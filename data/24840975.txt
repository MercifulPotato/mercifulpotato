Channels like:<p>- Reddit&#x2F;FB Groups&#x2F;any other online community. You can post once or twice in a a particular community to get feedback. If you want to &quot;scale&quot; your efforts (i.e. post every day), you&#x27;re likely to be deemed as spammy and get banned. This is both good and both. Bad because you cannot &quot;scale&quot; this acquisition channel (like with Facebook Ads, for example). Good because, for this very reason, these channels are open to new entrants. Compare this to something like:<p>- FB&#x2F;Google Ads. Yes, you can &quot;scale&quot; these channels, but so can your potential competitors. These people are usually well-funded startups that are willing to invest $500 to get a customer (although the customer will pay $50&#x2F;month), knowing that many of them will stay for 10+ months, when the company will eventually get a positive ROI. For competitive markets, this &quot;waiting&quot; factor spans to over a year, sometimes two. As an early-stage company, can you allow yourself to wait 15 months to get a positive ROI from your ad efforts? Probably not.<p>Of course, there are always exceptions (if you bid for a narrow&#x2F;high-intent keyword with not much competition, like &quot;screenshot API&quot; - this comes from a real founder interview [2]), but in general aim for acquisition channels that &quot;don&#x27;t scale&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;building-a-hobby-project-that-pays-for-itself-c43f9efdc8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;building-a-hobby-proj...</a>')
