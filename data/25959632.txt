Item(by='mmmrtl', descendants=None, kids=[25960211], score=None, time=1611940219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959369, text='Do you realize the irony in providing a list of FDA recalls while bemoaning their lack of rigor? Lots of these &quot;drugs&quot; were unapproved dietary supplements that the FDA found to actually contain drugs, or drugs that failed QC while on the market, not the pristine batches and data that would have gotten the drug approved in the first place.<p>To me, it&#x27;s similar to having more trust for media outlets that post corrections rather than pretending that nothing ever goes wrong. It&#x27;s a point in their favor that a stamp of approval can be rescinded.<p>You might have an argument that the companies need to be taken out of the drug approval process entirely, due to issues of hiding data to avoid giving the FDA a hint of anything wrong (or making them &quot;confused&quot; as you say), or maybe we need much stricter rules on data withholding. I&#x27;m with you there.')
