Item(by='Jochim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610465824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739217, text='&gt; When a group becomes sufficiently disenfranchised the most radical members transition from trying to make peaceful change to calling for revolution.<p>I&#x27;d agree that there is a sizeable proportion of the population that feels left behind. However, a large portion of the people present on Jan 6 were not the disenfranchised. There were a worrying number of CEOs, Active Military, Doctors, and Lawyers present.<p>&gt; Perhaps we should try and lift this group up instead of \ngrinding them down and using them as a scape goat for problems primarily related to wealth inequality.<p>This is overwhelmingly what people like Bernie Sanders and AOC are trying to do. The rhetoric of both is based around trying to help working people by introducing  social safety nets with the express purpose of giving people like them some room to breath financially. Have you seen how those policies have been received? Instead they elected an authoritarian millionaire who stoked division and xenophobia while cutting taxes for everyone but them.<p>They&#x27;ve been convinced that the reason they&#x27;re struggling is the fault of illegal immigrants, the Chinese, feminism, and leftists. Propaganda that has carried over from the Cold War leads them to reject any policy that might actually help them as &quot;communism&quot;. As a block they vote overwhelmingly for policies that only serve to enrich their bosses and the people producing the propaganda. They&#x27;ll rant for hours about how awful Obamacare was going to be, but then happily tell you about how much they love the &quot;ACA&quot; that they&#x27;re currently making use of.<p>We&#x27;ve reached a point where they&#x27;re behaving more like a spouse who won&#x27;t leave their abusive husband. The best thing is remove the source of that abuse for long enough that they might come to some degree of sense.')
