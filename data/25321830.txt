They&#x27;re having orgies and frying their brains on LSD!!!&quot;, combined with LSD&#x27;s association with the anti-war movement and the counterculture (including Leary very publicly telling kids to &quot;drop out&quot;, LSD being associated with &quot;free love&quot;, etc), which shocked and outraged the very conservative powers that be is absolutely what led to it being banned.<p>LSD use was basically seen as a threat to established social order.')
