I have a hard time seeing how any specific tax level could be considered fair (even after the argument of &quot;well people should just move to another state&quot;).<p>If the answer is yes, then I have a hard time imagining how any federal income tax system could achieve the goal of &quot;fairness&quot;.<p>And perhaps getting rid of the income tax altogether (perhpas replaced by Universal or partial BI + national sales tax as one idea) would result in a much faire &#x2F; progressive system.')
