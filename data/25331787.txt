Having a higher barrier to entry <i>does</i> lead to higher quality posts (and in one possible future, only people who have read the &#x27;how to get to front page of HN&#x27; guide can get to the front page of HN). On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen the problem of &#x27;should we invest this dollar into producing a better quality Widget or into telling people more effectively that our Widgets are the best?&#x27; kill entire organizations when the see-saw tilts too much to the latter.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m relating some things too broadly and it&#x27;s actually nothing more than &#x27;hey I post high quality content and do things to help it succeed&#x27;, but wondering if you&#x27;ve thought about this tradeoff at all &#x2F; if you&#x27;re worried about getting deeper into the metrics rabbit hole that you&#x27;ve discussed in some of your other posts.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goodhart%27s_law</a>')
