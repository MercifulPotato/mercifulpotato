(come to think of it..if I&#x27;m a department chair - maybe I should be reading the papers of my faculty instead just trusting SIG* to do a good job).<p>I think a reputation system (ala HN, but a little more transitive) would work just fine here. and then the reviewers get some measurable benefit for doing a good job.<p>and then each paper thread just stays open persistently and people can ask questions, and reviews can get posted, and talks and slides attached.<p>then you can do inline comments and revision control<p>and then people can collectively manage the topic taxonomy and publish things like field survey papers.')
