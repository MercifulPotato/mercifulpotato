In the case of discord, I can never get voice to work well over the browser. Maybe it has to do with all those fancy acceleration options not being exposed via a web browser, or maybe not and its something else.<p>I do stick with webapps when I&#x27;m a device other than my main desktop because I&#x27;m often too lazy to install something. The exception is mobile where mobile browsers and sites almost always piss me off to the point of installing a native app. I also will stick to the web app if the desktop app offers no advantage.')
