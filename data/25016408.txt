Item(by='takk309', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604769191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015759, text='Many of the comments here are clearly for the use of the term engineer in a generic form. As a registered PE (traffic engineering, specifically), I do think there needs to be a clear difference between capital E Engineer and lowercase e engineer. In situations where public safety etc. are concerned, Engineers accept the liability when things go wrong. By placing my seal on a document, I take personal and professional responsibly for the accuracy of the information contained within. It is much more than just proof of education.<p>In the lowercase sense of engineer, I think it is fine to say, &quot;I have engineered this solution.&quot; But to claim one is an Engineer because you engineered a solution misses much of the point of progressional licensure.<p>I, of course, come from the perspective of a PE not a coder. I have no doubt that influences my opinion on the matter. It doesn&#x27;t mean I think the word engineer has one and only one meaning, context is important.<p>To use the doctor analogy, to say one is a doctor is vague and requires context. To say on is a medical doctor disambiguates the statement. Same applies to engineer. The inclusion of context is needed to make sure you are not talking about one who operates trains versus one that does structural design.<p>TL:DR - Context matters, make it clear what sort of engineering you perform.')
