That said, there is still a need to store and represent value, and to be able to transfer it, divide it, etc.<p>If you look up the history of money, it actually shows that using something with tangible value (e.g. salt) is a bad idea for multiple reasons. This is why the U.S. dollar is not backed by oil, corn, salt, shares of Berkshire Hathaway, etc. This is what made gold historically a good money as well, as it historically had more use as a status symbol&#x2F;symbol of wealth than actual industrial uses (this may not hold for the future).')
