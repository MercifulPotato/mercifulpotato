There are millions of people in this country that grew up in a world without EMTs.  If you were hurt or sick you had to get yourself to the hospital or rely on the police getting you there.  Police obviously weren&#x27;t able to properly handle these situations from either a training or equipment perspective. This resulted in countless people dying unnecessarily. That was seen as an obvious failure and eventually a job was created to bring medical attention to the scene of an emergency and remove police from the handling of these medical issues.<p>We have already made this transition once.  Police are no more able to handle someone experiencing an emergency mental issue as they are able to handle someone having a heart attack.
