The result: mountains littered with puppies every mating season and then refuges overloaded.<p>Every few years, some fund pops up to pay vets to do free neutering and spaying: that really helps most of the problem as most will do it then; just wish the other owners could be fined if their dogs causes the stray dog issue to rise again (which costs money; there is dog catchers, the pound, refuges, effect on tourism etc).')
