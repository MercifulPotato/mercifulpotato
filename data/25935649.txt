Here in the EU, I hear there is a major push to introduce some meaningful legislation to establish requirement, definitely right direction.<p>Comparing Samsung with Apple is interesting, because Samsung is very competitive and will come to your door (so to speak) to sell its products, which I respect very deeply. In my country, Samsung official service is top, better than Apple probably. I&#x27;ve been able to go to the service unannounced, ask for a battery replacement, go for a coffee and come get my device back after an hour. For computers, Dell also has a very respectable name, to the point where people will prefer Dell solely because of this.
