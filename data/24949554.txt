I was particularly excited about the slides for architecture and design docs. I just wish I could sit in to listen on lectures (or have the discipline to read through the textbook :PP).<p>In my undergrad, I felt that my CS classes were divided into &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;systems&quot;. But, even the &quot;systems&quot; classes would feel removed from the modern tech industry and commercial software.<p>The topics that I see mentioned in the syllabus are familiar to me, but only because I surf Medium articles, and not because of my formal CS education. Yet, these topics are incredibly deep and complex. I would consider the people who work on them to be researchers in a hyper-specific domain.')
