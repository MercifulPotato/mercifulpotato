I feel all of the sentiments that you mentioned in your comment. Here are some tips for you that have really helped me:<p>- Turn off auto-complete on your desktop browser. The &quot;cmd+t &gt; news.y&quot; or &quot;cmt+t &gt; r&quot; is a real catalyst for mindless browsing sites like Hacker News and Reddit.<p>- Uninstall apps like Reddit, Facebook, or Instagram on your phone. If you really want to access them, then use the web experience through the mobile browser. It&#x27;s enough to get the job done, but not good enough to be addicting (no auto-play videos, notifications, and the UX is slightly degraded).<p>- Turn off all non-pertinent notifications on your phone, especially things like news, email, and social media. The only daily apps which have I notifications enabled for me are Messages, a sports app, and daily habit reminders.<p>- If I feel like I&#x27;m using a social media site too much on a laptop, then I change the hosts file to re-direct to localhost. Bam, access revoked for a while. I&#x27;ve found that this works better than browser extensions. With extensions, I used to just right-click &gt; disable, then go to my time-wasting website. With the hosts file method, I need to figure out the path to the hosts file (I never remember it), open it in a text editor, type in my changes, then save the file with sudo permissions. I thought about scripting it, but I think the manual process is more effective at preventing me from constantly enabling&#x2F;disabling access. There&#x27;s more intention behind the action.<p>- Pay for a newspaper subscription. It&#x27;s so refreshing to consume quality journalism vs trendy click-bait articles. My recommendation would be read one national outlet (NY Times, Wall Street Journal) and your local newspaper. Instead of browsing Reddit&#x2F;HN in the morning, open up your newspaper app.')
