That said, Fibonacci is credited with spreading the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to Western Europe, showing that at least in the area of mathematics they were in a relative darkness.<p>I hadn&#x27;t heard of Gouguenheim but his ideas seem rather absurd. He seems to believe the Islamic golden age never occurred, and I can&#x27;t find how he tries to explain where something like Liber Abbaci came from. His objectivity seems far more suspect than this piece.')
