React+ReactDom only has 3 dependencies, so I don&#x27;t understand how that follows. How is <i>React</i> bloated because `create-react-app` gives you functionality to setup a PWA? If I don&#x27;t care about PWAs, I don&#x27;t need to use it, but `create-react-app` downloads it anyways.<p>The majority of the dependencies pulled in on create-react-app is from the `react-scripts` which helps entirely with scaffolding. Saying that React is bloated because the scaffolding generation tool downloads too much code sounds crazy.')
