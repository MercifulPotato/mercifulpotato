I also am a horrible designer, but I&#x27;ve built enough UIs to be able to at least add to the conversation.<p>I actually consider it part of a front-end developer&#x27;s job to push back against designs that don&#x27;t work. There are anti-patterns for users and many of them make life harder for developers (modals launching modals, for example). Some examples from my own life is a designer adding so many columns to a table that it would be too crunched on laptop screens, magic interactions that break a11y, or flows that just don&#x27;t make sense for seasoned web users. Now that&#x27;s not to say I can design a great UI on my own, but plenty of good editors can&#x27;t write a hit novel either.<p>Most of the time designers are happy for the feedback, because it&#x27;s cheaper to fix things early on and ultimately makes them look better.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a designer to spot the good and the bad, and I&#x27;d be willing to guess you&#x27;ve osmosed more than you give yourself credit for.')
