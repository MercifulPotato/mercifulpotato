There is a little exam even. It&#x27;s normal children start cycling unattended from that point.\nHowever, children have been cycling attended since... when they are big enough to operate a bike that goes fast enough to do so (so say, from 5 years old.) Ergo they probably already know, in practice, how to operate safely in traffic.<p>When my parents caught me cycling home unattended during the longer school lunch breaks, and I confessed I&#x27;ve been doing that for most of the school year, they were like: &quot;oh. Guess you know how to do that safely then. Carry on.&quot; I think I was 9 at that point. (It was a very safe route, which is common for Dutch home-primary school situations.)')
