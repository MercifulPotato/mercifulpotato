[1] The effect was that only 1 (2%) of 50 patients needed ICU admission whereas the control had 50% ICU admission. In contrast the Remdesivir effect found was just fewer days of recovery. So we can contrast the vitamin D result with how much effort is going on  to determine whether there are marginal improvements from anti-virals.<p>The trial is small (100 participants), so we should be doing a larger one now, but I don&#x27;t think there is a down-side to adopting this as a standard of care.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0960076020302764?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S096007602...</a>')
