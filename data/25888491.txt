Shouldn&#x27;t firms just sack everyone, then hire contractors?<p>I often hear advocates of remote work talk about &quot;presenteeism&quot; and how managers need to just focus more on outputs. This is fine, but if they can do that why not sack everyone and just hire contractors and pay for the outputs?<p>The reality is, unless employees are micro-managed to the point of being basically robots, they&#x27;re given a certain amount of discretion. If they are at work, and can&#x27;t slack off, then they will use this discretion to create value for the company in ways that the managers don&#x27;t always have time to exactly specify.<p>The slack and discretion in a &quot;presentism&quot; run office means that employees can make changes without having to always go up the chain. For a concrete example, let&#x27;s say you think there&#x27;s a major show-stopper of a bug. Your manager disagrees, and says not to worry about it, and will not budge. You have a few hours free in the week because you finished your work a bit faster than expected. You might look into the suspected bug (and end up proving it&#x27;s an issue, or proving to yourself that your boss was right) if you&#x27;re otherwise stuck in an office reading email to look busy, but not if you&#x27;re at home and you can turn on the TV or walk the dog.')
