Operators also have to be licensed which means all of their personal details are on file with the licensing government. If they&#x27;re caught breaking the bounds of their license it will be revoked and they can personally face fines and even criminal charges.<p>Even if you got a bunch of hams to illegally carry general purpose Internet content the ham bands aren&#x27;t exactly brimming with available bandwidth. Most packet radio below 30MHz (where you&#x27;ll get your long range transmissions) is commonly 300bps. That&#x27;s <i>bits</i> per second. Instead of risking hams go buy some cantennas and set up a WiFi mesh.')
