One could write very thick books on this individuals life (and it looks like they already have in some context).<p>Using the descriptor of &#x27;Trump Backer&#x27; is deliberately prioritizing one single personal choice the subject individual made in a time representing roughly &lt;7% of his total existence.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s editorial to say it&#x27;s politically motivated at all. If you simply remove the specific subject matter of the descriptor used and instead, rely on its representation of the overall individual, its statistical irrelevance to the whole easily identifies its gross misuse as title descriptor of that individual.<p>I would go as far to say, that not only is it not editorial to arrive to such a conclusion, I think it hard-pressed to not describe it as a factual occurrence.')
