I definitely think that part is real. I personally always liked quake and doom, disliked Counter Strike and Call of Duty, so this might be my bias, but it seems easier to use the latter to soften people&#x27;s perspective on war and conquest while the former are just so cartoonish levels of violence that you can easily distinguish it from reality. That might just be my perspective.')
