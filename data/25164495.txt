I personally have nothing against the English, for example. If you hate us so much, that&#x27;s on you.<p>Go watch, say, The Last Kingdom on Netflix. It wasn&#x27;t made by Ubisoft or French Canadians. And yet the depiction of English vs Danes is pretty much the same: the cowardly christians with their silly religion. That&#x27;s the POV of one character. It is flawed as well. But it has nothing to do with French Canadians, come on.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m just saying that given their cultural baggage (as a group) this is likely to a blind spot where they&#x27;re less likely to notice.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but you seem to be showing your own &quot;cultural baggage&quot; here and projecting it onto others.')
