I would suggest you&#x27;re estimating at least an order of magnitude too high for the car count, since they can more or less operate 24x7.<p>That would bring the capex down below $100 billion - less than Google&#x27;s cash on hand. And you&#x27;d be starting with the most lucrative cities while staggering it out, and have a very good idea of your payback by the time you&#x27;ve spent serious cash.<p>Technology and regulatory risks are high for Waymo, but capex is very manageable.')
