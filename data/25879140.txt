My naive youthful self enjoyed using Objective C&#x27;s Categories and Associated Objects to share some UI code across 2 UIViewControllers.<p>Did I get it to work? yep. Did it make senior programmers a bit nervous? yep. I wrote a blog post about it.<p>Later, I got to use Java for some Android apps, and after that we got Swift. XCode seemed to get slower with swift and Java(android) was more a limited language. No complaints, but it was just not as fun and easy as using Objective C. (in my naive beginner opinion)<p>Things were a lot simpler back then. I&#x27;ll never forget my joy learning Objective C at my first ever programming job. RIP Brad Cox')
