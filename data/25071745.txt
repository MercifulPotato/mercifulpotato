It&#x27;s really useful if you have system dependencies or want to control the build process.\n* Python&#x2F;Node functions, similar to lambda in the principle, but in this case we also take of all the build process, you simply connect your GitHub repository, we deploy and scale for you.<p>Don&#x27;t hesitate to ask if you have other questions.')
