It&#x27;s not your fault that doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s.</i><p>If we&#x27;re talking for CI of builds, sure. But in that case, one wouldn&#x27;t be much affected (the C in CI means continuous, so you wont just rent for a few minutes).<p>Otherwise, as a user, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with less developers being able to build XCode projects and submit apps without even owning a Mac to test them on. Looks like it would bring a delluge of poorly ported apps based on cross-platform APIs and only tested in non-Mac platforms (if that).')
