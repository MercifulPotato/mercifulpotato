It was also the first smartphone sold by Vodafone Spain, who had zero experience with phones where you could actually use internet, so they offered uncapped contracts. To make things worse:\n- Android was just a few months old\n- Apps were not optimized for using as little data as possible\n- I was REALLY into RSS, with hundred of feeds, and RSS apps where continually polling for changes.<p>The rest is history: my first month with a smartphone - May 2009 - I consumed 10GB of data and I received a few calls from the Vodafone people')
