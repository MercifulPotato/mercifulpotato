Hell, everyone was doing it. ETrade&#x27;s online portal was hot shit. You could wake up 20 minutes before the market opened, get an order in on whatever IPO was happening that day (Webvan? The Globe.com?), if you lucked out and got a block early in the open you watched it tick up +10 and were out and on your way to work with another $1,000-$2,000 in your account.<p>Then it all fell apart in 2000.
