In particular, it incurs the same or lower cost factor on the attacker than the user.<p>More recent designs such as scrypt and Argon2 force high memory usage as well as computation time, incurring little cost on the users but making ASIC and GPU attacks significantly less cost-effective.<p>Of course, any of these will still give better protection than plain cryptographic hashes.')
