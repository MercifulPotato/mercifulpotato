Speedsubs are no longer a concern for fansubbing these days.<p>Meanwhile, the remaining fansubbers are competing by maximizing quality, with features such as singable song translations and full sign typesetting. But you end up with up to weeklong delays between airing and fansub release.<p>As far as purely translation quality goes, pro translations are much better than they used to be, but speaking as an amateur translator myself I always think it&#x27;s good for the viewer to have alternative interpretations for more difficult-to-translate passages.')
