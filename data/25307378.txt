We intentionally designed the old interface to be information dense.  When we made it slightly less dense, there was such a strong pushback that we had to add an option to go back to the more dense mode.<p>But there are a lot of users who don&#x27;t care.  And maintaining two interfaces is double the work of maintaining one, because you have test everything twice.  And it&#x27;s actually geometric, not double, because you have to test every new option combination in both interfaces.')
