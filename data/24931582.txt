In my last job at a bank I regularly interviewed recent CS graduates and candidates able to demonstrate a genuine passion for the subject were few and far between.<p>You are comparing college students from the 1980s to those from 20xx. I&#x27;ll tell you what is on the mind of the new students: <i>how the heck do I pay my student loans and save up for a $2M starter home</i><p>It is easy to have passion when you barely have student loans and can buy a home with a year or two of earnings.<p>In case you point out that salaries were also lower back then, i&#x27;ll give you that, but the <i>ratio</i> of salary&#x2F;debt and salary&#x2F;homeprice was far more reasonable back then than now.<p>EDIT: This is a US-centric view, not necessarily a global view. Further, it is a SF&#x2F;SV&#x2F;NYC centric view since that is where a majority of tech+banking jobs are.')
