This is apparently a fine achievement of quantum optics that will hopefully be applicable to quantum computing. But it is being directly billed as a quantum computer itself, which is a stretch.<p>A classical computer is more than an experiment. The &quot;just&quot; part of that statement is what matters. Computer implies some degree of generalizability in computing things. If it can only compute one thing, it&#x27;s at the trivial extreme and would be more logically described in terms of that single things it does. For example a beamsplitter that divides power in half. We call it a beamsplitter, not a classical computer that calculates 1&#x2F;2 input power.')
