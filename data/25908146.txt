Item(by='names_are_hard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611605641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907065, text='My understanding of Microsoft policy is that it&#x27;s easier to buy macbooks for your developers than it is to buy Slack. Which makes sense, because they&#x27;re currently doing head to head with slack for market share right now, while a few macbooks doesn&#x27;t threaten their credibility when selling windows.<p>My guess is that github was using slack before they were bought and inertia is a thing. I&#x27;m sure there are people within the parent company that would like to see them transition, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ton of resistance, especially &quot;on the ground&quot; at github. Buyouts are a delicate thing, they don&#x27;t want to ruin github by trying to force it to change too quickly.')
