Say what you want even if its dumb and hurts you.<p>With capital markets...there absolutely is a goal, and it’s not speculation&#x2F;gambling. The goal is to have a place where corporations can raise capital and investors can hold them accountable for how they return value to them...and then a billion rules to make that as fair and functional (not equitable) as possible.<p>I don’t get the argument that what these guys are doing is somehow noble, or to be encouraged. Completely unregulated non-purposeful markets are not helpful....we did that 100 years ago...thats why we have all the rules we do to make markets function to the end.')
