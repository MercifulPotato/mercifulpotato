In the past decade, Binary Ninja and Ghidra came out to also compete in this space, and the cutter project came out to give a sorely-needed GUI for radare2. Of the new tools, the only one I&#x27;ve tried is Ghidra.<p>Personally, were cost not an issue, I would just stick with IDA. However, IDA Pro is obscenely expensive, with the cheapest version &quot;only&quot; $365&#x2F;yr and a full version costing into the tens of thousands, and it&#x27;s not clear to me that the cost is worth it. I&#x27;ve had a lot of paper-cuts with Ghidra, but it still feels far better to me than radare2.')
