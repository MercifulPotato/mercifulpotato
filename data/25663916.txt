And since reasoning about the behavior of entire systems (emergent or otherwise) is an essential element of being a programmer. It true that over simplification of the elements and generalization can actually result in a much more complex and difficult to reason about system, just as you point out about the game of life.<p>I guess my point is that sometimes the systems model essential complexity, and by trying to over simplify and generalize elements of that system, you may make the system as a whole more difficult to understand and reason about.')
