I HATE TIPPING.  Just put the freakin price all-in on the mneu.  I don&#x27;t want to play this stupid game where the server tries to act nice to get a tip.  Just do your job. I do my job all day long without any tips. I&#x27;m nice to people and do my best. The service industry is no different- just do your job.  Tip jar for handing me a donut or pouring me coffee? Sorry what?<p>So unfortunately for me- grocery delivery is the same.  Just show me what it costs and I will make the decision to pay or not.  Costco upped their prices online to say they are able to pay their people a living wage? Great! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paying.  Walmart doesn&#x27;t change them online? Ok I&#x27;m not sure how works on their side, but I&#x27;m paying what they say it costs.<p>It&#x27;s not MY JOB as the consumer to make up the shortfall that companies are not giving.  You know who&#x27;s job it is? First, the government- if we provided basic things like healthcare for all, required paid time off, and then you mix in a reasonable minimum wage- most of the issues are solved right there. Then it&#x27;s up to the company to take care of their employees and make sure they are being paid a reasonable amount.<p>I&#x27;m sick of being told I have to make up the shortfall with tips for everything.<p>&#x2F;rant off')
