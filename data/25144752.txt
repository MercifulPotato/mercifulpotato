We&#x27;ve lost the freedom of the distributed internet by exchanging it for the convenience of centralized platforms like google and facebook. Even hacker news, and reddit are centralized dictatorships with a bit of democratic groupthink tossed in (effectively minimizing provocative content).<p>I think we&#x27;ll start to see stuff built on IPFS and libp2p that will break that trend at least for some of us.
