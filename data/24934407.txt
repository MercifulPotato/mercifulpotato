It can also be exacerbated by withdrawal from stimulants like caffeine, which tend to coincide with meals.<p>FWIW when I&#x27;m eating a very low carb diet with no stimulants, fasting for a day is a complete noop, pleasant even.<p>But I also feel nauseous consuming caffeine when fasting.  I&#x27;ve come to suspect a major reason people eat breakfast is so their morning caffeine dose doesn&#x27;t make them sick, though they may not acknowledge it.')
