I agree that security needs to be rethought, but putting more moats &#x2F; popups in the way is not going to work. We already learned that from the past- it doesn&#x27;t matter how many warnings you put in a web browser, those that are uneducated are still going to mash the install button to get those Comet Cursors or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m curious how this will change when the entire populate has more tech knowledge in general. A few decades, and everybody on the planet will have grown up with computers, and a couple more past that and everyone will have <i>always</i> had a smart phone.<p>I&#x27;m not super hopeful though. Security and Privacy are always a tradeoff with convenience. And if I&#x27;ve learned anything during my revolutions on this planet, it&#x27;s that we humans <i>really</i> love convenience. I&#x27;d say this will keep getting worse until we get a massive data breach... but we&#x27;ve already had a few of those and aside from it being on the news and maybe a congressional hearing, nothing changes. So I think it will keep getting worse until we find out what the market will bear. And I&#x27;m morbidly curious what that will be, even as I scream into the wind attempting to prevent it.')
