Real risk analysis takes rigourous sampling and modeling, so it&#x27;s great to see people exploring ways of doing this in the software industry.<p>As a person who lately works more on the infrastructure and operations side of delivering software, it&#x27;s been very natural to frame everything in terms of risk mitigation. Every time I apply this re-framing to a problem, I find that I have a new and interesting angle that yields high leverage. Google is doing amazing things in this space with their CRE program - stack ranking reliability risks to effectively automate decision making when you&#x27;re below an error budget. Cool stuff! Even with back of the napkin math, this stuff works wonders.<p>This line of thinking makes me wonder: what other lines of business could risk-first thinking help where it currently doesn&#x27;t? Also, what can we learn from other lines of business that already use risk analysis to prioritize decisions in uncertain domains?')
