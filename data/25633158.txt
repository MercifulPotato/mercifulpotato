The factors around post NYE releases:<p>- high risk changes that weren&#x27;t released pre-holidays get released. Depending on the company, this could mean a 1-week to 1-month delay between implementation and release. The greater that interval, the higher the divergence world of production and the world of the new feature<p>- lots of new hires (new year = new hiring budget). New hires are missing some tribal knowledge about the system and make a production-breaking release.<p>I tried to think of other reasons, but these two overwhelmingly stand out as the two biggest reasons. Would love to hear from others.')
