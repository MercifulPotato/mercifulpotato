A cloud has many more vectors for attack, and even the largest clouds have blind spots. For example, check out AWS&#x27;s (lack of) response to a vuln report that I filed with their security team: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-codedeploy-agent&#x2F;issues&#x2F;30" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws&#x2F;aws-codedeploy-agent&#x2F;issues&#x2F;30</a><p>Did you know that AWS does NOT pay for security vulns and does not operate a bug bounty program? It seems a common myth that AWS is more secure than any particular company. Your security inside or outside of a cloud has to do more with your internal security posture than what AWS brings to the table (and leaves behind).<p>The public cloud is not magic security pixie dust. It&#x27;s a virtualization platform with extra services attached. You are still 100% responsible for securing your servers (meaning everything down to the network routing layer, and some beyond that, too). Obligatory reference to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model[0]<p>This is not a bad thing, but it&#x27;s still a thing. Anyone who migrates to the cloud and magically expects their security posture to improve one iota is simply wrong unless they take active steps to integrate as tightly as they can into that cloud&#x27;s security tools. As someone who has done a ton of AWS security audits, I can tell you that people take multiple approaches on that: either they don&#x27;t integrate into it fully, or they submit to vendor lock-in.<p>This is perhaps too deep of an argument, since clearly intelligent and skilled people can reasonably disagree. FWIW, lapsed AWS SA, recovering Fortune 50 cloud security architect, and please don&#x27;t take my argument about the cloud to indicate that I&#x27;m anti-cloud: my security-focused SSH key management company, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userify.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;userify.com</a>, is <i>strongly</i> cloud focused: AWS Advanced Tier, GCP Partner, SOC-2, PCI, HIPAA. I&#x27;m very much pro-cloud, while recognizing that it enlarges your threat model but brings other security advantages.<p>Where you&#x27;re hosted doesn&#x27;t matter as much as whether you&#x27;re paranoid and clueful, and perhaps have former blackhats on your team ;) So my point is simply that the cloud question isn&#x27;t that relevant, and the thrust of the other questions should be used to determine security competency instead of where they&#x27;re running their operations.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;compliance&#x2F;shared-responsibility-model&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;compliance&#x2F;shared-responsibility-mode...</a>')
