For example the other day, it was Logstash vs. Fluentd.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed compared to even 5 years ago, is that almost all the Google searches on a topic like that are content marketing. Which isn&#x27;t wholly bad, at least I&#x27;m glad that marketing dollars are being spent on somewhat informative blog content instead of wild parties at trade shows.<p>But still, I don&#x27;t really find these content marketing pages terribly informative. They all tend to come off as the same type of bland, inoffensive corporate-y just-the-facts ma&#x27;am. &quot;Logstash supports [X]. Fluentd supports [Y]. They&#x27;re both good in separate ways. By the way our SaaS product [Q] integrates with both.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what I want. I want to know where the bodies are buried. I want to see flame wars, pig-headed opinions, comments saying &quot;lolz, doing that is retarded&quot;. Content marketing, in addition to pushing its own agenda, is never going to give you that kind of opinion, because offending people is bad for business. But I want to see honest takes, even if flawed and opinionated.<p>So all too often with these types of searches, I&#x27;ll just reflexively append &quot;Fluentd vs. Logstash Reddit&quot; or &quot;Fluentd vs. Logstash HackerNews&quot; because at least I feel like you&#x27;re likely to get an honest discussion.')
