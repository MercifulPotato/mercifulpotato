At first I thought my headphones were broken.<p>I listen with WH-1000XM3 and ATH-M50x and the Apple Music encoding sounded really, really bad to my ear. It’s not the bitrate, which should be fine, it’s the sound of the audio which is totally different from other services.<p>I suspect they have optimized for low quality devices like AirPods and earbuds; I expect the oversharpening might be rated as better on those devices.<p>FWIW Tidal and Spotify sound the same at their standard premium tier. I can’t hear the difference between Spotify and Tidal HiFi on my Bluetooth (AptX) Sony headphones, but I can hear the difference with my wired ATH-M50x.<p>I recommend listening to the services side by side, preferably with desktop client to compare. In Spotify you may want to adjust the streaming quality to high from auto, as I always do, to be sure it’s a fair comparison. Sadly Apple doesn’t seem to give a choice in quality, but based on reading my understanding is they always default to high - I could be wrong.')
