We were able to make ASICs cheaper than HP could make them for themselves. So we had the (cough) less impressive hardware (scan sensors, laser engines, motors) to work with. So image quality was so-so at even the best of times.<p>We were able to bury a lot of bodies under the sensor noise and engine output. But we made a super reliable, super cheap laser printer -- VW Bug of Laser Printers, if I may brag a bit. Twelve years later, the M1005 is still selling like hotcakes I hear.')
