No one is saying that recording a performance isn’t subject to copyright law. They are saying that youtube-dl is the camera, or the camera manufacturer. Canon or Nikon are not subject to copyright law because I use one of their cameras to illegally record a concert, I am. I am the one that did the illegal act and the fact that manufacturers make cameras, that gave me the ability to do it, is not the problem. The argument is youtube-dl shouldn’t be subject either, that it is the individuals using it to download copyrighted material that are breaking the law and a program having the ability to be used illegally is not the fault or responsibility of the program.')
