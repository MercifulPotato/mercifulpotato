Economists just don&#x27;t take seriously much of anything that Marx has to say on the actual field of economics, on the same level as that of flat earthers.<p>His only insights are maybe into politics.  But not the actual field of economics.<p>When economists are saying that he &quot;flunked&quot; economists, as quoted from the article, it is intended to imply that basically nothing that Marx had to say, on actual economics matters at all, and is so ridiculous that we should compare it to conspiracy theories, or flat earthers, or something else that is equally nonsensical.')
