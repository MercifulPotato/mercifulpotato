All of the VC shares were of course non-dilutable.<p>I accepted the offer (I didn&#x27;t have faith the company would IPO and felt the most likely exit - an acquihire - would come when I was far more diluted at far lower value) and after a very poorly communicated and drawn out process (&quot;we&#x27;ll pay you next week&quot; for 4 months) I finally received payment valuing the company at around $35M at a diluted share holding of 1.3% netting roughly $500k gross.<p>Throughout I was assured that I would only have to pay a capital gains tax (I&#x27;m in the UK) and additionally received faulty independent advice that confirmed that this was the case, however 1 day before payment I was told that I&#x27;d have to pay roughly half at income tax and the other half via capital gains (the latter tops out at 20% in the UK so this was a huge difference and cost me $55k+).<p>This was done by the startup withholding the income tax and paying it directly on my behalf via the UK&#x27;s Pay As You Earn (PAYE) scheme while leaving me to pay the capital gains later.<p>In the end I had to pay roughly 1&#x2F;3 of the payout in tax netting me ~$350k.<p>I was paid out 7 years after I joined the company.<p>Overall I feel the dilution _was_ offset by the increase in value of the company, and the % I received was fair as to my contributions, but the tax arrangements were handled very poorly indeed and gave no room for a more efficient arrangement.<p>Given that I felt the shares were no more than lottery ticket toilet paper + suspected I&#x27;d get cheated in some way even if there was a payout the outcome was really really good and unexpected, and have in fact changed my life (I can now buy a house after years of misspending!)<p>But I definitely don&#x27;t think the economics work out too well. I was paid probably half of the proper wage throughout and put up with a lot before vesting, having stayed there for 5 yrs that works out to $100k extra a year on top of the smaller salary (started at $50k roughly) - a FAANG or such would probably have paid the same by the end.<p>However at the time I joined I worked in a very unmarketable (and soul destroying) role and the position helped me change my career direction, gave me a lot of good experience and ended up paying out anyway.<p>I&#x27;d not work at a startup again (not only for salary vs. equity concerns) but I don&#x27;t regret having worked at one.<p>Something of a stream of consciousness but perhaps it provides some kind of raw data to add to the pile!')
