The reason for this is to curtail China&#x27;s military acquiring dual-use satellite technology, gaining capital to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles and reducing risk of nefarious actions on the satellites themselves.<p>China say they&#x27;ll master first stage re-usability of a medium-lift launch vehicle by 2025. For those of use who want to see an actual space race, let&#x27;s hope this is a case of &quot;under promise and over-deliver&quot;, because that&#x27;s a Blue Origin level schedule.')
