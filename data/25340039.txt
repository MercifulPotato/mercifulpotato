Reading the article (and being aware of the ongoing story) there&#x27;s no indication (to me) that there would be any hostility facing the officers.<p>Invading someone&#x27;s home isn&#x27;t an every day task. Most people don&#x27;t like that. And since this in the US where potentially anyone could easily have a gun, some will take the opportunity remove the invaders of their house by force, especially if they aren&#x27;t aware or sure it&#x27;s the police. [0]<p>But anyway, I&#x27;m not sure why police should even be the focus of this thread. They&#x27;re just doing their job. The bigger issue I see here is the police have been called to take care of an issue that shouldn&#x27;t require police.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_doctrine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Castle_doctrine</a><p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll just add since I&#x27;m getting downvoted to oblivion for saying something that could slightly be viewed as remotely favorable to police: It&#x27;s sad to see this topic hijacked from the focus on Rebekah Jones, where there&#x27;s an actual interesting story here about her work being potentially surpressed, to some unrelated topic about how much force police should use. Something that has been talked about ad nauseam across HN already, and yet this (at this time) is the most upvoted comment.')
