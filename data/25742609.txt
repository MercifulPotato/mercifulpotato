Not really sure I agree about &quot;winner takes all&quot; - Facebook bought IG, Whatsapp and dozens of other companies. That&#x27;s not winning based off product superiority - it&#x27;s winning based off access to financing. There are plenty of ways to stop companies from ever reaching that size - Limit M&amp;A, limit the amount of hot money used to finance growth ahead of revenue, and impose stricter regulations on larger companies - I&#x27;m talking investigating violations and prosecuting civilly and criminally - no compliance BS.<p>2. I&#x27;m not going to explain the Safe Harbor provision to you. Look it up. We already have externalities - removing algorithmic feeds would take (e.g. Facebook) back to where it was in the late 2000s, where users were in control of the content they saw. The only negative externality is that Facebook and other companies would make less money of targeted ads.<p>3. You&#x27;ve never heard of a transaction tax? I find that hard to believe. Why don&#x27;t you think about other times you&#x27;ve paid tax on a transaction, and then maybe you can come up with answers to the rest of your questions.')
