What a machine to have, for teenagers into computing, at home in the early nineties!<p>The shock, the world of difference between a beige box running MS-DOS &#x2F; Windows 3.1 and stuff like (Turbo) Pascal compared to that amazing SGI workstation...<p>I saw the future, I saw &quot;my&quot; future when I got to play on that SGI Indy.  And then when I discovered Linux (back when it was shipping on a CD attacked to a book&#x2F;magazine) I got to transform my MS&#x2F;Windows beige PC into a (modest) Un*x station and never looked back (I&#x27;m using Linux daily since that day).<p>I don&#x27;t have bad memories of programming in Pascal but both Pascal and Delphi felt, to me, like deeply attached to the MS ecosystem and a bit toy&#x27;ish (making it easy to do easy things, but very hard to make anything a bit advanced).<p>As soon as I found a way out of the MS world I was out and so I was done with Pascal&#x2F;Delphi.')
