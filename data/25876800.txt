Item(by='newfriend', descendants=None, kids=[25879443], score=None, time=1611352694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25867618, text='&gt; What&#x27;s special about the state or state government specifically that it should get its representation separate from the people it governs?<p>The United States is a union of states. The people have representation at the federal level, and the state level.<p>&gt; Are the state or state government&#x27;s aims and objectives different from the people of the state? If so, why, and what legitimacy does it have? If not, why have it represented?<p>No. The people of the state are the state, not the government of the state. Again, the state gets representation because we are a union of states. And local governments get representation at the state level. There are many concerns of a people, and we have people representing those concerns at different levels of government, from local to state to federal. Otherwise we could just have a single person represent everyone.<p>&gt; Why does the state get represented twice (Senate and EC) but the people only get represented once? Isn&#x27;t that an imbalance?<p>The People are represented twice as said before (House and EC). The EC is the House + Senate. So no, it&#x27;s not an imbalance.<p>&gt; Because it favors your side. You&#x27;d be singing a different tune if it was the other way around.<p>I don&#x27;t have a side. I vote for policies that I agree with, which has changed over time. Party support of certain issues has changed over time as well.<p>I am pretty tired, however, of people crying about foundational aspects of my country because they lost an election. I think the increasing concentration of power in the federal government is a bad idea.')
