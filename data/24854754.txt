Once I replaced it with an ANTLR grammar and a comparatively-trivial bit of glue, my thrift parser became not only easier to refactor but more reliable.<p>My hand-written recursive descent parser was a perennial source of bugs, where ANTLR has yielded almost none.  Some fiddly things I was doing with comments became much easier, if not effortless.<p>I highly, HIGHLY recommend at least starting with a compiler-generator like ANTLR.  The &quot;activation cost&quot; of your project will be much lower, and you may find that you never actually _need_ the level of control you give up.')
