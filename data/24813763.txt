Known problem, that has no solution. Then if you want to fix it:<p>- custom config<p>- custom drivers<p>- lot of hacky solutions<p>- compile wine &#x2F; proton on a &quot;fix&quot; branch<p>If you want to play just use the native platform the game was built for, Linux will never be like Windows until the games are natively supported.')
