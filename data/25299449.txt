I took the teaching job because I was bored with &quot;software assembly&quot; (nice name). It was fun to get drop shipped into a random location in the world and go toe-to-toe with their best and brightest.<p>I&#x27;ve since moved on to embedded development, and it is as you say. I&#x27;ve recently got to work on tensorflow light, pytorch, rust, object detection, compute shaders... it&#x27;s amazing.<p>The big company stuff can be a bit boring, but I can also say there&#x27;s some pride even in the &quot;glue&quot;. The team I was most proud of implemented Heroku-flow in their proprietary cloud using some kick-ass devops skills, figured out some innovative ways to solidly test their creation, and also got to write a genuinely comp-sci database diff tool to migrate data nightly from the original thing into their re-write.<p>If you can build the trust, there&#x27;s most often a good route to turn a terrible, untrusting, corporate monstrosity into something decent. But that being said, it takes a ton of passion and also sometimes it will just be dull and a hobby project is probably a necessary relief valve.')
