I&#x27;m not sure what the right amount is, maybe $1.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s also a kind of tragedy of the commons. If you&#x27;re the first marketer to fake the signal it will work very well. Once everyone does it, congratulations, you&#x27;ve ruined it for everyone, including people who are not faking it.')
