Note with this example, under &#x27;Contributing - Tasks I could work on&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t mention UX, and the only way to become a committer is to &quot;show us some of your patches, or solve some issues&quot; - none of which involve UX.<p>This affects not only UX. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has spare infrastructure and ops skills that I&#x27;d love to contribute to open-source projects - hosting CI&#x2F;CD, repo mirrors, staging environment, website, chat server, SMTP gateway, for example. It&#x27;d be nice to play a small part in decentralization, for one thing.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m far from the only one. I&#x27;m also sure there are open  source projects who would benefit from it.<p>There&#x27;s no process for us to match and it seems just culturally abnormal. I&#x27;d love to hear ideas.')
