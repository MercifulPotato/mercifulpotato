They remind me that there are places in the world where technology is moving forward. Where we live in Tennessee I have to run 2 internet connections to be able to have a service when I need it. 3gb DSL and a 5gb satellite connection. The sat connection has the additional bonus of being capped at 150Gb per month. All these new streaming services may as well not even exist for those of us in rural areas.')
