Since we got it, we forgot where our regular vacuum cleaner is.\nEspecially since dust bothers me - I set it up to clean while I&#x27;m not in (for example, every day at 10am, when we&#x27;re at work), and voila! Or when you&#x27;re not at home for a couple of days, you just trigger it an hour before getting home, and you get a clean apartment when you&#x27;re home.<p>So, you get more time because you don&#x27;t have to vacuum yourself and it does it while you&#x27;re not in, so the whole process is seamless.')
