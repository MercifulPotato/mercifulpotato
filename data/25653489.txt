But after that it&#x27;s about 30 installs a day (only because of cross promo in my other apps).\nBut how one person can do design, development, copywriting AND marketing? Is it even possible? My colleagues (also mobile devs) are telling me that it&#x27;s not the case.\nI find self promotion the hardest part. Any suggestions on how indie app developer could let the world know about an app?')
