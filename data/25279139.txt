Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606931756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278851, text='I find institutionally-forced diversity measures (whether by states like CA or organizations like NASDAQ) to be unacceptable simply because these diversity measures are racist and sexist and *-ist by requiring hiring based on various identities rather than merit. Such policies are also arbitrary, since the identities we recognize are arbitrary - we don&#x27;t, for example, recognize identity groups based on location (different cities or states) - should &quot;rural&quot; be considered a minority identity that qualifies? Why not require every company to have a rural board member since one of the biggest divisions is our society is rural versus urban?<p>Furthermore, NASDAQ is once again quoting misleading statistics to support their misguided measure:<p>&gt; In its proposal, Nasdaq cited a report from the Carlyle Group investment company, which found that companies it invested in that have at least two diverse board members have nearly 12% more earnings growth per year than the average of companies that lack diversity.<p>This is similar to the famous oft-quoted McKinsey diversity study, where it was noted that more-diverse companies perform better. In truth, the actual study&#x27;s authors mentioned that the study is not causal - that is, increased diversity of these arbitrary minority groups is not a proven cause of success. Nor is it causal here. It&#x27;s more likely that successful companies often grow into large companies and naturally tend towards representation that reflects their broader society as a result. It is also the case that large companies are often the target of activist pressure to carry diversity initiatives, which then skews who is hired and promoted away from a natural merit-based process.')
