Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603743493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900413, text='&gt; I encourage you to dig deeper into the background of the Walter Duranty and Judith Miller cases, in both cases the individuals were lying and their colleagues and coworkers knew they were lying or had good reason to suspect it. In the case of Walter Duranty, it took the organization several decades to admit Duranty was full of shit, long after the facts were widely know.<p>Duranty did his reporting literally 90 years ago, which is <i>several generations</i> in the past.  That case is of limited use when reasoning about the organization today.<p>Miller was criticized by colleagues and was eventually forced out.  She seems to me kind of like a software engineer who came up with some grand design that had fundamental problems, but couldn&#x27;t let the design go.  That&#x27;s mistaken, arguably incompetent, but not sabotage.')
