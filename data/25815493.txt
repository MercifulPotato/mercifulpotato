What I’m going to be looking for 2 things:<p>1) Good&#x2F;fair voting rights for  shareholders. Voting rights should be as good as Netflix&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;Tesla&#x2F;Peloton’s and not like useless like Snapchat&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Google’s. (Management shouldn’t fear voting rights because shareholders generally vote in agreement with everything management says but it should have language to prevent short sellers from borrowing shares to vote which is known as a “poison pill” to protect the company from bad actors.)<p>2) A lower market cap to user ratio than Match Group.  When Snapchat IPO’d it had the opposite: a higher market cap to user ratio than Facebook so it dropped from $25 to $5 and overall lagged behind it’s competitor.<p>Optional moonshot 3: An in-app benefit or perks system for directly having a share of stock. The uniqueness and demand generation of this would send the stock soaring in the same way Ethereum flew from $350 to $1250 after the transition to Ethereum 2.0 which primarily requires you to possess 32 Ethereum to be a miner — something that hasn’t even been rolled out to Coinbase yet and will likely appreciate much further once it does.<p>Bumble’s “designed by women for women” approach has caused Bumble to do a better job at attracting women to their platform than Tinder or Hinge.  More women naturally attract more me. In my area the women on Bumble are noticeably much higher quality in terms of looks, education, and profile description than Hinge’s while on Tinder women are flooded with 100+ matches after a day or two now even if their first photo is just a picture of a floor* while men get magnitudes less attention due to the massive gender disparity.<p>In summary, I think Bumble is the better dating app company but that won’t matter if the stock is overpriced or isn’t shareholder friendly.<p><i>Short Tinder video of a male vs. a female with a floor photo on TikTok:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.tiktok.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6912611072226741509.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.tiktok.com&#x2F;v&#x2F;6912611072226741509.html</a><p>*Disclosure, I already hold Match Group shares (which are pretty good shares to hold) and expect Match to try and at least bid on Bumble by diluting their shares again. Whether that’s an outcome everyone wants is a totally different topic..</i>')
