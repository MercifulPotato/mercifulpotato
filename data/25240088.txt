Simulated annealing for eg traveling salesman problem came later.<p>I do agree some optimization algorithms are rooted in other fields. I wasnâ€™t trying to say that machine learning is the only historic field from which optimization methods were developed. I just wanted to point out it is a major historic field where some highly respected search and optimization procedures were first created, since people often overlook how old machine learning is and the vast set of modeling procedures apart from neural networks that make up the core of machine learning.')
