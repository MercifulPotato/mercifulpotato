Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[24703538], score=None, time=1602025442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703284, text='&gt;&gt; And instead of supporting the native Canadian population in having more children themselves, Canada, like most of the modern West, simply opted to replace them over time via migration.<p>&gt;This doesn&#x27;t make sense. The country already incentivizes child birth, and provides socialized medicine. You can&#x27;t make people have children.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t disprove the prior statement. It&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;re incentivizing having children, but not enough. Given the available choices of incentivizing having children even more (eg. free daycare or longer parental leave) or simply admitting more immigrants, Canada went with the latter because it&#x27;s cheaper. After all, why bother letting the native population produce average workers when you can admit above average workers from across the world?')
