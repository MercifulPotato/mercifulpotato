It&#x27;s to build features customers want or need, which in turn create value for your employer. This generated value pays your paycheck. Of course if you do a bad enough job, it&#x27;s counterproductive, but to the extent it&#x27;s not bad enough your job is to focus on features and development and not on optimization. Once performance is bad enough, your job becomes optimization -- via instrumentation, measurement and profiling.<p>Every minute you spend waiting on a build or waiting for an app to launch or waiting for some long-running task to finish is a minute you&#x27;re not creating value. Compounding this problem, it impacts morale if you spend your day looking at spinning beach balls while your boss won&#x27;t get off your back about when you&#x27;ll be done.<p>This is your employer&#x27;s perspective, more than likely.<p>[edit] Another way of looking at this is to say that you and your customers are doing different jobs. You have all the extra cpu and memory overhead of developing a product â€” all they have to do is run it. By definition your workload is more demanding.')
