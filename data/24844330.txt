As long as it&#x27;s not literally in an oven and there&#x27;s nothing conductive getting involved (as in the steel mill example pointed out in another comment) most electronics will chug along just fine. Recognizing this is what led to me abandoning a case for my desktop PC. It&#x27;s now just slapped on a piece of plywood on my wall because it literally doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>This setup even fell (during wall mounting attempts) ~8 feet to hardwood floors...twice! And still going just fine running Half-Life: Alyx :)')
