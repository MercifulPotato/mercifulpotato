It was originally closer to biology and moved away from that.</i><p>At the time biology itself was not a very scientific discipline. Biology became a real science when chemistry caught up with biology and biochemistry was born. Before that biology was mostly like a psychology: a lot of vague words, theories telling us things about something that cannot be seen or measured, and so on.<p>Though I can agree, that with the time psychoanalysis moved even further from science than it&#x27;s starting point.')
