It reminds me of the first computer I experienced in my life.[1]<p>I mean, it is lovely keyboard, I really like it. Just &quot;futuristic&quot; is a strange way to describe it. It would be even more nice, if some keys of bright colors were added. Like in MK-61[2]. Though photo in wikipedia doesn&#x27;t capture it (or maybe my memory is wrong), but those blue key was of a so beautiful shade, I really loved it in my childhood and was eager to learn how to use MK-61 just for a joy of using this very key. Yellow and red keys were also likeable but not so much, moreover the function of red key was trivial and I lost interest to it very quickly. But the blue key was beautiful and mysterious... My first love. Maybe I became a programmer due to color of this key.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electronika_BK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electronika_BK</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elektronika_MK-61" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Elektronika_MK-61</a>')
