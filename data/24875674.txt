Newer phones are supported (e.g. XA2), and I&#x27;m speculating here, but I imagine even newer phones are in the pipeline (e.g. Xperia 10 II).<p>I don&#x27;t recommend SailfishOS to anyone who is looking for the fastest&#x2F;most supported device out there. I recommend SailfishOS devices to those who primarily use their phone as a phone (and a desktop&#x2F;laptop as their primary work station), and want an independent mobile device, or want the Linux ethos on their phone.')
