The movement of other planets has almost no impact on our daily lives - the moon may impact the tides and the sun leads to our day night cycle but we can&#x27;t effectively impact that and so, for the average person, life goes on without more than a momentary thought given to how things are going on up there.  Though, we are all vaguely aware that we could suddenly and arbitrarily be killed by an asteroid impact (much like a colony being arbitrarily chosen to become some kid&#x27;s ant-farm - or being run over by a truck) it isn&#x27;t in the front of our minds because we need to get back to filling out that TPS report.<p>Still, as a society, we have a number of dedicated individuals that do study celestial movements and would try and prevent a sudden asteroid impact, and we all do remain vaguely aware of what&#x27;s going on up there.  So I&#x27;m not certain how much I agree with the fact that ants cannot understand us.  Sure we can&#x27;t sit down and have tea with an ant and talk about the weather, but if the moon was a gigantic dragon that just moved really slowly in a mostly predictable manner then how we interact with it might not be particularly distinguishable from how we interact with it when it&#x27;s just a chunk of rock.<p>A good parallel to think of here is probably Discworld, I might suggest reading The Light Fantastic if you never had to get a bit of a sense of how we might interact with celestially sized lifeforms and just how one-sided that relationship could potentially be.')
