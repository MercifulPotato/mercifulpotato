Do you think he can put money to better use for all of society than a good government? (And we can discuss if the US government is a good government in that sense, but that&#x27;s beside the point I&#x27;m making).<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer to these questions is No (he would have still done it) and No (a good government can put money to better use for all of society).<p>Or do you think the single mom with 3 kids working 2 jobs and still can&#x27;t pay rent and health care cares about electric cars and rockets?<p>Edit: I still think what he&#x27;s doing is important and impressive, and it&#x27;s ok that he is one of the richest people on Earth. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean the US needs to have a better tax system for the rich and better social pillars.')
