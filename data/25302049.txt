Measuring single core on an M1 may be counter productive. E.g. javascript runs on 2 to 3 cores at once even though it&#x27;s single threaded. Thanks to running RISC instructions of a single process in parallel on multiple cores. Thats why javascript on the M1 is twice as fast as on Intel, even though the M1 just runs at 3Ghz.')
