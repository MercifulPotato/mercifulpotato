I use quotes because we had to assert() the sizeof float with uint32_t in the code prologue (it is unlikely to be an issue now, but the code is 25 years old, so we stuck to the spirit of expecting compilers where C types could be a variety of sizes, not just the &quot;conventional&quot; sizes of today). Unions are defined, casting is very poorly defined, especially float&lt;&gt;int. There&#x27;s a good link a few comments down.')
