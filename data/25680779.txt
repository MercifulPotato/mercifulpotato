Thats just fantasy, unless you want full on civil war. For all the contempt you feel for Trump voters, they feel the same for you.<p>This thing escalated when it could have been resolved with just a proper audit of the vote totals by and independent panel in the disputed states. The supreme court should have taken the case, and resolved it. Unfortunately the Supreme court chickened out. And the disputed states governors fought tooth and nail a proper audit.<p>As a result Trumps people protested a contested election because they feel cheated. Some of them breached the barricades in the legislature. A Small group of them entered just for kicks and selfies. There&#x27;s no reason to label all of them terrorists, there was no violent intent for most of the protesters.  Its called &quot;The Peoples House&quot; after all, and Democrats have occupied legislatures too during protests.<p>You need to consider that human being are very sensitive to being treated unfairly. Right now its looking like an extreme double standard will be applied with how the BLM protesters were treated and how these protesters will be treated.')
