Even deep learning networks are essentially just linear regressions stacked on top of each other, with lower layers being trained on features predicted by higher layers.<p>I think if neural networks or SVMs are AI, then linear regression is as well. Neural Turing machines and other recent developments I think are closer to the layperson&#x27;s idea of &quot;AI,&quot; though.')
