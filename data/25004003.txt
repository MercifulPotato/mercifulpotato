Also an added bonus to this is having the full history of changes to the CI&#x2F;CD process tracked in git.<p>Can&#x27;t those stages, tasks, etc. be specified in the CI specific config files of the repository? Specifying them via an UI seems horrible to me. At least Github actions is all file-specified (except for secrets).')
