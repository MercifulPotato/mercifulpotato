Predictably it was much better at mapping word meshes than concept meshes, but it was still an interesting approach.<p>The underlying problem is that we literally don&#x27;t have a clear representation system for these concept meshes. Words are overloaded, code and math are too specific in their different ways. The various shades of ML are still too concrete.<p>So we&#x27;re going to keep having these debates until someone invents a representation system for natural language concept maps that isn&#x27;t based on verbal approximations.')
