If people learn personal responsibility isn&#x27;t rewarded then they will aggressively spend all their money now counting on rainy day funds. Which is fine until nobody has saved and there isn&#x27;t enough and everyone loses.<p>If Biden wants to solve the problem (and he should), then he needs to address why college tuition has been going up at much faster than inflation for years. Professors are not making any more (perhaps less, if non tenure track professors are more of them?). Government is spending less, but not that much less. So where is the money going that causes tuition to go so high. I don&#x27;t have answers, that is a hard problem, but it needs to ben confronted. There is no reason why a class of 20 working fast food wages cannot with careful living pay a professor their wages as a part time student. The math works out, so why is tuition so high?')
