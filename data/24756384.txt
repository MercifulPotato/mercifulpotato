These are interactive webmaps that also have a lot of narrative content (prose and pictures) that you can read through in a start-to-finish type of way, or browse the map and click on spots, seeing that part of the narrative.<p>They are focusing right now on making these that describe geologic hazards such as Cascadia subduction zone earthquakes and attendant &#x27;secondary perils&#x27; such as tsunamis, landslides, and liquefaction, all of which have different geographic distributions and types of impacts.<p>The big hold-up with this is not really technological, it&#x27;s that it takes a lot of time to write the damn content, make the maps and charts, and edit the photos.  But on the (information) technical side, there are still a lot of cool things that can be done within webmaps or similar interfaces, showing interactive geologic events and having sliders for different times, or whatever.')
