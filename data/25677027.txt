Then the article gets either a silent edit, or get a retraction hidden somewhere in another news.<p>After I&#x27;ve been burned by that a few times, sending something to a friend who read my message after several hours, opened the article i linked, and wondered what the hell I was talking about, I started sending them archived versions.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that even thought some journals issue corrections, sometimes that&#x27;s not enought to cover the damage done.')
