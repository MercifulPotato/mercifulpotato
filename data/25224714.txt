At least from memory, I remember some problems where on kubernetes if you look at nproc or cpuinfo, that will give you the number of processors on the host machine, and not necessarily the CPU limit which is set per container.  Although maybe I&#x27;m mis-remembering.  I guess nproc could look at something else as well to filter based on that, and I agree having a nice portable commandline is way better than looking at &#x2F;proc.')
