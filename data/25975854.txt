Once it&#x27;s over, the share price will begin to decline quickly. Anyone left holding shares on the way down will lose their money. Moreover, if they only joined to squeeze the shorts, they&#x27;ll lose their purpose. Despite what the memes say, they&#x27;ll absolutely start selling when it looks like there isn&#x27;t any more money to be made.<p>WSB presents an extremely over-simplified version of the stock market. They look at graphs of short interest and assume that no new short positions have been opened since this started. In reality, hedge funds are likely closing and opening short positions all day, every day. They&#x27;re trying to push the idea that total short interest is a valid indicator of when the squeeze has started, but it&#x27;s not valid at all.<p>Frankly, the level of misinformation coming out of WSB can no longer be attributed to Redditors having fun making memes. They deliberately remove comments and accounts that don&#x27;t toe the line or pump the stock. They deliberately push flawed ideas to convince newcomers to buy more shares. They&#x27;re pumping the stock, and the early GME buyers will take advantage of the pump by dumping their shares. It&#x27;s basically a pump-and-dump at this point.')
