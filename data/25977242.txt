To make them switch the messenger has to be easy to setup and feature wise it has to be so promising that they don&#x27;t feel like I lured them into something half baked.<p>While being federated is a huge plus for me, it still needs to be a good and usable messenger on all other fronts. If I can&#x27;t imagine my mother using it, you are doing something wrong.<p>I am not usually of the &quot;software must be usable by a baby&quot;-front, but for a messenger adoption is key, and unless I only talk to my nerd friends it needs to be both simple and at least up to task with Signal (videocalls, groups, easy to find contacts, ...)')
