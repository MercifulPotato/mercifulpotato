I also enforced getters-and-setters back in the day, for no good reason.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about long diffs because you changed many calls from &#x27;.x&#x27; to &#x27;.getX()&#x27;, good.  If it&#x27;s so coupled that it&#x27;s called in a thousand places, and you just changed functionality, it&#x27;s on you to understand those thousand places.  If it doesn&#x27;t affect those places - which you don&#x27;t know unless you look - then don&#x27;t make the change.<p>As for the RgbColor example in the article, not using setters would be better.<p><pre><code>    RgbColor red = new RgbColor(1,0,0);\n    red.set(.., .., ..);\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Is it still &#x27;red&#x27;?</code></pre>')
