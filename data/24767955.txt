The colors need to be able to change in transit. Otherwise, how does a double slit adjust after a particle passes through, and the opening then closes?<p>Here&#x27;s my approach:<p>1. Each ball starts with red or blue as the easiest way to transfer heat through electromagnetic radiation.<p>2. You are good at quantum chemistry. You convert the ball to a microstate. You turn it into a voltage without chemical reactions or heat loss through phase change.<p>3. That voltage grounds out to Earth. Earth gets brighter. Earth&#x27;s internal clock ticks faster. Earth&#x27;s orbit increases in radius. Good telescopes far away all agree that bigger Earth in orbit around bright sun transfers heat the fastest.<p>4. That propagates at the speed of light to everything. As time passes, all that is leveraged. You will need to give all that a different explanation if you want to start reversing things now.<p>5. You alter the macrostate of AUS so if a ball materializes, it&#x27;s easier to transfer heat as blue.<p>6. Any ball to materialize in the USA would be red.<p>It&#x27;s a big difference. Cosmic objects are spinning coins growing in locality at the speed of light. Stopping them with chemicals in orbit or matter wave satellites or systems that start with our sun or a black hole at one end have very profound effects. We can increase our precision here based on our greater ability out there. A slow acting photosensitive drug or genetic treatment that works because what a solar probe did in the past. Sounds desperate but I am tenacious in the pursuit.')
