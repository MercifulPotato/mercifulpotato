Focusing just on home prices or healthcare is incomplete way of understanding purchasing power &#x2F; cost of living. When we say that the median income has increased <i>adjusted for inflation</i>, it means that the real salary has increased even accounting for the increased prices of all of the stuff that needs to be bought.<p>And finally, re-iterating the point: these numbers don’t represent a single earner’s pay history. It doesn’t really make sense to compare a single individual’s fixed expense in the context of these distributions, because they represent different individuals at different snapshots in time. While the shape of the distribution may be (moderately) fixed, the <i>composition</i> of it changes dramatically.')
