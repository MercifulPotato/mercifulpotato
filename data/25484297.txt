It seems this message gets lost because people don&#x27;t want to be seen as transphobic or don’t want the “mental health” research to be misconstrued as “I want to ignore those crazy people”, as a lot of transphobes do consider things that way. While this is inherently a mental incongruence, it is easy to accommodate while we work to avoid it happening.')
