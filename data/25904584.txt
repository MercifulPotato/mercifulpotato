Currently I check page 2&#x2F;3 for something not yet on front page, but that depends on HN activity I guess. It is good enough right now, but about 12 hours from now (which is my preferred morning read in my time zone) only few of them come under not yet got enough attention category. By having a separate selection, they can be browsed more easily.')
