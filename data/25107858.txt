What I meant was that their document describing the v4 tests[1] mentions SSE and AVX, while the v5 version[2] does not. Does it mean that the v5 tests don&#x27;t cover them? I found find it surprising for a benchmarking tool but they really were mentioned before and now they&#x27;re not, hence my question.<p>If indeed v5 tests are not particularly about specialized performance but more about real-world use cases (e.g. PDF rendering, SQLite, image compression as others have mentioned) then running Geekbench v4 on M1+Rosetta would give a comparison of emulated x86 without vector instructions versus native x86 with all of its modern capabilities. Now if the M1 wins <i>that</i>â€¦<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekbench.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;geekbench4-cpu-workloads.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekbench.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;geekbench4-cpu-workloads.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekbench.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;geekbench5-cpu-workloads.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekbench.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;geekbench5-cpu-workloads.pdf</a>')
