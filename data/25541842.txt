The WYSIWYG aspect of Roam is real nice, vs having unrendered markdown in one pane and the rendered version on the other side.<p>Also, the “daily notes” feature in Roam is really useful, it’s a small UI thing but it gives me a nudge to make a daily note when I do any thinking, rather than having to file it manually in Obsidian.<p>Obsidian has most of the core stuff that Roam does though.')
