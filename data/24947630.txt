Like, all the &quot;protect the children&quot; anti-encryption laws for example are being pushed by &quot;the right&quot; &#x2F; &quot;conservatives&quot;. We see a lot of &quot;left-wing&quot; &quot;censorship&quot; in tech because most of the companies have younger, more liberal CEOs. At the same time, information is entirely controlled by mainly conservatives in government and traditional media.<p>Doing the math: the &quot;side&quot; that holds power in a certain sector is the one wanting to control information. The best conclusion from that has to be &quot;those in power want to control information to keep themselves in power&quot;, which makes a lot more sense than trying to attribute something as simple as &quot;controlling information&quot; to any particular political leaning.')
