Several elected officials have expressed fear they or their family would be harmed by members of the far right, most notably Rep. Pete Meijer (R-MI), who was one of the few house republicans to certify the results of the election:<p>“I had colleagues who, when it came time to recognize reality and vote to certify Arizona and Pennsylvania in the Electoral College, they knew in their heart of hearts that they should’ve voted to certify, but some had legitimate concerns about the safety of their families,”<p>He also said “That was what weighed on the colleague in mind’s conscience, and the last thing that that individual said to me, concern about the safety of that individual’s family, if that individual voted to certify the election... That is where the rhetoric has brought us. That is the degree of fear that’s been created.”<p>In Facebook comments, one rioter wrote:\n“Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in.”\n“We get our President or we die,” they added. “NOTHING else will achieve this goal.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;people-will-try-to-kill-us-says-gop-lawmaker-on-going-against-trump.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;people-will-try-to-kill-us-s...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;1&#x2F;13&#x2F;22229052&#x2F;capitol-hill-riot-intimidate-legislators" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;1&#x2F;13&#x2F;22229052&#x2F;capitol-hill-riot-int...</a><p>Sure seems like terrorism to me.<p>Now, do I think we need increased surveillance? Absolutely not, it was largely planned in public on Facebook. We just need an FBI that takes this movement’s threats more seriously. Exposing that some far right elements act like terrorists is one way of calling attention to the seriousness of the problem.<p>Edit: I also think the appeal that they might somehow treat BLM protestors even worse is not worth considering much. I don’t identify with any “side” that uses the threat of physical violence against elected officials to change their vote, even if they were to do it for a “good cause”. I don’t want that to be an available tool for BLM or anyone either.')
