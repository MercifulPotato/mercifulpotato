(Among rodent animal models, only guinea pigs could cough and sneeze, making them ideal for studying how respiratory diseases spread.) The guinea pigs were exposed to the infected air over a four-year period. A second group of 150 guinea pigs acted as controls: their air ducts were irradiated with UV-C lamps to kill TB bacilli.<p>Results:<p>&gt; an average of three guinea pigs per month contracted TB, while no controls were infected. The experiment [also] quantified how many TB infections could be expected to result from exposure to a given number of patients over a defined interval.<p>Relevance to COVID-19:<p>&gt; Rileyâ€™s research points to wearing masks and disinfecting air in enclosed spaces as two of the most effective tools for fighting COVID-19')
