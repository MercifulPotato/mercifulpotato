They could&#x27;ve rethought this any time in the past 20+ years, when it became apparent Chinese companies aren&#x27;t willing to follow US IP laws and keep buying the trinkets they (and at this point, only they) know how to make at a markup. Instead, our corporations still outsource manufacturing, and solve their IP issues by telling the people to tell the government to cry foul and do something about a now nuclear-armed nation that decided to grow past being a source of cheap labor.<p>There are plenty of bad things to say about China as a country&#x2F;government, but on the IP front, that&#x27;s just funny. IP laws in the West are a ridiculous racket. For all the companies here talk about innovation, there&#x27;s sure as hell more of it happening in China than over here.')
