The answer is the number of paths from 0 to N.<p>This is still pretty specific to counting paths in the same way the original knight problem is, though.<p>The other comment is talking about how you represent each state for the recursive function as a vertex, then connect it to its dependencies (basically taking the recursion tree, but merging identical calls).')
