Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[24785144, 24781952], score=None, time=1602710243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24780821, text='There is another aspect to this people might be missing:<p>If every phone that is shipped must come with a charger, but half the chargers are never used, then the marginal value gained by customers from the manufacturer improving that product is also halved.<p>So why bother making the charger good? Half the people won&#x27;t use it! They&#x27;d have to pay for something that&#x27;s not a direct benefit to the product they <i>do</i> want to buy: the phone.<p>This is one of the reasons the chargers that come with typical electronic devices are so bad. So very very bad.<p>They&#x27;re big. They&#x27;re odd shaped. They can&#x27;t be plugged in side-by-side. They&#x27;re heavy. The don&#x27;t provide much power. They&#x27;re inefficient. Etc... Some are downright <i>dangerous</i>.<p>It&#x27;s a race to the bottom where noone wins.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: I like the &quot;fancy&quot; chargers Apple makes. They use very advanced technology such as gallium nitride circuitry to miniaturise their chargers. They&#x27;re tiny, yet <i>powerful!</i> They don&#x27;t get hot. They&#x27;re light. They&#x27;re safe.<p>But I only need one or two, but only when travelling. At home I need <i>none</i> because the IKEA power strips have USB charging ports built in!<p>I&#x27;d much rather concentrate my dollars into a couple of <i>really good</i> chargers instead of a bunch of mediocre chargers that&#x27;s forced upon me on a one-to-one basis with the number of devices that I own.<p>Also: I haven&#x27;t used a wired charger for my phone in about a year. Why include a wired charger if the customer has a <i>choice</i> of charging technologies? Should Apple include both a wireless <i>and</i> wired charger? Should they include a car-kit too?<p>No. This is the point of standards: it lets you mix and match components at will instead of getting a fixed combination.')
