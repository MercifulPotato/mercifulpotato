Of course I could <i>assume</i> that a = account and n = amount to increment by, but that&#x27;s nothing more than an <i>assumption</i>, which only invites inevitable bugs. Alternatively I could look at the function body, and try to figure out what&#x27;s going on, but that&#x27;s time wasted that could be spent more productively.<p>Further, non-descriptive naming often assumes that the programmer reading and modifying the code has domain-specific knowledge. That might be true of mid level or senior engineers have have been with a particular company for years, but the new grad coming into a financial services company (a field he has no training or familiarity with) will have no idea what &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; means. I was in that position, and the descriptive naming absolutely would have helped me to learn and become productive with the codebase faster.<p>I&#x27;d say that your reasonable middle ground would be the best practice.')
