If pure collective will can create a valuable financial asset, without any reference to cash flows or fundamentals, then all you need is a collective and some will. Just hop on Reddit and create value out of nothing. If it works for Bitcoin, why not … anything? Why not Dogecoin? Why not Signal Advance? Tesla Inc.?

The error, as it were, was quickly corrected: Lots of news stories, and a tweet from the “real” Signal, clarified that Musk was not talking about Signal Advance. The stock kept going up. (It’s <i>still</i> trading at roughly 10 times its pre-tweet price, weeks later.)<p>Has anyone created a news-skimming trading bot that does the equivalent of making trades based on typosquatting to buy call options on SIGL or ZOOM when the more famous companies show up in the news?
