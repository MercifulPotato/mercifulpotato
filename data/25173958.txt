Even if it does pay 100% of the costs, it is often <i>mostly</i> an illusion.<p>In practice, most earmarks fall into the former category, and thus are entirely about manipulating the public.  Not that I&#x27;m necessarily objecting to manipulating the public.<p>===<p>worked example:<p>If fuel taxes bring in $100, which is spent on road maintenance, and then topped up by $40 of money from general revenue, that implies that the government thinks that $140 is the point at which marginal benefit drops below marginal cost.  In other words, if there was no fuel tax, they&#x27;d probably still try to spend $140, or thereabouts.  The earmark is entirely illusory.<p>If fuel taxes bring in $100, which is spent on road maintenance, and is not topped up, then that implies that the government thinks that the point at which marginal benefit drops below marginal cost is some number below $100.  If there was no fuel tax, their spending on road maintenance would go down.  Go down to what?  Let us suppose that it would go down to $60.  Then the fuel tax earmark is 40% reality, 60% illusion.')
