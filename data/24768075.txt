It does not &quot;tell&quot; the particle at the speed of light. The mutual wave function collapses as a whole unit.<p>it is very easy to measure something entangled at the same time (or at least within a margin that is faster than light travel) and confirm you always get the correct results. If the wave function didn&#x27;t collapse together, you would get results that break quantum laws, such as measuring two entangled particles with both up-spin.')
