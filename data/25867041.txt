Item(by='HoppedUpMenace', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611278462, title='Ask HN: Why does this ad window in macOS Catalina have no close/dismiss option?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I don&#x27;t know where to submit screen captures to be viewable by anyone without creating accounts and such but here is a URL to the app the ad in this window is advertising for: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;id1525556960?mt=12<p>The first screenshot is what I see on my screen, except with a message at the top saying &quot;Mirror My Screen (formerly MKMirror) - Free Download expires soon&quot; \nand a &quot;Download on the Mac App Store&quot; button at the bottom.<p>Why isn&#x27;t there any way to close this window without having to click this button in particular? And to be more clear, I cannot close it with Activity Monitor or Force Quit it in any way.<p>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a browser popup window and clicking anywhere in the window doesn&#x27;t show me what macOS app this belongs to. For all I knew, it could&#x27;ve been malicious in nature and I wouldn&#x27;t have known until clicking the button.<p>Finally, this window appeared after installing updates for macOS Catalina, I&#x27;ve mostly avoided going to Big Sur for now.')
