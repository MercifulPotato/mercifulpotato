Yeah there’s a need for this type of things. But as a person who is thinking to quit his&#x2F;her job to start a company, they may need more actionable advices and data points, e.g., how to buy healthy insurance, what corporate credit card to use, where to find design&#x2F;engineering help, what specific tools to use for specific things &amp; the cost... I wish there were such “trivia” advices when I started out 4 years ago. Of course, we can’t expect someone like pg or sam Altman to tell us what specific saas or api or health insurance to buy :) this kind of things can only come from people who fight in the frontline , while the memory &#x2F; experience is still fresh.<p>Maybe I should write an ebook for these unglamorous advices , especially for people who don’t want to go the venture scale route :)<p>- [edit 1] I had an old blog post on the tools &#x2F; tech I used for my company: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listennotes.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listennotes.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-boring-technology-behin...</a> it’s of course not the most optimal set of tools &amp; tech; but they get things done :)<p>- [edit 2] when people make it and become successful entrepreneurs&#x2F;VCs, they are teaching in startup graduate schools with their deep knowledge. But Where is the startup kindergarten&#x2F;primary school to teach those things that college&#x2F;graduate schools assume you already know?')
