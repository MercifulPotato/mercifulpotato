I would say the evidence is incredibly strong at this point, and it&#x27;s very hard to explain it spreading this successfully via any effect other than selective advantage. The &quot;founder effect&quot; and &quot;post facto identification&quot; explanations are just not credible any more, given that the explosive growth of B.1.1.7 compared to the wildtype has continued for almost a month after it was raised as a concern, and the pattern having now repeated in at least three other countries with enough data to make prevalence estimates (Ireland, Denmark and Switzerland).<p>What alternative explanation would you propose?<p>If the new variant is 50% more transmissive, then to get R to 1 requires measures that would previously have taken R to about 0.66. Clearly that is possible to achieve. But it&#x27;s also not really enough. Can they get it significantly below 1, and for how long?')
