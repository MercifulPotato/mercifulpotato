At the time, Israel claimed that Egypt was trying to develop a nuclear bomb.  However in his 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion, JFK says that American intelligence agencies had found no evidence of this and believed Egypt did not have facilities capable of it (unlike Israel.)  To ny knowledge, in the decades since then, evidence of the alleged Egyptian bomb program has never surfaced.<p>&gt; <i>&quot;I can well appreciate your concern for developments in the UAR. But I see no present or imminent nuclear threat to Israel from there. I am assured that our intelligence on this question is good and that the Egyptians do not presently have any installation comparable to Dimona, nor any facilities potentially capable of nuclear weapons production. But, of course, if you have information that would support a contrary conclusion, I should like to receive it from you through Ambassador Barbour. We have the capacity to check it.&quot;</i><p>-JFK, 1963<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org&#x2F;kennedy-letter-to-ben-gurion-regarding-visit-to-dimona" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org&#x2F;kennedy-letter-to-ben-g...</a>')
