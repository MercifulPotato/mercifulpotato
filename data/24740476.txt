While Twitter is definitely not the best site for a lot of research, it ends up getting used for tons of research because it is one of the only companies that allows others to access even a sample of its data without going through lots of hoops.<p>I think opening up the models is a good start, but I think it is even more important that we allow responsible use of these huge datasets. I also think that ensuring responsibility probably needs to be done by governments rather than companies since allowing companies to apply a lot of restrictions to data access leads to them cutting access off to everyone. If we need to restrict access to certain data because it might be abused, either the collection of that data needs to be banned for all companies or maybe we need to place restrictions on how that data is processed&#x2F;used rather than restricting its access to a few people.<p>Disclosure: I work as a SE at Microsoft.')
