Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=[25592473], score=None, time=1609417705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591811, text='I’m not a tax expert either but I think the rules were set up exactly with the intention as you describe.<p>My understanding is that capital gains taxes are intended to grow capital with the goal of a larger payout in the future as capital is reinvested. It’s purposely not intended to be a real-time tax on gains because future taxes will be greater.<p>For example, if there’s $100 in profit today and it’s paid out as a dividend then that’s $15 in tax revenue. But if that $100 is invested in the company, it compounds at some rate (say 5% although this varies by company and Amazon is much more efficient) so in 10 years that $100 becomes $162 (1.05^10*100) and if cashed out then as dividend results in $24.3 in tax revenue.<p>Theoretically if you think the government can invest and get a return greater than within individual companies then capital gains doesn’t make sense, but that’s an argument for economists.<p>But wanted to share that the goal of capital gains is to maximize tax revenue through efficient incentives.')
