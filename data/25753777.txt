If Trump really intended a coup, he should have had friendly military embedded among the rioters.  He shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;now go home&quot;.  It&#x27;s a very half-hearted coup on the part of the president.<p>Note well:  I am far from saying that Trump is innocent.  He absolutely should have known that his words would incite violence.  In the most charitable light possible, he&#x27;s still clueless about the effect his words would have.  (I could kind of see his intent being to use the mob to pressure Congress, so that they would be inclined to see it Trump&#x27;s way.  He may have intended the mob surrounding the Capitol, but not the breach... in a very charitable interpretation.  Even in that interpretation, though, he still very dangerously misjudged the effects of his words.)<p>And Trump may well be guilty of more than that.  He may well be guilty of attempting a coup to remain in power, and just not have had any idea of how to do it right.  (I prefer that rogues be incompetent...)')
