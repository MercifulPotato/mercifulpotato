That means Linux works with the touchpad, sleep works, wifi works, and so on. Every single machine has a prompt that says &quot;Windows pre-installed only&quot; &quot;Windows + Linux installed&quot; or &quot;Linux-only.&quot;<p>Today a lot of Lenovo machines work well with Linux but don&#x27;t ship with those options.
