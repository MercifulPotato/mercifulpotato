Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=[25171549], score=None, time=1605982411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171050, text='&gt; many people in the world are not happy when their prudent choices are invalidated by a change in the government policy in favor of others who took the opposite choice as you. And that they be called &quot;selfish&quot; for thinking so.<p>Sorry, but they are called selfish because they are selfish. And, they are part of the reason we can&#x27;t make any changes for the common good anymore. We can&#x27;t seem to politically make things easier that were previously difficult. This &quot;I suffered to do X, therefore everyone in the future must suffer to do X&quot; is a toxic, progress-limiting, and quintessentially American point of view. Same logic as &quot;We can&#x27;t have universal healthcare, because I have been paying so long for my own healthcare!&quot; and &quot;We can&#x27;t relax immigration policies, because when I immigrated, it was difficult!&quot; and &quot;We can&#x27;t take care of our poor elderly because I paid my own 401K for decades!&quot;<p>I paid back over $200K in student loans over more than a decade. I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re paid, finally. Not having them hanging around my neck is helping me financially get on track. If there is a chance someone younger than me (maybe even my own kids) can go through his or her life without that burden, I am all for it. Their success does not diminish mine.')
