SmartAsset pegs you as right on the money as $133k take home. Let’s say you live in a $1400&#x2F;mo place like I did for years (no roommates, but how often are you in your place in your 20s anyway?), that’s $17k a year. Now you’ve got $1300 a month for food and luxuries, and $100k&#x2F;year going into investments. That is not roughing it. If you hit a financial rough patch you sell a little stock. If the market does 7% inflation adjusted per year (its average for the last 50 years), you end up over a million in the first eight years without a problem. And again, this is assuming you never get a raise or a bonus.... anything extra is gravy.')
