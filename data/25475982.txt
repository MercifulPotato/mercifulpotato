I would suggest looking into something like Quarkus (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io</a>) and if Java is to verbose for someone, she&#x2F;he can checkout Kotlin (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotlinlang.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kotlinlang.org</a>) which is 100% interoperable with Java but clean, modern and pragmatic. With Quarkus you have a very powerful but simple framework that out of the box (GraalVM) can be compiled also to a single binary if you need very fast startup and very low memory consumption.<p>Go evangelises simplicity but when someone has to use it in a bigger project the lang is very cumbersome. You don&#x27;t have any functional programming features like filter, map, find to manipulate collections. The not null (nil) safety or the magic with interfaces{} does it make non safe especially compared to modern languages like Kotlin,Swift which have the notion of nullability build in the language itself.  Dependency Injection support is very limited. I think Go is hyped because of the excellent single binary feature which you have nowadays via GraalVM also for Java, Kotlin as I described above.')
