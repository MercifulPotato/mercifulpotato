Abstract data types, information-hiding, and separation-of-concerns were being done in C well before OOP was a thing. Granted, the information-hiding wasn&#x27;t as sophisticated as it got once OOP was introduced, but I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to attribute information-hiding to OOP as a result, especially since newer programming language have used visibility attributes in the absence of OOP classes.')
