Item(by='nathannecro', descendants=None, kids=[25023649], score=None, time=1604817909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022765, text='I see that I may have been a bit snarky to start off my response and in an effort to be clear, I&#x27;ll see if I can refrain from coming across as an asshole.<p>&gt;Goodness me, it seems you love to talk politics and a decided one side view of them as well.<p>I mean, not really. If you look at my (sparse) comment history on HN, I mostly don&#x27;t even comment. I&#x27;ll also point out that in my previous reply to you, I avoided making any assumptions about your belief systems or any conclusions (as I don&#x27;t know you from Adam) -- I find that arguing the argument is typically a better way to come to a clear conclusion.<p>&gt;There is alot to unpack here most of it twisted and filled with incomplete or out right false information from a liberal bias that completely ignores a lot of recent history<p>Sure, I&#x27;m happy to go through your response line by line and see what I have perhaps presented incompletely or falsely. I&#x27;d also like to remind you that I had three factual points about the Trump administration: that they did not cause economic growth beyond baseline average, that they increased our nation&#x27;s debt by 36%, and that they caused or participated in immoral and inhumane treatment of humans. It was specifically on this last point which I drew my line in the sand to say that I would have problems working with people who <i>to this very day</i> continue to behave in an unethical manner.<p>&gt;lets start with the most obvious, child separation...<p>First off, I&#x27;m glad that you outright state that you are against child separation and oppose fencing people in cages. I agree too!<p>Let&#x27;s be clear. I never alleged that Trump&#x27;s administration created these detention centers from thin air. According to USA Today, the cages were built during the Obama-era to temporarily house children so that they could be relocated to safe child-care within the United States. They were not built to house people for any extended length of time and they were not used as such (1). There&#x27;s also an interesting discussion as to the Trump Administration&#x27;s role to inflame an existing situation (a lot of migrants want to come to the US) and making it inhumane and worse (2). So there were policies in place before (which might have been not great), but Trump&#x27;s administration turned the knob up to 11 here and crossed over to immorality.<p>But hey, I never even talked about cages or whatever, but what I did link to was specifically speaking about forced family separation and forcibly turning children into orphans (and remember, these are decidedly &quot;non-combatants&quot; -- as far as I&#x27;m aware, we are not at war with any of the countries to the south of the US). <i>That</i> is something <i>no president</i> has done in recent memory, but please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here.<p>&gt;If you want to proclaim some kind of moral superiority, do you really want to point to Drug warriors Biden and Harris as people of moral fortitude.<p>I mean, if claiming that orphaning children is bad somehow makes me more morally superior to everyone else, then...then I don&#x27;t quite know where the baseline is. I feel like I&#x27;m just being rather rational in my assessment of the situation. I also don&#x27;t really want to engage in strawman arguments because like ad hominem, they don&#x27;t actually provide a clear argument for us to agree&#x2F;disagree upon. But hey, you brought it up, so I&#x27;ll respond.<p>I not once claimed that Biden&#x2F;Harris&#x2F;anyone else were morally superior or more ethical. I, in fact, never even mentioned them by name so I don&#x27;t see how you can claim that I pointed to &quot;Drug warriors Biden and Harris&quot;.<p>&gt;The War on Drugs has cost the lives, directly and indirectly, of many many millions of people...for those victims?<p>Hey, I agree with you too! I think that Nixon&#x27;s War on Drugs is likely one of the stupidest policy moves in recent American history. Several economics professors I know start Econ 101 by talking about supply and demand in the context of the War on Drugs. Essentially, attacking the supply side (DEA, invading South America, etc) has been shown to have no real effect on demand and therefore, should cease because it&#x27;s a giant money sink (3). The real way to &quot;fight&quot; drugs is reduce the demand (through education, rehabilitation, etc). Beyond just being a dumb idea, the War on Drugs was a popular idea and unfortunately, many people tied their political success to funding&#x2F;expanding a popular idea.<p>If you had asked, I would have absolutely criticized anyone who continued to promote the ridiculous War on Drugs -- especially after the awful ethical knock-on effects became well known. Yes, this includes Biden and Harris.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. Both Biden and Harris today have learned and understood that perhaps, they did make mistakes and though it was considered widely to be the right move twenty or forty years ago, today, we know better! In fact, Biden publicly apologized, and expressed remorse for his mistake (4). To connect your strawman back to Trump&#x27;s administration. Trump and his crew are <i>still doing awful, unethical things</i>. They cannot claim to be doing the &quot;popular&quot; thing or &quot;ignorance&quot; because literally the majority of the country, journalists worldwide, leaders of countries and religions, and even his former cabinet members publicly and vociferously tell him and anyone who will listen that doing obviously unethical things is...unethical. This is how I know that Trump and people who may agree with the unethical policies he has put into place, are...unethical.<p>&gt;To be clear, I am not a Trump supporter, but I am also not a Biden supporter. Though I would have preferred Trump over Biden for about 11 Trillion Reasons... My politics are libertarian, I am Anti-War, Pro-Gun, Pro-Free Markets, Pro-Free Trade, Open Borders, Anti-Social Welfare and Pro-Legalize Drugs... Biden is bad on all them, Trump is bad only a few of them.<p>Cool! I am an independent voter and have voted for Republicans and Democrats historically. I try to stay away from generalized &quot;buzzwords&quot; because I prefer to deal in specific policy. For instance, I&#x27;m for the legalization of drugs, but believe that they should be regulated very tightly because like anything addictive (gambling, alcohol, etc) the societal impact on <i>others</i> can be highly detrimental. I don&#x27;t mind if you want to get wasted every night, but if you get wasted and drive a car into my wife, I&#x27;ll be pretty pissed.<p>While also not on topic, I disagree with your statement that &quot;Biden is bad on all [policies]&quot; and &quot;Trump is only bad on [a few policies]&quot;. I at least know that Biden has seriously considered many questions and has publically written very thoughtful policies out for people to read and think about. One such policy favors the federal decriminalization of marijuana and I also know that Trump is staunchly against decriminalization of marijuana.  So, since you write that you are &quot;pro-legalize drugs&quot; I don&#x27;t quite understand why you claimed to agree with nothing Biden presented.')
