Here&#x27;s the thing: science is never done, it will never know for finally and for certain.  And yet two of my objections will remain unaddressed:<p>1) FTL implies CTCs, that means paradoxes.  How are those going to be resolved?  Because the Cosmic Censor stuff never quite makes sense -- exactly <i>what</i> mechanism is going to forbid you from opening the message that says, &quot;Do not send this message back in time?&quot;<p>2) Again allowing for FTL ... where are the self-replicating machines spreading across the cosmos?  Pop to another star system, pop to another galaxy, or even a local cluster.  They should have already been there.  The universe is vast.  Most species will realize that this is a terrible ass idea, but there&#x27;s always a lunatic in a large enough crowd, and it&#x27;ll be a pretty large crowd.<p>Nobody ever deals with these points.  People <i>want</i> FTL to be true because, well, Star Trek (or Star Wars, or Farscape, take your pick).  It&#x27;s a bit dull, plodding along at some small fraction of <i>c</i>, but the universe doesn&#x27;t have to be exciting for us.  And I&#x27;m not going to bet otherwise.')
