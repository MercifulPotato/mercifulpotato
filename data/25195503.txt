I&#x27;m talking about music.<p>I don&#x27;t like using the word &quot;piano&quot; for quiet, &quot;forte&quot; for loud, &quot;retardando&quot; for slow down, etc. I don&#x27;t like using 7 letters and sharps&#x2F;flats&#x2F;naturals to describe 12 notes. I don&#x27;t like using keys and clefs to obfuscate notation. I don&#x27;t like demanding everything be Ionian-mode centric.<p>I offer the following improvements: Replace historic words like &quot;allegro&quot; with sensible replacements like &quot;faster&quot;. Replace the 12 different Ionian-mode centric keys and &quot;accidentals&quot; with a single chromatic notation. Make a notation that expresses a wider range without relying on ledger lines, and ditch clefs all together.<p>And above all, stop rejecting every change that diverges from the <i>status quo</i> out of hand. Actually consider real changes, instead of worshiping the 17th century system we use today as if it&#x27;s the epitome of perfection.')
