Item(by='Udik', descendants=None, kids=[25730086], score=None, time=1610360663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25724291, text='How is it different from having a private key + mnemonic phrase split between three persons? Once you have your private key stolen, you can recover your mnemonic phrase and transfer your funds to another wallet. Of course, this needs to happen before the thief can do the same, but this is not different from the proposed &quot;social recovery wallet&quot;.<p>The problem is that transactions are a one-time, irreversible operation. I wonder if it would be possible to:<p>a) create wallets with an unchangeable per-transaction spending limit;<p>b) with the need to have transactions above a set amount to be confirmed after a set amount of time, with an email or other type of messaging sent between first and second confirmation.<p>(edit): The messaging part is impossible, as the blockchain cannot be aware if the message was actually sent- the miner could say it was and there&#x27;s no check. But an app could observe the blockchain and notify the wallet owner of the transaction request.')
