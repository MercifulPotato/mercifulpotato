Absolutely I agree that businesses should be able to easily opt out of being listed on a given delivery platform if&#x2F;when it causes problems for them.<p>But on the flip side, I&#x27;ve observed a lot of restaurant owners not having the time, energy, or know-how to set up even basic online things that could really boost their business.<p>I would expect that many restaurants really benefited from Doordash adding their menu to their website without their knowledge (even if some have, in net, suffered).<p>Going straight to opt-in seems like it could hurt some businesses.<p>Not to mention, of course, any new entrants! This law will make it much harder to compete with &quot;the next Doordash&quot;.')
