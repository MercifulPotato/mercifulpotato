It&#x27;s possible to change membership but this requires achieving consensus on the membership set by running paxos.<p>As to your question, it really depends what you mean by &quot;survive&quot;. Paxos will not make progress unless it can achieve quorum, usually set as the majority of nodes. However it won&#x27;t corrupt data either (multiple different tx values being chosen during consensus). It is thus a good fit for non-adversarial environments where you own &amp; control all the nodes in the cluster and want to gracefully handle common faults (nodes losing power or crashing, network messages lost).')
