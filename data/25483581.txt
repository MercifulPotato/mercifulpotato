I know they do not, because I personally know and socialize with Polish people and also know - as a direct result of that - a bit of Polish political news.<p>I am not here for any &quot;SJW&quot; debate as everyone else seems to keen to get into, nor do I care to litigate Poland&#x27;s track record of immigration as I lack either interest or competence to do so. I do not doubt or question that Polish has a different cultural disposition than more Western countries.')
