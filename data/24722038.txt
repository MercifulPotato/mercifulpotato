Evidenced not least by the fact Bitcoin was likely created by an international narcotics and arms trafficking racist bond villain who at one point tried to keep Rhodesian farmland in the hands of the whites and nearly started a cocaine plantation in Somalia [0, 3]<p>(2a) Inflation isn&#x27;t some magical evil conspiracy, money is an intentionally lossy store of value. Inflation incentivizes investment and allocation of capital towards the most productive enterprises. This is intentional. Inflation doesn&#x27;t affect people who own assets, including real estate and equities, so long as wages keep pace with inflation. They have.<p>(2b) Deflation is bad, as it decreases the velocity of money and economic productivity. Why would you spend money today when it would be worth more tomorrow? Hundreds of BTC are lost every few days due to the user-hostile nature of cryptocurrencies.<p>(2c) Deflation also concentrates wealth with existing holders, hurting the next generation of market participants, and entrenching the current BTC wealth distribution. This is worse than <i>any</i> banana republic. Unless you&#x27;re one of the whales, you&#x27;re a peasant fighting scraps, and your kids will practically be serfs.<p>(3) I want my currency to be subject to &quot;government coercion&quot; when the courts say so. If you don&#x27;t trust your government or the courts, the &quot;coercion&quot; of the government is literally the least of your problems.<p>(4) I for one do want the government to be able too regulate,  control and trace transactions. Which is something they can easily and explicitly do with a shared public ledger.<p>(5a) Massive waste, each proof-of-waste BTC transaction produces 100g of e-waste and consumes as much electricity as it takes to drive a Tesla from SF to NY. [1] All to operate a network that you could replace with a <i>single DynamoDB table</i> and likely one man on a stationary bike powering it.<p>(5b) At market rates for electricity alone a crypto transaction costs about $80, which is socialized across the block reward. When this stops, people will have to pay the whole cost of a transaction, which in turn they will not do, which will shut down miners, which will kill the security aspects of the network.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;was-bitcoin-created-by-this-international-drug-dealer-maybe&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;was-bitcoin-created-by-this-inte...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Le_Roux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paul_Le_Roux</a>')
