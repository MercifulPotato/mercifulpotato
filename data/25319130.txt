It can&#x27;t be explained by just lower memory latency or faster CPU, because neither are x30+ faster, with a speedup like that needed to explain it getting down to under 100ms from several seconds (that&#x27;s the current norm across platforms and GPU vendors). So most likely they do <i>something</i> differently there, skipping work instead of doing the same thing, but faster. What is that? Is that somehow dependent on their hardware, or is it something like what Intel did to MKL on AMD?')
