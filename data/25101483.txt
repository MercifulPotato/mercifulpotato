If the feature goes away entirely, that&#x27;s fine. And then somebody else can come back and implement it themselves.<p>But if the company gives themselves access to that feature and not anybody else (even with the permission of the device owner), and restricts anyone else from reimplementing it, that creates a monopoly which they would then be abusing by restricting what competing app developers can do.<p>Security is the owner of the device controlling what runs on it. Monopoly abuse is the manufacturer of the device doing so against the will of the owner of the device.')
