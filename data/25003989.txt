The result image can also be tested by launching a qemu VM with no additional code.<p>The language itself provides some amount of syntactic validation. Thousands of fairly up-to-date packages[1] readily available and pre-compiled (but you can also build them if you prefer). Most sysadmin tooling already comes with specific, type-safe config parameters. Just override the defaults you don&#x27;t like. Let&#x27;s Encrypt support for an nginx vhost is a single &quot;enableACME = true&quot; line!<p>While there are still some rough edges like secret sharing&#x2F;storage, I&#x27;d encourage giving it a try before getting to the big, unnecessary guns.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixos.org</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.nixos.org&#x2F;packages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;search.nixos.org&#x2F;packages</a>')
