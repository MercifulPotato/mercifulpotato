I was 11 and it blew my mind how much info there was in it. Despite also buying FIFA &#x27;97 at shop, I looked forward to coming home from school and firing up a new article. They had a audio and video too!<p>It&#x27;s hard to explain just how incredible it was to have this info all in one place in the pre-internet age. Even today, I&#x27;d say having this kind of validated information as an integrated product offers a superior way to learn compared to Googling random articles and watching ad-ridden Youtube videos.<p>Maybe this is the 2020-itis talking, but I can&#x27;t imagine watching the moon landing or MLK&#x27;s speech online without mentally preparing myself for the rudeness and straight up lunacy in the comments section.')
