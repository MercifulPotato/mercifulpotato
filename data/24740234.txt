We have people from national labs usually because of compensation. It&#x27;s not high six figures but it is pretty competitive especially for the area I live in. I worked in finance for a few years in New York and although the pay was better, living in Manhattan has a way to humble you :)<p>To be honest, I feel like I really lucked into this job and don&#x27;t really know many places that employ people like me for solving PDEs in industry but you could definitely try something like quant researcher&#x2F;developer which will alleviate some of the compensation woes from university and still have aspects of mathematical code to some extent.')
