My work machine is a 16inch MacBook Pro and since I had a laptop and I was not satisfied with the performance of my Mac I decided to build a PC. I have nothing against RGB as it gives me the possibility to change the mood at my desk at will. So I thought. I made the grave mistake to buy RGB RAM and by the love of god the manufacture thought that it’s a cool Idea That the default pattern is the rainbow color animation. My motherboard can control RGB for most devices from Bios but not all! So I can configure that everything is dark at boot except the RAM. My grafixcard is also sometimes acting up and shows a single static color on some LEDs. That is all not so bad as long as I boot into windows. The tools on windows start up and set it to my preferred setting (some static color or off). But Linux is a different beast. I hoped OpenLED could help but it won‘t work with my hardware. I managed to get my RAM to show up (at that point my goal was to shut all down when in Linux) but it only finds 2 of my RAM slots. I have 4 modules and still room free for 4 more. Means I can only disable or set colors for 3 modules the rest rainbow circles still. I thought about replacing the RAM but at the moment I lived with the Lightshow.')
