I try to only downvote posts with whom I disagree if I believe they are being mean.<p>As for my own posts, I do get frustrated when I am downvoted but nobody replies with an explanation for why they downvoted me.  I leave comments on sites like HN because I want to evolve my own thoughts on the subject and help others evolve theirs.  So to me a downvoted post with no replies is a missed opportunity to evolve my thoughts and better understand those who disagree with me.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t look like this site applies to HN comments.')
