Signal’s developers are on record as preferring the Google Play store as the official distribution method, and even downloading the APK directly from the Signal website is something they tolerate only grudgingly.<p>Plus, some are predicting that forthcoming changes to Android – Google possibly mainstreaming its “advanced protection” model so that phone owners cannot install the F-Droid APK except through enabling ADB and pushing it to the phone from a computer over the command line – will further marginalize F-Droid.')
