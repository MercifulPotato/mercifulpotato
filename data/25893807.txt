Like any starchy food, it&#x27;s effectively largely sugar (glucose) anyway. And the added sugar is only a few grams per serving, so if you take the viewpoint that the fructose component is what makes sucrose&#x2F;HFCS especially harmful, it&#x27;s not nearly equivalent to downing a glass of juice or soda.')
