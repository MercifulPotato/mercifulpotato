Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609663481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25619325, text='&gt; but according to our government you may lose your citizenship if you commit an act of treason<p>If you read the applicable provision of law—8 USC Sec. 1481(a)(7)—you have to not only commit an act of treason, but do so “with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality” in order to lose citizenship.<p>As long as you still want to be an American, albeit a traitorous one, you don&#x27;t lose your citizenship just for being a traitor.<p>(And, it <i>also</i> requires conviction of the treason by a court martial or competent court, so if the government wants to give effect to this, it literally not only have to get a hold of the person, try and convict them of treason, and <i>then</i> prove additionally the intent to relinquish citizenship. At which point the last bit is quite likely to be moot.)')
