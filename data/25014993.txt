Design patents allow a company to get an exclusive right to the form of a functional object so that a 3rd party can&#x27;t make a different device with identical appearance (well, not legally at least). Almost every company that puts the time into making a distinctive shape for their devices gets one: Microsoft has one for the Xbox, George Lucas got one for Yoda etc.&quot;')
