In a better educated society people would understand that II WW did happened and would more or less know what it was about and what Holocaust was. In case the society did not know, it could turn to experts for advice. In any case, deniers would be shunned, belittled and generally not heard seriously.<p>I still think freedom of speech should accommodate people who want to embarass themselves by claiming obvious falsehoods and this move is just a part of slippery slope to complete loss of what should be universal right.<p>The response should not be administrative action by private company but ostracism by general public.<p>Now, this is of course impossible in a society where almost half of it declares would want to reelect a person that lies about everything even when he doesn&#x27;t need to and who doesn&#x27;t care about anything other than his own interests.')
