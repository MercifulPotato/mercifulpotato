What circumstances would a four way stop sign allow for more traffic flow than a roundabout?<p>Heavy traffic.  In most situations a roundabout will do better, but when completely saturated, the 4-way has a slight advantage.  This is probably due to how 4-way stops with dense traffic develop an predictable alternation pattern that eliminates ambiguity and reduces the clearance requirements.')
