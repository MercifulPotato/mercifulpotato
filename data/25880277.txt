Item(by='sudosysgen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611384953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880078, text='I am fully F2P and have Keqing, Mona, Jean, Albedo, Fischl, Barbara, Xiangling, Razor, Xingqui, Beidou, Xinyan, and Noelle.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m missing much. I could use a Cryo or Pyro 5*, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine.<p>I did get <i>somewhat</i> lucky, but I was able to do ~130 free gacha rolls and have enough gems left for around 20 more, so it&#x27;s not outside of expectations.<p>I think it is fine. You can always lust after more characters but really, if you spend your primogems wisely, there is no real need beyond what you can get for free.<p>I also appreciate the resin system that removes the incentive to spend too much time on the game. It limits me to 45 minutes a day which undoubtedly costs MiHoYo a lot but is appreciated.<p>If you run the numbers, every day you can as a F2P player get enough for a 1.6-2.2% probability at a 5* character, so around 40-60% at a 5* every month. For this you have to be patient and game the pity system, though.')
