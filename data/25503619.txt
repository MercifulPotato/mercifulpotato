UI programming and game programming are now currently the areas where functional programming techniques are sort of in vogue.<p>If you want to do FP in your job, becoming a front end developer is your best bet as React + Redux currently follow a paradigm called functional reactive programming (FRP) with react trying to go more and more in the direction of FP and trying to separate out all side effects from pure functions.<p>A popular pattern in game programming is called ECS, which isn&#x27;t strictly FP but is similar in the sense that functions are separate from data rather then attached to data as it is in OOP. The game industry is definitely heading in this direction over OOP style techniques. It&#x27;s actually rather similar to FRP.')
