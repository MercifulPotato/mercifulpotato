It is a disappointingly short sighted effort.<p>To make a difference in a city it needs to shrink down the area occupied by cars today as well as reduce the absolute numbers.  Since this car cannot travel at even modest highway speeds it does not replace anyone&#x27;s primary car.  The result is that people will end up owning more cars.  If they can afford it.<p>The second problem is that it puts a new demographic on the road:  teenagers.  In this segment it would (again, for those who can afford it) replace public transport, bicycling and walking.<p>I live in a city.  I have a small car.  What I really want is an even smaller car built around the fact that most of the time I am transporting just myself.  But I need to be able to drive at highway speeds in order to not cause traffic problems.<p>This is an embarrassingly poor design effort.  Europeans used to be great at designing nation changing, important small cars.  The french had the 2CV and the Renault 4.  The Italians gave us the (original) Fiat 500.')
