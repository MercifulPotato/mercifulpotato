They are far too valuable even if intel doesn&#x27;t own them anymore.<p>Now, the US may lag behind top of the line fabrication tech (It already does).  But it will never lose it&#x27;s ability to fabricate chips.<p>For military applications, unless they start getting really into artificial intelligence (maybe they already are?) they don&#x27;t need super advanced chips for most of their equipment.  Simple micro-controllers are enough for most military applications.')
