Their goal is to be a little silly and maybe elicit an emotional reaction, judging by your reaction it seems like it worked well.<p>So, if I&#x27;m hearing you correctly: good marketing involves making someone so disgusted by the this ever pervasive Corporatism so much that it will actively make someone avoid eating there ever again? And thus reducing their potential market share?<p>Then again I guess polarization does sell ad-space, look at CNN&#x2F;MSNBC these past 4 years who made billions in ad money for their perverse 24 hour version of 2 minutes of of hate with Trump spam. But I fail to see how that works on people that aren&#x27;t the senile boomer demographic who rage on Facebook and foment more division and discord demographic?<p>Honestly, I was so glad that I went dark for those days. I avoided all the pointless Trump-Biden inauguration drama and was actually super productive and it reminds me I should do that more often.<p>I actually went back to Jermey&#x27;s Scahil&#x27;s expose on Trump&#x27;s 4 years on the Intercept and watched Curtis&#x27; HyperNormalisation that reminded me why I have the views that I do.')
