Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=[25426321], score=None, time=1607992734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424994, text='&quot;Nature&#x2F;Nurture is almost unsolvable&quot; - I was under the impression that for most traits we have researched the evidence shows that the Nature&#x2F;Nurture answer is simply &quot;both&quot; ? I.e. I agree that it&#x27;s getting good experimental data on the exact mix of nature vs nurture is difficult or impossible with ethical methods, but for many traits we can  (as far as I understand - it&#x27;s not my field of research) demonstrate that it&#x27;s definitely not 90&#x2F;10 or 10&#x2F;90 purely from observational studies.<p>But perhaps it&#x27;s more accurate to look at this from a &quot;four quadrant&quot; (simplified) perspective, with nature&#x2F;nurture on one axis and hereditary&#x2F;nonhereditary on the other axis. So you&#x27;d have hereditary nature (biological determinism) factors in one quarter, non-hereditary nature (biological variation, mutations, things like most cases of Down syndrome) in another; hereditary nurture (socioeconomic status, which affects a lot, cultural aspects and family values), and non-hereditary nurture, where (among other things) I&#x27;d be eager to place things which are under the individual willpower control even though they&#x27;re not technically &quot;nurture&quot;.')
