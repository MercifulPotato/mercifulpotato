As I mentioned in another comment, no individual without billions of dollars behind them can do anything whatsoever about air pollution.  Do you really think even, say, middle class Americans could take on the US government, one of the top 10 greenhouse gas polluters in the world?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just amplifying your point, but you seem to be blaming people for being poor here, when, in fact, people are being <i>kept</i> poor intentionally by capitalism.  It&#x27;s much easier to control people who have no other options, after all.')
