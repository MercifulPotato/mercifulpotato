I regularly see much shorter compile times on macOS development systems and after trying Clang on Linux, the gap narrows significantly.<p>My most recent experience was with building GCC for cross-compiling. I had been doing work on Linux and spun up a cloud VM instance to do the compiling there with tons of CPU. Later, I wanted a Mac build environment set up, and when I compiled GCC on macOS with Clang, it was <i>much</i> faster to build. I went back to my Linux system and tried compiling GCC using Clang there, and got the same result.<p>Clang is <i>fast.</i> Just saying.')
