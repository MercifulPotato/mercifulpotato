Yes, Larry asked a <i>Java</i> question but the real interest was solving an intellectual puzzle:  since the impact (e.g. h-index[1]) of academic papers can be approximated by citations, can that <i>same idea</i> be applied to webpages by <i>analyzing the pages&#x27; href links</i>???  This is the idea that&#x27;s <i>bigger than Java</i> which preoccupied his mind.<p>After he codes his proof-of-concept crawler in Java, one of his later employees at Google Inc rewrites it in C++ for performance.  Larry Page doesn&#x27;t waste time arguing on internet forums that <i>&quot;C++ gives you so many ways to shoot yourself in the foot&quot;</i>.   Instead, he concentrates on the <i>expanding his idea to organize all the world&#x27;s information</i>.<p>That&#x27;s what a lot of us on HN are trying to do... find a big idea that just lets us use our programming skills to implement it.  The programming is only a transition state to something else.  Personally, I do like programming but that&#x27;s not my end goal of self-actualization.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H-index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H-index</a>')
