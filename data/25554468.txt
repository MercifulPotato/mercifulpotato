I downloaded the macOS version of the Kindle reader because I was reading a programming-related book. A single page turn would take seconds to complete on a Mac Pro. I ended up profiling it with Instruments. It was a QT app that they had obviously ported from another platform and done no performance tuning on. It turned out it was redrawing the page 4 or 5 times, and allocating and freeing something like 40MB of memory on each redraw. It seemed like just having a statically allocated 40MB buffer would have solved the problem, but who knows? It was pretty appalling.<p>The ratings for their own software on their own web site show all the problems.[0]<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Amazon-Digital-Services-LLC-Download&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00UB769KC?th=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Amazon-Digital-Services-LLC-Download&#x2F;...</a>')
