I think you&#x27;ve mistaken terseness and informality for clarity.<p>You misconstrue &quot;wise spending&quot; with &quot;allocating funds to areas that need the most assistance&quot;.  The two are not informationally equivalent.<p>You leave out the information that you know nothing about local conditions. Presumably you&#x27;ve jumped to conclusions about what local conditions means.<p>And lastly,  it must be pointed out that a perfectly valid interpretation of your version is that you were unable to form an opinion on the committees spending because you got lost in the carpark&#x2F; building&#x2F;town...<p>I think one could arguably simplify the original further to:<p>&quot;Knowing nothing about local conditions, we could not determine how effectively the committee allocated funds to areas needing the most assistance.&quot;<p>But it&#x27;s very hard to move past that without fundamental information changing,  and even my changes I accept are a little bit stylistically subjective,  albeit with a marginally lower word count to convey fundamentally the same information.')
