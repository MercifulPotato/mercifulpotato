But I did not use the option &quot;Window Scaling&quot; (currently set to 1x) instead I changed in the Fonts-tab the &quot;Custom DPI settings&quot; setting it to 192.<p>The only problem that I have left is with Google Chrome &amp; Vinagre: whenever I move the cursor inside their windows it stops being scaled up (therefore it becomes tiny). Used to work fine, changed during some recent update :(')
