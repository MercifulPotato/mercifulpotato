But on Netlify, most of my build time isn&#x27;t actually used doing `next build`, it&#x27;s the un-logged-to-user file transfer to their server &#x2F; CDN cache invalidation &#x2F; whatever hosting magic they do after the static files are built.<p>So at least in my case, NextJS would have to create a way to not rebuild files that haven&#x27;t changed, and then the hosting&#x2F;CDN provider would also need to be able to see which files those are and respond accordingly. This all seems very doable eventually though.')
