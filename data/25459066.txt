The Americans had the choice to erase werner von braun from significance and instead chose to benefit on a grand scale from his slave-built knowledge.<p>You&#x27;re right Von Braun is part of the past now. He&#x27;s apart of the Usa&#x27;s past. It&#x27;s difficult to hear complaints about his nazi past, long after all the hard choices about what it means were already made.<p>VB&#x27;s work is inexplicibly stamped into space flight and trying to get rid of that influence now, is like having your cake and eating it too.')
