Some people just want to share what neighborhood, city, or even what country &#x2F; state they&#x27;re in, or only share accurate location to a specific set of people.<p>Also another way to avoid using google &#x2F; apple location services is offering a geoIP mode, which would mesh well with the optional rough location options.<p>It&#x27;s too bad you can&#x27;t force location services to only use built in GPS vs pinging their internet servers.<p>Apple also has an issue where they silently stop location tracking apps in the background, you might have to make a nag notification like arc app does do to keep it active. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigpaua.com&#x2F;arcapp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bigpaua.com&#x2F;arcapp&#x2F;</a>')
