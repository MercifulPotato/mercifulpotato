Not just one node, but all of them.<p>When I tried to login again after they rebooted everything, I found that my account had been banned.  I got a NOC admin on the phone and apologized for my mistake, but also asked him why they did not enforce a maximum number of processes per user (via ulimit).  Apparently they had never thought of doing that.  He thanked me and my account was restored immediately.')
