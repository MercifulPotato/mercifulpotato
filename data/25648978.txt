The ToS for .eu domains is not that clear about the fact that these are not to be considered property but there is an important point:<p>&gt; SECTION 9. RIGHTS GRANTED<p>&gt; 1. Upon registration of a Domain Name, the Registrant obtains a limited, transferable, renewable, exclusive right to use the Domain Name for the Term unless otherwise stated in the Rules. No other rights can be claimed by the Registrant except for those included herein.<p>The key point here is: limited. This should indicate that a domain name is not property. On top of that UK .eu domain owners had 2 years time to figure things out.<p>This whole article read like a big complaint about not doing long ago announced homework.')
