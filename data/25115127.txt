But search after search I conduct, reading articles on this topic from the likes of Norton and various respected security researchers are tipping the balance in favor of iOS for overall security. It&#x27;s not perfect but it is rather clear. The lack of fragmentation, and the centralized control and ease over updates, are all cited as key advantages in the iOS space in the war against malware.<p>Thanks for the info on XcodeGhost, I hadn&#x27;t heard that before. But to stake your evidence on this one single event from over five years ago is not so convincing.<p>I appreciate your effort to dig up an example that is an exception, but we&#x27;re talking about the industry overall here, worldwide, and in recent years.')
