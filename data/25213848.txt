If you let your eyes relax their focus to a point beyond the screen, the blurry circles maintain the illusion.<p>And bonus points if you find the focal point where a third circle is in the middle which is a composite of both the left and right circles, and... it doesn&#x27;t move.  I don&#x27;t know how to better explain the effects of letting your eyes wander out of focus and the artifacts it creates in your vision, but I&#x27;m sure someone will get it.')
