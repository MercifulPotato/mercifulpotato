The Supreme Court has ruled that splitting minority districts is a violation of the U.S. Constitution as it weakens their voice.  Which has made this a common fight between the parties.<p>However, this idea that districts should be advantageous to some group is inherently corrosive to the idea of democracy.  You canâ€™t have your cake and eat it to, either districts need to be arbitrary lines drawn without political influence or your just deciding what influences are allowed.<p>PS: Packing means these districts can also be used to hurt democrats by creating a single district with extreme bias you can create several safe districts which would otherwise be contested.')
