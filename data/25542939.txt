None. However well you treat animals you&#x27;re still ultimately going to kill them.<p>No, there are a lot of arguing about this. There is no ethical consensus on &quot;killing animals&quot; being the &quot;wrong&quot; thing. Hell there is not even consensus on whether an objective ethics is possible.<p>Organisms consume other organisms. This is part of the cycle of life. Declaring this objectively wrong without exceptions just because you feel bad for the poor animals is a weak argument at its best.<p>You can talk about the perils of the modern day animal farming which involves treating animals like vegetables and &quot;growing&quot; them in conditions indistinguishable from torture; but that doesn&#x27;t have to mean &quot;killing animals&quot; is bad per se.<p>&gt; Environmentally: a hundred reasons to choose a plant based diet, all of which have been cycled here a million times so won&#x27;t go back through it but we all know it&#x27;s true.<p>Yes, but there is research supporting that grain and vegetable farming has a lot of problems as well. Farming in scale in general is a problematic thing. Some even go as far as to state that animal farming can be even less harmful environmentally, when done right. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that, this claim hasn&#x27;t been proven yet. If you want to see counter arguments and relevant research, try following a couple of carnivore diet advocates on social media. I don&#x27;t have any links to share off the top of my head at the moment and I&#x27;m sorry about it. But there is no real consensus here, not so easy.<p>&gt; Health: again, see pretty much all the research ever. Eating a plant based diet is so much better for weight, health, BMI, etc etc etc<p>Yes, there are a lot past research about this. But as we can see today there are a lot of problems with those researches as well. A lot of them are being challenged today. Ketogenic and carnivore diets are on the rise and for good reason. USDA&#x27;s food pyramid is reversed. Fat, eggs and animal protein are no longer the enemy according to many new researches. I suggest you to keep up with the new research as well.<p>&gt; Taste: this is the kicker imo. If you&#x27;d asked me 15 years ago when the vegetarian alternative was a crappy pasta with tomato sauce, I&#x27;d have been more tempted to chomp my way into a steak. Nowadays? There is SO much good vegetarian food. Loads of choice, huge range of flavours and in many places it&#x27;s the vegetarian food that gets the chef&#x27;s attention, rather than falling back on the Default Meat.<p>Yes, this may be the kicker for you. For many, animal based foods are still irreplaceable. Not much point talking about this as it&#x27;s fairly subjective.')
