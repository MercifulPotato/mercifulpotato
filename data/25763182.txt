Item(by='tachyonbeam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610551862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25762778, text='The way I encounter it, identity politics is a divisive ideology, or a political tool, used to make judgements about groups of people based on external characteristics such as skin color, gender and sexual orientation, with little to no regard for the actual circumstances these people came from or currently live in.<p>For example, cis-white-males are often demonized, binned as oppressors. If you take a step back and think about it, a lot of cis-white-males were born in US states with huge meth and fentanyl addiction problems. Raised in trailer parks, in poverty, with maybe one or both parents missing and no access to education. If you paint poverty and access to education as being purely a race problem, and white males as always being oppressors, you are leaving people behind. We can&#x27;t afford to do that. We collectively pay the price, as a society, somewhere down the road.<p>With regards to &quot;live and let live&quot;, many prominent advocates of identity politics are very hostile people. They do not welcome discussion, they do not want your input. Either you have the same opinion as them, or you are an alt-right, a bad person. The correct opinion has been decided once and for all by social justice academics, and either you&#x27;re onboard, or you&#x27;re necessarily ignorant and wrong. Kind of like George W Bush said &quot;you&#x27;re either with us, or against us&quot;.')
