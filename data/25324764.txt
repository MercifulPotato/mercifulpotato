Is UBI better than nothing? Probably quite a lot. Better than a JG? No, I don&#x27;t think so.<p>This story very much demonstrates that giving people jobs helping the community rather than just money <i>is</i> a better option. They were both productive <i>and</i> happier. So much so that they didn&#x27;t want to stop.<p>I&#x27;m sure the nature of the job probably had something to do with it.
