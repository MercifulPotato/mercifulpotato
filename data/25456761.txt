You like <i>watching</i> the characters, but you don&#x27;t <i>like</i> them. You wouldn&#x27;t want to spend time with them. That means you&#x27;re never rooting for Jerry to find a satisfying relationship, Kramer to finally succeed in a scheme, Elaine to finally leave the group or George to find fulfillment in <i>anything</i>. Rather than making the reversion to status quo painful, it becomes funny and cathartic. The fun basically becomes watching them be and make each other miserable.')
