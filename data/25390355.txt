Item(by='notacoward', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607717635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388461, text='&gt; an industry&#x27;s version of &#x27;ranking&#x27;<p>Citation needed. &quot;Ranking&quot; in plain English is practically synonymous with sorting, and it&#x27;s no different in computing, unless you&#x27;re in some <i>very specialized</i> pocket where they&#x27;ve twisted it. The difference is that it&#x27;s possible to show different posts first <i>within the same set</i> and IMO that&#x27;s not particularly problematic. What&#x27;s problematic is when Facebook <i>selects a different set</i>. Those posts I didn&#x27;t ask for shouldn&#x27;t just be at the bottom of the list; they shouldn&#x27;t be on it.<p>In an infinite-scroll world these phases do get interleaved a bit. Query, sort, show top N, repeat. Some posts might get dropped in the &quot;show top N&quot; part, but the point is that those posts I didn&#x27;t ask for should never even have come back from the first query. In SQL terms, it&#x27;s the WHERE that&#x27;s broken, not the ORDER BY or LIMIT. (Yes, I know it&#x27;s not SQL. I could tell you exactly what it is, but I&#x27;m still bound by a legal document that says I shouldn&#x27;t.) It&#x27;s really not that subtle or unusual a distinction, and I&#x27;m sure most people understood it. Why are you so invested in a weird definition?')
