Could be a ton of reasons why people are lagging behind when they are younger but be able to catch up when they are adults. Judging people based on how you think they might have been when they were younger feels... Not fair. Judge them based on their current knowledge and person instead.<p>&gt; inability to master the native tongue shows a lack of education<p>I think you&#x27;re reading too much into it. Education has nothing to do with native tongue. People forget language.<p>I myself speak my native tongue a lot worse now when I lived outside the country I was born in a couple of years. Does this mean I lack education? No! I do lack any education, but that&#x27;s not the reason my native tongue is getting worse every passing year.')
