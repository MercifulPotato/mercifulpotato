Item(by='rsync', descendants=None, kids=[24961819], score=None, time=1604255523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960207, text='&quot;It would be interesting if we could make a youtube-dl that dynamically fetched the latest working version ...&quot;<p>I think a better strategy would be to separate the youtube-dl core &quot;engine&quot; from the set of rules&#x2F;exceptions&#x2F;offsets that it uses to iterate and download the media.<p>So the core youtube-dl could not download anything (or, perhaps, only a simple file at a static URL) and you would add a set of rules, or specs, that give it the ability to download from youtube or vimeo or whatever.<p>Then you would not worry about blocking youtube-dl or having it barred from github, etc. and all of the &quot;rules&quot; could be simply shared, or published, as simple text via pastebin or email or whatever.')
