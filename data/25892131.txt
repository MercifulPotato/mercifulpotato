That accounts for 1&#x2F;2 of your productivity, just so that governments can have a monopoly on their currencies.<p>Not to say that managing fiat money is tremendously wasteful. Credit cards alone take 3% of every transaction on fees that barely make sense. Banks charge ridiculous taxes on pretty much everything they do, and don&#x27;t even guarantee your money can be withdrawn.<p>Gold and silver on a per unit-of-value basis require more energy to mine than Bitcoin.<p>When you compound all of that, you&#x27;ll realize that Bitcoin energy expenditures are overall not so much of a big deal.<p>But if they are a big deal for you, at least be consistent and go after gold and silver mining, to start with, and do fight against governments&#x27; monopolies on currencies, as those are a lot less &quot;green&quot; and more widespread than Bitcoin.<p>Additionally, you can come up with new blockchain technologies that don&#x27;t require PoW, and&#x2F;or support the existing ones that don&#x27;t require PoW by parking your money on them. You can also short Bitcoin in a futures market in order to protest against it.')
