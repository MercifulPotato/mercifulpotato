It looks great though just the way it is out of the box, I don&#x27;t know the difference either.<p>This was Samsung I think who launched a phone, bragged about it&#x27;s resolution, then shipped it with that resolution disabled so they users would get better battery life out the door. Terribly user-unfriendly and a horrible example since users who buy a high end smartphone would expect the phone ship with it&#x27;s advertised resolution enabled.<p>&gt; Apple dealt them this card - you&#x27;re blaming people for not knowing that a single vendor has introduced a new (image) format by default which really...<p>IMO if you are passing out blame, look squarely at the developers of the web app who failed to create a standards compliant site. If your service is only capable of receiving specific mime types, you specify it on the input element. `accept=&quot;image&#x2F;png, image&#x2F;jpeg&quot;` If you fail to do so, you will get arbitrary, random file types. If this were a desktop computer, a student might have sent photoshop images or TIFFs. If they&#x27;d specified what file formats their web app accepted, the iPhone would have sent JPGs.')
