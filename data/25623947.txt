T&#x27;would be nice if the Apple Silicon MacBook Pro had it. There&#x27;s not much of a reason to pay for the Pro over the Air. But like Linus, I&#x27;m going to blame Intel for this situation in the market. Maybe Apple will strike out on its own with Apple Silicon but since their dominant use case is phones, I&#x27;ll not hold my breath.')
