Item(by='ratww', descendants=None, kids=[25030835], score=None, time=1604886286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030143, text='<i>&gt; use banking apps</i><p>Coming from a country where at some point the only way to have internet banking was to install an impossible-to-uninstall rootkit in my own machine that fucked up accessibility, messed up Steam and made it impossible for me from using competitors (because they needed incompatible rootkits), iOS being the way it is makes <i>a lot</i> of sense.<p>I once had to spend a whole weekend untangling the mess made by one of these rootkits in my father&#x27;s computer. I remember it screwed with his ability to use third-party USB digital signing dongles, which he needed for his company to operate. The bank&#x27;s rootkit basically prevented him from conducting business, and since he needed both bank and emitting digital receipts, the only solution was creating another partition.<p>I&#x27;m not even expecting security at this point, I just want to use the damn thing without some asshole bank developer ruining it forever (or until I reformat the machine).')
