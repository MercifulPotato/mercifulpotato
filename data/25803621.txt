If we give up gun rights, or any of our other major rights, we would be taking a big step towards losing our edge and being more like any other modern western democracy.<p>I think that is a big reason why many Americans intuitively oppose some of the positive rights that have proven popular in other countries. That includes even a positive right to privacy against other citizens, e.g., the GDPR--which in practice ends up being more of a restriction on individual freedom than a protection of it.')
