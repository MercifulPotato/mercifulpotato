Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607638596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373259, text='&gt; it should be good for France and bad for Germany<p>the permanent triangulation between France, Germany, and the UK in itself was harmful to the EU. It&#x27;s always been a problem for us (speaking as a German citizen) that we were torn between pro-integration and sovereignty.<p>At the end of the day the EU can only work if France and Germany, realistically being by far the two dominant countries in the union, have a clear, common vision rather than obstructing the institutions. With the UK out of the window I actually see this lack of choice as positive, because it finally forces resolution of the question where the EU should go.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is, nothing that is bad for France and good for Germany or vice versa is good for either one of us in the long run.')
