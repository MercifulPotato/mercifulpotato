I might if I had small-ish kids, maybe.<p>As an adult, I would be wary of a service like that, and it would be outside of my comfort level.<p>I&#x27;d need assurances that the other parties who I trust today but maybe shouldn&#x27;t (or don&#x27;t trust tomorrow) won&#x27;t be able to snoop on me, neither my current location nor historical locations the app may have collected, without my knowledge.<p>I could imagine something like a scheme where the data is double-encrypted. An outer layer of encryption where the key is known only by either the app or the server, and only revealed when the other party requests it, thus leaving an auditable action. The inner layer of encryption would still ensure that only the trusted parties could perform the final decryption step, or something like that. I am just spitballing here and this is surely not a finished, well-thought-out scheme.')
