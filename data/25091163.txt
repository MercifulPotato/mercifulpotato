As more machines get out there, this should start to fix itself. For Python and JS, I don&#x27;t foresee an issue with the projects that would prevent this. It&#x27;s then an issue of who manages the project and if they want to do it or someone else forking it and providing arm builds. Not a big issue IMO. It&#x27;s a fairly easy thing to do.<p>Anecdote, switching back to Linux, I&#x27;ve toyed with it recently and... it&#x27;s not as frictionless (which sucks).<p>I run a bit of Linux infrastructure and I&#x27;m on servers all the time. But on laptops, I don&#x27;t know why, I kept having issues. I went in knowing I won&#x27;t have the integration and whatnot, but I still had some issues.<p>I ran it on extra, older, Apple hardware I have. Not sure if that might be why and newer or more compatible hardware would work better.')
