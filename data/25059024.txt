The relevance on the parts pricing here is to point out that Apple is being extremely abusive in their pricing to their customers.<p>Many laptops now have soldered RAM, but other vendors have not chosen to do what Apple has done. In HP&#x27;s premium laptop (Spectre x360 13t), adding 8GB of RAM is a +$70 option. For reference, an 8GB DDR4 SODIMM at retail pricing is about $30.<p>Also, AFAIK, no other major laptop or mini-desktop manufacturer uses soldered storage like Apple does, so in this case, the retail cost for storage is even more relevant.<p>These are commodity parts, so there&#x27;s not any R&amp;D to recoup - this is just profiteering on Apple&#x27;s part. Especially for the Mac Mini, where there&#x27;s not the same space constraints, the lack of storage upgradability is also a rather egregious form of forced obsolescence. Fine from a business perspective, but hypocritical for a company that claims to care about the environment.')
