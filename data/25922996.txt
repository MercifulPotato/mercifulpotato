As a maintainer of a project with more moderate user base, it&#x27;s a mix. I have a lot of interactions with contributors that are very rewarding to me, and also add genuine technical value. On the other hand, there are also a lot of contributions that are more of like &quot;support requests&quot;, where I feel like I need to respond to them because it&#x27;s my responsibility.<p>I would guess that the bigger a project&#x27;s user base gets, the greater the proportion of interactions that are more like makers-and-fans.')
