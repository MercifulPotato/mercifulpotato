If you live on your own, a VR headset becomes just the opposite - you go from being isolated to being in a room full of people. Those people can be on the opposite side of the world, but you&#x27;re carrying on a conversation and playing mini-golf with them.<p>Or for local play, there are one-vs-many party games where one player wears a headset and interacts with a group of people in the same room who aren&#x27;t in VR.<p><i>Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes</i> is a great example of this where the other players are referring to a paper manual to help you defuse a bomb. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hqelfBKuiic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hqelfBKuiic</a><p>There&#x27;s <i>Acron: Attack of the Squirrels</i> where one person has a headset and other people play against them as the squirrels with their phones. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LP29BxhvHfc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LP29BxhvHfc</a><p>Or <i>Davigo</i>, maybe a less social one because it&#x27;s VR vs PCs and not likely to be in one room, where the VR player is a giant trying to swat at the tiny humans who are playing a 3rd person game where they team up and throw bombs at the giant. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HL7a63MMx6Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HL7a63MMx6Q</a><p>Even if you don&#x27;t have a game where other people can be involved, you can still cast the headset view to TVs and tablets. It can be plenty of fun to pass a single headset around taking turns in Beat Saber if everyone else can see what&#x27;s happening.<p>I&#x27;m guessing none of that was the case in 1995, so I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to stick to a 25 year old judgement of what the technology can do.')
