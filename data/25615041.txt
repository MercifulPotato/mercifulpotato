If you run a security@ mailbox at a company, you&#x27;re bound to receive hundreds of bug bounty&#x2F;responsible disclosure requests because of known software quirks or other design choices. They&#x27;ll cite precisely one CVE or HackerOne&#x2F;BugCrowd report, and then proceed to demand a huge payment for a critical security flaw.<p>I&#x27;ve seen reports that easily fail the airtight hatchway [0] tests in a variety of ways. Long cookie expiration? Report. <i>Any</i> cookie doesn&#x27;t have `Secure`, including something like `accepted_cookie_permissions`? Report. Public access to an Amazon S3 bucket used to serve downloads for an app? Report. WordPress installed? You&#x27;ll get about 5 reports for things like having the &quot;pingback&quot; feature enabled, having an API on the Internet, and more.<p>The issue is that CVEs and prior-art bug bounty payments seem &quot;authoritative&quot; and once they exist, they&#x27;re used as reference material for submitting reports like this.
