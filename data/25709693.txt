Since you chose $1 since it is the least bet, I would like to increase your options. You can now choose any real value between 0.01$ to 100$. You are free to change your answer of $1 to anything you&#x27;d like.<p>You do not need to answer the question. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that as an investor you can invest in an asset class even if you can imagine an Armageddon (crash to zero for BTC) scenario. You just have to allocate the right proportion towards the asset incorporate the volatility. Remember, the same scenario could also happen for any investment asset. The lesser the likelihood of the Armageddons the higher the allocation. You can simply reduce your asset allocation to what you perceive as the likelihood of the Armageddon scenario. I can tell you for sure that none of us can predict a scenario with a 100% probability. Given that, an allocation of 1$ or even 0.01-0.99$ is not a bad idea.<p>Oh, as far as BTC getting to zero - I can&#x27;t imagine how that can happen without every government on the planet banning it [0]. Currently, you have governments in well developed economies consider it as an ordinary tangible asset [1] and even trading them from exchanges (9th largest in Europe) [2]!<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;the-feds-balance-sheet-the-other-exponential-curve&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.visualcapitalist.com&#x2F;the-feds-balance-sheet-the-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winheller.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;banking-finance-and-insurance-law&#x2F;bitcoin-trading&#x2F;bitcoin-and-tax.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winheller.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;banking-finance-and-insurance-l...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bsdex.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bsdex.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>')
