How is the web less free, just because there is one huge social network that people like to use? Yeah we got a classic monopoly there, that just happens to use the internet for it&#x27;s business... so legally break it up if you don&#x27;t like it. I can&#x27;t ethically blame companies for trying to grow wherever they can. And I especially can&#x27;t see the connection to the internet as a technology.<p>It&#x27;s like saying roads are not free, because there are only 2-3 car brands driving on it. If that&#x27;s a problem, it&#x27;s not about the roads.')
