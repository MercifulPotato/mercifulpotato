It&#x27;s not at all surprising to me that a lot of political issues would have a &quot;thought about it, realized the problems, and trying to fix it&quot; position and a &quot;apolitical, don&#x27;t like thinking about it, don&#x27;t want to consider changes to the status quo&quot; position that end up butting heads. I don&#x27;t see how you can go from that to &quot;anyone arguing with &#x27;apolitical&#x27; people is following a religion&quot;. (Obviously there are bad variants of this scenario like where someone misidentifies a problem or misidentifies the fix, but that doesn&#x27;t seem necessarily like religious thinking either.)')
