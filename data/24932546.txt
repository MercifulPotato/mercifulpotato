We last crossed paths 6 months ago, when we shared Tara 1.0, a simple Jira alternative. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23033387" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23033387</a><p>I&#x27;m one of the creators of Tara, and with support and feedback from the community, we&#x27;ve been hard at work building this v1.5 release over 24 sprints and  500+ pull requests. Several of you asked for an improved Github sync, PRs and commits tracked in tasks, alongside a Gitlab integration. We&#x27;ve discovered from teams, just how painful Jira and Confluence can be for tracking issues, sprints and docs. Our requirements feature has also gone through a bit of a re-design, and with Gitlab, we&#x27;ve also shipped commenting, workspaces and teams.<p>As for why we&#x27;re working on this problem; we just wanted to use something fast, with minimal setup, and built-in views for Git. We just couldn&#x27;t find anything designed from the ground up for development teams.<p>Finally, Tara AI is free for teams and developers. Our free forever plan has no limits on users, tasks or workspaces. Looking forward, we&#x27;re working on predictive functionality around effort estimation, release planning and engineering analytics.<p>Thanks for reading!')
