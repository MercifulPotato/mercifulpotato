Cloud doesn&#x27;t use it yet because AWS is backwards at migrating some of their services (eg RDS). But they support IPv6 in VPCs and for ingress&#x2F;egress to the internet.<p>Effectively they run dual stack and people are starting to realize that allocating subnets in &#x2F;24 chunks is getting painful and it&#x27;s much easier to allocate in &#x2F;56 then &#x2F;60 then &#x2F;64 and that using ULAs and routing and NRDP and DNS is a much better way to do things.<p>IPv4 in the cloud is mostly people not wanting to understand more than 10&#x2F;8 and 172.16&#x2F;12 and 192.168&#x2F;16.<p>IPv6 is actually <i>easier</i> but it requires learning about a new Layer 2&#x2F;3 set of protocols. NDP is really better than arp&#x2F;bootp&#x2F;dhcp etc.<p>Use SLAAC and then mDNS and DNS-SD.<p>There was a really neat use of IPv6 on here the other day that lets you avoid the port mapping&#x2F;iptables dance in K8s by treating a node as a LAN and giving each pod its own IPv6 &quot;node area network&quot; address.
