Item(by='Daho0n', descendants=None, kids=[25775139, 25774933], score=None, time=1610621532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25774351, text='&gt;Texas is now the number 1 oil producer in the world<p>That make no sense at all. It is like stating &quot;the US make the most car tires and hence must have the most rubber trees&quot;.<p>The argument is about access to oil reserves. The US emptying its oil fields faster than anyone else is not much of an argument. Looking at how many years of oil is left in the ground at the current rate of usage the US has less than 10 years left. Kuwait has not only twice as much oil as the US it also has almost 100 years left at the current rate of usage. Combine that with Iraq&#x27;s also close to 100 years the US is in a very bad position. Had an enemy of the US 100% control of all that oil it could quickly become a problem. For example if OPEC either raised the price or stopped selling oil to the US the US war machine (and all of US society) could grind to a halt.<p>Now the biggest known oil reserves are in Venezuela. I wonder what that will do to Geo-politics....')
