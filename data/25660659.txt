It wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious (especially to brand new developers) that having all the code for even a simple CRUD web app, which you only ever expected to have a single deployment to a single server, live as pickles inside an object database that had a transactional history of edits, was inherently a bad idea.<p>A lot of interesting stuff was created that way, and integration with the facilities that were missing such as version control led directly to capabilities like versioning content in cvs and svn (since code was just another kind of content).<p>Eventually, Zope&#x27;s so-called &quot;Z-shaped learning curve&quot; hindered adoption and other Python-based web-app platforms surpassed it in popularity.')
