When I was a teenager my friends and I would film our weekend bike rides around the city – sometimes uploading them to Google Videos back when that was a thing. I remember often struggling to get the video formats to play on Windows Media Player because back then there seemed to be a lot of competing formats and WMP didn&#x27;t always support them. Just off the top of my head I remember, 3gp, mp4, avi, wmv, divx, mpg &amp; m4v. I was having trouble getting a video to play one night and a friend told me to try VLC and I haven&#x27;t looked back since.<p>VLC just works. It&#x27;s also light weight – which was import when comparing to RealPlayer and Quicktime on an early 2000s PC. The UI is also extremely clean and simple when compared to other media players (especially those in the mid-2000s).<p>Now 15 years later I&#x27;m still using VLC almost every day. It&#x27;s probably the second or third thing I&#x27;ll install on a new system. Quicktime player is pretty decent on Mac, but it doesn&#x27;t play everything and there are things it doesn&#x27;t do that I use all the time on VLC like the 100%+ volume.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how much time and many headaches VLC has saved me over the years. It&#x27;s easily one of the best pieces of open-source software ever made.')
