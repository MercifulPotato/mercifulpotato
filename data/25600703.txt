If someone had written after the Empire State Building that skyscrapers would not grow another order of magnitude in the coming century, it would have been laughed at. There were lots of popular articles about “mile high” skyscrapers then. And skyscrapers today are much better! We have counterweights at the top, glass facades, fancy designs… But they’re mostly the same heights. Even the show off Burj Kalifa is only twice the occupied height. And we don’t even have a kilometer high skyscraper yet.')
