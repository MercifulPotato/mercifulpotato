But it&#x27;s not for them. It&#x27;s for managers and stakeholders who have to report progress and who are responsible for budgets.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s for developers too.<p>As a developer I want to know what the history of work on a certain issue was, who requested it and who worked on it in the past (not just at the code level, the information for which should be in version control logs, but also at non-code levels like approval, review, etc), what the communication was with other stakeholders, etc.<p>Much of this information is useful to me to figure out who to talk to if I have some questions which the documentation or sourcecode does not answer, and also how to communicate how&#x2F;what was done on this issue.<p>This is the strength of a ticket tracking system, and that strength helps everyone.')
