In fact, I play often, and years of that have made me an at least serviceable player.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is maybe you&#x27;ll never be a 10x dev (I won&#x27;t be) and a large part could be because you don&#x27;t have the traits you mentioned -  which in my experience, definitely describes most of the 10x types I know. but hard work over time can get any person of average talent to at least a 2x or 3x dev (or basketball player). So there is no reason to beat yourself up if you aren&#x27;t Einstein. A person is competing with themselves.')
