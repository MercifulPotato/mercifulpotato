Item(by='Judgmentality', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611782265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933933, text='You could limit the amount of money you can make via lobbying.  If it was illegal to make more than $1 MM a year through lobbying, suddenly the playing field would be significantly more level.  If a corporation can pay you $1 MM and a group of citizens can pay you the same, suddenly you care more about the message than the receipt.  And the majority of ultra-rich lobbyists will do something else, because that&#x27;s not nearly enough money to interest them.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of limiting salaries in general and I do not believe this is a good solution, but I believe it&#x27;s likely to be better than the current situation.  This is just me spitballing on a whim, having put approximately 60 seconds of thought into a solution.  Hopefully people more informed will reply with better solutions or an informed explanation of what&#x27;s wrong with my idea.')
