Take a long walk by yourself, spend sometime reading in a quiet room, mediate if you enjoy it, go for a bike ride by yourself, when social spaces up again, practice going to the bar or to slowly drink a coffee by yourself, get dinner by yourself more often.<p>And to make it clear, my point isn&#x27;t &quot;be more alone&quot; but rather than &quot;being comfortable being alone helps us maintain social connections better&quot;.')
