Who is this landlord that&#x27;s only charging more for one of their units because the other units are rent controlled? If they could charge more for a unit, why wouldn&#x27;t they? Can you imagine someone who says to themselves... &quot;I could get someone to pay me $3000 a month for this unit. Thank God that rent controlled tenant moved out of one of my other unit. Now I only have to charge $2500 for this one to make ends meet. I didn&#x27;t want that extra $500 anyway.&quot;<p>Rent control is bad because over time it screws up supply and demand, and increases the the rent that the market can bear. Not because it gets in the way of the landlords&#x27; natural charitable instincts.')
