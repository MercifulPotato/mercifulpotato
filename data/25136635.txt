One of the main differences of advanced Math is that the problem gives no clues about the solution. You look at the problem, you pick one of the standard tricks from your backpack of trick, and try to hit the problem as hard as you can. Sometimes the trick solves the problem. Sometimes the trick simplifies the problem. (Sometimes it is not obvious that it is a simplification). Sometimes the trick does nothing, so you just pick another trick from your backpack of tricks...<p>If that doesn&#x27;t work, you call a friend that has another backpack full of tricks ...<p>The idea is that in a Math BS or PhD you see a lot of tricks, and get some advice about where each one can be useful. Transforming an infinite sum to a function is an standard trick. Transforming that to a differential equation is not so standard, but I&#x27;ve seen it before.<p>And sometimes no trick solves the problem, so you must invent a new trick. After a few year, if the trick is useful in other problems it will become popular and it will be added to the standard curriculum of a major in Math, or to the advanced classes for PhD, or just be a standard trick in a small niche.')
