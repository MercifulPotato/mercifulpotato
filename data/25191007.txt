A PC can be patched. Patching the router requires firmware update, which requires cooperation from the vendor (which seems unlikely given the vendor intentionally implemented the vulnerabilities in the first place).<p>Yes, Walmart should be slammed for this. It&#x27;s the Walmart&#x27;s responsibility to protect its customers by sourcing secure electronics--especially when they&#x27;re advertising the router as a Walmart exclusive. They&#x27;re explicitly aligning themselves with the vendor.<p>But Walmart won&#x27;t be slammed for this. Because the people who buy cheap routers from Walmart typically aren&#x27;t the most tech savvy bunch.')
