That puts too little blame on us.<p>Our home-grown flavor of fascism is influenced by Nazi Germany in particular but has far outpaced it by systematically co-opting and diluting any attempts to divert from the status quo. Pride parades are paid for by banks, Black Lives Matter is supported by companies with histories of racial discrimination, hell, the phrase &quot;All Cops Are Bastards&quot; was taken by Liberals to mean &quot;some cops (not your friends) are bastards (but they&#x27;re good people just forced to do some bad stuff)&quot;. The Right has convinced the populace that the Left wants to censor and restrict the people when in reality the opposite is true. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.<p>I think China is still learning to ride the bike of authoritarianism. A truly totalitarian government will seem to its people to be completely democratic.')
