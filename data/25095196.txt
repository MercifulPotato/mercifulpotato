I have a large programmable microwave with grill and convection.<p>Most often, I just preprogram microwave to 1) heat water for 4,5-5 minutes at max power to boil it, then 2) keep water hot for meal specific duration from 10 to 60 minutes at 30-40%, like in slow cooker. It works for a single meal, but I&#x27;m single, so it works for me. If microwave is not programmable, e.g. at work, then I cook at 60%, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to guess proper cooking time and get reliable result.<p>I will not publish all recipes there, of course. By a book.')
