System become unusable, quite performant after reinstall. Looks like your experience is not universal. And I can not remove user configurations <i>as I can on Linux</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Windows 10, it is not bad as consumer OS. Tray notifications gone, so good. WSL1 has limitations, should be solved in WSL2. PowerShell, OpenSSH and winget are good improvements.<p>Windows interface is changing, at least some people should like it. I feel it is getting progressively worse. That&#x27;s strange â€” I like macOS Aqua. I didn&#x27;t like brushed metal, it has gone now. I have no other explanation but blind spot of Windows users.')
