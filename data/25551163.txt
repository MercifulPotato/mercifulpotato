Best case, avg?<p>There is a very large segment of the gaming community that&#x27;s all about the 120-144hz experience these days. A lot of that is how it feels. At &quot;just&quot; 120hz that&#x27;s only 8.33 frame time. You start throwing in 20ms of input latency on top of all the rest and you&#x27;ll never get that 120hz experience.<p>It doubly won&#x27;t cut it for the PC VR crowd. Ever.<p>That&#x27;s high-end low latency experience but where things are headed and certainly noticable by non-pro gamers. But sure, it&#x27;s high-end.. Even though the PS5 supports 120hz.<p>But forgetting high end, 20ms is more than a frames time at 60hz! PC Gamer&#x27;s review of Stadia had the input lag as high as like 70ms on some titles doubling the total input latency!')
