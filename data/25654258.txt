So he consciously chose to write more simply after that.<p>In my own view, Long Sun is as good as New Sun: I don’t think the simpler prose detracts from it, it fits the tale and Silk’s personality (to say more threatens spoilers).  We see a huge yet mostly stable set of characters evolve throughout the tale.  Compare with New Sun which is mostly just Severian wandering around, having adventures and occasional encounters with characters from earlier.  They are very different stories.  After reading both series many times, Long Sun grew to be my favorite.  This could change again.<p>I agree that Fifth Head is fantastic, but when I tried to reread Peace I couldn’t get through it (it was apparently his own favorite).  And I agree with your assessment of his post-2000 novels.  I did enjoy The Sorcerer’s House and The Land Across, but neither is calling out to be read again, and their details are vague in my mind.')
