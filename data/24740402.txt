By and large, those reading this message board live lives of relative privilege. This is just some pandering feel good club-house stats. I care about depression and mental health issues in poor populations, those without the ability to get help or can readily get their Adderall prescription refilled with whatever sobfest they push to their doctor. Reports like this on already let&#x27;s just say well-to-do and privileged populations are just insulting because they are the only ones who ever get reported on in large number. This is some easy statistics post for clout rather than any concerted effort to look at the problem where it really is a problem.')
