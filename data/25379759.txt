My advice is to think about how you&#x27;ll gain users. The mobile gaming world is basically user arbitrage. You buy users (via the ads market) for X, and if you make more than X, you print money. It&#x27;s helpful to find a creative that gets clicks for cheaper than the rest of the market. Eg. if your ads have slots machines, then it costs $25 to acquire a user. If you find some niche, like cool cars in your ads, maybe you can spend a lot less to get users. I&#x27;d recommend testing your ads before even starting on coding a game, test out a few different branding concepts. Really successful mobile gaming companies have a tight loop between their ads and game development. It&#x27;s important to get quick feedback and see how new game features affect user retention and spending habits. Note, all of this costs money! Do you have a marketing budget to acquire users.<p>What not to do: spend a year coding a game in your basement, then &quot;release&quot; it and hope it grows from word of mouth. Those days are long gone.')
