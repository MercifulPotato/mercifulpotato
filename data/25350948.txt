If you&#x27;re doing open source at all, you&#x27;re losing control over what&#x27;s done with your code, including allowing it to be used by competitors and &quot;bad guys&quot; however you define that.<p>See (5) and (6) in the open source definition: no discrimination against persons or groups, and no discrimination against fields of endeavor.<p>If you&#x27;re unwilling to relinquish control, no open source license is going to be good enough. At best you might scare some risk-adverse companies away from using it, but there are still going to be a lot of people you dislike who can use your software to nefarious ends.')
