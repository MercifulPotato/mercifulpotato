Selecting &#x27;Module.Function&#x27; would execute that function in that module.<p>It used a &quot;Document Object Model&quot;, the base text class was expandable to handle more widgets than just native text.<p>Single user, single process with no real distinction between the system code and your own.\nYou could view and edit system modules and add your own.')
