That means that all the entries in Nixpkgs look alike, which in turn prevents building a &quot;package-aware&quot; or &quot;OS-aware&quot; user interface.<p>The Guix CLI &quot;knows&quot; about packages and versions, and package transformation options are an example of how the CLI can take advantage of that abstraction.<p>Likewise, the &quot;guix system&quot; command knows about services, which gives it convenient introspection capabilities such as &quot;guix system extension-graph&quot; and &quot;guix system shepherd-graph&quot;.<p>It really isn&#x27;t about parentheses vs. braces.  :-)')
