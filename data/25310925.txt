We will never <i>truly</i> know the person so we can mostly only judge him by his works and boy can he craft a divine sound. But when you apply a personal lens to your own work I have realised that it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to distance your personality from your craft so why not also Mozart?<p>In any case, a reminder to check your snobbery at the door when following classical music - the musicians and composers are usually quite ordinary people with special gifts.')
