For this to happen, somebody should start funding one (relatively) professional developer per research group. Or, at least, there should be a way to fund &quot;methodology&#x2F;development&quot; researchers&#x2F;PhD students that have some domain knowledge, but mainly focus on aspects of publishing code, data, stats methodology, maintaining it, and ensuring that others can use it.\nUnfortunately, in many fields there does not seem to be a niche for that.\nBut clearly this is a very important problem, possibly more important than funding a larger number of research ideas?')
