And create a routine, some scheduled time during the week when I work on it. Because I&#x27;m not going to figure out big things like that by just mulling them over in my head. Somebody else spent a lifetime doing that to contribute to a chapter in a textbook that we have now. If I tried to spend all my time on that I would be lucky to reach some of the same conclusions, when I could just read about them and start there.')
