I&#x27;m afraid solving a problem of that scale is outside the scope of a discussion like this!<p>However, some parts of the world are more enlightened when it comes to consumer rights. For example, the EU has at least attempted to make constructive regulatory interventions in the interests of consumers as technologies have evolved, even if their success has been mixed. Here in the UK, aside from EU rules we&#x27;re inheriting after Brexit, we too have some solid basic consumer rights laws of our own. The EU+UK market is already larger than the US one, so that&#x27;s a pretty big incentive for Tesla not to try those sorts of games around these parts. And if we get reasonable treatment, <i>maybe</i> that&#x27;s enough for customers in places like the US to demand the same standards.')
