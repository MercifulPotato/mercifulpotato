You know what else is standard issue? A <i>f$#%ing dongle</i> so you can actually plug anything into said laptop. I can&#x27;t help but think that all these folks saying, &quot;oh it&#x27;s so nice, everything I&#x27;ve ever wanted to plug in runs on USB-C&quot; represent a tiny minority of the real world.<p>The only two cables I own that can plug into my laptop connect it to:<p>1) the charger that came with it and<p>2) the aforementioned dongle<p>That&#x27;s it. And no, I&#x27;m not going to drop a bunch of cash upgrading monitors, phone cables, keyboards, and mice to get rid of the dongle. Especially when the &quot;USB-C compatible&quot; ones all cost twice as much.')
