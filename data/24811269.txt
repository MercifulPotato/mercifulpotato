That&#x27;s a huge achievement and you should be proud! It&#x27;s also great that you&#x27;ve kept on it for 2 years, and published a lot of posts.<p>So the question is why hasn&#x27;t it &quot;worked&quot; yet. There are TONS of new developers entering the field. The audience definitely exists, and they do hang out online.<p>I took Amy &amp; Alex&#x27;s 30x500 class a few years ago and it was a big factor in getting my blog + business (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daveceddia.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daveceddia.com</a>) off the ground, so my ears perked up when you mentioned Amy!<p>I think you&#x27;ve got it right that she advocates for creating a tiny infoproduct first, but the emphasis is on <i>tiny</i>, less on education. Other tiny things are icon packs, or templates, or themes, etc. Small, quick-to-create, one-time-purchase products. Goal is to learn the entire build + market + launch cycle with low risk (vs building software for 6+ months that nobody wants). Once you get your footing with all of it, you can move up bigger&#x2F;riskier products, if you want.<p>They also advocate that the content you create should deliver some kind of fix for a problem the reader has. Give the reader a <i>win</i>. Also, ideally, quickly helps the reader decide &quot;this is for me&quot;. The easiest way to do that is to make it clear you understand their struggle.<p>I think this is where some of your posts could use tweaking. The &quot;Write good commit messages&quot; article, for instance, starts with &quot;Take the time to write good commit messages.&quot; It&#x27;s advice, yes, but is it for me specifically?<p>Contrast this with a title like &quot;How to Write Better Commit Messages&quot; and opening with &quot;It&#x27;s time to commit your code, and you need a commit message. What should you say? How long should it be? Should it describe every little detail? Or is shorter better? In this letter we&#x27;ll look at some examples of bad commit messages and how to write better ones.&quot;<p>You mentioned that your email list hasn&#x27;t grown much too. It&#x27;s hard to figure out how to sign up though! There&#x27;s a small sidebar link &quot;Sign up to receive posts via email&quot; and the &quot;Subscribe to new posts&quot; header link, but the copy isn&#x27;t terribly compelling. Few people will go out of their way to click a link to sign up (as you&#x27;ve noticed!). You could probably improve signups quite a bit by writing more compelling copy and including those signup forms within the articles. I&#x27;d also remove the required field &quot;how many years have you been a dev&quot;, it&#x27;s just extra friction. Feel free to ask them that question in the welcome email though, it&#x27;d be a good way to connect.<p>Last strategy I&#x27;ll mention is that hanging out in communities with your audience is a great way to learn what they struggle with, help them where they are (with comments&#x2F;replies&#x2F;tweets&#x2F;etc), and occasionally, sometimes, share a link to something of yours if it&#x27;s relevant. Goal is to be helpful and build a reputation, not just to share stuff.<p>Happy to chat more about this stuff any time.')
