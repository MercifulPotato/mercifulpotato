Item(by='simgooder', descendants=None, kids=[24700401], score=None, time=1601994182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697341, text='The industry is absolutely inefficient when you consider what inputs required: pesticides, seed, machinery, fossil fuels for planting&#x2F;harvesting&#x2F;transport, massive government subsidies -- not to mention the depletion of the soils that come along with it. It is not even monetarily efficient: take for example the dumping of millions of gallons of milk to match quotas this past year. It&#x27;s far from efficient.<p>I would not consider something that requires so much input to be &quot;more efficient at feeding a person&quot;. It is however a system that is efficient at feeding mass amounts of people -- if you ignore the inputs.<p>We created Permapeople alongside the principles of permaculture. The efficiency you can create by designing systems that require few outside inputs is unmatched! While the output is not as far-reaching as industrial production, in the hands of enough local folks, growing in their yards, this maximized efficiency of land could technically provide a LOT of food.<p>PS: growing potatoes is probably easier than you think. One could grow potatoes with very little time and no monetary input.')
