X can&#x27;t handle independent screen scaling of two different DPIs. I have 24&quot; and 27&quot; screens and on windows I can have the 24&quot; one at 2x and the 27&quot; one at 1.5x and it &quot;just works&quot;. In X I have both at 1.5x.<p>2. Wayland supports independently scaling the two screens. Unfortunately programs that don&#x27;t support wayland run through something called XWayland, which upscales them in a crude way that makes the fonts blurry. It&#x27;s pretty much unusable because of this to have an XWayland app (this includes chrome, firefox, and emacs) running on a 4k screen in wayland, at least on KDE.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating because it&#x27;s SO CLOSE. There are WIP branches of both browsers running on wayland (but they&#x27;re not stable for me) and once those land I think everything will finally work.<p>All this said I do still use KDE on X daily as my development environment, but every time I boot back into Windows I&#x27;m frustrated again by how much better the scaling is.')
