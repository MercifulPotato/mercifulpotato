Roughly 50% is plant-based proteins, with added seasonings.</i><p>That sounds about right. Even chicken nuggets and chicken patties &quot;made from chicken&quot; are an entirely recreated textured product made from chicken slurry from a blender, soy protein, binding agents, water, and seasonings.<p>I&#x27;m not even remotely surprised they&#x27;re able to create a lab-grown &quot;chicken patty&quot;. I&#x27;m honestly not even sure what the difference would be between this and a 100% soy protein version, in terms of taste and texture?<p>This &quot;chicken burger&quot; is, of course, nothing like an actual chicken breast or thigh. There&#x27;s a reason it has to be breaded and fried, to mask the total lack of any real meat texture whatsoever.')
