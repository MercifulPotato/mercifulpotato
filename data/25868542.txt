I didn&#x27;t have the issue after maybe four or six months of using Rust in WSL1 until suddenly I did. Upgrading to WSL2 fixed the problem.<p>Publishing Rust crates does require a workaround[0] in WSL2 if it&#x27;s from a Windows directory. That&#x27;s annoying but pretty infrequent (for me) and not a difficult workaround.<p>Except for those two issues, I&#x27;ve not had any problems in either WSL version - certainly nothing that would give me pause to using either one.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8439#issuecomment-660310563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;cargo&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8439#issuecomment-...</a>')
