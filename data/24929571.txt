Europe (and the US) fought facism, so we had a period of time where politics where mostly shades of purple&#x2F;blue&#x2F;red. Now facism is on the rise again, and we&#x27;re seeing that across Europe, from Spain with Vox to Sweden with &quot;Sweden Democrats&quot;. With the rise of these parties, you&#x27;re seeing more and more of excommunication, as being tolerant of intolerance will only lead to more intolerance, not tolerance.')
