Hugo is fast, but it doesn&#x27;t do incremental builds. Once you get to the point where you&#x27;re publishing 10&#x27;s of thousands of posts, Hugo starts to get real slow (like 20 minutes to build, even after enabling template caching), so an increase in speed during build time is welcome. But once you get to 50K posts you realize that Hugo doesn&#x27;t follow Google&#x27;s convention to break your sitemap into separate files with an index map[0]. Hugo doesn&#x27;t have a handler for this and as of now I haven&#x27;t figured out how to modify the sitemap compilation process to be compliant (not like I&#x27;ve tried too hard, I&#x27;m not native with Go and the code isn&#x27;t clear to me where the sitemap is being built). If Blades would handle the sitemap issue for me without needing a plugin or modification, that would be huge for a lot of people on the Hugo community boards.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;webmasters&#x2F;answer&#x2F;183668?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;webmasters&#x2F;answer&#x2F;183668?hl=en</a>')
