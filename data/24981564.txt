That&#x27;s simply the continuation of a societal expectation that women will do the &#x27;mothering.&#x27;<p>Because that social expectation is there, it is far more often true that in a hetro marriage the wife will be the one who gives up their career path to take care of a child.  Thus the court systems has standardized on an expectation that the mother will need spousal support, and child support in a divorce, because she is the one who&#x27;ll need to retool and rejoin the workforce, while still _doing_ the parenting she did while in the marriage.<p>None of this happens in a vacuum.')
