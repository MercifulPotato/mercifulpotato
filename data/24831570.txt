I think it means more or less the same in English, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be commonly used.<p>I am French, so I cannot answer the following questions with certainty:<p>- Is the word &quot;liaison&quot; very uncommon in English?\n- Is it difficult to pronounce, spell, or remember?\n- Does it have a negative connotation?<p>If you are a native English speaker, could you please help me answer these questions?')
