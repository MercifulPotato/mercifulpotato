I do want a platform where <i>no</i> entity can control what I can install.<p>I just don’t think that world has a lot to do with Apple.<p>Apple isn’t going to build it, no matter what we do, and Apple isn’t doing anything particularly different from any other corporation that sells any good.<p>If we want a freer platform we are going to need to build it.')
