It definitely slowed down, but nowhere close to the amount of time it takes to boil water and wait for it to cool down.<p>The Katadyn Befree is my favorite right now because it&#x27;s lighter with a considerably faster flow than the Squeeze. Some reviews from thru-hikers say it clogs faster than the Squeeze but I haven&#x27;t had any issues so far. (Haven&#x27;t thru-hiked with it yet though...)')
