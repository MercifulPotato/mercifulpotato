Item(by='a3camero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608056341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432753, text='The Supreme Court of Canada in 2009 specifically recognized a defence related to defamation as being one that&#x27;s broader than &quot;journalists&quot; in the sense of employed people who work for the news media, and here&#x27;s their explanation:<p>&quot;In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test.  This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style.  However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists.  These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets.  I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is “available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium”&quot;<p>Decision: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scc-csc.lexum.com&#x2F;scc-csc&#x2F;scc-csc&#x2F;en&#x2F;item&#x2F;7837&#x2F;index.do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scc-csc.lexum.com&#x2F;scc-csc&#x2F;scc-csc&#x2F;en&#x2F;item&#x2F;7837&#x2F;index...</a><p>This explanation is an answer to the question of who&#x27;s a &quot;legitimate journalist&quot;, which is that it should be about what people are doing not who they work for. That&#x27;s an idea captured in the above case, which reviews some of the laws of other countries on this subject too. It was in the context of defamation, but it&#x27;s closely linked to your comments about accountability (since the everyday threat is lawsuits, not assault&#x2F;arrest).')
