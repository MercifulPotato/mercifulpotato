You have to consider the scale the benefits &quot;get provided at.&quot;<p>At a certain point, it costs the same to feed premium salad to 500 engineers as it does 575 engineers (no idea if this is the math, but conceptually yeah). A cook can make 600 or 700 gallons of soup without much difference or new purchases required: huge vat of soup is 2&#x2F;3 vs. 3&#x2F;4 full.<p>If the % of remote engineers hit a level such that cooks have to buy new soup bowls, idle hand cooks, or offices with cavernous empty halllways, then yeah, you&#x27;re back under diminishing costs&#x2F;eng and need to scale down.')
