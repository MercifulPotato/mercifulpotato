Whether it makes money immediately or not, is not a concern, as the business will pay for it, and absorb the initial loss. And the development costs to build the site are already in the $50,000+ range.<p>So with all this upfront expense, why don’t the business just go with EC2?<p>Unless this is for some silly hobby website of yours, that you have no clue will make any money or not.
