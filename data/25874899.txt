And I&#x27;m sure many others wouldn&#x27;t either for similar reasons.<p>Public transportation is great and I love using it when it makes sense, but in many cities it does not compete with the convenience and security of having a reliable personal vehicle.<p>The only place I felt public transportation was <i>good enough</i> to go without my own car was NYC - but I lived on a great train line that ran every few minutes reliably. I also didn&#x27;t have any dependents that I was responsible for. Many people who lived nearby used the train but still had their own cars as a backup.<p>Even with how convenient it was for shuttling myself around, using it when needing to carry anything like groceries becomes difficult, and made me wish I had a car. Especially during rush hour where sitting is almost impossible.<p>I&#x27;m all for improving public transportation, but I do not see it being a replacement for personal vehicles in every way.')
