Item(by='leftyted', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603543400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878062, text='&gt; Aristotle and Marx have zero to do with it and the way people on HN bring super old classics in completely unrelated context is getting obnoxious.<p>The Greeks are the source for a lot of our language and a lot of how we think about the world.  Marx turned much of that upside down.<p>It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t agree with the idea of &quot;intellectual heritage&quot; (or the influence of that heritage).  But I (and others) do, so clearly we&#x27;re going to talk about it.<p>It seems, uh, strange to fail to notice Marx&#x27;s influence in particular given what happened in the 20th century and what continues to happen in China.  Furthermore, the idea of the government as an instrument of violence used by the ruling class (which is so common these days, on HN too) is clearly straight out of Marx.<p>&gt; The private sphere is where the most severe abuse happens.<p>Certainly plenty of abuse happens in the private sphere.  My original post was hasty.<p>My opinion is more complicated than &quot;everyone is good in private&quot;.  It&#x27;s more like, at a certain point, &quot;publicness&quot; becomes a problem.  And things that we can do in private (like goodness, love, and hatred) do not work in public.  And yet we seem to be reaching for them anyway.')
