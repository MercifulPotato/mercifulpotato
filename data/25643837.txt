Obviously have some cash aside for this type of &quot;sabbatical&quot;.<p>Another possibility is to get someone you used to work for &quot;invest&quot; in the idea, as a sponsorship of some kind, in which they have some skin in. This can work because presumably you&#x27;re solving a problem related to your career path.<p>Another option is some seed investment from an accelerator of some kind, but your chances are really low unless you promise them a unicorn shitting gold on a platter.<p>Finally, family can help for this sort of thing, but again they have to understand that it&#x27;s throwing money down the pit 90% of the time.<p>You can also try to take on a part-time contract to sustain yourself while helping out someone else. Like a 3 day week affair, where you work the remaining 3 days on your project and take a day off. Worst case is take a mind-numbing job which doesn&#x27;t get you tired mentally, and focus your mental efforts at night on your side projects.<p>Another final idea that pops to mind is the Patreons and gofundme type options... They can work if you&#x27;re pretty on video and can sell your idea to the common people. Most of us are too shy to even fathom doing this... I would have impostor syndrome personally, then there is the constant answering to people pain...<p>A lot of us are in this boat, so don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re in it alone or crazy doing so. The reality I suspect is 90% of us go back to work to fund their night&#x2F;garage project; until we can finally live in a utopia where humanity could actually focus on advancing itself rather than spinning a wheel in a cage.')
