And to the extent that I&#x27;ve worked under shitty management, I&#x27;ve had sufficient leverage to alter my situation accordingly. When I feel as though software engineers are systemically incapable of possessing the degree of leverage so as to alter their situations to a more optimal one, within reason, then I would be willing to consider bringing forth the myriad of problems that come with collectivization in order to attempt to access additional leverage. The landscape at the present could not be described as I have.<p>So no, I haven&#x27;t proved any of your points. Nothing that you said applies to what I said.')
