So maybe going back 20 years or so and not much in the way of digital archives before about 10 years before that. Essentially nothing from BBS days, email on various proprietary systems, etc. Some shards here and there from the 1980s and a few things that were digitized prior.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s good or bad (probably a bit of both) that much of my early time online is largely gone--and I didn&#x27;t have a significant time &quot;online&quot; before I was about 20 or so.')
