Doesn&#x27;t matter when they joined.<p>I&#x27;m not rewriting history. In fact, I suggested a correction to be more accurate&#x2F;inclusive based on you clearly having an issue with my original statement. Everyone knows the US was not the only country that defeated the Nazis. I never tried to say they were. I&#x27;m not going to list every country involved when we&#x27;re discussing a current event in the context of US affairs ONLY.<p>My point still remains in my comment. If you look at the history of the US and what is has accomplished, the recent Capitol issue is not a real problem for the US or the average American family.<p>You have no problem with the parent&#x27;s post but a problem with my comment saying the US took down the Nazis and the Axis? A bunch of countries took down the Nazis. So what?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t get all sensitive if someone from Russia was talking about them taking down the Nazis as an example of them overcoming something VASTLY more concerning than their current affairs.')
