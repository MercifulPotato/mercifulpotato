Yes, that does occur naturally, and it does work to allow us to hear different frequencies of sound...<p>So, now the next question is, could we prove that a cochlea implements a Fourier Transformation?  Note that this Fourier Transform isn&#x27;t applicable to all frequencies, that is, our ears cannot hear vibrations beyond a certain high pitch, so if a Fourier Transformation could be proved, we could almost think of this as a Fourier Transformation inside of a specific range of frequencies...<p>But anyway, an interesting observation!')
