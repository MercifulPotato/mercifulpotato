I swapped that out for a PicoPSU with an external solid-state power brick and now you can’t hear it at all unless you put your ear right up next to it. (Well, the power brick that comes with the kit has a high-pitched coil whine that you can hear when it’s quiet, but it’s just an ordinary 12v supply so you can replace it with a better one if that’s a problem.)')
