You could search for topics that interest you online and contact people accordingly.<p>I cold-emailed my current lab&#x27;s P.I. and just asked for work. Search for &quot;research software engineer&quot; or &quot;scientific computing professional&quot; positions. Plenty of data engineering goes on in many fields (environmental science, climate modeling, high energy physics, physical chemistry, etc), and plenty of fields desperately need to develop an engineering culture (e.g., plant biology, my field), whatever interests you. Availability and compensation will vary by discipline.')
