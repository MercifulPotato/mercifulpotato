There are a ton of entries (though not the most I&#x27;ve seen). There is no &quot;opt out of all&quot; button. The confirmation to save the opt-outs is hidden down at the bottom of the dialog, on the opposite side from the button to accept-all. Most of the entries are marked as &quot;always active&quot;. There is this confusing &quot;object to legitimate interests&quot; button, which I have no idea what that is supposed to mean. I kind of get the idea that it&#x27;s not an actual opt-out.<p>So no, I&#x27;m closing this window and not even reading the content.<p>I thought the EU court clarified that this is not what they meant about reasonable opt-outs being required.')
