Item(by='Arnavion', descendants=None, kids=[25156671, 25156594], score=None, time=1605835274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25156354, text='&gt;then maybe that browser can ask to be added?<p>So as soon as one such webview-based browser gets added via this hypothetical petition process, what&#x27;s to stop the Evil Nasty Malware (tm) from using the same webview library? The email&#x27;s author worries about needing their webview-based browser to maintain JS engine and TLS ciphersuite equivalence with an approved browser, but that becomes trivial if the exact same webview library can be used by an approved browser and the Evil Nasty Malware.<p>It seems to me that allowing even a single webview-based browser would go against what Google is trying to do.')
