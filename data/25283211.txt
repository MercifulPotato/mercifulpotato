I have many concerns with the Pfizer vaccine<p>* 99.96% of the placebo group did not have a serious case of covid<p>* 99.25% of the placebo group did not get covid<p>* No one in the trial was deliberately inoculated - participants just lived their lives as normal.<p>* Only symptomatic participants were tested - this seems unbelievable to me - we have no idea what the actual incidence rate is because not everyone was tested<p>* Vaccines might just mask symptoms - since not everyone is getting tested, vaccine makers just have to make sure there are no symptoms. No symptoms equals no test.<p>* No trials done with two placebos - we need trials where both groups are in a placebo group. One gets a shot that gives a mild side effect and the other gives no side effect<p>* No trials done with unrelated immune boosters - we need to see how well this vaccine performs against other immune boosters. This could be a drugs or even supplements (vitamin D &amp; C and exercise).<p>* Two shots were given in a trial lasting just 4 months - 4 months is an incredibly short amount of time to know whether it will be effective long term. It also gives Pfizer two chances to boost immune<p>* Long term health consequences of vaccine - we only have 4 months of data, which is way too short of time to see any longer term consequences<p>* There is a huge incentive to provide something that masks symptoms - billions of dollars are at stake. Big pharma is one of the very last companies I would trust with a novel vaccine<p>* No coronavirus vaccine in history - many coronaviruses currently circulate, but no vaccine has even been produced for them. It seems quite coincidental that humans finally put the pieces together for our current novel strand')
