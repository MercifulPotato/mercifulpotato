I&#x27;m a 17 year old PFY invited to beta test a VR headset from a local company.  My Uncle was an investor and I was technically savvy and the target market.<p>I had a copy of Descent that supported VR, and while it was a bit of a hassle to get setup, I got it working.  The experience was incredible.  After the first use I said to myself &quot;this is the future&quot;.  I had permission to test the headset for two weeks, and I wanted my friends to see it as well.<p>So I invited them over that weekend.  And that&#x27;s where the problem set in.  When one person was using the headset, they were gone.  You couldn&#x27;t interact with them in any way.  They might as well have been in a different room.  Then I said to myself &quot;this is not the future&quot;, and haven&#x27;t touched VR since.<p>There is no amount of technology that can get over this problem.  It&#x27;s not about FOV or resolution or immersion.  It&#x27;s a social problem.  If you live alone at home, and want to plugin then great.  But if you live with someone, its distant, weird, and kinda creepy, to have the other person in a headset and unreachable.')
