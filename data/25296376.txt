Everything went well and our dog is happy. But the process of flying with our pet is absolutely horrible. First of all, our only option was to let the dog fly in cargo. Extremely expensive (5000 USD). It’s also stressful for our dog to be in the crate in a noisy environment during “check-in” at the cargo company, sending the dog through an industrial x-ray machine, didn’t seem safe at all! The dogs are really handled like any cargo package, getting picked up by forklifts and placed to wait for extended periods of time. The only alternative option for us would be to charter a private yet, then our dog can fly in the cabin. But the price is prohibitive.')
