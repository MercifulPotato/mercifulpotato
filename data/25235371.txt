I heard similar advice playing soccer: when you drink water during a game, what you usually do is drink it fast (and in a hand wavy way where the bottle is in the air). So the speed allows for more water <i>and</i> air, and thus you feel cramps. If you were to drink it slowly, which will reduce the air most likely, then you have less risk, but as a kid playing soccer, the urge to go back to the field is is too great. :)')
