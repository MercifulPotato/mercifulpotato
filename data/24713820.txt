This exploit opens the door to that, and you can install keyboard intercepts via the new System Extensions Interface. Did it yesterday myself via an update to Karibiner. Notarization can be disabled by interrupting the network pathway and you can definitely disable SIP after you capture the password. In essence, T2 is the lynchpin that prevents the defeat of other aspects of macOS security.')
