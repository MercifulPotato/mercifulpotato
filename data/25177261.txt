This isn&#x27;t because there&#x27;s a welcome committee of Japanese people shaming them out of driving; it&#x27;s because driving works less well there, and public transit much better.<p>The point isn&#x27;t to individually shame unwilling people out of their cars. The point is to make biking a real, viable transportation mode for short&#x2F;medium distance trips for most people in urban or suburban areas. It&#x27;s entirely possible to do this with the right infrastructure.<p>Once you do that, people will choose biking of their own accord, because it makes sense.')
