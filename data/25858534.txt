As a teenager, Corona SDK was a fantastic way to get into game development. Being able to use a language with simple syntax, the emulator that could instantly reload any changes, adding physics with just a few lines and then being able to deploy to iOS and Android from a single codebase made this fantastic for learning and playing around.<p>I still remember feeling super excited when Bubble Ball[0], which was made by a 14-year old using Corona SDK made it to the top of the app store!<p>I am so glad the product continues to be maintained, still seems like a great way to develop apps and games.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bubble_Ball" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bubble_Ball</a>')
