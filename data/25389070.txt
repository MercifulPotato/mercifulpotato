It&#x27;s also true for the majority of Windows laptops in the MacBook price range, I assume. I&#x27;d also assume that Hackintoshes don&#x27;t work as smoothly as you describe, which feeds right into the parent commenter&#x27;s complaint.<p>The parent commenter just has higher standards than you: either that software and hardware are relatively easily decoupled and should be, or that laptop manufacturers should competently implement the standards they claim to, or even just that he&#x27;s never worked at a company whose product was as poorly-made as almost every laptop&#x27;s compatibility software.')
