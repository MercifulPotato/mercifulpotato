The in-group is perceived as individuals with a diverse range of opinions and believes, while out-groups is generalized and seen as with no&#x2F;minimal amount of diversity in opinions.<p>A result of this is that people who incite violence in the in-group is seen as a small minority of extreme voices, while same actions will define the entirety of the out-group.  Non-violent behavior, say views about small government and lower taxes, can also be discarded since it does not fit the generalization.')
