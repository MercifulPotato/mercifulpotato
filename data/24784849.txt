Very well balanced, and cleverly piggybacks on human psychology to make gameplay surprisingly engaging and complex when you’re with the right group. It has the feeling of a really good board game, but with the mechanics of an online video game.<p>One thing I did notice, though, is that it took me about eight or nine rounds before I really started to appreciate. Until about round six I really didn’t understand what the hype was all about. It’s much more fun once you take the time to get past a surface level understanding of the game and start learning the nuances.')
