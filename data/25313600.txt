Could this be tested by forcing the machine to perform many delayed computation at once, line in a supernova ?, could it be that gravity and time measure the speed of computation of a local node?, can we design an experiment to count the number of local clusters of this machine?, is the computational power of this machine an input for the machine, i.e, it is self-regulated?\nJust nonsese.')
