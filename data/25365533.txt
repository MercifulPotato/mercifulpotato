At the time I think it started to mess with my confidence too. I had some great times on it and actually meet my future wife on it. Over all I wish I&#x27;d never tried it though. It was too good. Then after a while the nastier side of it outweighed the fun and we stopped doing it.<p>I can definitely see how it could help couples talk through their difficulties and it seems to bond people closer together.<p>As an aside I know a guy who completely fucked himself by doing mdma farvto much. It was really sad to meet him after a few years, he&#x27;d gone from happy outgoing to a paranoid mess.')
