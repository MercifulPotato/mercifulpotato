For example Britain doesn&#x27;t use them. Periodically the Parliament gets people to come in and talk about this, basically the discussion always goes like this:<p>Expert: We should probably use a secret ballot<p>Politician: Do you have any evidence we&#x27;ve used the fact that ballots aren&#x27;t secret in the modern period?<p>Expert: No, but that&#x27;s sort of the point. Courts are allowed to use this but they never do, so, just use secret ballots.<p>Politician: There are rumours that Military Intelligence uses it to find out who votes Communist and so on right?<p>Expert: Yes, there are rumours but we aren&#x27;t able to substantiate them.<p>Politician: How about you, ex-spy, can you do better?<p>Ex-spy: I have heard these rumours too.<p>Politician: So they&#x27;re true?<p>Ex-spy: Well like I said, they are rumours. I&#x27;ve never seen it personally.<p>And then the politicians decide actually maybe we&#x27;ll think about this some more before making a decision and another decade passes with the ballots still not actually secret.<p>[In England you will notice that the ballots are identical on a big pile when you arrive, but then when you show them or tell them who you are, they read out a number (a locally unique voter registration number), that number is written on a serial paper counterfoil, and the current number from the counterfoil is written to the ballot paper. This means that in principle it is possible (but laborious) to unwind parts or the entire election if you wanted to until the counterfoils are destroyed, a year later typically.]')
