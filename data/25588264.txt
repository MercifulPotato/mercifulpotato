Among others.<p>There is no trite healthy vs vulnerable tradeoff here, and it&#x27;s simply a fantasy to believe that everyone under 40 would be able to get on with life without consequences while the over-55s were dying off quietly.<p>The reality is far more complicated. Letting Covid run wild would have been far more damaging than mitigation in a huge number of ways - economic, psychological, political, medical, and more.<p>The one area of valid debate is whether good mitigation strategies were chosen and implemented wisely. Often they weren&#x27;t. Test and trace, masking, and PPE provision should have been central, allowing more limited lockdowns.<p>In the most badly hit countries none of that happened, and without them full-spectrum lockdowns were the only (blunt) tool that was left.')
