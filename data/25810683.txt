May be months before we have any reaction or statement.<p>What IS fascinating and will be very telling is to closely watch Tether issue from ‘Treasury’. Seems they have stopped as they KNOW what is in the millions of pages they delivered to AG and from now on need to be much more careful. If Tether issuance decreases, crypto prices should fall. Must also watch Tether volume per day.<p>Two scenarios:<p>1. Tether decides to go legit: mild short term crypto price fall. Tether actually has an independent audit as much promised.
