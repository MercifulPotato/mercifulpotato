There are multiple credible traced studies of transmission on planes, and there remain very few (really almost none) detailing outdoor activity of any kind.<p>As with anything else, including sitting in a restaurant or bar, any single flight is unlikely to infect you and statistically &quot;safe&quot; from the perspective of individual risk.  But air travel is absolutely spreading this disease.<p>The whole notion of treating a pandemic via the lens of individual risk (&quot;will I get sick if I do this one thing&quot;) is broken analysis, of course.  But at this point I despair of our ever being able to free ourselves of that nonsense.  It&#x27;s just too ingrained.')
