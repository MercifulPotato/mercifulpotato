You&#x27;re not arguing against Flatpak, you&#x27;re arguing against decentralized app distribution in general.<p>You are already living in a world where upstream developers can decide to distribute their software using channels that distro maintainers can&#x27;t control, update, or patch.<p>Flatpak changes nothing about that arrangement, it merely acknowledges that the problem exists and tries to make it slightly better. The alternative to Flatpak for a lot of Open Source devs isn&#x27;t an official Debian package, it&#x27;s a tar.gz file, which is just objectively worse.')
