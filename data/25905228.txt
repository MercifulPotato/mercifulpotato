Of course, the unfortunate gap is that they don&#x27;t truly understand how to use&#x2F;interpret the tools of the scientific method (e.g. they may not know how to empirically derive physics equations from experiments, or they may not understand concepts like falsibiability, or even account for blind spots in &quot;common sense&quot; such as why are tides a thing, etc)')
