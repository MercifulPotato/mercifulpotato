Item(by='rsfern', descendants=None, kids=[25262458], score=None, time=1606790133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260464, text='I’m not a protein crystallographer, but here’s my generalist take.<p>We understand the physics of e.g. X-ray diffraction pretty well, so we can fit pretty decent forward models for the x-ray data given a proposed structure. The hardest task here is getting a good enough guess at the structure to optimize the physical model, and it’s my impression that people use an iterative model refinement workflow. At least that’s how it’s done in condensed matter materials.<p>There are many sources of experimental uncertainty, like the non-ideal nature of the x-ray source and optics, and the fact that the atoms in the protein are not static but have some thermal fluctuations. so at the end of the refinement you still have some uncertainty on your model parameters (the interatomic distances for proteins I guess), but if you are careful you can calibrate these uncertainties pretty well.<p>This paper looks like a really good detailed discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4080831&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4080831&#x2F;</a>')
