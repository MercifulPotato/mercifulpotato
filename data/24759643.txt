It&#x27;s nice to be able to adjust the length of a tab, but I dislike when editors convert tabs into X number of spaces.<p>Going back and editing indentation levels usually then means turning the hidden symbols on to keep track of the number of spaces.<p>In a good editor too, you should be able to adjust the length of sections by simply adjusting tab length. Using spaces means manual refactoring should you wish to adjust the length of sections.<p>Tabs just keep everything consistent and easily managable while allowing text to be easily displayed to the user&#x27;s liking depending on their editing environment.')
