Only release something when all the facts are known! (Although coding that seems pretty difficult, and curating it seems exhausting)<p>The news cycle is absolutely toxic. People shouldn&#x27;t have 24&#x2F;7 access to the news. The pressure to create news immediately, and in turn, to read them it immediately, is harmful for everyone.<p>Plus, with very few exceptions, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you hear about it in 2 seconds or 2 weeks.<p>I hope to hear about what you&#x27;re building! Sounds great.')
