When Tesla disables functionality remotely, they don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s because the warranty ran out or because it&#x27;s unsafe now, they say they are happy to re-enable it for fresh money.<p>That&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t buy a Tesla (or any car of a manufacturer pulling the same crap) now, and if I did already buy one, would be looking into filing a class action against the company, because remotely disabling features like that that you already paid for is fraud.')
