I have found that disappointment can lead from unrealistic expectations.<p>My home wasn&#x27;t a very happy place when I was growing up. I spent most of my time hanging out with friends outside the home. It has taken me to get to 50 to truly understand the unrealistic expectations I still place on my friends.<p>I carried out an experiment about 6 months ago and stopped contacting friends. Throughout that time about 25% have been in touch. I think in a healthy way I am re-thinking the mutuality of friendship. I will invest my energies more wisely going forward.<p>So maybe you are the problem or maybe you are not. Maybe you are just hoping for a world where people are kind. Unfortunately everyone is not awesome as the modern world would have us believe. I think you should keep doing what you do well, being a business man, and not get dragged down by other people&#x27;s drama. Expect hassle in the workplace and get your lift from family and friends.')
