It&#x27;s called collaborative desktops over VNC ...<p>&gt; the differentiator between &quot;branches&quot; is not &quot;what computer does it reside on&quot; but &quot;who did it&quot;<p>So you&#x27;re into collaboration, but not on branches? I would have said branches related to specific units of functionality, streams of development or specific issues.<p>Definition of branches aside, this is the way old-style centralised VCS like CVS, Subversion actually work - and you can still use SVN if you want to ... or you can use git in that manner and never have to worry about it&#x27;s more complex details.<p>The whole point of Git is that it addresses the specific problem that once you are disconnected you de facto have a branch. Once you push to remote its more like that ideal you&#x27;re reaching for.<p>&gt; at this point it&#x27;s not git anymore, so we might as well start from scratch.<p>I&#x27;m sorry this is really quite hilarious. Go! Stop whinging and go do it!')
