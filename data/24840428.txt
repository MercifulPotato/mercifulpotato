For instance, urllib.urlopen() already existed in Python 1.4 (the oldest I could quickly find docs for), which is from 1996. Things that were useful back then (like a built-in uuencode module) no longer make much sense as part of the standard library. And mistakes in the API of a standard library are hard to fix without breaking backwards compatibility, while a third-party module can, in the worst case, be discarded and replaced by a newer one.')
