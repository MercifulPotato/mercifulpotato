That has been very quietly walked back.<p>Well considering that Trump&#x27;s attorney general William Barr shut down the investigation and is reversing Mueller&#x27;s charges that is not surprising.  So not only was there never a full investigation done but the mediocre investigation we had is being undone. We will never know the truth of Trump&#x27;s and Putin&#x27;s secret relationship until a proper investigation is done. Including Trump&#x27;s finances.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justsecurity.org&#x2F;69266&#x2F;barr-is-dismantling-charges-filed-by-mueller&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justsecurity.org&#x2F;69266&#x2F;barr-is-dismantling-charg...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;michael-flynn-doj-continues-dismantling-robert-mueller-investigation&#x2F;3095300001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;mich...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-russia-justice-department.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-russia-...</a><p>No one walked back on anything. It was simply not investigated since Republicans (especially people like Mitch McConnell) are putting party over country and not holding the president accountable.<p>DNC has many problems including mediocre security and treating candidates differently and picking favorites but that is not the topic of the discussion.<p>&gt;Every single American should demand that evidence even if they despise Trump.<p>The problem with your entire premise of demanding evidence is that it&#x27;s a red herring. This is not about producing evidence because any evidence produced you can label as fake or made up or false flag. Once evidence is provided the goal post is moved to evidence being made up or not credible. There is absolutely no benefit in the US government revealing evidence except for making Putin&#x27;s team of hackers smarter. The people who believed that Russia did it --- will continue to believe it and that people who didn&#x27;t --- well they will find new excuses for themselves.')
