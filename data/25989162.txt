Apple Store and Play Store are full of borderline or outright scam apps. Google and Facebook keep pushing literal scam or porn-baiting advertisement[0]. Every search engine is poisoned by those shitty top-X, article spamming, fake news website making searching for an answer to some question a real chore. Amazon is full of fake product and scam. Even Steam is now spammed with shitty game that are sometimes not even playable ...<p>The current states of the &quot;mainstream&quot; internet just make it way to easy to make money making the cheapest content possible or scam. And the company &#x2F; individual running those are usually in country that keep them safe from any legal repercussion so they can keep doing it over and over again. While not everything is easily fixable, a lot would be better if Google, Apple, Amazon and co would finally step in and enforce their &quot;quality control&quot;, make every app, ads, etc, go through and actual human verification process, but that would hurt there margin and it looks like they have no incentive in doing that. They usually have a monopoly or at least a duopoly, so why would they care about the cesspool that their services have become ? Its not like another company can compete with them.<p>Want to have a real quality app store ? Its not possible on Apple devices and Google make it as hard as possible. Want to compete with Youtube or Twitch ? Be ready to throw a lot of money to attract customer and creator and still fail (hello Mixer) or become a cesspool either way (hello DailyMotion, rutube, ...).<p>Sure you can try DMCA take down, copyright infringement lawsuit, ... But it will cost you a lot of time and money, which could have been put in your product, and it will be ultimately useless. By the time the request is processed or the lawsuit takes places, they will have already created 10 more clone, push 100 more scam, and other fun stuff.<p>[0] Google literally allowed a ad for a &quot;one night stand&quot; app that use a underage girl in ad: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;france&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9y8rz&#x2F;ya_til_que_moi_qui_est_d%C3%A9rang%C3%A9_par_le_fait_que&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;france&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l9y8rz&#x2F;ya_til_que_m...</a>')
