There&#x27;s PyPy of course, but people only pay attention to PyPy when it does impressive things with performance, it doesn&#x27;t get all that much &#x27;credit&#x27; for being written in RPython. If that were all it brought to the table it would be viewed as a mere curiosity.<p>Java is moving to be more self-hosted (Graal), but this can bring real advantages (fewer undetected buffer overflows inside the JVM for instance), it&#x27;s not being done just because it&#x27;s cute.<p>Compilers can of course be written in all manner of different languages, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a mistake that DMD is written in D, or that GNAT (the Ada frontend for GCC) is written in Ada, or that GHC is written in Haskell. It could serve as a useful example of a complex program written in that language, and it only requires that contributors know the language they&#x27;re compiling.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m sure a much faster TypeScript compiler could be written in OCaml or Rust, for instance.<p>In that specific instance I suspect you might be right, but this is just guesswork.')
