That&#x27;s basically every living thing on the face of the earth.<p>Make no mistake, almost every living thing that expanded its territory had a negative effect on that territory that was expanded into which will make every species &quot;invasive&quot; under your hair brained extreme technical definition.<p>Most humans can catch the drift of what I&#x27;m trying to convey though. I&#x27;ll spell it out for you because you seem to be a savant... too intelligent to understand the obvious subtleties of normal human communication.<p>Invasive species only refer to a subset of species under temporal conditions meaning the current ecosystem which the species invades has not YET adapted to the invasion. If all animals have died&#x2F;evolved and changed to accommodate for the situation the species is no longer invasive it is the status quo.<p>If what I said above isn&#x27;t part of the definition then it makes every freaking thing on the face of the earth invasive. So it&#x27;s unspoken but Obviously invasive refers to a temporal phenomenon.<p>Because your a savant too intelligent for mure mortals like me, let me give you an example why what I said above isn&#x27;t included in the wikipedia definition. Think of the word &#x27;thief.&#x27; If a child steals some candy from the store he is a thief. If the child grows up to be 50 years old and never steals anything again for the rest of his life typical humans no longer call him a thief. This means thief refers to a temporal phenomenon and most humans are able to recognize this even though webster&#x27;s dictionary doesn&#x27;t include it in the definition. We humans call this &quot;obvious.&quot;<p>But someone like you who can&#x27;t figure out what typical people find &quot;obvious&quot; must mean that your beyond human. A person of such extraordinary logic that subtleties of human language are irrelevant to you. That or your just making up logic to support some agenda, because it&#x27;s utterly clear what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>Also throwaway usernames are against the rules in HN.')
