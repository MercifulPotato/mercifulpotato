Well do you want to use the cellular&#x2F;WiFi network, GPS, or both to tell you where you are? Ok, you figured that out, now how fast do you want updates? Oh, that was more of a suggestion - what&#x27;s the fastest we can send you updates? And so on.<p>And it&#x27;s like that for almost EVERY. SINGLE. THING. Imagine someone sat down to develop a mobile API, then got bored halfway through and decided to just leave the rest as an exercise to the user. And then some other people decided to come along later and add &quot;improvements&quot; (i.e: what Apple is doing) to the mishmash of existing &quot;stuff&quot;, and you basically get Android development.<p>Yes, iOS is better, at least in my opinion. It&#x27;s hard to pin down, but you get the sense that at least they designed it for someone who actually wants to write an app.')
