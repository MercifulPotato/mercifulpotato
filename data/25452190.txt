Now I am not convinced - a simple language which fits in people&#x27;s heads, and a way of leaving comments. Yes there will be bugs that don&#x27;t get picked up at compile time - this happens in all languages - but the bugs that would be caught by a richer type system in another language tend to be the ones that are the easiest to fix.')
