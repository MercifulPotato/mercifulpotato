The fundamentals all transfer, but ramping up on an entirely different language&#x2F;stack&#x2F;toolchain, an entirely different business&#x2F;industry, and an entirely different company culture&#x2F;management&#x2F;process all at the same time can be a really big challenge, especially in more senior roles where expectations of autonomy are high.<p>But eventually you finally get over the hurdle and it starts to click. I&#x27;ve done it a few times, and each time I have to remind myself that I&#x27;ve done it before and I can get through it.<p>Fortunately, so much of being an effective senior engineer is not about programming.
