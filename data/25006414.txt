If you learn the phonemes you will know how to pronounce words, easily, train your ears to its core minimal pairs and it will help a lot.<p>The grammar is logical, there are a few exceptions per case, it&#x27;s just very different from Indo-European languages.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s very obscure but I take that for Swedish with the silver lining that learning an obscure language will be, in the worst case, a good party trick.')
