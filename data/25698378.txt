Section 230 specifically bars certain force from being appliedâ€” it doesn&#x27;t add more to the equation. Repealing it would, in practice, <i>require</i> Google and Amazon to scrutinize the content they host for you. It would be like if Target could be sued for the conversation you&#x27;re having with a friend while shopping. Like if you could be sued for someone else&#x27;s conduct on the sidewalk in front of your house (for the sake of argument, &quot;on your property, without protection&quot;).<p>The only outcome that can invite is more frequent &quot;driving in front of a cop&quot; moments, because companies would need their own cops, and need them everywhere.')
