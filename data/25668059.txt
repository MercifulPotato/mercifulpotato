Item(by='dhritzkiv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610002714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666755, text='(Canadian here) For a year or two, I didn&#x27;t have a valid† form of photo ID. I don&#x27;t drive, so I either didn&#x27;t have a license or didn&#x27;t have a learner&#x27;s license that hadn&#x27;t expired. You&#x27;d be surprised how far you can get by day-to-day without a legal photo ID. Utilities don&#x27;t require photo ID, nor does voting (you&#x27;re mailed a text-based voter registration piece of paper and just… show up and vote). It&#x27;s nice.<p>†I did have a photo provincial health card, but oddly enough, it&#x27;s legally not considered a valid government ID in many contexts. I also had a passport but I had let it expire and didn&#x27;t renew it for a while. Even when I did renew it, I would not carry my passport around with me, so it would not count as day-to-day photo ID. I have since acquired a provincial photo ID card, which looks like a license, but is a different colour and doesn&#x27;t permit you to drive (Duh!) These weren&#x27;t available til a few years ago.')
