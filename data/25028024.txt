The one negative I see to the Canadian system is that it&#x27;s true people can wait months for elective (but still very important) surgeries like joint replacements. It&#x27;s not true, as some propaganda states, that we wait months to see the doctor, can&#x27;t get prescriptions, or die in the hallways of hospitals waiting for a room. In fact we can go to any walk-in clinic when we need to see a doctor, or to any hospital when we have an emergency, and be seen without an appointment. (You can also make an appointment with your family doctor if it&#x27;s non-urgent). To me that seems far superior to having to choose from those covered by your insurance, and then sometimes being unsure of what will be the cost to you until after the fact.<p>I will agree with you that the standard of care for those with the best insurance in the US is probably better than the Canadian system. But the standard of care here is still very good, and even as someone who could afford that good insurance, I wouldn&#x27;t want to switch. Also, the US already spends more <i>public</i> money on healthcare than Canada does per capita despite not having single payer, so it appears there&#x27;s a lot of efficiency to be gained.<p>Edit: please don&#x27;t down vote my parent in disagreement. They answered my question in good faith and helped illuminate that viewpoint. Shouldn&#x27;t be punished for that.')
