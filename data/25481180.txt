Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608411824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476709, text='<i>&gt;  it&#x27;s worth noting that bureaucracies can and do take better care of people than they do themselves</i><p>I strongly, strongly disagree with this statement.<p>First, even in cases like mandatory seat belt wearing, where the benefit is obvious, the rule would be better enforced by private entities like insurance companies. Get in an accident and not wearing your seat belt? Your insurance company won&#x27;t pay your medical bills. People are more likely to respond to such incentives than to nanny state laws, however well intentioned. Also, once you&#x27;ve passed one nanny state law, it gets easier to pass more; even proponents of such laws admit that most traffic laws, for example, are just revenue sources for local police departments and have no meaningful effect on safety.<p>Second, restrictions on tobacco and alcohol sales are mostly aimed at not allowing sales to people, like minors, who are presumed not to have developed the full capacity to evaluate the consequences of their actions. They don&#x27;t stop adults from dying from lung cancer due to smoking or becoming alcoholics. People who really want to poison themselves with drugs or alcohol will find a way to do it: just look at the rising popularity of vaping. The law cannot stop people from doing it and shouldn&#x27;t try; the US should have learned that lesson with Prohibition.<p>Third, citing child protective services as an example of bureaucracy taking better care of people than people do themselves is laughable. Anyone who has had personal experience with CPS can tell you horror stories, and what statistics are available do not paint a pretty picture. Based on my own and my wife&#x27;s experiences (my wife was a social worker for 20 years), I would say that roughly 80 to 90 percent of children who are taken from their families by CPS are worse off than they would have been had they been left with their families, however imperfect those families were. I suspect most people who have had personal experience with CPS would give a similar figure.')
