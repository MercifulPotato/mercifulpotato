Most of the communities I&#x27;ve been, struggle a lot with even a small vegetable garden.<p>In other words: big words, but low outcome, with the result of having to buy the food in the end.<p>&quot;Like we might need less humongous farms producing one specific product but more smaller farms producing various products&quot;<p>So I agree on that, but also on a smaller, diverse farm, I would use at least a small tractor.<p>But here I see the advantage of autonomous electric tractors: they could be made quite small and rather have more of them.<p>But I would really not go back to horse or human drawn wheat harvesting. It is not efficient. Those who like to do so as a hobby, have plenty of opportunity, but don&#x27;t expect to feed the world with this approach.')
