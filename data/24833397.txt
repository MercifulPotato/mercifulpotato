I bought a Lexmark E232 for school and it&#x27;s been a solid printer on the rare occasion I&#x27;ve needed to use it.  The only thing I&#x27;ve had to do is apply Rubber Renue to the pickup rollers when it stops feeding paper correctly.<p>I did replace it with an HP Colour LaserJet, primarily so that I could get colour prints and not have to worry about ink drying up due to very infrequent use.')
