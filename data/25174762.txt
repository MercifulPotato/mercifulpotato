Any attempt to produce a frequentist version of a posterior distribution is either going to end up just being Bayesian inference in disguise, or be inconsistent.<p>But even if we focus just on confidence intervals and credible intervals, there needn&#x27;t be the equivalence you state.  A comment elsewhere here discusses a ridiculous confidence interval that is either the whole parameter space or the empty set.  That&#x27;s never going to be what a Bayesian credible interval gives you.')
