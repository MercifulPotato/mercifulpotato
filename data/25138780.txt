Sure it&#x27;s not much work to switch &quot;master&quot; to &quot;main&quot; (although in aggregate it&#x27;s probably a tonne of person hours), but what happens when the next trend is to be offended at &quot;blacklist&quot;, or &quot;sanity check&quot;, or any of the other thousands of words that someone is inevitably going to be offended by.<p>And once the expectation is that you change your language based on the irrationally offended minority, if you refuse to do so because it is a lot of work and makes no sense you become deamonized as some kind of sexist&#x2F;racist&#x2F;*ist.<p>I&#x27;ve seen lots of people claim that if you aren&#x27;t a part of the minority in question you have no right to say what is or isn&#x27;t offensive. I strongly disagree, some people are offended for stupid reasons, and we shouldn&#x27;t feel obligated to accommodate them. Now if a significant portion are offended then there is probably some legitimate reason behind it, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here.')
