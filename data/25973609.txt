I was expecting to read about a gamma squeeze... (people buy far out-of-the-money calls on GME (low delta), option seller is short, buys a bit of GME to get flat, more people buy &amp; price goes up, delta goes up, option seller needs to buy more stock to hedge, and you have your feedback loop going (until option is far in-the-money, delta is one, and option seller doesn&#x27;t need to buy anymore).)<p>But that never came... it was just positive feedback in perception.<p>2. It&#x27;s not &quot;usually&quot; crazier than you expect. Most everywhere, we have feedback loops that keep things stable. Demand rises, prices rise, people think, eh, too expensive, and demand and supply are in balance again. Airplane gets bumped nose-up a bit, angle of attack increases on the wing and the horizontal stabiliser creating upward forces, but everything (centre of gravity, tail volume, etc.) is carefully designed such that this results in a nose-down momentum until the plane is in equilibrium again. And I could go on.<p>That&#x27;s why it is so <i>unusual</i> when things spin out of control (nuclear bomb, anyone?).<p>3. As for GME, I trust that the forces of the market will pull it back down where it belongs soon enough.<p>EDIT: closed parenthesis')
