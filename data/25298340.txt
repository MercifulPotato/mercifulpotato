Often it was a choice between mediocre FLOSS drivers or binary blobs from 2-3 private parties... when things even had drivers at all. It&#x27;s been a while, but how many laptops lack wifi support or require proprietary drivers to work now?<p>Are the FLOSS drivers for Nvidia&#x27;s cards great now? How many years have people been hacking on that project to make them work as well as they do?<p>What people are describing as &quot;Open&quot; is actually an enormous amount of work on the part of developers and the grudging support of hardware vendors after decades of struggle.')
