Stuff breaks all the time and getting it fixed is nigh on impossible even if you happen to be a partner with contract.<p>What is claimed to be backwards compatibility is only partially true; reality is that bugs and their workarounds will exist forever.<p>As for Linux and breaking userspace, that&#x27;s the kernel interface which is stable, not the whole distribution. I really wish people would report that honestly. NT&#x27;s API is stable too. It doesn&#x27;t mean Gtk and ComCtl32 doesn&#x27;t have abhorrent stability problems and bugs in them.<p>The issue is, on all platforms, the thousands of libraries each containing hundreds of calls and data structures.')
