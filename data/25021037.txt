(I mean according to what the public would regard as law-abiding, in hiring, firing, pay, bonuses, profit sharing, etc.)<p>But in fact it is not. They look like rules and laws, but are really just legalese cover for &quot;CEO-does-whatever-he-wants&quot;.  Such as dilute your value however he pleases when a deal comes around.  I suppose in this case it&#x27;s the VC&#x27;s cover too.<p>Interesting to see the CEO complaining that he&#x27;s the one on the wrong end of the stick.')
