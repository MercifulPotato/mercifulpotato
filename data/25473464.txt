So getting a shot would have more of an effect than taking a pill, and a surgery would have more effect than a shot. Presumably getting something from an authority figure would also do more than whatever you can do yourself, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the latter would be useless. If you can find some kind of physio exercise that&#x27;s claimed to potentially help, maybe that would have a decent placebo effect, if nothing else?<p>Of course it&#x27;s likely there is <i>some</i> kind of physical explanation for your pain, just not a known one (or even knowable, with current medicine). I&#x27;m in much the same situation with hip pain.')
