If there is some work that needs to be done between parties and you don&#x27;t trust the parties involved then you can use blockchain to do the work in a trust-less setting. This is why money has been the first and most prominent use case; people are less trusting with their own money.<p>For a specific non-money potential use case of blockchain I would say identity services. For example, currently the internet runs based on implicitly trusting a set of root CAs (hundreds just counting the big ones!).  The CAs certify that a site is what it claims to be. But if the CA becomes malicious (either through intent or hack) there are limited mechanisms for combatting this.<p>If you decentralize the certification process you can have a trust-less system. This also works beyond CAs - any sort of identity management falls under the same principle: Credit scores, citizenship, etc')
