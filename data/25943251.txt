Defining a weapon &gt; {sword, wand} hierarchy, with respective properties for melee and casting, and then defining a unique weapon spellsword which is capable of both melee and casting. You could inherit from weapon, and copy &amp; paste sword&#x2F;wand code, or inherit from sword&#x2F;wand, and copy &amp; paste the other, but the hierarchy is broken.<p>Or, you could, in OO Python:<p><pre><code>  class SpellSword(Sword, Wand):\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nor, possibly even:<p><pre><code>  class Melee:\n\n  class Casting:\n\n  class Sword(Melee):\n\n  class Wand(Casting):\n\n  class SpellSword(Melee, Casting):\n</code></pre>\n&gt; So instead of representing the relationships as a tree of inheritance, you represent it as a graph of components (properties).<p>Multiple inheritance <i>also</i> represents relationships as a graph of properties.')
