There are various energy storage problems. All hydrogen (or batteries, or other storage technologies) have to do to be viable is address one or more of them.   No storage technology can solve all of then, and no single storage technology has to.<p>Hydrogen is best suited for long term and infrequently tapped energy storage.   For that use case, it is vastly superior to batteries, even if its efficiency is much lower.   And this use case has to be solved to get to a 100% renewable grid.<p>Even aside from that, realize that today 6% of all natural gas consumed in the world goes into making hydrogen, mostly for manufacture of ammonia.   So this use ALONE -- which amounts to 700 cubic kilometers of H2 (at STP) per year -- is a vast market for renewable hydrogen production.')
