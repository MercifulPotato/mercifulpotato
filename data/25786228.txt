The best you can do is to specialize per situation and leverage all the assumptions you can while being cautious not to leverage the assumptions you can’t.<p>This problem contains lots of incidental complexity and it doesn’t help that folks do the opposite of the above and add a ton of accidental complexity on top. For example, for a situation with a crossfade or morphing set of 2 buttons you should:<p>- leverage the assumption that there are only 2, and static, buttons.\n- not assume that there are only 1 button present at any time.<p>Some end up inclined to create some “reusable” abstraction on top and end up doing the opposite:\n- generalize to handling n dynamic buttons. Without realizing that some important properties of that specific situation would have been lost.\n- (usually due to the lack of experience&#x2F;focus&#x2F;interest on the problem) oversimplify and assume there’s only 1 button present at any time.')
