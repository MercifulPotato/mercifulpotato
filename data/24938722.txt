Whilst I largely agree with his views on free speech, he has repeatedly shown himself to be a petty and narcissistic man who seems to be unable to have a healthy disagreement with anyone. Once he decides someone is an enemy he seems to lose his head - his attacks on Sam Harris, who I&#x27;m by no means an acolyte of, saw him repeatedly seek to discredit Harris not through argument but by claiming Harris was &quot;radicalising&quot; people to adopt extreme right-wing views.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few people in this thread refer to his reputation to affirm his account. This is a very dangerous way to evaluate the veracity of conflicting claims. Particularly when part of his reputation is built atop Snowden&#x27;s choosing of him rather than anything he uncovered himself.<p>Having read the piece and the emails I don&#x27;t think this justifies the hysteria, I&#x27;ve had far more aggressive email exchanges at work that didn&#x27;t blow up this badly. I can see why the editors felt revisions were needed, the title was clickbaity and it read more like an angry blog post with facts interlaced with strangely personal attacks e.g.<p><i>by Thomas Rid, one of those centrists establishmentarian professors whom media outlets routinely use to provide the facade of expert approval for deranged conspiracy theories</i><p>That is certainly not what I would consider dispassionate and impartial analysis. He has a problem with this person having in the past called him a &#x27;cold war grifter&#x27;. He seems to consider any suggestions that Russia may be using internet disinformation to sow discord in the US ridiculous and conspiratorial. Which I find as naive as all the democrats who dismiss all negative stories as Russian disinformation. If the NSA had the opportunity to undermine Russia for geopolitical advantage it would, I have no doubt the GRU&#x2F;FSB would seek to capitalise on this opportunity.<p>However, I do think he has some valid general points re: Biden&#x27;s refusal to engage, as well as the criticisms of the blatantly partisan news media - that includes his sources. I just don&#x27;t think that particular piece is a good exploration of it.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not an American and I have no particular affinity for Biden or Trump.')
