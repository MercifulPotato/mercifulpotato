The test data (input&#x2F;expected output) was anyway in the Excel sheet, so why not. We did not have other software available at the time, so Excel+VBA it is.<p>That&#x27;s an upgrade on how Toshiba did testing. They did basically the same thing except it was Excel+Humans. No joke. Never saw that one with my own eyes but a coworker did. He also said they had doctors there and each doctor was responsible for X number of staff and every so often made them fill out a questionnaire of which the final question was &quot;have you thought about killing yourself lately?&quot; and if you answered yes you got a day off. Apparently people would ask for transfers to different offices where the doctor responsible for them wasn&#x27;t physically present, so they could avoid even being asked the question for fear of being made to take time off work. One of the more senior guys on the project kinda just disappeared too. Fun times.')
