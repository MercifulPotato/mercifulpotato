The original target was ridesharing companies but now with prop 22 they may actually be exempt, while the freelancers will remain the (unintended?) target. My bootstrapped non-vc funded company was literally possible only due to freelancers.<p>It is likely that prop 22 will pass because majority of people care more about ride-sharing than about freelancing. Then the popular focus will be shifted away from the problem, and freelancing will remain difficult in California in perpetuity.')
