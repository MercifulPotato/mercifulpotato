The company gets a risk premium.<p>* Does it need a bunch of specialized resources? the company needs to provide those.<p>* More subtly, is it net-new or incremental value? Providing a company with something that boosts what they already do isn&#x27;t evaluated on the incremental increase because you can&#x27;t realize them without the previous baseline.<p>There are countless factors measuring value-add, making it extremely hard to allocate back to a single cog in the machine - unless you&#x27;re a startup with very few cogs, hence they&#x27;re responsible for all value (or costs).<p>If you want to be evaluated based solely on your individual contribution, put yourself into a situation where this is possible, i.e. do it all yourself. Otherwise join the broader team and take the benefits and costs that comes with that.')
