You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”<p>“...something is wrong here, something is really wrong, can&#x27;t have happened and we fight, we fight like hell, and if you don&#x27;t fight like hell you&#x27;re not going to have a country anymore.”<p>He said that yesterday morning, right before the capitol was sacked by his supporters, at yet another one of his klan-style rallies.<p>I further consider falsely calling elections stolen, rigged, or fraudulent just because you lost, as incitement to violence. He has been doing this for two months, but he gave a preview before both the 2016 and 2020 elections that he would call any election he lost as rigged. Without elections, what else is there? Admitting and accepting defeat is one of the most central requirements of a functioning democracy.')
