Right now we can&#x27;t really do that ab initio, you have determine the activity in the lab and then look at the structure. And that allows you to potentially identify this motif in other proteins.<p>If someone produces an AI that you give a sequence and it tells you what the protein does exactly, I&#x27;d be extremely impressed. I don&#x27;t see that happening soon.<p>The specifics matter a lot here. We can often determine rough functions for subdomains by homology alone. But that really doesn&#x27;t tell you the full story, it only gives you some hints on what that protein actually does.')
