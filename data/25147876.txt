I&#x27;ve got a hackmac with an i9-9900k that needs some optimizing. It was hitting 100C frequently until I changed some overclock settings, that&#x27;s been remediated but I still haven&#x27;t had a chance to optimize it. It appears most of the tools for measuring OC settings and benchmarking are PC-only, so that requires throwing up a Windows install alongside Mac OS - which I&#x27;ve done.<p>Dual-booting required disconnecting all other hard-drives to install Windows onto a new drive. Which is a ridiculous requirement and not even related to Mac or hackintoshing, but to the Windows installers inability to install in the presence of any drives with bootable EFI partitions â€“ I think.<p>Off topic, but yeah, buy real Macs unless you have a lot of time to devote to fixing problems. Most of the time it&#x27;s flawless. Upgrading and special cases are fun.<p>I&#x27;d really like to see how the M1 compares to my current setup in my real world use.')
