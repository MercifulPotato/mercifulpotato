Get in early if you want to put in time at a soup kitchen, etc., particularly on Thanksgiving or Christmas.<p>If you are holiday shopping with the kids, you might be able to add on a little shoe box shopping. The items can be picked up at a drug store, Target, Walmart, etc. The kids can help you pick out and pack up. Then drop it off at a local shelter, church, whichever kind of group is collecting.<p>Have a great time! And don&#x27;t stress. Find something that works for you. You&#x27;re much more likely to do it again :-)')
