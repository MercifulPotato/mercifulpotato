All of the efforts at limiting speech, at least recently, have come from private, left-leaning people and organizations.  The general consensus seems to be that all speech that doesn’t endorse leftist political views is hate speech and should therefore be banned.<p>I went on Parler, which I had never heard of before last week, just to see what the big deal was.  I saw nothing endorsing violence, planning attacks, conspiracy theories, or hate speech.  I saw a modern looking Twitter clone with similar, mundane conversations.  I suppose I didn’t see much leftist banter, but that was the only real difference between it and Twitter.<p>The idea that elite liberals with monopoly power colluded to strangle a site like this, simply because a percentage of its users likely voted a different way than they did, should be offensive to all Americans, regardless of political affiliation.  It makes me fear for the future of democracy as a whole.  Democracy cannot exist without the ability to debate.')
