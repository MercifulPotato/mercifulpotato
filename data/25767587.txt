The only way I can reconcile those numbers is by adding two assumptions: first, that severity depends on initial viral dose; second, various social and weather patterns associated with summer drive lower initial viral doses. I don&#x27;t think these are implausible assumptions--in fact, I&#x27;d guess they&#x27;re true--but I would need significantly more evidence to make me think they account for many tens of millions of missed COVID cases.')
