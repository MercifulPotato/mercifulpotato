Basically everyone is trying to get a back link at any cost, to promote their product. At first it seemed like if you have more links you have valuable information. Now if you have more links, you are just good at working hard and&#x2F;or cheating. Thanks Google and Marketers for making information more junk everyday. You guys already ruined Quora with pseudo-helpful answer just to get a back link.<p>Doesn&#x27;t it ruin whole idea of finding information? I feel like bunch of people found a way how to hack Google ranking and trying to out compete each other by cheating. Google doesn&#x27;t care because they are making money out of it.')
