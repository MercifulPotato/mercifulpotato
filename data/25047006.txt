USA is all about the brain drain against other countries and that&#x27;s the way it should be for a successful nation.  Immigration has been more successful with the USA than probably any other nation.  Illegal immigration on the other hand does cause issues with schools, jobs, taxes, hospitals etc and for those with a vested stake in the area, they should be pissed about that.')
