Further, the data and accepted method is always changing. I believe living in proximity to multiple traditional societies grants perspective quite apart from the ivory tower of universities. I personally believe Diamond raises some good points for a general audience. FYI I grew up two doors down from an internationally celebrated anthropologist, have PhD anthropologist friends, and my father studied anthropology, so I am not unaccustomed to the winds of academic change in this space.<p>Also a fan of David Graeber but didn&#x27;t recommend his books due to the degree of repetition I found in them (I basically grew up in <i>Zomia</i>).<p>In short it seems we read similarly but our opinions differ.')
