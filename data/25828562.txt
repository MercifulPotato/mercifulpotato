If we were to own up and legalize it, we would be in a better position to treat it and to apply preventive measures. Plus we wouldn&#x27;t be financing the underworld. As far as I can tell, facing the hard issues, like working with the most disadvantaged people, is the only thing that makes a difference, while illegalization is about rejecting them.')
