I&#x27;ve always found Leetcode irrelevant and would rather learn how to actually build stuff.<p>So I was surprised to find that a ton of companies have actually done away with the traditional style (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;poteto&#x2F;hiring-without-whiteboards).<p>There&#x27;s a lot of advice on &quot;how to crack the coding interview&quot;, but how do you crack these kind of interviews?
