That function indicate the effects it has in the type is possibly the greatest feature Haskell has. Haskell LSP is great allowing to write and evaluate doctests in real-time.<p>Haskell can be learned in a couple of months of serious learning. If you don&#x27;t get it after 9 months you simply weren&#x27;t serious in learning it. It&#x27;s not like Haskell is harder then any other language. It&#x27;s concepts are different which makes it hard to learn. But C++ and Python are much harder to write code in then Haskell.')
