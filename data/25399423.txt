(If you need better random numbers, you also have no need to read this.)<p>You can get similar quality from hashing the low bits of a mic input.<p>Hashing already-connected noise is actually better than resistor or diode noise, that is tricky to get right -- although feeding output of one of those through a good hash forgives a lot of bias.')
