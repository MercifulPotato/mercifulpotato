You choose the right tool because it it the right tool.<p>&gt;&quot;The second is to do with the JS tech battlefield - you pick React because it won the front-end popularity fight&quot;<p>If we always pick &quot;most popular&quot; there will be only one left.<p>&gt;&quot;you can hire React developers, and you can hire them knowing they will want to stay React developers etc.&quot;<p>I guess some big companies might hire narrow scope developers (and throw those away when they the size of tool they were using changed from 9mm to 10mm). Me being more down to Earth I prefer to look at the resume and list of accomplished projects and hire persons who are creative and do not get fixated on a single thing.<p>&gt;&quot;Also you might pick React for your own CV!&quot;<p>Sorry, no ;) I pick projects for money and being interesting. Using XYZ language&#x2F;framework does not come as a reason into that picture for me.')
