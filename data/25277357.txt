We are both sleeping better -- a <i>lot</i> better. I find myself wanting to recommend it to everyone I know who has trouble sleeping, but it&#x27;s quite tricky (maybe even impossible) to talk about quitting TV without coming off as horribly snobbish&#x2F;elitist.<p>Edit: the very negative reactions so far in this thread are an example of what I mean. But I do get it, since prior to quitting myself, hearing something like this probably would&#x27;ve pissed me off.')
