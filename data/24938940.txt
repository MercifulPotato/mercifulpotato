The doctored emails are the ones alleging malfeasance. To accept that Biden owns the computer is to accept that he flew all the way across the country to hand deliver his laptop to a blind technician who miraculously recognized him.<p>&gt; We are actually, as of tonight, at the point where anonymous Justice Department sources are alleging that the Bidenâ€™s have been and continues to be under investigation for money laundering since 2019.<p>Yes, anonymous sources. The funny thing about these anonymous sources is that, you see, they&#x27;re anonymous. Which means they could be anyone and, let&#x27;s face it, they probably are anyone, even an anyone unrelated to the Justice Department.<p>&gt; We are about a week past the point where people were falsely claiming this was disinformation, and several days past the point of any credible claim that the emails are not authentic.<p>No one outside of the alt-right media is claiming any authenticity for this &quot;scandal&quot;. Even Fox News is like &quot;Nah-uh. Nope. This is fishy as hell, and I once ate a whole fish stinking and raw!&quot;')
