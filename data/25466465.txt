You saved lots of developer time with IDE, then Kotlin language. I use Golang, Python and Database IDEs, and they are really nice and time saving, can&#x27;t imagine how much time you guys saved to Java developers where everything is reflection based annotations and deep level of abstract class&#x2F;interface implementations. (last time when I worked with Java in VSCode, it was almost useless for autocomplete, because too many things rely on annotation based code generation)')
