However it&#x27;s not hopeless - we already have a system to serve them. It&#x27;s the culture of monogamous relationships and marriage. That removes the most attractive men from the dating pool, leaving the remaining women available for the less attractive men. If we didn&#x27;t have that, we&#x27;d probably instead have a lot of polygamy with most men missing out entirely and most women sharing a partner.
