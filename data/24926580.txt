The only thing I&#x27;m aware of is Ember Data but Ember is apparently not cool anymore, and I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable replacement.<p>I&#x27;m asking because in all the projects I&#x27;ve been involved with, consuming the backend API always felt like a mess with lots of reinventing the wheel (poorly) and duplication of code. I can&#x27;t believe in 2020 there&#x27;s not some kind of library I can call that will give me my backend resources as JSON and transparently handle all the caching, pagination, error handling (translate error responses to exceptions), etc and people have to do all this by hand when calling something like Axios.<p>In contrast, Django REST Framework handles all that boilerplate for me and allows me to jump right into writing the business logic.')
