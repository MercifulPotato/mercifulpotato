Advances in AI, regardless of whether machines &quot;surpass&quot; or even come close to human intelligence, will be exploited by a few against the many. It will further exacerbate power imbalance and it is already happening.<p>Forget about whether machines get &quot;agency&quot;. Humans, in many cases, don&#x27;t have agency or are rapidly losing it. They are losing it to other humans which are gaining power, financially, politically and perhaps now computationally. That&#x27;s disturbing and it&#x27;s part of what Jaron Lanier has been warning about for quite a while now.')
