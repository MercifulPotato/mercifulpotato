I think it&#x27;s an interesting technology stack with some excellent use cases (and a fair amount of hype).<p>I also use Wordpress for serveral small&#x2F;mid sized personal and F&amp;F blogs.<p>I don&#x27;t think comparing the comment options in Wordpress to the comment options in Jamstack applications is fair. Wordpress is a complete CRM designed for blogs&#x2F;modular websites. The Jamstack is a design pattern; it&#x27;s not supposed to include the kitchen sink.<p>Like @qeternity mentioned, the A in Jamstack stands for APIs. The author only mentioned the ability to hosts comments in Wordpress (or another CRM). Why not roll your own comment system? Sure, that&#x27;s extra work, but it&#x27;s also very doable if you&#x27;re building a Jamstack application (again, it&#x27;s not a one-click solution -- Wordpress already exists for that).<p>&gt; As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it. I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community!<p>I don&#x27;t have a &quot;free&quot; solution for you. But you could use a storage option like Dynamo DB, create an AWS Lambda endpoing (with API gateway) to add&#x2F;get comments, and return them as JSON to your Jamstack application. Boom. A comments system. Pricewise, it shouldn&#x27;t go over the AWS free tier for Lambda. I could literally spin this up in an afternoon -- let&#x27;s do it this weekend if you&#x27;re in.')
