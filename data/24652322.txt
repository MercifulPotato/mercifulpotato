If you make something that breaks the expectation it should be your fault. A connector is a connector, a cable it a cable. If they all physically fit it should just work, and whoever broke that should be legally at fault. Now I will admit that cables break, and connectors wear out, both of which are not the fault of the manufacture. However it should just work.<p>Note that if you connect two usb-6 devices with a usb-5 cable (Intentionally using standards that don&#x27;t exist yet) is may drop back to working like usb-5.  If you connect a usb-5 device to a usb-6 device it should all just work - to the limits of usb-5 of course.')
