One stock can be shorted multiple times which is what causes the SI% to be over 100%. A lends to B, B sells to C, C lends to D and so forth. Two shorters (B,D) but only 1 original stock.<p>And Robinhoods closure of the trade seems reasonable in retrospect as well. If the clearing house required a higher collateral to clear trades on those tickers due to their volatility and RH did not have the liquidity to provide it then blocking the purchase of those tickers seems fair.<p>I can&#x27;t really see anything illegal about the actions of the traders or the brokerages like Robinhood and Webull.')
