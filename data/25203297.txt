For example, I recently spent three full days on writing code without running it at all — I just made sure it compiled as I went along. Afterwards when it was time to run it, there were a few mistakes not caught by the compiler, but I was able to fix all of them in 30 minutes.<p>That program has been running in production without any issues since then. We use PHP for most other projects at work. I can assure you that this kind of thing is not possible with PHP.<p>So in short, Rust forces me to think about every edge case and error path, so I can feel confident that my code really works, even in the face of obscure situations.<p>In fact, this is also the first line in the AWS article in question:<p>&gt; One of the most exciting things about the Rust programming language is that it makes infrastructure incredibly boring. That’s not a bad thing, in this case.<p>The only language I&#x27;ve had a similar experience from is Typescript.<p>That it&#x27;s fast or uses only a little memory is just a bonus for me.')
