I used a borrowed DV camera (with a firewire interface), the 70s projector and projection screen. Ended up with decent 480p quality. Used some ancient Linux&#x2F;GTK-based editing tool to do the cutting. Ended up with what is now a 90 minute, 700 MB .mp4 file. I&#x27;m happy that I ended up keeping the audio track, recording the noise from the projector and my occassional giggles.<p>It took about 1-2 days.')
