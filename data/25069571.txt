(Value of your stock portfolio vs private equity holdings).<p>3) Some assets are not free to own. Simple example being property. It’s worth a lot but also costs a lot (taxes, Maint, ...) to own it. This is in theory valued into the asset value but really on a point in time basis. If the asset isn’t “productive” in earning income then having it on your books with those expenses just keeps eating away at funds elsewhere. Think owning a paid off rental property that doesn’t earn enough to cover its annual costs. Worth a lot in a fire sale, but terrible item to have on the books long term.<p>4) Companies can have negative goodwill on their balance sheet, especially if there are questions about the quality of the fundamental business or management team. Outsiders may say the company owns a lot of stuff but it’s so poorly managed that that that stuff isn’t worth what it’s normally worth. Yahoo had this issue where the market cap of the company was less than the stock Yahoo owned in other companies. “Yahoo the company” and its team was literally considered to be worth negative dollars.')
