Item(by='kstrauser', descendants=None, kids=[24706999], score=None, time=1602025015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702224, text='Is there any advantage at all to BCD over the int number of cents? Either approach gives exact precision but requires a marker to say how many digits to the right of the decimal. Fixed-point decimal is vastly faster for calculations. BCD requires weird carry calculations, is less memory efficient per digit stored, and requires a choice between truly awful memory density (one digit per byte) or using bitwise operations to do nibble-level addressing.<p>Actually, the more I think about it the more awful it gets. I&#x27;ll go ahead and assert that the <i>only</i> reason ever to consider BCD is for compatibility with legacy systems that use it, and even then you&#x27;d only want to use it on the edges of the codebase where the system interfaces live.')
