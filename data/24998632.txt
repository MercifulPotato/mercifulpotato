We already know how to create iron at massive scale. Various iron smelters are going green already.<p>2. This has much higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries. More similar to gasoline.<p>3. The cost of storage is very low. Capital expenses to build batteries is much higher.<p>4. You can save a lot more of money by using existing industrial infrastructure. We can convert existing coal plants and any industrial process needing heath such as concrete production to use this. This makes it possible to get a solution in quickly . Scaling up global battery production in contrast is an enormous undertaking and we must prioritize EVs over grid storage at least initially.')
