He doesn’t know the cost of life, the price of the bean, of the fish, of the flour, of the rent, of the shoes and of the medicine, all depends on political decisions. The political illiterate is so stupid that he is proud and swells his chest saying that he hates politics. The imbecile doesn’t know that, from his political ignorance is born the prostitute, the abandoned child, and the worst thieves of all, the bad politician, corrupted and flunky of the national and multinational companies.</i> --Bretolt Brecht (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;541442-the-worst-illiterate-is-the-political-illiterate-he-doesn-t-hear" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;541442-the-worst-illiterate...</a>)')
