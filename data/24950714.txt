Being eaten beforepuberty does tend to cut a genetic line short.<p>Ed: a counter example of &quot;modern&quot; evolutionary pressure would be sicle anemia&#x2F;malaria. A &quot;technological&quot; fix would be mosquito nets, relocation to a part of the world without malaria, etc.<p>Or eating koka&#x2F;coffee to stay alert on late watch.')
