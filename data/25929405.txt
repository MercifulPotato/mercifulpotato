At least social media gives me quite a bit of mental heart burn.<p>Interestingly enough, HN and reddit have both been really useful for me.  Both are much more focused AND the people there don&#x27;t gain anything by attacking me personally, only by attacking my ideas.  This has been really good because it&#x27;s allowed me to get used to communicating ideas in a way that people will understand them and getting used to people being upset at me.<p>Social media where people know who I am in real life though, has been terrible.  Like, the worst was a few different relatives who were getting &quot;offending&quot; at me because it gave them social capital with other relatives.  I had nothing to do with anything, they just wanted to look good in front of someone else by trying to make me look bad.  And I suppose that&#x27;s a good lesson to learn, but it&#x27;s not something I want to have to deal with from arbitrary many people.')
