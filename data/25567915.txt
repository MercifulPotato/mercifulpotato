Most other solutions make it hard to manage installing packages on different flavors of Linux. You can get even more fancy by using the direnv integration to have specific versions of binaries available  when entering a directory. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathiaspolligkeit.de&#x2F;dev&#x2F;exploring-nix-on-macos&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathiaspolligkeit.de&#x2F;dev&#x2F;exploring-nix-on-macos&#x2F;</a> . By checking in the nix files into your projects directory, you get really reproducible projects, because all you have to do is to checkout the project then run direnv allow and nix&#x2F;home-manager will install all tools needed to run&#x2F;build that specific projects. Different projects can use different versions of tools.')
