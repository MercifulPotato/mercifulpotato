Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605489908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103997, text='&gt; aborting in some circles is the same as murder so the &quot;ethics&quot; is a bit blurry here<p>You give those circles too much credit, it&#x27;s like the mythical flat-earthers. I don&#x27;t know anyone who feels that way and would expect only countries like saudi arabia to have problems with abortion (though I recently learned it&#x27;s also state-dependent in the USA). Probably takes some time to get the people of countries in various states of development to get used to the idea, similar to rights for black people, euthanasia, gay marriage, transgender acceptance, etc. Everyone being equal and aiming to decrease worldsuck is a process that takes time for some reason, and I don&#x27;t know of a country that has moved the other direction for a significant amount of time (heck, an unexpectedly large majority of babies around the world get vaccinations nowadays) so we&#x27;ll get there eventually.')
