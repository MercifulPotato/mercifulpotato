You can&#x27;t avoid that.<p>&gt;<i>It&#x27;s also not really a problem in and of itself. You&#x27;ll find that if cancer treatments are actually cheaper and more effective than the status quo as demonstrated by a study that a single payer state will quickly take them up.</i><p>Some people report that doing a ketogenic diet helps them control some diseases (eg diabetes). It&#x27;s been a decade since its surge in popularity. Keto doesn&#x27;t seem to always work, but it seems to work for some. Is it considered a treatment yet? Because doing a keto diet is likely to incur a higher cost - carbs are cheaper compared to protein and fats.<p>&gt;<i>Healthcare isn&#x27;t a pay-to-win game. Generally if you find a way to pay more to get better care you&#x27;re just bumping someone else down the priority list.</i><p>What do you mean? Healthcare is not a fixed pie. It&#x27;s constantly expanding in what can be treated, you can train and hire more doctors and nurses, you can make more and better equipment. If people are willing to pay enough extra for some treatment, then this can directly lead to the capacity of that treatment increasing.<p>&gt;<i>That may be acceptable in America but it&#x27;s not in much of the rest of the world.</i><p>This is exactly how it works in <i>many</i> countries. You have your public healthcare and then private healthcare, where you can skip queues.')
