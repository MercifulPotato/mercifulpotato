Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &quot;collectively bargain&quot; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &quot;better&quot;.<p>I feel like this is only half of the truth.  They also help employees increase negotiating power as a counter to employers working together to increase their negotiating power (colluding on wages).<p>&gt;The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#x27;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too.<p>If by taking some action they get a bigger slice of cake, why shouldn&#x27;t they take that action?  Our economy is built off the idea of rational actors acting in their own self interest, so doing something to get you a bigger slice of cake at a lower (or equal) price fits the expected behavior of actors in such a system.')
