How many people were killed in the protest? Aaron Danielson was ambushed and murdered by antifa Michael Reinoehl in Portland.<p>&gt;I mean, how violent could they have been.<p>The &quot;protestors&quot; were using blinding laser weapons against the police. That&#x27;s not even permitted in war, there&#x27;s a 109 nation treaty against blinding laser weapons.<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s a 22GB torrent of riot videos out there now if you need a memory refresher. The largest file in the torrent is 6.2 GB of Portland videos. Portland was months and months of violent riots and murders.')
