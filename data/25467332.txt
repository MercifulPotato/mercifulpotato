The holiday season, especially during a pandemic when millions are stuck at home, is simply a financial opportunity too good to pass up. Launching in a few months would have lost those sales, while delaying the game (again) until holiday season 2021 would have destroyed a lot of hype and anticipation. From what I’ve seen, the game is still doing well in terms of sales.<p>Tough situation, but considering the options, an understandable move. It’s a classic example of being forced to choose between two bad decisions because you failed to make an adequate plan in the first place.')
