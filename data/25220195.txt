Your example is leaving aside an entire new market to protect an existing one. That would be shortsighted.<p>Here however there is no new market which Apple is missing. Pushing the iPad, a revenue leader in the high-end tablet segment, towards the Macbook Air, a revenue leader in the high-end ultraportable segment, would only make them compete. Unless you need to prevent a competitor from making inroad in one of these markets, that&#x27;s just losing revenue.<p>As long as the iPad Pro seems to be a suffisent answer to the Surface line, Apple really has little reason to go further.')
