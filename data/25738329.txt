The law has unfortunate edge cases but I think it was well motivated.  If you tally up all the Poles who  knowingly and willingly collaborated with Nazis and compare that with the number of Poles murdered by the Nazis, I think it&#x27;s clear that calling Auschwitz a &#x27;polish camp&#x27; is monstrous.  And while the matter of Zgoda should be taken seriously, it should also be kept in context.  Less than two thousand people died at Zgoda, which is certainly a horrible crime.  But that number represents what, a few hours at Auschwitz?  It was more at Jaworzno, but still less than a single day at Auschwitz.  It is any wonder the matter of these camps was overlooked in the formulation of a law targetting neo-nazis who want to disassociate Germany from Auschwitz?<p>It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call a great law.  But I think it&#x27;s a law with a wholly reasonable motivation.')
