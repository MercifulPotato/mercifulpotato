This means if you spent 1000£ through CC rather than a debit card, the 1000£ will sit in your bank account and earn interest, also 1000£ spent on the CC would have earned you reward points that could be redeemed as a statement credit. Thus in effect by using CC, one would have spend less for the same transaction.<p>Also taking credit and closing them in time with CC could boost one&#x27;s credit score, which may be useful in the future ocassion when one requires a bank loan.<p>Is that not sane personal finance advice?')
