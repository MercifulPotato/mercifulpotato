When old and young disagree on a political issue, you assume the old are wrong? Why? Is there some fact they don&#x27;t know? Have they not thought through all the correct chains of causation, whereas you have? Of course not. They might turn out to be right. You can&#x27;t assume you&#x27;re right just because all your peers agree with you and the outsider group is wrong because that&#x27;s not the group you belong to.<p>I know a child who&#x27;s afraid of climate change. Not in a political way but afraid of drowning in high sea water or her house being destroyed by the weather or something like that. Her grandmother reassured her that it&#x27;s all blown out of proportion and people will manage to cope just fine. Who&#x27;s right - old or young? Don&#x27;t pretend you know the answer because you don&#x27;t. Nobody does.')
