AVX-512 is exciting because its use of masking simplifies edge cases (partial loads, partial stores, etc.), there are 32 wide vector registers, and really excellent shuffle&#x2F;permutation instructions (in particular, the two-input permute by var). Recent versions of GCC produce very good object code from C intrinsics<p>The goal of NN-512 is efficient neural net inference on inexpensive, CPU-only cloud instances. For example, a Skylake-X cloud compute instance costs $10 per CPU-core per month at Vultr, and the NN-512 generated code does about 18 DenseNet121 inferences per CPU-core per second (in series, not batched)<p>As AVX-512 becomes better supported by Intel and AMD chips, it becomes more attractive as an alternative to expensive GPU instances for workloads with small amounts of inference mixed with other computation')
