Item(by='SiempreViernes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605812368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25152624, text='&gt; There is also the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) coming online soon. This is phased array format, similar to VLA, and covers a similar frequency band as Arecibo (unlike VLA). I have to wonder if this factored into the calculus to let Arecibo go.<p>In some sense I&#x27;m sure it did, but the USA is not a part of the SKA collaboration, so it&#x27;s not a direct replacement.')
