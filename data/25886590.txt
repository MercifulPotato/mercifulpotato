And we have a manual approval step before bounties are paid out.<p>So the original developer would have to raise a dispute somewhere (issue, email, etc.) and I could go through the commit history to see who wrote the code originally.<p>Although I think that would be an extreme edge case. Especially with a low bounty. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the effort of ripping off another contributor.<p>And if the bounty was like $10,000. I would pay a lot more attention to the solution before sending out the money.')
