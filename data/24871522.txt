Cognitive dissonance creates undue mental stress until resolved.  If one can&#x27;t resolve it by deflating their ego, then the dissonance between reality and one&#x27;s self perception won&#x27;t allow them to stay in a position of low status for very long.  Thus they get stuck in relative peaks, unable to descend from their high position, to start fresh from a point that allows them to climb the right peak.')
