And with mostly comparable power draw and a much worse turbo story that ARM is trying to pretend is somehow a good thing.<p>Competition is great, but it&#x27;s a bit premature to claim &quot;the writing is on the wall&quot; is it not? AMD has historically made ARM CPUs in the past, they&#x27;re not rigidly stuck to x86 like Intel is, but it&#x27;s also not like x86 is in immediate danger, either.')
