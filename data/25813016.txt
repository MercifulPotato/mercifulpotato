Item(by='fabian2k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610906309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812360, text='As a very rough first filter, for papers in the area of natural sciences, check if the paper is indexed in Pubmed (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;</a>). Every legimitate peer-reviewed journal in that area is indexed there, anything that is not indexed is almost certainly a dubious journal. But you can&#x27;t use this the other way around, Pubmed still contains some journals that publish questionable stuff.<p>Beyond that you can look a bit at the impact factor of the journal, you can generally find it by just googling for the name of the journal + &quot;impact factor&quot; or on the Wikipedia page of the journal. But it is kinda hard to interpret this on its own, and it does not translate directly into credibility. A high impact factor shows that articles in that journal are cited very often, and you can assume that journals with high impact factors generally have a reasonable peer review system. But that doesn&#x27;t say much for a single paper, reputable journals can easily fail in individual cases.<p>The Pubmed check generally filters out most of the journals that would just publish anything without real review, so it&#x27;s the most useful filter in my opinion. I would not try to gauge more meaning than that from the journal and focus on the individual article.')
