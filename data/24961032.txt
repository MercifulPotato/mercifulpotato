Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604252086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24960848, text='&gt;  People at busy 4-way stops (incl. myself) tend to want to increase flow by a self-organized optimization of allowing more than one car in the intersection at a time if they don&#x27;t interfere w&#x2F;each other- such as two cars across from each other going straight or turning to opposite roads.<p>The algorithm is pretty easy (but sadly, not universal) once the intersection becomes congested, you switch from whatever you were doing to opposite sides enter the intersection simultaneously, straight and right turns exit first, left turns turn after passing the opposite traffic; then the perpindicular direction has a turn. Easy peasy, unless you live where the convention is to maintain first arrival order per entry direction, even when congested.')
