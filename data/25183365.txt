There are two more at the table (sometimes work and personal laptop are up at the same time), and one on my nightstand, and one in the kitchen for when I&#x27;m using a recipe from online or just youtubing while cooking.<p>All my old Thinkpad bricks with the gray round plug have little converter cables on &#x27;em, so they work with the modern yellow rectangular socket now. I got a new brick with the work lappy, a new one with the personal, and I think there&#x27;s one knockoff cheapie in the mix somewhere.')
