For instance, tt makes this claim:\n&quot;100% of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for early, PrEP, or PEP treatment report positive effects, the probability of this happening for an ineffective treatment is 0.002.&quot;<p>Note that the only RCT with positive results is \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.22.20040758v3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.03.22.20040758v...</a><p>Which was late, not early. Meanwhile, quickly searching through all the RCT&#x27;s listed, there&#x27;s 5 that are negative and 10 that were inconclusive (i.e. showed no benefit).<p>So there&#x27;s 15 to 1 against the effectiveness of HCQ using the highest standard of study (RCT&#x27;s), yet somehow that site attempts to represent that as 100% of &#x27;early&#x27; RCT&#x27;s showing positive results.')
