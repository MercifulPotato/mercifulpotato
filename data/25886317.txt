It wasn&#x27;t marketed as a low cost replacement for a computer, it was marketed as a low cost computer to learn and experiment with. In particular, having a raft of IO that you can hang cheap sensors, motors and all sorts of things off of and play with. Attempting that with a ThinkPad or any regular computer isn&#x27;t quite as straight forward, and is a bit of a non-starter because out of the box they don&#x27;t have these IO ports unless you go and find some external &quot;box&quot;, which adds to your $200 cost, and is likely not inexpensive.')
