It is beyond dispute that the standards used by tech companies to silence people go far beyond speech that violates the law.  Reading the TOS of any of these tech companies will confirm this.  Its rather astounding that otherwise intelligent and presumably literate people are so jarred by this statement of indisputable fact.  Unfortunately its impossible to have a thoughtful, reasoned discussion about the free speech issues raised by recent events when so many are living in denial of reality.')
