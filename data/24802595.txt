Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602867035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796552, text='&gt; Yes, here is the first google result.[1]<p>So you would have supported Twitter blocking all mentions of the Panama papers until this conviction <i>last month</i>? Or would Twitter judge ahead of time that a crime has occurred and thus permit the hacked materials to be released?<p>&gt;  In those instances, it is up to the whistleblower and journalists initially before eventually the court decides.<p>But only journalists of a certain political bent? You seem to be advocating adding Twitter, FB, and other for-profit corporations into the conversation here.<p>&gt; Assange is the one who is not on the same moral footing as those two.<p>Assange was the journalist who published Manning&#x27;s releases. This seems incoherent to me.<p>&gt; Trump&#x27;s taxes likely did reveal numerous potential crimes.<p>The NYPost article revealed the crime of crack possession. It was not so long ago that the FBI did a sting operation to get the same sort of footage they used to convict my city&#x27;s (DC) mayor. And the FBI clearly thought they had some information about a crime, which is presumably why they were subpoenaed.<p>Obviously, that&#x27;s a stupid argument - but <i>that&#x27;s the point</i>. You are just going to set up arbitrary thresholds for what is a crime and what isn&#x27;t post-facto to justify blocking what you don&#x27;t want and allowing what you want.')
