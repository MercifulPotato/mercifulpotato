The Indian Express is considered generally reliable under the news organizations guideline.<p>- The South China Morning Post: trusted.

Xinhua News Agency is the official state-run press agency of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. There is consensus that Xinhua is generally reliable for factual reporting except in areas where the government of China may have a reason to use it for propaganda or disinformation. Xinhua is also generally reliable for the views and positions of the Chinese government and its officials. For subjects where the Chinese government may be a stakeholder, the consensus is almost unanimous that Xinhua cannot be trusted to cover them accurately and dispassionately; some editors favour outright deprecation because of its lack of editorial independence.')
