I&#x27;ve frequently seen the argument made that particular censorship is within the <i>legitimate purview</i> of a private actor, while still being <i>disapproved</i> by the speaker.<p>&gt; If facebook tomorrow banned all LGBT content I have a feeling &quot;it&#x27;s a private company&quot; would not be an acceptable defense for anyone currently using it.<p>Facebook absolutely has the <i>right</i> to censor all LGBT content, and them doing so is not a cause for government intervention.<p>Facebook also absolutely <i>should not</i> censor all LGBT content, and I would condemn them and cease use of the platform if they did.')
