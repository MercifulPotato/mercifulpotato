Are you aware that there are probably thousands of examples where they&#x27;ve been arbitrarily enforced and put innocent people in prison (or even executed them)? Many of them are just a matter of common sense and yet there&#x27;s an entire apparatus around them. Does that mean they&#x27;re silly and useless?<p>I&#x27;ve never organised a conference, but people who have told me that there&#x27;s a level of craziness that most attendees or speakers aren&#x27;t exposed to. I don&#x27;t know if a code of conduct makes their job easier or not, but your glib dismissal fails to take into account that conference organisers don&#x27;t enjoy judicial immunity and enforcement of anything -- be it written in a code of conduct or just common sense -- can make them liable for damages. One way to protect yourself is with a system of due process, and some lawyers think that a written code is helpful in establishing due process while others disagree.')
