The railfreight firms I know are all semi or fully state backed.<p>As for the innovation thing, the report I quoted literally says they can&#x27;t keep up with road innovation. It doesn&#x27;t say there are no new ideas in railways ever, but, who in SBB or DB is really going to go the extra mile to fight for some cool new idea? Truck firms are far smaller and there are way more of them, so people can conceivably get ahead by doing things differently (doesn&#x27;t need to be tech innovation).')
