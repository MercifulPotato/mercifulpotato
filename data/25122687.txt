As another commented, git is born in a world where computers are mostly offline, people are highly technical, and will spend a lot of time manually crafting the messages they will send to the numerous collaborators. It is an alone-first software. What the author wants (and exactly what I want as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25002318" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25002318</a>) is the complete opposite: a system that knows it&#x27;s connected to other people, where changes are instantly propagated and easily visible, where the differentiator between &quot;branches&quot; is not &quot;what computer does it reside on&quot; but &quot;who did it&quot;. That&#x27;s the model behind GitHub, after all.<p>git is complex because it&#x27;s working with a very complicated model that is not in line with what most people expect today. As I said in my other comment it seems that fossil works with that flow, but I haven&#x27;t tried it. However what is sure is that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to ask git to become what it fundamentally is not.<p>EDIT: There might be a solution with wrappers. When you look at git-annex assistant (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-annex.branchable.com&#x2F;assistant&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-annex.branchable.com&#x2F;assistant&#x2F;</a>) you can see that the right amount of abstraction can provide something closer to what we expect... but at this point it&#x27;s not git anymore, so we might as well start from scratch.')
