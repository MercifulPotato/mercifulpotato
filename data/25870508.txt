Working in a field where engineers can create huge returns for their company and where resulting demand far outstrips supply is a far better form of security than any union could ever provide. Unions can’t realistically protect against changing work forces. Software engineering is globalizing. Unstoppably.<p>I’m not opposed to people organizing for whatever purpose they think is best. I am opposed to people being forced to pay a tithe to unions in order to work in their field.<p>I don’t see unions as making my life in software engineering better at all and, given that, I’m naturally opposed to paying 1% of my earnings to a group that I don’t think will help. If others see it differently, they’re welcome to form one; I’m not “so opposed” that I’ll picket outside their workplace to interfere with them.<p>Most engineers seeking security for their future would be much better off increasing their 401(k) deferral (or other savings) rate by 1% rather than sending that money to a union.')
