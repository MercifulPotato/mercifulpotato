A hybrid between MQ, DB, backend logic &amp; frontend logic.<p>The reduction in application logic and the increase in reliability you can get from reactive systems is insane.<p>SQL is declarative, reactive Materialize streams are declarative on a whole new level.<p>Once that tech makes it into other parts of computing like the frontend, development will be so much better, less code, less bug, a lot more fun.<p>Imagine that your react component could simply declare all the data it needs from a db, and the system will figure out all the caching and rerendering.<p>So yeah, they have awesome tech with many advantages, so I don&#x27;t get why they bad-mouth other architectures.')
