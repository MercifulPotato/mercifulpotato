A touch of security-through-obscurity can help at the margins, but you chose Blake2b, which is used by cryptocurrencies like Zcash, Siacoin, and Nano [1], and as a result there are optimized GPU algorithms (first Google result [2]) and FPGA designs (one of the top Google results [3]). Have you run the numbers on any of those?<p>The closest to any discussion of these numbers that I saw was a mention that it may take up to 20s on mobile; for comparison, the much-hated image CAPTCHA takes about 6-12s on average for native English speakers, and 7-14s for non-native speakers [4].<p>In another comment you bring up the idea of starting with a lower difficulty, and increasing it with repeated requests from the same IP address (IPv4, I assume). Unfortunately, access to unique IPv4 addresses is highly correlated with access to more compute power: laptops and desktops in developed countries are most likely to be in a household with a unique IPv4 address, whereas mobile devices on 4G internet and households in developing countries are more likely to be behind Carrier-Grade NAT [5], where thousands or millions [6] of hosts share a pool of a handful or dozens of IPv4 addresses. (The exact same concern applies to IPv6 &#x2F;64 prefixes.)<p>This means that mobile devices will face a &quot;double-jeopardy&quot;: your service will present them with higher proof-of-work difficulties because the same IPv4 address is shared by more people, and at the same time, the mobile device solves the proof-of-work slower for the same difficulty than a desktop.<p>Do you have documented anywhere on your website or GitHub how you address these concerns?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoinwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blake2b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoinwiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blake2b</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zhq1&#x2F;sgminer-blake2b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zhq1&#x2F;sgminer-blake2b</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xilinx.github.io&#x2F;Vitis_Libraries&#x2F;security&#x2F;2020.1&#x2F;guide_L1&#x2F;internals&#x2F;blake2b.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xilinx.github.io&#x2F;Vitis_Libraries&#x2F;security&#x2F;2020.1&#x2F;gui...</a><p>[4]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theory.stanford.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;jcm&#x2F;papers&#x2F;captcha-study-oakland10.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theory.stanford.edu&#x2F;people&#x2F;jcm&#x2F;papers&#x2F;captcha-study-o...</a><p>[5]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carrier-grade_NAT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carrier-grade_NAT</a><p>[6]: Yes, millions.
