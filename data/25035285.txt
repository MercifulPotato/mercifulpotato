Some in production vaccines are only against the RBD (the protein that actually latches onto ACE2). There are variants out there that have been shown to escape RBD antibodies. However, since this vaccine encodes the entire spike, there are other areas that antibodies can bind to. They stated in their press release that the vaccine elicits a Th1, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell response against both the RBD and other areas on the spike. I think this is the most promising aspect. This means it should hopefully be effective against even escape variants.')
