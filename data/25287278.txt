Or at least with a job which involved using such tables (and the names too).<p>Also, in current computing practice, one can still write programs which produce wrong results if one is not aware of the limits of the partial numerical calculations, including these named. One doesn&#x27;t have to know the names, but in some specific cases it could be needed to have separate functions calculating exactly the values of the functions named. As we start to discover again that the custom processors could calculate more with less binary digits, knowing this becomes even more important compared to the times where &quot;just use doubles&quot; was enough.')
