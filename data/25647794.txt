It even asserts that to claim otherwise is dishonest.<p>But the data isn&#x27;t so clear. Countries in South America locked down hard and early but it had no effect on the pandemic spread. And all Asian countries, without a single exception, have outperformed Europe, US, and SA by more than an order of magnitude, despite countries having responded to the crisis in different ways. How can this be?<p>I think it&#x27;s much more honest to say that we don&#x27;t have the answers. We have questions. It&#x27;s been a year, and the questions keep mounting. We don&#x27;t know why Belgium got hit hard but Germany did not. Why Slovenia didn&#x27;t have a first wave, but did get a second wave. Why did every African country do well despite limited ability to lock down or distance? Why did all of Asia do well? Why is the correlation between NPI and future infections&#x2F;hospitalizations so weak?<p>And frankly I find the combination of a mounting pile of unanswered questions one the one hand and a call for censorship of dissenting voices on the other very disturbing.')
