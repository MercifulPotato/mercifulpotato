They&#x27;re deciding what is acceptable speech for their platforms and services. And given how absolutely insane and extreme that speech became before they took action, it&#x27;s just strange to look at these companies like they&#x27;re a problem. They tolerated increasingly violent and hateful rhetoric until people literally stormed the Capitol, then took action against the worst offender that helped to plan violence against our elected officials. This isn&#x27;t some theoretical case of billionaires imposing their worldviews by banning people that we should be tremendously fearful of.')
