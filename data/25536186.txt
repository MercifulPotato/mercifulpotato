Item(by='FreshFries', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608900946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533254, text='&gt; There are companies in certain developing countries who will skirt the rules on providing consulting and auditing&#x2F;monitoring to the same company.<p>Welcome to my live :) We &#x27;hired&#x27; these experts since they came up with the lowest price offer for our certification. I have been through many certifications in the past, this was one was the most... shameful.<p>Pathetic grasp of English, IT in general and security controls specifically. We passed that in absolutely zero time, if you exclude the time spend having lunch and &#x27;discussions&#x27; about the interpretation of the requirements.<p>This was PCI BTW.<p>Next was the local healthcare certification, done by an international auditing firm. Possibly even worst. Total paper tiger exercise. Total lack of understanding of current security standards. Nice ties &amp; suits though and even better lunches to discuss (you guessed it) the interpretation of the requirements.<p>I get why these guys get the jobs: they know the right people and look the part. But boy, would it not be nice if experts could do these jobs.')
