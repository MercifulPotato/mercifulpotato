This is when Red Hat, AdoptOpenJDK, Azul and others stepped into the limelight with this LTS release time-sharing agreement.<p>It may be true majority of the governing body overseeing Java&#x27;s development is employed by Oracle... but that doesn&#x27;t make these other things true. Oracle took very deliberate, calculated steps to put Java into the hands of OpenJDK and ensure they were a major contributor - but not the sole dictator of Java&#x27;s future.<p>The reason AdoptOpenJDK, Red Hat&#x27;s OpenJDK port, Azul and others are gaining so much ground these days is directly a result of the changes Oracle consciously made. It really is one of the few surprisingly good things to come out of Oracle in the past few years - and was extremely forward thinking.')
