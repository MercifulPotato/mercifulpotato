This claim was 100% proven true by the Mueller report. Whether this actually changed the results of the election is impossible to say (I am of the opinion it was Comey&#x27;s announcement 11 days before the election which tipped a close election toward Trump). But an effort was made, and that effort was for the benefit of the Trump campaign, and was explicitly <i>supported</i> by the Trump campaign. See: Mueller report Vol I, or Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election (5 volumes).<p>In 2020, side B was (and still is) arguing that the <i>output</i> of the election (the actual vote total) was changed. This has been shown to be false by repeated recounts, audits, investigations, court cases, etc.<p>If you think these two scenarios are identical, look a little closer.')
