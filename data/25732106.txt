So if you sniffed the traffic and never loaded the website, I guess, you&#x27;d not know the actual password...but you wouldn&#x27;t need it; it as as good as for the purposes of logging in. If you did load the website, you could still determine what the plaintext password was.<p>It was really irritating, since I had to figure out what the encryption scheme of a backend app was doing (when I only had access to the frontend code, and the datastore).')
