Candidate is being interviewed for a senior position, there are three employees conducting the interview: one HR rep, one (non-technical) manager and one senior engineer.\nThe engineer supposed to help with the interview arrived late so the HR rep and manager briefed him, basically telling him the interview was going well and that they were considering hiring him unless he had any objections.<p>Going back, he asked the candidate a simple Fizz Buzz question, something like finding the largest element in an array. All hell broke loose suddenly. He was outraged and started telling them that, back in his country he was a university professor and that this was beneath him. The interview ended with the candidate arguing for 10 minutes that he shouldn&#x27;t have to do this test. If I recall, at this point the senior engineer just left the room and didn&#x27;t bother with the remaining 15 minutes of the interview.<p>Needless to say they didn&#x27;t hire him. HR was shocked as he seemed to be a great hire.<p>Fast forward a few years later, I&#x27;m the one interviewing and I systematically get great resumes who can&#x27;t implement a simple version of word count in 30 minutes.')
