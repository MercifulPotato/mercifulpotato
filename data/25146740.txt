But it also shows they don&#x27;t have to change what they&#x27;ve been doing to keep sales going.<p>I suspect when Docker gets running on M1 Macs, a lot of the need to boot into Linux will dissipate. Same thing when Linux running in a VM on Apple Silicon Macs is <i>much</i> faster than any comparable PC hardware you can buy.<p>Remember, they demoed Debian running in a VM on a prototype M1 Mac nearly 6 months ago, so we know it&#x27;s coming.<p>And while I get it—I used to help support a lab of triple-boot Macs (MacOS&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Windows)—being able to boot 3rd party operating systems on manufacturers machines is going to become less common.<p>With the goal is to diminish the attack surface for the bad guys, my hope is Apple&#x27;s hypervisor technology will enable access to enough things to create a fast, workable VM solution for 3rd-party operating systems on M1 Macs without sacrificing security.')
