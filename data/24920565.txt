If you want to differentiate your product why not choose a name that rings different to your competitor?<p>And now I finally went and browsed some repositories and it&#x27;s clear as that they were very much &quot;inspired&quot; but Github&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s practically a github clone, at least in that regard (although something is a bit off in the smoothness)<p>Maybe one day I&#x27;ll find myself in a similar position and see things differently but this blatant copying always seemed ridiculous to the point where I would feel ashamed to lead this type of strategy.')
