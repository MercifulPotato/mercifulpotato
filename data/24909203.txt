That&#x27;s why nobody is running a startup selling electricity below cost as an MVP for their fusion reactor back-of-a-napkin sketch.<p>If it&#x27;s just a matter of aggressive driving, I&#x27;m sure Waymo has a dial they can turn that would make them go faster, and then Uber has already proven the market for them. But they need to get the safety margins up before doing that, which is a hard problem.<p>Is it the Silicon Valley model? Well it&#x27;s not the get rich quick VC model. It&#x27;s much more like the Bell Labs model of growing a transformative but immature technology in house until it&#x27;s ready to deploy.')
