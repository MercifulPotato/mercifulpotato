Which isn&#x27;t actually that big of a problem either, even if the costs are probably underestimated for fission plants.<p>Now, the real killer for fission is the cost of the plants. They are just so incredibly complex and expensive that they are not competitive.<p>Will a fusion plant be cheaper? Probably not. It will most likely, with current tech, be much more expensive. So it won&#x27;t be able to compete with fission. And fission can&#x27;t compete (in most parts of the world) with renewables, that are still falling exponentially in price.<p>So fusion may still be interesting from a scientific stand point, and perhaps things will change in the far future.<p>An argument I often see is that renewables need storage, and that&#x27;s true. But so does a fission or a fusion plant, unless you overbuild and accept a bad capacity factor. Some amount of overbuild combined with storage looks like the most economical solution currently - the specifics depend very much on where you are in the world.')
