I bet many at the Capitol believed they are &quot;legitimately trying to prevent a communist regime from taking over&quot;... what you are basically saying is &quot;violence is ok as long as I personally believe it&#x27;s ok&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d say require the police line to wear body cams, have them on, and then require connecting a shot to a specific act.  That would also serve as good Pavlovian training for people who think violence is ok as long as they personally think it&#x27;s ok. The definition of what act can vary, but what I meant above is limited to this instant, targeted reaction - what I want to see is a specific &quot;protester&quot; throw a rock at police, or force entry, or set something on fire, and instantly gets shot; with camera evidence of both. Of course, I&#x27;d also accept arresting (and prosecuting with real punishment, not releasing after a few hours), but I don&#x27;t believe it matters which one is used in the case of violent riots.')
