E.g., compare Greenwald&#x27;s consistent, well-researched op-ed&#x27;s to his bitter, nasty ad hominem attacks in his varous Twitter insult-wars.<p>It&#x27;s as if everyone has decided to get coked up and go talk politics at 2 a.m. at a noisy club. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s convenient for journalists to start there since they know everyone is at the club, but it&#x27;s also lazy if they start every article with shit cokeheads were yelling at each other. (As well as boring for readers.)<p>A significant portion of our population, including journalists, is addicted to social media. As a society we have yet to take steps to curb this toxicity. Now, can we please at least admit this is a problem and quit letting this sludge leak into serious writing for the sole benefit that it&#x27;s free and easily discoverable?<p>Edit: from Strangio: &quot;it was supposed to be a cheeky response to Bari [Weiss] not something to be taken on its own terms without that context.&quot; What&#x27;s more generous-- that Strangio is secretly against free-speech and intrepid Greenwald caught him before he deleted his true feelings, or that a system that optimizes for dogfights got the better of Strangio?')
