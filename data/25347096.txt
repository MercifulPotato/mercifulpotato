We only managed to go that far because the first engineers were quite experienced and super proactive. We also had a PM (essentially part time, since he was in charge of other areas too) and the CEO giving a lot of product direction.<p>It would have been really hard to do with more junior people (or contractors) without process. We are in a better place now, and planning to start hiring more junior people next year. I think without the correct support structure and process in place, we would have done a disservice to jr engineers. It&#x27;s part of my focus now, though.')
