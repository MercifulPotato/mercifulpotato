Even if there were very few alternative options available, most people would still not generally pursue an interest in such content. The current torrent of content that they do like just turns what is already a very unlikely proposition with perfect conditions into a near impossibility.<p>The underlying mechanism is that the group you describe as still enjoying reading doesn&#x27;t have much use for social media to begin with. It&#x27;s not just them being left behind, but rather having better options elsewhere for what they want to experience. I would go as far as to say that social media is probably anathema to them as it runs against many of their core ideals and instincts.<p>But let&#x27;s be honest: most content defined as high-quality in direct opposition to what is found on social media is often not that insightful or actually helpful in shaping lives for the better. I believe it is a trap to consider HN as better than brain fast-food, to name one example.')
