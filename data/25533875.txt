It would never commit suicide. It would never sacrifice its life for love, or for an ideal, because it would have neither.<p>All of those can be explained by optimizing the curve for other cases. Mourning the dead happens since there is a conflict between quickly killing feelings for things and to keep the feelings for important things. Self sacrifice happens for any p zombie that values something else higher than itself. Love is just highly valuing something combined with momentum making it hard to stop valuing it, hate is the same but the opposite direction.<p>Now maybe there is consciousness with effects etc, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily needed.')
