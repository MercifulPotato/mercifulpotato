Maybe they don&#x27;t want emacs to become popular?  Certainly given the state of Hurd that could be true, and perhaps merely the fact that a Free editor exists is enough for them.<p>For me, I really like emacs. It&#x27;s great. But it has flaws&#x2F;warts&#x2F;roadblocks that routinely turn away new users and the grognards that seem to form the most influential portions of the emacs community seem to care more about freedom than about making an editor that&#x27;s welcoming to new users and that people actually want to use.')
