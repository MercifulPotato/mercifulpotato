I looked into WGU, but I didn&#x27;t like the lack of accreditation.<p>I found one school&#x2F;program that seemed fair in terms of cost and time, but I couldn&#x27;t fully test out of all of my pre-requisites, and I would still have to spend a considerable amount of time (and money) doing community college courses.<p>I just can&#x27;t justify the time and effort involved when it would do nothing for my career at this point. I&#x27;m already at a top employer, top 5% income, a ridiculous upward trajectory that beats out all of my friends with a CS degree, and I&#x27;m basically set for the rest of my working life if I just keep doing what I&#x27;ve been doing for the past five years.<p>Coworkers have always assumed I had a CS degree, and have been surprised when they find out that I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve grinded leetcode twice in the past, and when I&#x27;m in interviewing shape, I perform as well as someone with a CS background, and that&#x27;s the only thing that really matters.<p>The main benefits I see at this point are that it would help for immigration, but I&#x27;m confident that the United States will remain the best market for software engineers for years to come. I&#x27;d rather invest the time in learning Mandarin, which I think will become increasingly important for software engineering. I at least have a non-STEM undergrad degree, so immigration wouldn&#x27;t be impossible. The employers on my resume mean more than any CS degree would in the US market, but I don&#x27;t know how true that is in other job markets.<p>For people who don&#x27;t have experience, and especially for those doing the typical college path from ages 18-21, a CS bachelor&#x27;s is great. You get priority for internships (a huge advantage over people from non-CS backgrounds, and the most significant IMO), a network of peers, and you have the opportunity to land in FAANG straight out of college, which means you&#x27;ll be able to retire early if you want to. If you don&#x27;t, you still get the other two.<p>I started my career late, but if I had the opportunity to go back in time to when I had just graduated from a non-STEM program and trade two years of working for a CS degree, I wouldn&#x27;t do it. I don&#x27;t think I would be as successful as I am now if I had done that.<p>Things would be different if software engineering had gatekeeping similar to what&#x27;s seen in other high-paying fields like finance, law, and medicine. The only real form of gatekeeping is the aforementioned prioritization (and sometimes even exclusivity) for internships.')
