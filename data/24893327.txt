Our longest mission went 4 days and travelled 3.6km with plenty of charging from the sun.<p>I&#x27;m using 4G cellular data to send commands to an onboard Raspberry Pi, with an Arduino running the solar power system. I drive it manually from mission control using the camera to see where we&#x27;re going, though next year&#x27;s rover should hopefully introduce limited autonomy too.<p>Thanks! I&#x27;ll be crossposting the missions to Youtube too, for those that can&#x27;t hit the timezone. :)')
