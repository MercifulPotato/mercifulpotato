I know that thier license means that if my requirements and Coackroach Labs business model diverge, I will be unable to fork the code and build a proper open source community around it.  I know that I will (likely) never be able to buy a managed coackroach DB service from any vendor other than CoakroachLabs, no matter who acquires them or how badly they manage their service or how well their managed service and term offerings match what I need.  I know that no matter how much I may want to pool resources with some one else to build features I need or fix bugs that I need fixed, I only have on viable option and that is to go through Cockroach, because there is no way to create a viable community fork of the project.<p>Them pretending that their use of the BSL doesn&#x27;t impact end users and end-user freedom is marketing department BS.<p>They are free to license the software they develop under whatever license they want.  I appreciate their past and future open source contributions and the technical achievements they have made, but their use of the BSL license  rather than an open source license makes their product highly undesirable in my business.')
