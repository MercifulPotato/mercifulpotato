And the big invisible &quot;underwater part&quot; of young or lucky people who don&#x27;t get bad Covid but still serve the virus as transmitter relays would have made it a very strong, short wave. Likely mass graves in every part of the world, but mostly over I think by late summer 2020.<p>And so much individual suffering, because Covid deaths seem to be pretty far from peacefully dozing off. On this scale, which is orthogonal to all the usual metrics, I believe that it&#x27;s considerably worse than 1918. If this virus had hit us before we got the tools for asymptomatic detection it would have likely lead to quite a few changes in our approach to end of life care, instead of the extra progress we now see in our utilization of the mRNA toolbox.')
