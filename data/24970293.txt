I do a lot of traveling, and I want to enter my itinerary in my calendar in terms of the local time where I will be at the time of the event.  I use a Mac, and Mac calendar assumes that all times are local to the time zone I&#x27;m in when I entered the event.  So when I&#x27;m on the road, I would like to change the time zone on my laptop to match the local time where I am, but I can&#x27;t because if I do, Calendar will move every event on my calendar to a new (wrong) time. So I have to keep my Mac&#x27;s time zone set to my home time zone in order to not have it screw up my calendar.  It drive me nuts.')
