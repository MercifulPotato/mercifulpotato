Like, obviously no one considers git a failure overall. Obviously not even the tweet linked suggested that. So all the glib responses about that are unhelpful.<p>But the ones that acknowledge the tweet’s (correct) point and say the failing is in the person who said it not having workarounds... that’s their point! It’s such a bad experience that you need to work around it!!<p>Git is such a wonderful tool, I wouldn’t ever discourage anyone from using it. But its rough edges are such a source of pain that I discourage people from using it directly, even if they’re experienced devs.<p>I personally encourage using a GUI over a bunch of CLI aliases, because the vast majority of normal git usage is so mundane it’s easy to make clicky, but even that mundane usage is complex enough that abstracting it at the shell is more likely to cause mishaps.<p>Folks! That’s bad UI! It’s not a condemnation of the tool! It’s just a recognition that the tool’s primitives are too low level for normal, even technically minded normal, brains to interact with productively.')
