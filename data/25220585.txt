It&#x27;s the first time I saw a &quot;car&quot; that was basically as tall as I am, and I&#x27;m not small. Everything truly is bigger in America. Since then started paying attention to the size of the vehicles in American-produced media and I realized how absolutely huge cars can be over there.<p>I was also remembered of an HN thread years ago where people were commenting on the failure of Smart cars in the US. Many Americans were basically arguing that the car was too small to feel safe in traffic, which sounded a bit silly to me, but now that I know that every other car in the US is closer in size to a tank it makes a lot of sense.')
