Item(by='vitus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609775827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632718, text='&gt; 1% of 100K people making over $100K&#x2F;yr is an insanely huge amount of money for a union.<p>Well, think about it this way. 1% of 200k people making &gt;$50k is the same amount.<p>There are 775k members of the IBEW, for reference, which charges 2% of base wages in additional to fixed overheads. The SAG charges dues of 1.575% on the first $500k. Writer&#x27;s Guild charges 1.5% with no cap. So 1% is actually low.<p>&gt; (But that 1% is perhaps&#x2F;likely only salary not equity.)<p>The article stated &quot;compensation&quot;, which I suppose could go either way, but I lean toward &quot;total compensation&quot; in my reading. But either way, I&#x27;m sure the majority of Google employees do make over $100k in base salary (between those in the Bay Area, New York, Seattle, Boston, London, and more).<p>&gt; A big question to ask is whether Googlers need to pay for union or if they should donate to politicians who would regulate Google.<p>How many of those regulations would impact the profitability of Google (e.g. through antitrust enforcement) versus encourage better working conditions?')
