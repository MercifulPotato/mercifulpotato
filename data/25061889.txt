You don&#x27;t have to be writing in C to make calls into C libraries, and it would be rather strange for a language to be unable to use the C ABI, yet claim to be a systems programming language. You might notice that no other language has this problem.<p>Besides, Go does use libc on macOS (now), and always used Win32 API calls on Windows, so it clearly <i>can</i> be done. It&#x27;s just that for a while, they&#x27;ve decided that being fast on macOS was more important than respecting the ABI stability guarantees from the OS.')
