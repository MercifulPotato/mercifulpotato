I&#x27;m thinking httpd&#x2F;nginx&#x2F;jetty, redis&#x2F;memcached, postgres, and so on. You could even make a text editor. Or a kernel. Or anything, really.<p>I really like functional programming, but Haskell turns me off and without at least one major example of a beautiful, popular solution written in Haskell (and I don&#x27;t think pandoc counts), I&#x27;m not going to make the effort to push through that barrier.<p>Other languages that occupy a similar space (&quot;superior but tragically underused&quot;) have these examples. Erlang has...well a lot but Matrix and RabbitMQ come to mind. Clojure has...well it has datomic, but also Jepsen uses it, and heck I&#x27;ve used it and its fine.<p>The real question is, who&#x27;s fingers <i>itch</i> to write haskell, and can you please pay them $400k to rewrite nginx in it?')
