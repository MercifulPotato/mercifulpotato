Coming from Elm&#x2F;React to my first project in Swift choosing SwiftUI seemed like the obvious choice. It always felt like the type system wasn&#x27;t quite powerful enough to express the API. Once you add Combine into the mix type erasure makes debugging issues unspeakably painful, errors appearing on the wrong lines at best and often in entirely different files. Then there&#x27;s the tooling, Swift Package Manager was endlessly running into mysterious issues that would eventually disappear if I just rebuilt the project enough times. As for SwiftUI preview I have no idea what was going on there but it brought my brand new iMac to a halt, simple code changes causing multiple minutes of the dreaded spinner. I was using Swift for a side project and the issues just destroyed all motivation to continue with it. I&#x27;ve since switched to Flutter which while the language isn&#x27;t as capable (though reified generics are a huge improvement) does at least feel like a solid tool to build apps with.')
