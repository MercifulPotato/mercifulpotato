Item(by='sunnydayddr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611196612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851569, text='It works similarly to calling someone &quot;mister&quot; and &quot;sir&quot;, as in &quot;excuse me, mister&quot; and &quot;excuse me, sir&quot;.<p>&quot;Mister&quot; is generally used for someone older and &quot;sir&quot; is usually used for someone around your age. The equivalent mapping in many Asian languages is &quot;mister&quot; = &quot;uncle&quot;, and &quot;sir&quot; = &quot;brother&quot;.<p>In the case where you are speaking generally, as in writing an article about some people rather than addressing them directly, then it is sort of subjective and not relative to the speaker&#x27;s&#x2F;writer&#x27;s age, but &quot;older&quot; people (~50-60s onwards) are referred to as &quot;uncle&#x2F;auntie&quot; and &quot;younger&quot; people are referred to as &quot;brother&#x2F;sister&quot;. What is &quot;older&quot; and &quot;younger&quot; here is a very fuzzy line, and it&#x27;s possible to offend someone by using the wrong term, but this is pretty universal and not exclusive to Asian languages.')
