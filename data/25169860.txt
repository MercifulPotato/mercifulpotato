If management asks us to go back full-time, I will start looking for another job.  I&#x27;m happier and more productive than ever.  I never want to go back to rotting in a cube farm pretending that 1-2 productive hours a day is enough.<p>1. Cubes, cube pods, and &quot;open offices&quot; are inhumane.<p>2. I don&#x27;t have to wear headphones to &quot;hear myself think&quot; anymore.<p>3. Meetings no longer produce the positive feelings that result from the presence of another human, so there&#x27;s incentive for everyone to eliminate the pointless meetings.<p>3a. I can multitask during the truly pointless meetings that haven&#x27;t yet been eliminated.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much work I&#x27;ve gotten done during &quot;town halls&quot; during the last eight months.<p>4. No commute.<p>5. My house is way nicer than my office.  I know this isn&#x27;t the case for everyone.  But if you&#x27;re working as a software engineer, you can afford it.  You have to ask yourself why it wasn&#x27;t a priority before.')
