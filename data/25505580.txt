If you don&#x27;t find any pro-T. posts quickly, then this is your example.<p>We know from the election results that about half of the U.S. voters prefer R. party or T. in particular. This is a lot - this can&#x27;t be a fringe group by definition of &quot;fringe&quot;.<p>In 2016, scrolling through reddit you could see it. There was a contested election, there were supporters from both sides on reddit, noisy and visible. In 2020, you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find some pro-T. content unless you know where to look (I don&#x27;t, and won&#x27;t bother), it&#x27;s all &quot;orange man bad&quot; now. He probably is, but come on.<p>So, reddit somehow shut off the half of its home country from participating in political discussion on their website. They&#x27;re probably in their own right, but this <i>is</i> scary shit.')
