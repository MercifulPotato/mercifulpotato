You expend a lot of words on something which you say has no proof. If you didn&#x27;t fear these ideas to be true, why spend so so much effort defending they can&#x27;t be?<p>That comment asked for how, that&#x27;s not a challenge, nor a refutation.<p>You don&#x27;t want to face this idea, so to try to avoid engaging with it, you pretend you need to see more to merely consider it. But you can consider it immediately, and relate it to the world you see.<p>I understand that&#x27;s not something you want, and it&#x27;s hard for you, and I don&#x27;t want it to be hard for you, so you could try just not believing it. And you can do that, without pretending you&#x27;ve disproved it. Why are you unwilling to disbelieve  without pretending you&#x27;ve also disproved it, yet at the same time refusing try to disprove it by addressing and criticizing it? No wonder you seem upset, it must be very hard to be stuck in such a bind. But it&#x27;s no one else&#x27;s responsibility to get you out of that except yourself. It&#x27;s your responsibility what you choose to believe or not and it&#x27;s your responsibility to convince yourself or not of ideas, no one else&#x27;s.<p>You work it out. You can think and use your mind.<p>You say it&#x27;s condescending to note you own your own beliefs but it seems more condescending or arrogant or immature or irresponsible to try to incorrectly put the responsibility on other people, for what you choose to believe and how you choose to believe it.<p>If you are open and curious I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d be willing to engage with an idea and criticize it but it seems from your comment that you&#x27;ve already decided that whatever other people write here will be nonsense, which is similar to how you decided that other ideas are nonsense without engaging and criticizing them, you don&#x27;t seem open and curious at all. it seems much more like denial and psychological avoidance. which makes sense because these ideas are challenging and they threaten the worldview and the associated sense of security and stability with that.<p>So this problem where you shut your mind off and refuse to consider and critique the ideas and instead of this project onto others to demand that they solve the problem for you, is a common pathological projection pattern, but you can fix it, accepting you got yourself into this place and owning your own beliefs and the responsibility to convince yourself or not of ideas that you encounter.<p>Best of luck, hope this helps!')
