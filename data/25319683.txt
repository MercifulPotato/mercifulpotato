At least I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever encountered it in the wild.<p>I think you&#x27;re exactly right.  That&#x27;s what I was trying to suggest and address with:  &quot;Integer size-generic routines are best served with wrapper macros and use of the C11 _Generic() construction, or some of the typeof() magic used by, e.g., Linux.&quot;  It predates the C11 _Generic() stuff, and the standards ignore the GCC extensions like typeof().')
