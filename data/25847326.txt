That is usually not a bad thing; however, it requires persistence.<p>I&#x27;m currently stuck in Germany. Think about the late 80s when a whole state was brought down peacefully by the people of the German Democratic Republic. It was not a storm on the Reichstag that brought about the fall of the state, nor a military coup. It was a lot of different factors combined but an increasing pressure from the people played a central role in it. And, mind you, this was a regime that had no problem taking extreme measures against its own people, so certainly no easy circumstances to stand up against the authorities.')
