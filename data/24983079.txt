A relative owns a small business and needed to get rid of an employee. She wound up laying her off, and taking the insurance hit. She wasn&#x27;t the best employee and there probably could have been an argument for causal firing, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to just lie&quot; is what she said.<p>Many larger orgs would just try to go for a causal firing, so they can block the employee from receiving unemployment. It doesn&#x27;t even matter if they&#x27;re an otherwise decent employee. We&#x27;ll save money so lets just lie, basically. It&#x27;s pretty crushing to the individual, and IMO this practice should be abolished.<p>This is totally anecdotal and plenty of small to medium businesses act shady, but it&#x27;s interesting that things tend to get even shadier (lawful evil) as things scale up. Yet there&#x27;s less at stake for the individual employees and more ability to &quot;not be evil&quot;, without closing up shop.')
