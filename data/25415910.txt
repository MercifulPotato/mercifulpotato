Most of the time it&#x27;s used, it doesn&#x27;t mean anything at all.<p>What is actually used? Fertiliser,  Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, not some scary poisons and &#x27;chemicals&#x27;.<p>Do they need to be disposed of? Not really, plants use them up. If you are disposing of them, you are disposing of your money, because you paid for them.<p>The whole point of these greenhouse or vertial systems is that they are closed off,  so you don&#x27;t have runoff like you do in the open field, and you don&#x27;t need pesticides because pests don&#x27;t get in.<p>There are 99 problems with this &#x27;tech bro&#x27; solution, but chemicals is not one of them.')
