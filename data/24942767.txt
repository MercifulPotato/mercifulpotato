But, I prefer not to have targeted ads -- I prefer ads that shoot from the hip and know as little about me as possible. I know that&#x27;s not as compelling for advertisers, but they did ok with that model for a century.<p>I mean, if it were just as simple as, he likes gadgets and cycling: let&#x27;s show him an ad for a new bike accessory -- that isn&#x27;t so bad.<p>But when they know what your mood is, what your insecurities are, what your financial situation is, past purchases at one retailer linked with your phone number to purchases at another retailer, how likely you are to buy at a certain time of day, etc and then they show you the right ad, in the right place at the right time to exploit all of those things... that is too manipulative for my taste.')
