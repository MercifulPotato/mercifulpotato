I am not an expert but I can walk in the forests of the northeast and see things don&#x27;t look super great and we won&#x27;t ever see old growth like we had here. My neighbor is a 90 year old tree farmer, he&#x27;s got an ag PHD and we sometimes talk about how the land has changed here (he&#x27;s been living the same place for around 85 years).<p>On my desk in front of me sits one of the two viable American chestnut nuts I&#x27;ve found this year from a (barely) surviving tree of the blight. 100 years ago there were over 4 billion of these trees, now it&#x27;s assumed that maybe 100 or so large examples exist inside the original range ravaged by the blight. There&#x27;s no point in planting it, the nut I have has likely hybridized with the Chinese chestnuts we have nearby and it&#x27;s almost certain it would also die from the blight before it reached maturity. Right now there&#x27;s plans to introduce an engineered variant with a gene from wheat to stop the effects of chestnut blight, but it needs approval: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acf.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;Newhouse-f2018.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.acf.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;Newhouse-f201...</a><p>The undergrowth of the forests here are covered by tearthumb (mile-a-minute) and stiltgrass, and I can see dozens of dead ash trees covered in the zigzag scars caused by the emerald ash borer. The large elms were all wiped out before I was born, but many of the dead ones were still standing. We have fast growing tress in the form of things like tree of heaven (aka ghetto palm, which lives maybe 70 years at most), but that&#x27;s now attracted the latest imported hell: the spotted lanternfly. Not far from me there&#x27;s huge numbers of eastern hemlock dying off from woolly adelgid, which is manageable but at great expense and effort. What we could plant and have regrow 100 years ago just wouldn&#x27;t work now for these and many other reasons that much better qualified people should write about.')
