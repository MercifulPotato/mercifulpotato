Low-horsepower EVs like the Leaf feel great in a city where you get the benefit of that torque from 0-30 mph, but that benefit quickly tapers off as speed rises. (aerodynamically, 2x speed requires 4x power) The 2012 Leaf launched with a high-9 second 0-60.  The 2012 Prius has a number in the low-10s and the 2012 Yaris has 0-60 times in the low-9s.  These are all very comparable vehicles in a highway merge situation.   You won&#x27;t impress your passenger with the performance of any of them on a high-speed American highway.  They&#x27;re fun as heck around a dense city, but most Americans dropping $40,000 on a new car are merging on to divided highways in the burbs.')
