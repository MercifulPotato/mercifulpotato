I&#x27;m talking about the core tenant that people respond to incentives, which is a fact that can be both observed and derived through logic. It&#x27;s not story telling. What&#x27;s the alternative? People don&#x27;t react to tax rates or prices more generally? Do they act rationally? Maybe not but the general principal holds that make something more expensive people consume less of it. Make taxes higher people will look to shift their income or assets around to avoid them as the cost of not doing so is much higher.<p>IMO one of the most important lessons of economics is the idea that prices convey collective information not accessible to any one individual. That&#x27;s why prices exist and lead to prosperity and communist regimes fail. No committee can pin down exactly a number that encompasses all information. Check out the article I, pencil to appreciate all the complexity and information conveyed through market activity. No person can produce a pencil without a market. Something so trivial for a market to produce that they&#x27;re essentially given out freely.<p>So it&#x27;s not correct to suggest that economics is just stories and we should ignore incentives and prices or anything argued using economic principals<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;I,_Pencil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;I,_Pencil</a>')
