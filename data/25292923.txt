You have to compare performance at a given power target to judge performance&#x2F;efficiency, which you can&#x27;t do for most ARM CPUs. But you can get 8 core x86 CPUs that are 15W, or 1.8w per core (example: the 4800U). Similarly 64 core Epycs are around or less than 3W per core. These are all well within similar per-core power numbers as your typical big-core ARM chip.<p>The perceived gap is larger than it really is, because there just isn&#x27;t really an x86 tablet-focused market. The M1&#x27;s jump into laptop-space puts it up and we can really see it shine, but the other ARM jumps into laptop-space were a joke. So comparing equivalent power targets becomes challenging.<p>But take your articles benchmarks for example. The Snapdragon manages something like 60% of the performance of the A12&#x27;s. So take the existing M1 mac, cut the performance drastically, and suddenly it&#x27;d be not interesting at all. The performance&#x2F;efficiency wouldn&#x27;t be impressive at all if it was getting 60% of the performance it is now.')
