Item(by='fareesh', descendants=None, kids=[24959654], score=None, time=1604236790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959099, text='A high profile executive working for a corporation in Iran will be fired and possibly arrested if they start talking about the government&#x27;s stance on women&#x27;s rights. Likewise in the USA if some executive talks about babies&#x27; rights they&#x27;ll probably be fired and some smear campaign will be launched against them. Likewise in China vocal criticism of the CCP will probably lead to bad consequences.<p>I would encourage Americans to reject this type of culture and embrace freedom of speech and diversity of views. Reduce the number of taboo topics rather than increasing them. This modern blasphemy culture is spreading in many western countries. Reject it before it&#x27;s too late. Conversations are good. It is how society moves forward. No good ever comes from silencing conversations.')
