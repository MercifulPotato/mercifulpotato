You&#x27;re just showing downsides without any upside as a tradeoff.<p>I mean, with microservices you can also do blue&#x2F;green deployments, and they are not all-in like monoliths. Each deployment only covers a subset of features that can gradually be rolled in and out with the only risk of causing partial failures.')
