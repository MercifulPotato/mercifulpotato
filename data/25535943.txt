I have a friend that is pretty much an expert in Logic, and I will ask him for more input. As a side-note, I think the UI will be the &quot;easy part&quot; of the deal :D The implementation - that may be insanely hard :D So I will have to strike the right balance :D<p>&gt; Beginner and often intermediate users often do not understand the importance of good audio in a video. When they do it still takes a steep learning curve to understand the complexity and nuances of even the basics.<p>100% agree :)<p>&gt; Most video editors donâ€™t help users with audio<p>Agreed here as well :D One thing I&#x27;m kinda&#x27; proud of is you can go anywhere in the project , go to an audio track and space will only play that. Or shift-space will play all tracks (no video). And one can create music keyframes (that move along with the audio if you move it), and you can snap video to them.<p>&gt; Templated signal chains for individual audio tracks that include simple things such as gate, subtractive eq, compression, additive-eq<p>I know a bit of the theory here, but I&#x27;ll need to did  lot deeper into this. At some point, I believe I&#x27;ll definitely have this.<p>&gt; Level suggestions for tracks, based upon if they are dialog, music-bed, room tone etc<p>This sounds complicated, but will delve into it at a later time.<p>&gt; Not specifically audio, but being able to output multiple different renders depending on target website with a single click. (Ideal container, codec, resolutions, ratios, LUFS, etc).<p>Agreed, this will definitely be there :)')
