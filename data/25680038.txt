Item(by='pvarangot', descendants=None, kids=[25680150, 25680089], score=None, time=1610067997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679870, text='&quot;A friend&quot; was detained in protests and illegal parties multiple times, the police will make you identify yourself when you don&#x27;t have an ID and they radio in or verify your identity with the terminals on their cars. You are obliged to identify yourself when you are &quot;detained&quot;, and if you don&#x27;t in cases like this were there&#x27;s ample evidence of _at least_ breaking and entering they will arrest you and move on to the next person. They had basically all of the the DC police at their disposal for this, plus the national guard. They can&#x27;t say they didn&#x27;t have the resources to identify 100 protesters, I&#x27;ve seen them do it with 20 police officers with bigger groups.<p>If they are overwhelmed they don&#x27;t do the verification but they always always always at least write the given identities on a notebook or the car computer.<p>If they didn&#x27;t do that when they emptied this building is because someone on the chain of command told them not to. Otherwise they _have_ to do it.')
