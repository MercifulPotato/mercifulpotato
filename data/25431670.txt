Personally it seems like there is often a dearth of intermediate resources to better understand and utilize the language. Maybe it&#x27;s more complex use cases, patterns and best practices, advanced syntax (looking at you, Haskell), etc.<p>For Python I think you&#x27;re lucky in how versatile and ubiquitous it is. I&#x27;ve found the best way for applying Python is &quot;I want to learn x&quot; and oftentimes &#x27;x&#x27; is suitable or desired with Python.<p>In your case I can see search (as mentioned by someone else) as being useful. Also being able to make API requests for cases&#x2F;documents that you may want to search or maybe save to a local db for later indexing. Speaking of indexing, maybe you may start looking into a bit of NLP.<p>My biggest piece of advice would be that if you really want to use Python, use it in a situation where it makes sense but could be accomplished a different way. Maybe that document request form that you were going to fill out via the UI can be done via an API endpoint you can write in Python. Instead of searching via &#x27;Ctrl-F&#x27; write a small script that you pass document(s) to search and term(s) to search for.')
