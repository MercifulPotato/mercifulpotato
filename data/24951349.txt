Iâ€™d go in at 5-6PM and leave at 22:30. The best two years of my time in school. The amount of effort I had to put in vs the amount I absorbed dropped drastically. And driving against traffic (against the people leaving the city), enjoying the lower temperatures in warm months, having lunch and dinner at home, not having to miss school to go to a doctor or a store that runs 9-5. Everything just makes sense to me.')
