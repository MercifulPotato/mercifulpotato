Item(by='mannykannot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608403685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25477696, text='Yes, and I regret making a snarky comment.<p>There are clearly quite a few people who are determined to avoid flying on a 737 Max (or avoid Boeing altogether) and also seem to expect this to be a widespread view. While I can understand the former (though not hold it myself), there is no realistic prospect of the latter.<p>I can&#x27;t verify the safety of airliners either, but so long as they are flown by an on-board crew of professional pilots, there will be a body of informed* people with a vested interest in keeping things safe.<p>* Though not always <i>fully</i> informed, which is, of course, a big part of the 737 Max debacle.')
