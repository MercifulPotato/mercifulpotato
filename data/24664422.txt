As usual, if you assume all his unproven priors (ie, reality is actually a hypergraph with well defined update rules, the hypergraph has premade nonlocal &#x27;long threads&#x27; in it) and go along with his redefinition of the speed of light as the speed of causality then the article makes perfect sense.<p>Where the trouble starts is that there seems to be no evidence whatsoever to support the axioms, and also no way to actually measure the predicted effects. It is not so different from saying &quot;There might be a godlike being out there that can just teleport us anywhere we want, but we have no way of contacting it or even of being sure it exists&quot;. A cool theory, but until any proofs or falsifications come along it is indistinguishable from science fiction.')
