Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=[24680944], score=None, time=1601825316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679362, text='&gt; What is true is teachers overrate girl&#x27;s performance earlier in school compared to boys, then girls catch up and overtake, often approaching their teacher&#x27;s predictions. This might well be a case of matching expectations. Another, to me reasonable, explanation for the results is that teacher&#x27;s grading includes potential, based on their experience. It&#x27;s hard to know, and would be very hard to ethically test.<p>Girls overtake boys in terms of grades assigned by teachers, but they don&#x27;t in terms of scores on standardized tests. You can make the argument that the grades are just another method of overrating girls&#x27; performance.')
