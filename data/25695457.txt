But we expect human decency that has nothing to do with political views.<p>The media reports on facts, with proof, because their reputation sort of hinges on it. Retractions don&#x27;t make them look good. These people don&#x27;t live in the realm of facts. So the best that can be done for them is to print their opinion with the actual evidence next to it. It&#x27;s not the medias fault if that evidence totally disproves whatever they thought.')
