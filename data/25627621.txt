No one is willing to run the experiments necessary.<p>This is entirely false. I work in adtech, and almost all companies run experiments in order to optimize their ad spend (everything from Ad A vs Ad B, to Ad vs No Ad, to Channel A vs Channel B, and more).<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that advertising always produces ROI. Quite often, experiments will be run that will show a certain strategy isn&#x27;t performing well, and the company will adjust accordingly. It&#x27;s incredibly na√Øve to think that companies are flushing half a trillion dollars a year down the toilet on advertising without any attempt to validate their investments.')
