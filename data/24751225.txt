I can go to &#x2F;x&#x2F;&#x27;s catalog page and see maybe 1-2 posts about le jewish nazi conspiracy theory, with less than 10 posts. Because it&#x27;s fucking bait and most the lurkers aren&#x27;t taking it. There&#x27;s a thread on &#x2F;lit&#x2F; right now about African writers with a lot of recommendations. It&#x27;s 4chan. As always, you wade through the shit to find the interesting stuff. It never existed to service you or your sensibilities.<p>Sorry not sorry that your point of view is so narrow that literally any mention of Nazis triggers you. That&#x27;s the nature of 2020 shitposting. You got filtered.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s stagnant at ~22M active monthly users for the last 8 years, and why it&#x27;s #1 referal is now jeuxvideo.com (lmao!)<p>Hiroshima Nagasaki&#x27;s incompetence is the one genuine cause of the downfall of the site. He wants money, and he&#x27;s severed ties with 4chan&#x27;s other referrals and sponsors for better deals. Not even J-List was willing to stick around. The site is more or less managed by a dedicated team of mods and janitors, with Hiroshi occasionally changing a few lines of code on the backend and fucking things up. He hasn&#x27;t even figured out how to take down &#x2F;qa&#x2F; yet, which was a board moot temporarily created to answer questions when he left. I don&#x27;t (fully) fault 4chan&#x27;s community for this. I fault the owner.<p>&gt;You&#x27;re showing your true colors, aren&#x27;t you :). Thank you for proving me right. The only people who didn&#x27;t leave or at least come to loathe that website are literally fasiscts, and you&#x27;re more than on your way there if you&#x27;re not already there.<p>Thank you for taking the most obvious of obvious baits, and proving once again that you got filtered.<p>I think it&#x27;s best to just stop here. You clearly have a chip on your shoulder and any mention of 4chan&#x27;s impact on the greater cultural sphere of society will be met with scrutiny unless it conforms with your world view in that it is a horrible, terrible, no good website full of bad people. (It IS that, but it is also MUCH more.) You can move your goalposts all you want until nobody is left playing with you.<p>Tchuss.')
