It is especially difficult if that relative has a drug charge in their past, including &quot;smoking a joint at age 16&quot;. (If that relative has a felony drug charge in their past, they also can&#x27;t get federal student loans ever.)<p>Many of the things people do to help their families have been made to have bad consequences for poor people in the US. To me, it feels as if there has been a systematic effort to break poor families, take away their ability to help each other, and ensure that they continue to be embroiled in &quot;the system&quot; in the US.')
