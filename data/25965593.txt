Why didn&#x27;t they just license some working vaccine and start cranking it out?<p>Why does the company X developed medicine only have to be made by company X? That&#x27;s against the whole idea of patents, which is making information available and usable via licensing. Money shouldn&#x27;t be the issue, the cost of the shots is negligible so there is not much profit to be made there. Instead licenses should be more profitable since time is worth a lot of money.<p>There are also a lot of vaccines under development. There should always be multiple well resourced efforts under way. Unfortunately it seems some promising alternatives for development, testing or mass production have been starved for funding.')
