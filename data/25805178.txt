In Java you could have a public final field and it was obvious that it was immutable (unless referencing a mutable object). Kotlin, in an attempt to match Groovy in syntax cuteness, allows to declare a val (supposedly the equivalent of a java final field) that is actually not backed by memory at all but a getter method in disguise.<p><pre><code>  val x: Int &#x2F;&#x2F; this is an immutable value\n  val y: Int &#x2F;&#x2F; this is an immutable Function0&lt;Int&gt; that is executed each time and but pretends to be a val\n     get() = System.currentTimeMillis()</code></pre>')
