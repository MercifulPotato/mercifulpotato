The senior monk told the student that he was to not cross the bridge&quot;Hashi wa dame&quot;. Every day the young monk studies and meditated but he was not reaching enlightenment. One day, he crossed the bridge and meditated and had a vision on the island. He then share his vision with the other monks and the senior monk said to him &quot;I told you not to cross the bridge&quot; and the young monk replied &quot;Master, I thought you were telling me not to walk on the edge, I went down the middle.&quot;<p>Both stories are very anti-establishment in nature and teach us that in order to get what we desire we may have to look for loopholes.')
