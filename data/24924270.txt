That&#x27;s how much the &quot;no code&quot; generation is arriving?<p>&gt; <i>In business today, it’s not enough to just open a spreadsheet and make some casual observations anymore.</i><p>Using office applications is also &quot;no code&quot;. Spreadsheets have some aspects of code in that there are formulas that use the value of other formulas, but it&#x27;s not really code.<p>&quot;No code&quot; arrived about forty years ago. With the advent of personal computers in the home and in offices, most computer use since then has been by non-coders.<p>&gt; <i>[T]his new generation is prepared to connect multiple online tools to build an online storefront (through no-code tools like Shopify or Squarespace), calculate basic LTV scores using a no-code data platform and prioritize their best customers with marketing outreach through basic email delivery services. And it’s all reproducible, as it is in technology and code and not produced by hand.</i><p>Well, reproducible today, and maybe a week or two hence, until some details in the technology change. Invariably, the technology either has no regression tests which cover your use case, or else consciously declares your use case irrelevant. You know, they &quot;prioritized&quot; the software for &quot;their best customers&quot;; too bad that wasn&#x27;t you!<p>Since it&#x27;s online SaaS, you can&#x27;t even do the usual troubleshooting of comparing the behavior of the old and new version of a program. Between two refreshes of a browser, the black box can change what it is running.<p>In prior decades, you might use some query language to scan a customer database to prioritize them according to &quot;best&quot;, and export the results to some word processing mail merge to generate correspondence. All &quot;no code&quot;.<p>This article is really about shifts in the kinds of tools that no-coders are using, away from locally installed or in-house software toward SaaS.')
