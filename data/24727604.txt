Many things that use domain names do reverse them. See [0] and [1] for some examples. For many systems, reversing domain names is better, so that is presumably why they do it, because it makes more sense to do it that way for those systems. (It might also help when indexing anything related to domain names; you will want the broadest part first, so that when you search by prefix, you will find anything in that domain and its subdomains.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reverse_domain_name_notation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reverse_domain_name_notation</a><p>[1] (My own &quot;Unusenet&quot; specification also uses reverse domain names in NNTP newsgroup names; they specify where the newsgroup originated (not necessarily the same server you are accessing them from), and are used to avoid namespace collisions.)')
