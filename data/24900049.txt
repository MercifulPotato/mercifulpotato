A policy can be important to me even though it does not nominally affect me directly. Secondly, this method doesn&#x27;t even attempt to weigh policies by anything else, like the magnitude of benefits&#x2F;downsides, budgetary concerns, civil rights implications, etc. For instance, in my view, it&#x27;s fine for a political issue involving state-sanctioned persecution or bigotry of a very small minority to share political attention with a large public health crisis.')
