Just had a 2 month bout of them where at one point I had 3 in a week.<p>Initially I thought that my BJJ training was the issue as there was a direct correlation between training, exertion, neck strain and migraines the next day. But they progressed to migraines from the gym (weights), after a meal and one drink, and even for no apparent reason. I still think there is a link between neck strain which is exacerbated by computer use and eye strain.<p>Sumatriptan saved my life. Maybe this could also help, in small doses.')
