Maybe australia has a different cutoff bp to the USA.\nThe nih say you need five visits to be assessed on 140&#x2F;100.<p>Many people with hypertension have comorbidities. Diabetes for instance, which also causes neuropathy.<p>Is it ideal? No. Far from it. I wish I could get mine lower. I see my health professional regularly, I am taking my prescribed medication, and I exercise.  I have had no signal that I am facing imminent demise. Far from  it.<p>That&#x27;s all I meant really: if there is no other problem, I think treated 140&#x2F;100 could be sustained for some time.')
