Item(by='jcims', descendants=None, kids=[25140807], score=None, time=1605724811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139833, text='I was tinkering a bit recently in an effort to build a simple system that finds &#x27;related&#x27; podcasts and see if I can see the network effect play out over time.  I did this by building a graph of people (hosts&#x2F;guests) and episodes and started folding in tags&#x2F;topics.  None of this is in my wheelhouse, and I found:<p>- It takes a <i>lot</i> of work to curate a substantial collection of podcasts.  There are lists all over the place but it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s really in there.<p>- I attmpmted to use SpaCy and&#x2F;or NLTK to do some &#x27;Named Entity Recognition&#x27; in order to extract topics&#x2F;people&#x2F;orgnaziations from episode titles and descriptions.  This was surprisingly brittle.  The string &#x27;Sean Carroll&#x27;, for example, wasn&#x27;t detected as a person by either framework (IIRC).  It also seems quite brittle to punctuation and other context (e.g. beginning or end of a sentence).  This was using the default models shipped with both.  I started off with just the english models but expanded as there were <i>lots</i> of names being skipped silently.  That helped less than I had hoped.<p>- I have yet to find a good UI for exploring a graph.  I used Neo4j and the built in &#x27;browser&#x27; is not intended for that purpose.  Gephi has good capability for filtering and analytics, but it takes quite a bit of getting used to and the graph itself isn&#x27;t amenable to dynamic navigation.<p>That&#x27;s all.  Bookmarking this as it would really help.')
