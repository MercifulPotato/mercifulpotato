(I used to use them when I worked in an office.) I have some 3M &quot;hearing protection&quot; muffs that I bought for mowing the lawn, and they happen to have bluetooth headphones in them. They aren&#x27;t as good as the DTs, but they are pretty darn close; and good enough that I prefer them when I travel to the DTs.')
