The newer buildings were constructed at a much higher cost than the old ones and they are priced accordingly (and with less flexibility to go down in price). In spite of the price tag and the &#x27;luxury&#x27; appellation, they really are not that nice (they tend to be small and the gym&#x2F;pool that comes with the apartment is closed during Covid. Consequently there is a subtle structural shortage on apartments that doesn&#x27;t go away by simply building more apartments. If it were possible to build apartments at a lower price with more space per unit in the city then it would be a simple matter of total housing stock. As long as housing stock is differentiated in price and quality a shortage can endure even with an increase in total supply (rent controlled units for example will always be in short supply regardless of new construction).')
