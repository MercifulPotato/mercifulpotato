When you &quot;measure&quot; the state of your particle, you force it to assume a definite state, and entanglement forces the other particle to assume e.g. the opposite definite state (&quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;). This allows you to synchronize information across large distances, but you cannot <i>send</i> anything, because you cannot chose the outcome of the quantum measurement.')
