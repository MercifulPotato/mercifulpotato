It&#x27;s certainly not to temper expectations that things may take longer than people expect (because it certainly shouldn&#x27;t take _that_ many words to say something so simple).. does it just make you feel smart or something?<p>&gt; This perception is mixed with a more dangerous one that the Starship is in a league of its own. It&#x27;s not. Blue Origin&#x27;s work and approach may be superior in the long run, as they&#x27;re designing mission specific vehicles that are optimised to their context.<p>Has Blue Origin even gotten a rocket into orbit yet?')
