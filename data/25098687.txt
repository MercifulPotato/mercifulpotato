The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles was not hacked and was not the cause of the breach.&quot;<p>I appreciate that the Texas DMV wasn&#x27;t the direct cause of this breach, but they can&#x27;t completely pass the buck to Vertafore. At the very least, I would think they need to issue 28 million new licenses with new license numbers and invalidate the old ones. And, since this is likely to be an expensive and time consuming process, they should probably sue Vertafore to make them pay for it.<p>And while they&#x27;re at it, they should probably make sure that Vertafore is never allowed to access this data again.<p>Realistically, none of this will happen, the compromised DL #s will remain valid in perpetuity (I just had someone tell me they moved out of Texas for 5 years and were issued the same DL # when they moved back), and Vertafore won&#x27;t even be fined.')
