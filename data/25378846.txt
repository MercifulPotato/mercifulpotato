They made all sorts of weird stuff—and did it well. The cereal boxes were the tip of the iceberg. Brian and Joe could design (and throw a good party!). Nate was a terrific coder who did CS at Harvard.<p>I would absolutely say they had the best fallback plan—they could make things. They could&#x27;ve gotten other jobs. That takes decades of hard work (I&#x27;m sure they started building things when they were very young).<p>So if you can&#x27;t make good things, DO NOT max out your credit cards. You will be setting yourself up for disaster. Instead invest in your skillset. If you aren&#x27;t good enough to build something great, go out and get a job(s) and keep working on it.<p>I like a poem written in 1916 about being someone who &quot;delivers the goods&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breckyunits.com&#x2F;deliver.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breckyunits.com&#x2F;deliver.html</a>)')
