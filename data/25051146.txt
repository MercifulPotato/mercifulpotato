Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605038913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25048396, text='&gt; I hope that the DMCA takedown issue can be resolved reasonably, but it’s starting to seem more and more like a move off of Github is overdue.<p>It&#x27;s a risky move, dabbling with stuff that is targeted under DMCA. Anything hosted in the US is liable for takedowns - including domain names that are under the control of US-based companies. You&#x27;ll need to deal with acquiring hosting and DDoS protection yourself, plus keeping track of security updates. And to be honest Europe isn&#x27;t exactly a legal safe haven either, we also have nasty laws (e.g. in Germany the infamous &quot;Störerhaftung&quot;) exposing you to liability.')
