Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=[24965003, 24964996], score=None, time=1604292463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963825, text='That&#x27;s the most flimsy argumentation...<p>The author likes some bots, so he must be a Russian bot?<p>The author mentions ยง230, so he must be a right winger?<p>The author mentions a Qanon slogan as an example for censorship happening on twitter, so he must be a Qanon nut (I cannot be sure if the author calling out Qanon as a conspiracy theory movement was already present when you commented... but it is now at least)<p>As for censorship: yes, it&#x27;s censorship that you&#x27;re not allowed to scream fire, and it&#x27;s one of the exceptions to free speech in the US that can be legally censored by the government. Not all censorship is automatically bad. Another example for &quot;good&quot; censorship would be child pornography.<p>The questions always are who does censor? and why do they censor? (and how do they publicly justify that censorship) and how sound and &quot;obvious&quot; is their argument?<p>Facebook censors nudity - as do most US TV stations (some under FCC rules) and a lot of other companies - even non-sexualized nudity, and arguments it&#x27;s to protect viewers, especially kids, from naughty things. In Germany you will sometimes even see non-sexualized nudity - be it nipples or even &quot;full-frontal&quot; - on the public children TV channel (KiKa - Kinder Kanal). Is the US (corporate, sometimes government) approach to censorship of nudity the right one? Or the German one?<p>Censorship, and the reasons for it are seldom really black-and-white, and communities, from small groups, to social networks, to societies at large, have to reach some kind of consensus what goes and what goes not and reevaluate that consensus frequently.<p>The point is to justify when and why you censor, and from my understanding of what the author wrote, it seems the lack transparency, twitter implementing censorship with disregard for what their community wants (or at least part of it) from up top, and ever increasing amount of censorship that he disagrees with, not saying all censorship is automatically bad.<p>I myself tend to find myself on the &quot;censor less&quot; side of the argument usually, in case you wonder, tho shit like Qanon&#x2F;&quot;pizza comet&quot; and their success sowed a little doubt recently, to be completely honest.')
