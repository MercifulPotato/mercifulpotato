Just because your bubble is more educated about this doesn&#x27;t make this a general truth about the whole world. Basically anyone you will find on this site has exceptional high knowledge about certain things, which the majority of people do not have.<p>But I also have strong doubts whether this crafty claim is even true. Quite unlikely that you know the state of knowledge of so many people for this specific topic.<p>&gt; Articles like these make it sound like Telegram is somehow uniquely messed up while it is in fact a lot more secure than email (which can be accessed by at least your provider and sender&#x2F;recipients provider).<p>Very manipuilative and misleading argument. The article does not recomment email or whatsapp as an alternative, but signal and threema. Actually the article is quite obvious in saying that Telegram is as unsafe as Whatsapp.aaaa')
