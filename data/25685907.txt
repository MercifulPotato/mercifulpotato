Despite what certain propagandaesque sci-fi &quot;warning&quot; videos would have people believe, I&#x27;m least worried about these nano-drones. At the end of the day bullets are still cheaper, less complicated, and more effective. And as soon as you give the drones some standoff capabilities to mitigate some of the countermeasures, you start loosing many of the perceived &quot;benefits&quot; and are back to just using guys with guns.')
