As soon as an entity has managed dominance in a market and squeezed out competition via VC-subsidized dumping, it <i>will</i> raise prices and the customer service will degrade.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth this is even valid for entirely &quot;virtual&quot; market spaces. Google, Facebook, Twitter, PayPal and Amazon have no meaningful competition, they&#x27;ve managed to achieve sort-of dominance in their markets, and their customer service is atrocious at best. Amazon is interestingly a bit different because the ones that are getting the crap end of the stick are the third-party vendors who have to fight with co-mingling, AmazonBasics and fraud claims, while the end customers have a pretty decent offering.')
