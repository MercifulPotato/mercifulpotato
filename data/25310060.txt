But that&#x27;s not what people have been complaining about with regards to the new CoD game. The issue was that a lot of matches end up being disproportionally one-sided one way or the other.<p>And that&#x27;s not fun at all. While an occasional slam-dunk game is fun (or maybe even most slam-dunk games are fun, i don&#x27;t know), I cannot find anyone who would have an increased desire to play the game after they get absolutely annihilated by a vastly superior team that they cannot do absolutely anything against.<p>And that&#x27;s a sign of a bad SBMM system. A &quot;perfect&quot; SBMM system would always put you in matches where you are either slightly better or slightly worse than the other team. Turns out, that&#x27;s the scenario that optimizes for engagement the most (at least from personal observations across a ton of different video games and real-life competitive sports I participated in).<p>If I won a game by a tiny margin, I feel proud and exhilarated. If I lost a game by a tiny margin, I feel incentivized to play more, because &quot;only if I did this one small thing differently, we would have won, let&#x27;s play one more game and see&quot;. If I won by a giant margin, it feels good too, so I might as well continue playing more. But if I lost by a giant margin, it drops all desire I had to continue this gaming session, because no amount of incremental improvements to my gameplay I can do within a day that would have let me somehow close the 30-100 point gap in that game (so, in a sense, it feels like i was set up for a game that i stand zero chance of winning, and that&#x27;s pretty demotivating).<p>Losing by a tiny bit is a learning moment that makes you feel like you can win if you try a bit better or improve in one specific aspect a little bit. You learn from those kinds of losses, and the feeling of improvement is good. Losing by a giant margin makes you learn nothing. Just like in basketball or chess. Playing against someone who is slightly better than you are is fun. Playing against someone who is a pro (while you are a beginner) isn&#x27;t fun, because of the sheer width of the skill gap. There is no &quot;victory carrot&quot; hanging in front of you to motivate you to continue playing, because that &quot;victory carrot&quot; is located on the other continent, and you aren&#x27;t keen on swimming across the pacific ocean in one go.<p>So, at least in this case, the incentive of the matchmaking system being good aligns with the increased engagement. Or so I believe, based upon my personal observations and anecdata.')
