Not only that, but you can&#x27;t enforce your &quot;set of principles&quot; on billion of tweets each hour of the day, not by people at least, so you defer to bots, which are incapable of discerning what is free speech. They can&#x27;t apply your principles with the discernment of a human, they can&#x27;t enforce what&#x27;s legal or illegal, like they can&#x27;t recognize copyrighted music from public domains ones.')
