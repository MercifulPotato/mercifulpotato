Consider 3 people:<p>- Morgan. Worked 80 hour weeks for 40 years developing treatments for childhood cancer. Runs a charity supporting orphanages in their free time. Net worth: 8 million, income: 1 million<p>- Sam. Started the largest pornography empire in the world and works as the CEO. Accused of child sex trafficking on multiple occasions, but no proof. Net worth: 8 million, income: 1 million<p>- Jordan. Their great grandparents started a mining company and they inherited a trust fund. Never worked in their life. Net worth: 8 million, income: 1 million<p>I’m willing to bet people would have value judgements on how much each person should pay in taxes. People do tie moral, emotional, or ethical considerations to what they consider fair. I personally believe these three people should be taxed almost the same, as the value judgements should have an impact elsewhere. I think estate&#x2F;wealth taxes would be the only case where there should be a divergence, as they would only apply to the third person. What do you think?')
