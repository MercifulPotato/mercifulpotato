Search “robot” in Google Images and you’ll notice it immediately.&quot;</i><p>This is the most asinine thing I have ever read.<p>Search &quot;industrial robot&quot; and you will see that actual robots can be all kinds of colors. Though I speculate that the authors of this &quot;study&quot; will conclude that only laboring robots are not white and that also has some sinister meaning.<p>NASA and early space exploration give us low energy absorption and high space visibility white and everything utopian futuristic draws from that including Apple, Kubrick, Pixar and typical pop culture references.')
