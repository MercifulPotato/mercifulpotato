After an election is held, new members of parliament are elected and must form a governing coalition that has a majority of the members (sometimes with one party, sometimes with multiple parties) can select a new prime minister and start governing in earnest. Sometimes, they cannot come to an agreement on a governing coalition and they continue without a government for a while until they can. Belgium is infamous for having gone years without a real government that can enact policy due to their failure to establish a majority coalition. This is however very unusual.<p>Over the past couple years I&#x27;m strongly starting to believe that this is a better system of government than the US republican[1] model.<p>[1] by republican, I mean of a republic, not the GOP')
