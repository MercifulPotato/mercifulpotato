SBS has refused to retract false information outright (they have zero oversight for online operations). ABC takes over a month to retract, sometimes as long as 3 months.<p>News Corp and Fairfax both retract false information fast. From my limited experience, News Corp issued a retraction within 10 minutes of my email and Fairfax within 2 days. Both fair.<p>ABC? 2+ months. SBS? Never.<p>Without commenting on quality, at least the private sector bothers to correct what they say. ABC and SBS couldn&#x27;t care less.')
