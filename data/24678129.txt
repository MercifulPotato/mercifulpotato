Item(by='httpsterio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601810674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='I was at a summer thing for two weeks when I was 10, learning how to draw comics and illustrate. There was at the same time a course on making websites with MS Frontpage and publishing them on the city council&#x27;s hosting service so I stumbled on that and ended up spending a few days putting my drawings online. After that, I played around making computer graphics for a year or so before we had a HTML course at my school.<p>That was kinda it, I ended up spending time with free webhosts and visual page building tools. This was around 2003 or so and after that I started to learn how to use FTP tools and and make websites from scratch.<p>From 2003 to 2007 I made a ton of basic sites for a ton of different projects like counter strike clans, tutorials, video game cheats etc. In 2008 I set up my first WordPress site to write reviews about electronic music and that kind of blew up and I outgrew my shared web hotel pretty fast with over 100k daily visitors and 1tb monthly traffic so after that I had to learn how to self-host on Linux VPS servers and how to build lighter sites with less db queries to keep up with the demand.<p>My site got hacked twice due to bad plugins and not understanding basic web security so in 2010 I moved into static site generators and separating file hosting (as that was 99% of the traffic) and the website. I finally ran the site down in 2013 because I lost interest in the music scene due to it changing too much.<p>These days I&#x27;m doing mostly client work, but I&#x27;m self taught so I have to be careful about the projects I pick as I&#x27;m not a stellar JS dev. I can do most basic operations from hosting and Linux server admin to frontend development and web design but most my of contracts are these days in UX design and usability studies and less on the technical side.')
