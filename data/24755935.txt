Prior to his death, should he have been allowed to post on Twitter encouraging the murders of more people?  Would Twitter have been a &quot;hateful extremist&quot; for banning him and other Al Qaeda accounts?  Or -- and here me out here -- would it have been acceptable to ban him?  If so, then there <i>is</i> a line somewhere.  And if there is a line, then why shouldn&#x27;t modern day Neo-Nazis calling for the deaths of Jews be on the other side of the line as well?')
