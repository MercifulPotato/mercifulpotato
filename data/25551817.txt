A nice bonus of doing this outside (besides the fresh air, etc) is you can often recall precisely where you were and what was on your visual field (since it&#x27;s constantly changing unlike at home) when you had a particular thought, so you can refer to to it later as &quot;that thought I had when I was approaching that icecream truck in Red Hook&quot;.<p>If you are self-conscious like I was when I first started doing this, it helps to put on some kind of headphone, if only to put yourself at peace by the thought &quot;they&#x27;ll just think I&#x27;m talking on the phone&quot;.<p>When I have a good thought, I record it on my phone (or dictate it into Gboard, which works offline) and later upload the mp3 to an app called Otter, which gives extremely good transcription and allow me to search through years&#x27; worth of voice notes by text but also be able to instantly hear myself talking from 2 years&#x27; ago, which I find to be much more effective for resuming a train of thought than looking at typed notes.')
