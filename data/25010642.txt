It&#x27;s not his fault that you can hear him, it&#x27;s your office manager&#x2F;designer.<p>Some of us really do have to spend a huge chunk of our day talking to other people on the phone, zoom, etc.  There&#x27;s n other way to get our jobs done, and if they don&#x27;t give us private office space to do it in, then we have to do it in the open space they do give us.')
