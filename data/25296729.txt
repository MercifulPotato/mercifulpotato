Those are probably fairly standardized, so I&#x27;ll concede that she does have some technical knowledge.<p>I have however seen way to many doctorates that seem technical while they&#x27;re not. There&#x27;s a common theme in her career, and it&#x27;s not necessarily technical knowledge.<p>She worked at Microsoft research, sounds really impressive. But it was in the &quot;Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics in AI lab&quot;. which sounds like a PR stunt. Her research was supported by Stanford DARE fellowship, which is mainly concerned with increasing diversity. She was an AI researcher at Google, but it consisted in pointing out bias in datasets. Her PhD research[1] was using street view images to find pick up trucks and finding a correlation with republican voters, which sounds more like a sociological application of computer vision than a hard technical problem.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;114&#x2F;50&#x2F;13108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;114&#x2F;50&#x2F;13108</a>')
