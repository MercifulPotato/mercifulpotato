The market is what it is, and we individuals are fairly carried along like so much flotsam on the waves.<p>I agree we&#x27;re perhaps dickering over distinctions no one external cares about, akin to characters in &quot;Let That Be Your Last Battlefield&quot;. Is our internal perspective as valueless as the mindset of those characters above, or is there use in hammering out a common understanding for the general public before it&#x27;s handed to us?<p>That being asked, the distinctions may be moot. Most of us have probably 10-20 years of rapidly dwindling utility in our respective realms due to the swift boot that is ML&#x2F;DL&#x2F;etc. And your point will remain more poignant at that time: &quot;will anyone outside of our field know or care about the difference?&quot;.')
