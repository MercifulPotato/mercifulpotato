The Mechanical Universe textbooks are still available on Amazon.  If you prefer a more recent textbook, Serway&#x27;s &quot;Physics for Scientists and Engineers&quot; is well regarded, as is Halliday &amp; Resnick, though the latter is aimed more at career physicists.<p>[EDIT] Regarding the Feynman Lectures on Physics mentioned elsewhere, while Feynman indeed intended it for physics undergraduates, if you read his biographies and the views of his contemporaries, it was famous for being utterly impenetrable for actual undergraduates.  (One might even say the FLoP was a flop.)  It would probably not be a good idea to use it as your text; I&#x27;ve never heard of any undergraduate physics course that uses it.')
