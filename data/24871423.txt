If I feel manipulated or like there are arbitrary restrictions or peculiar structure to things that I can&#x27;t justify, what you&#x27;re liable to get is disengagement, leaving, etc. From a survivorship bias point of view, you might find that the kind of people who stick around and show a positive effect are those who react and apply themselves positively to structure + externally set goals + feedback.<p>That positive bump might be because the entire set of people who leave your little experiment or disengage as a result. I suggest this was&#x2F;is one of the reasons I have problems with formal education environments, much modern game design, and an general dislike of bundles and sets in products.<p>Again, that&#x27;s not to say it can&#x27;t work for your use case and temperament, but be aware you&#x27;re also likely going to turn some people off,  and they&#x27;ll tune&#x2F; opt out altogether if that&#x27;s any concern to you...')
