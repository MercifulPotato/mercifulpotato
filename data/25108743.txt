Going at 150+mph consumes a lot more gas, probably ending below 10mpg.\nThey probably had to refill halfway in between.<p>Edit: the Huracan seems to have a 90L gas tank, divided by 480km they must not have exceeded 18.75L&#x2F;100km in one go (= 17.33mpg). I.e. they must have refueled at least once, if not twice')
