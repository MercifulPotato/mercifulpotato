Or future taxpayers would be ransacked by underfunding in the case of taxpayer funded pensions.  The government tried to stop the ransacking with PPA 2006, and apparently a properly funded defined benefit pension plan is incredibly expensive (surprise), so of course companies would drop them.<p>There&#x27;s no reason for me to give control of my savings to a third party, especially now that I can buy VOO or whatever index fund I want at almost no cost.')
