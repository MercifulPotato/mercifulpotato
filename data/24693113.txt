But you force your clients to deal with the complexity right now, and you could wind up needing to change things in a different way in the future.  Neither of these concerns clearly dominates all the time - it&#x27;s a question of just how much effort you&#x27;re saving them, just how likely various changes are, etc.<p>On the other hand, if you make your internal representation support more complexity than what you hand out to your users, there arises the question of how you simplify (probably lossily!) or break when you wind up with data that can&#x27;t be expressed with the simpler interface.  But you might well be saving yourself a costly data migration down the line.  Also a decision with trade-offs that could potentially go either way.')
