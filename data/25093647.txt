But what if I did want to know if vaccines are dangerous, so I search &quot;are vaccines dangerous&quot;. If I want to find an anti-vaccine site, I should be able to do so, but the search term &quot;are vaccines dangerous&quot; should be viewed neutrally, in which case I would find links from cdc or .gov sites to be more useful that anti-vaccines sites')
