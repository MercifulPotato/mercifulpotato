For a typical user of htop, what matters is not &quot;a process&quot; or &quot;a thread&quot;, but a <i>killable unit</i>. A piece of software that, should it misbehave, I can kill and possibly restart later. Killable units are almost always individual processes. Almost never threads - I can&#x27;t think of a piece of software that can recover from having its random thread killed. Sure, I like to see threads - particularly in tree view - but I think the default should still be to hide them (with a more discoverable toggle than just Settings screen).')
