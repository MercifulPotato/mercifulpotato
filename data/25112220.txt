Had a similar experience with Tinder where Paying in their web application using a danish credit card failed because their cc service returned &quot;visadankort&quot;, which had to be changed to &quot;visa&quot; through the developer console for the payment to go through. Got tired of that and filed a bug. Oh the battle it took to actually convince them that an entire country is unable to pay in the web app using their de facto credit card.')
