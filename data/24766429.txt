If a program is able to distinguish cats from dogs, don’t talk about how a machine is learning to see. Instead talk about how people contributed examples in order to define the visual qualities distinguishing “cats” from “dogs” in a rigorous way for the first time. There&#x27;s always a second way to conceive of any situation in which AI is purported. &quot;<p>It&#x27;s basically like saying it&#x27;s all really just &quot;curve-fitting&quot;, a mathematical tool which which requires smart mathematicians and programmers to implement successfully, not anything genuinely intelligent about the software.')
