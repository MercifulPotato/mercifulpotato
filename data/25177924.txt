If my power-washing forum gets to over 10m users I&#x27;m now legally obligated to publish everything that doesn&#x27;t violate US law, regardless of my site&#x27;s content moderation policy?<p>What about large platforms based in other countries with a strong user base in the US, or vice versa?  Do you force tech companies based internationally to comply with US law for content moderation purposes globally, or just for US residents?  If not, what&#x27;s to stop Facebook from moving their offices to Canada and continuing their business model as-is?<p>I fail to see how this is an even remotely reasonable assertion.')
