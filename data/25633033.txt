If your codebase is becoming increasingly spaghetti, and management doesn&#x27;t let you take time to do meaningful refactoring because you gotta push out deliverables, apparently in FP this just...doesn&#x27;t happen?<p>I also like how the author says that Toyota&#x27;s bad acceleration and Boeing&#x27;s 737 MAX were victims of spaghetti code, therefore it must be OOP, but provides no sources to prove that these codebases even were OOP, much less that being FP would have helped prevent these errors in any meaningful way.<p>There&#x27;s so much restated information, this article is at least twice as long as it needs to be.')
