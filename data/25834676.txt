They are unable to sustain this tech by themselves nor with AMD anymore. \nIt seems to me when Apple releases their new CPUs I am going to have to move to that platform in order to keep up with the competition (quicker the core, I can do calculations quicker and quicker deliver the product). Currently I am on AMD, but it is only marginally faster than M1 it seems.')
