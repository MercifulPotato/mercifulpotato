It does not run any operating system without the necessary modifications.<p>So, no, it does not help Amiga emulation directly unless someone adds Amiga hardware emulation support to QEMU based on top of this work.<p>But it will certainly help the Amiga indirectly by providing a fast development and testing target for the Motorola 68000 CPU.')
