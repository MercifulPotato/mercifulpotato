There are a few full text&#x2F;archiving solutions out there but they all seem to be very manually driven. Automating that properly seems to be hard to make slick enough.<p>One very easy win though would be to address the fact that history in browsers only allows you to see and sort by the most recent date you visited a page. So you can&#x27;t really answer the question &quot;what are the pages I visited in March this year?&quot; (for example) with any confidence and you can&#x27;t be sure you&#x27;ve got all the pages you visited in a particular cluster if you might have gone back to one of them later.')
