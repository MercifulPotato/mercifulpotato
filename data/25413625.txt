I was looking at tools on Amazon since I was given a gift card for it and I see tools listed as being &quot;stainless steel&quot; but in the reviews you have 90% of the reviews saying the product was blessed by Jesus and 10% giving one star reviews with pictures showing the &quot;stainless steel&quot; was rusting immediately and fracturing under normal use.<p>How does a product flat out lying about its specs and getting called out end up still on the store selling well?')
