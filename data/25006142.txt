Item(by='mleonhard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604653074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003133, text='Another problem is that SF shelters have schedules that exclude working people.<p>Shelters require folks to line up for entry in the early afternoon.  Many unskilled jobs require late evening work (restaurant dishwasher, line cook, bus boy, janitor, etc).  So folks leaving work at 11pm cannot get into the shelters.<p>Shelters kick everyone out in the early morning.  Folks who work at night cannot get in to shelters at all.  Night shift work is very important for unskilled folks (security guard, janitor, warehouse, etc).<p>Also, many shelters are run by religious organizations and require guests to spend time attending religious presentations every day.<p>I think 80% of the homelessness problem can be solved by providing free housing for these extremely poor people.  Housing will not turn them all into successful citizens, but it will stop them from sleeping on the streets.  Comprehensive health care (including therapy and long-term psychiatric care) can solve another 10%.  The last 10% are folks who just prefer to live on the streets.<p>Unfortunately, free housing in SF is very expensive because of the housing shortage.  The city already houses many formerly homeless folks, spending $200M&#x2F;year.  Housing the remaining 8,000 would take at least $200M&#x2F;year more.  This would be a 4% increase in SF&#x27;s $5B annual budget.')
