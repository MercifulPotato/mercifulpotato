They break decades of convention in how to write POSIX-like applications, and force developers into locked-in practices.<p>Android gives lip service to the NDK, but in practice you can&#x27;t really run many useful C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Golang&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;etc programs on Android, because the system breaks POSIX. You can&#x27;t keep a simple webserver running without starting a foreground service, which requires Java&#x2F;Kotlin. There&#x27;s no &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf for DNS resolution, so you have to use custom servers or use the Android NDK compiler (which can be a huge pain). Plus they lock down the filesystem more each year. Android 10&#x2F;11 are a complete mess on this front. Fortunately they&#x27;ve rolled back some of the more draconian changes, but only because of developer outcry. The fact that they even wanted to do some of the things in the first place is sad.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is an easy problem to solve, but it&#x27;s obvious that the big boys have only made a token (if that) effort to build a good, open way of doing it.')
