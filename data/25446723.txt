He stated two facts... relief loans were not required to cover wages.  Loans &lt;$150k can be forgiven.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to require some % of the loans to cover wages of employee&#x27;s whose hours were cut or were furloughed completely.<p>That said, a better option would have been direct payments to employees from the government. The $1200 check model but on a larger scale (ie, $1200&#x2F;month or similar).')
