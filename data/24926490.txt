Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603938958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24926266, text='&gt; The official .deb is 156MB compressed, which is prohibitive for all but the largest OSS projects.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this statement. Why is 156MB prohibitive? You don&#x27;t need to include Bazel in the project any more than you need to include Xcode for the macOS version of a project. You can specify a version of Bazel with .bazelversion so you don&#x27;t need to worry so much about people using the wrong Bazel.<p>There are some systems like Waf and Autotools where the build system is customarily bundled inside the source release, but this is not universal--if you use CMake, it&#x27;s almost certainly not bundled either.<p>&gt; Most tellingly, Google has gone through two major build system migrations (Android and Chrome), and neither project chose to migrate to Bazel&#x2F;Blaze. If Google won&#x27;t eat their own dogfood, it doesn&#x27;t inspire much confidence.<p>Android is a fairly large project itself consisting of the Kernel (which has got its own custom build system) and a ton of different components. From what I understand, for NDK projects, Bazel is moving towards &quot;the one sane way to do things&quot;, it will just take time, this stuff doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. For non-NDK (pure Java or Kotlin) projects, there&#x27;s not really a point.<p>Chromium is a bit of a special snowflake and predates Bazel&#x27;s Windows support, and a codebase the size of Chromium would take a long time to migrate--but it looks like it&#x27;s heading in that direction. From what I can see in the revisions to the Chromium build system, it seems that it&#x27;s massive custom build system is moving towards Bazel by leaps and bounds. It&#x27;s already structured like a Bazel project and uses much of the same terminology, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a few hundred Bazel scripts appear overnight in Chrome, because it looks like much of the groundwork has been done.')
