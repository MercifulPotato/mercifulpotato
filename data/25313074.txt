If it can&#x27;t recognize people of some category then it <i>can&#x27;t</i> be used to discriminate against them, e.g. the police can&#x27;t use it to identify peaceful protesters with those characteristics. I wonder what would have happened if the these networks were much better at recognizing women and people of color, would the paper then be about Google designing technology to detect minorities?')
