Nothing else presented a big enough pain point to motivate a full switch -- I was mostly happy using Windows and SSHing into Linux to work. I often leave my computer on overnight with the expectation I can pick up whatever I was doing, but Windows Update would force reboot without warning me ahead of time and I&#x27;d lose all my stuff. Many times I needed to start my computer and do something right away, but Update decided it needed the next 20 minutes. I remember one particular instance when I needed to shut my laptop down to put in my backback (it was pouring outside) and get to a class, but when I shut down it went into a lengthy update without giving me an option to skip.<p>On Linux I am rarely if ever compelled to reboot unless I upgrade the kernel and want to use specific features like virtualization. There&#x27;s just no going back once you get used to this.')
