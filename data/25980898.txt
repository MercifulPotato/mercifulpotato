Item(by='Nevermark', descendants=None, kids=[25981981], score=None, time=1612116102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979958, text='I hate to say “Bitcoin” because of its high risk, short track record, volatility, faddish aura, etc, but:<p>I believe it’s filling a gap beyond being a better gold-like asset. Better gold = digitally portable, 24 hr liquidity, digital literate friendly, fixed cap, transactions (even with its limits), decentralized control, etc.<p>But the solidly fixed cap is more profound than I think most people recognize. Potentially, once Bitcoin finds its “true” price, it will continue to grow in value in proportion to all wealth in the economy - over the long run. So it won’t just be a hedge against downturns, but eventually a semi-stable way of sharing in overall increasing wealth in the economy.<p>I don’t know of another instrument that anyone can easily buy that might track (over the long run) with global wealth as apposed to particular entities or particular aspects of the economy.<p>So in that sense, anyone can participate in overall wealth growth. A very useful new tool!<p>OF COURSE, this is SPECULATION on my part. But I think the idea of a total global wealth correlated asset is new and useful.')
