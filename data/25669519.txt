Item(by='Tepix', descendants=None, kids=[25669657], score=None, time=1610015980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668517, text='&gt; So you are going to move from one centralized, walled garden, privacy hostile platform that hard requires Google&#x2F;Apple ecosystems to get signed updates... to another with identical drawbacks.<p>Ideally we&#x27;d have a polished, decentralized app. Signal is a compromise. I don&#x27;t think the drawbacks are identical:<p>Facebook&#x27;s business model depends on violatings the privacy of the users. The Signal Foundation has no such need.<p>The client is open source. I see no reason to call Signal &quot;privacy hostile&quot;.')
