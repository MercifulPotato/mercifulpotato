Except for the blame part:<p>&gt; Those people are the ones running the tech giants today, pushing locked down hardware, and trying to crush general computing as a thing.<p>To blame individuals will solve nothing. This is a systemic problem. There is a strong incentive to gate-keep computers for maximum profitability, put anyone in charge of a tech company and they will feel the market pressure to extract as much value as possible from each user and close doors to competition.<p>Only regulations that change the industry environment will make it work for consumers. And, that regulations are clearly needed. Or locked down hardware is the only hardware that will exist in the future controlled by a few corporations that have locked in everybody else.')
