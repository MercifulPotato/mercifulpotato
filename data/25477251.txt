Just because someone was a mediocre academic doesn&#x27;t mean that they weren&#x27;t a great candidate from Google&#x27;s point of view. There are also lots of very successful academics who Google wouldn&#x27;t hire.<p>For my part, I had a couple of decent shots at getting a tenure-track job, but I doubt I&#x27;d make it through more than a couple of rounds of Google&#x27;s interview process. Perhaps it&#x27;s easier than I think though (I&#x27;ve not tried it), but for sure there are vastly more people who want to work at Google than there are positions available.<p>The chance of getting a tenure track job can vary a lot from field to field, so it&#x27;s not surprising that people are reporting very different views on this.')
