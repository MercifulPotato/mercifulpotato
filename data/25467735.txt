I came back from a vacation the day after they announced it and checked here, &#x2F;r&#x2F;programming, and a few other developer-focused forums including their own site and it was like the world was on fire. There were very few people who supported the change or were even indifferent. It seemed like the entire community united against it. JetBrains really didn&#x27;t have a choice but to listen.
