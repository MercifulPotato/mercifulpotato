Why do people have to carry a wallet everywhere, unless they want to?<p>I have my payment cards on my watch. Pre-pandemic, my gym membership card was on my watch. If I had my ID on my watch as well, I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about a wallet being stolen because I wouldn&#x27;t carry one.<p>Sure, people can steal your watch at gunpoint- but it can be remotely disabled (even if you were forced to give your passcode under duress), and you&#x27;d still have a physical ID card at home you can use.')
