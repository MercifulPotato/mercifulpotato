A lot of the tools of frequentism were developed for a time that is quite different to our own.<p>Just personally, I don&#x27;t think frequentism is incompatible...it seems to have just been built up to frame everything in terms of a problem that is tractable (i.e. t-tests), and that is effective but comes with pitfalls. In economics, as an example, it seems that this toolset has gone pretty far.<p>What I like about Bayesianism, to my ill-informed mind, is that Bayes Theorem feels parallel to other parts of statistics that are effective: Kalman filters, Metropolis-Hastings, MDPs, even ELO is Bayesian (Glicko makes this explicit). And, this is in no way empirical but, when the results are directly comparable then I have seen better results (even when the Bayesian model is at an information deficit). No idea if that generalises beyond my activities (largely, sports modelling), there are still many pitfalls, and implementation can be tricky (I still don&#x27;t understand Bayesian Data Analysis)...but it is pretty useful.')
