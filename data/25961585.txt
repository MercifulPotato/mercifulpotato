There are other successful games that use deckbuilding as an element of a larger game (in the vein of Clank or Quest for El Dorado), but no pure deckbuilding game has come close to overtaking Dominion as top dog.<p>If we use logged plays for the past month on BGG as one datapoint, Dominion has more than than Aeon&#x27;s End, Ascension and Marvel Legendary combined.<p>Sure, there is a specific population of people who log their plays and it differs from the gameplaying public as a whole, but if anything it veers more towards &quot;cult of the new&quot; and away from people who still play an older game because it&#x27;s what they have.<p>EDIT: It looks like Star Realms has almost as many logged plays this month as Dominion, but I would still maintain that Dominion is in no way &quot;superseded&quot; even if it is no longer the only relevant game in its genre.')
