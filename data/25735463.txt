Unless you have actual specific information about future plans  and reason to believe in them, expecting everyone to qualify their prognostication with “this generation but it might change in some hypothetical future” is just not useful. That’s generally true of all technical topics. What’s stated today can change in the future. These aren’t physical limits being discussed.<p>Finally, Linus’ main advice is to stop focusing on AVX and focus on architectural improvements. It took an enormous amount of engineers to implement AVX512 and then even more to get rid of the power hit. I trust Linus (and back that up with my own experience and observations in the industry) that Intel would have been far better served focusing on architectural improvements like Apple did. It’s a blind spot Intel has because they know how to bump clocks and create x86 extensions but they don’t trust architectural improvements to deliver massive gains. Hell, this isn’t the first time. Netburst (which was their attempt) screwed up so badly they had to return to the P3 architecture with the Core line. Intel has the engineers but their management structure must be so bloated an inefficient to fail with such regularity.')
