I&#x27;ve used django professionally for about 8 years and I agree with you. Python (and django) is great but solves only the backend side of things.<p>Things that are by far superior in Rails in my opinion:<p>* It is a real full stack solution. From migrations to css to credentials storage to assets compilation to file uploads to rich text editing to we sockets, etc.<p>* Ruby might not be as popular as python, but it is a lot better designed (and a lot more consistent).<p>* Gems&#x2F;bundler and everything about packaging works a lot better.<p>* The routing, controllers and validations make a lot more sense to me<p>The only thing I like more from django is the built in admin. Although there are also external gems for rails which provide same functionality for rails.')
