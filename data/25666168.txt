But I have seen many of my parents&#x27; generation getting increasingly radical (I am not American, BTW. I am talking about India). They don&#x27;t have the tools to understand what is going on. Their entire life was training to &quot;read between the lines&quot; of newspaper articles and journals. They are used to subtle lies and distortions, and they can catch that. Blatant outright virulent rhetoric - with the tone &quot;this is some truth that must be told&quot; - is ok in 1 or 2 videos. But the recommendation engine enmeshes them in that mire.<p>My mother is a PhD. I asked her whether she will accept a paper without sound academic bibliography. She said no. Then why would she believe in extremist videos with shady citations and outright lies? But she does. I think it is because of the recommendation engines which keep feeding similar videos. Just like Goebbels&#x27; maxim of repeating a lie often enough and loudly enough to make it the truth.<p>We can keep saying that our algorithms are fine. But if what we see today has never been seen in history, I think it is high time that we re-evaluate our current beliefs about the impact and the correctness of our work.')
