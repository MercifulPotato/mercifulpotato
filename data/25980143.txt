Earlier this week a former candidate for city government was opining that new &quot;gentrification tower&quot; - actually tremendously expensive and not at all luxurious studio apartments in a 5 story building -- were all vacant! Look at all these available apartments!<p>But these truthers simply never understand the numbers. In the first place they always underestimate the number of occupied apartments in a building. In the specific case there are 170 apartments and 90 of them are already occupied. In the second place, they always underestimate normal vacancy rates. Zero is not a healthy vacancy rate. 10% is a healthy and normal vacancy rate in functioning markets. Finally, these people don&#x27;t understand the process of leasing out a new building. It usually takes a full year to get to 90%. Again in the specific building I heard about, they only got their certificate of occupancy in September 2020, are already more than half occupied, and are leasing out at about 1 per day which is well ahead of the normal pace.')
