The surgical masks prevented much of the smoke from going out the front, the &quot;cloth mask he borrowed from his wife&quot; let much of the smoke come through the mask.<p>Regarding the rest of the video, his claim of &quot;masks have no effect&quot; seems to be easily demonstrated as false from his experiments. Yes, some smoke does leak, but compare that to him exhaling without a mask. You would get a blast of vape smoke right in your face. The masks clearly filter some smoke and deflect the rest of the smoke away from where he&#x27;s facing. While obviously not perfect, it looks like a clear improvement to me.<p>Finally, comparing smoke to covid-19 is disingenuous. You will almost never find individual virus particles floating around the air, they will instead be contained in water droplets which you exhale.')
