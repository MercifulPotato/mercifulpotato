In that match viper made 3 docks on a land map and no feudal army.<p>As T90 himself said, &quot;The trouble with playing viper is that if viper memes me, and I win, people just say oh T90 isn&#x27;t good, viper wasn&#x27;t trying. And if I lose, well, T90 can&#x27;t even beat viper when he&#x27;s not trying. So it&#x27;s a lose-lose situation.&quot; Too true.<p>I see he is #96 on rankings right now though, that&#x27;s terrific. Being able to beat #1 isn&#x27;t the only measure of success and I don&#x27;t mean to imply otherwise.')
