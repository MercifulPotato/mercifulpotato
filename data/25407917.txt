You can melt down that coin and sell the silver or use it for a myriad of industrial purposes. The value of the coin is based on the market value for the silver contained inside of it. The metal in American coins, the fibers in American dollars, are worthless (relative to the face value). The value of the American dollar derives from the the US government&#x27;s guarantees of payment on its debt, its status as legal tender within the US, and the requirement to pay US taxes with it.<p>The value of the dollar derives from the might of the American government and the productivity of its economy. A silver coin is worth its weight in silver even if the government and economy that issued it long stopped existing. The dollar is worthless without the American government and American economy backing it.')
