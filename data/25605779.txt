They sell actual products instead of you, the user(&#x27;s data). Their logistical chain does not rely upon a system of (often fellow American) warehouse workers who are pushed to the breaking point. [The developing world workforce that actually assembles their products- that&#x27;s another story, but bogus hoaxes like Mike Daisey&#x27;s only add confusion and make their supply chain working conditions seem more innocuous than critics claim.] They don&#x27;t actively contribute to the disruptions and dysfunctions in our society that social networks have brought us. Somehow just by being less readily apparently bad, people assume that means they&#x27;re more automatically good. But that&#x27;s a fallacy; the badness can exist elsewhere, and given a culture of secrecy and silence, can be readily hidden.')
