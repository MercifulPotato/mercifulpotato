Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610714305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787361, text='Assuming that the focus is to be on treating all humans equal, the last thing you should want is to split all humans up into identity categories, to be put on a set of scales so as to promote &quot;justice&quot;. Don&#x27;t agree with the list? Go ahead and make a new one. Make sure to be open about your criteria so that readers will know if you add weighted categories - left-handedness, brown-eyedness, feet-of-abnormal-sizedness or other such unimportant identity categories. Don&#x27;t complain if readers shun your list because they don&#x27;t consider such criteria important in deciding the literary quality of a work.')
