You have to get the timing right.<p>For Melvin Capital, they were right, until they were not - when WSB showed up. They have eaten a loss on this.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean to say that someone else was not willing to buy their shorts, for a hefty discount, with a significantly longer term time frame strategy (because they don&#x27;t have to borrow on margin), believing that once it becomes clear that Melvin are out, that Redditors will want out of GME, and GME will likely crash back to something close to its prior levels.')
