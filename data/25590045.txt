As I become a more senior developer and have to take on more managerial responsibilities my time to actually get my own work down is disappearing.<p>I started working ~1.5hrs early in the morning just so I could get my coffee&#x2F;hackernews routine out of the way and really get my head in to the work, then by the time stand-ups and meetings start I&#x27;m ready for a break and helping my team. Do an extra 30min at the end of the day wrapping things up and there&#x27;s your extra two hours being used productively.<p>I&#x27;m actually already working this schedule (5 days&#x2F;week) due to lack of senior staff at the company, I just want to formalise it and get Mondays off...<p>If I was purely coding my own tasks all day I would probably not get as much use out of the extra time, but my work is varied enough now that it&#x27;s not an issue.')
