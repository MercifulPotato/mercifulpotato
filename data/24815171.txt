While Algo has many sane defaults for configuration as well as (VPS) destinations and an interactive mode, this one doesn’t have any interactive features. It doesn’t seem to have have specific defaults either.<p>I may be completely wrong here since I’ve used Algo only a few times, and that was quite sometime ago. One difference I see with this is the creation of new user profiles every time it’s run. Algo, in my limited use, seems to be geared for one user profile (or creating user profiles on setup and not later?).<p>It would be great to see this integrated with Algo.')
