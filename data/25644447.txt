So yes, hospitals kill covid patients, because patients sick enough to need to go to hospital are sick enough to die.  I know you’re kind of writing in jest and looking for sources but the fact remains that admittance to ICU (when I did my ICU term, at least in Australia and at least when I did it - my brother is an ICU trainee and I raised this number with him and he said it’s lower than that now, here) carries an all source mortality risk of 30%. 30% of those who are wheeled through the doors go out in a bag.<p>To relate this to COVID, <i>generally</i> ventilators don’t cause an increase in mortality just because you are on one. This was a surprising finding during the early days. It is also contrary to what we find in influenza patients, where it is usually life saving when a patient gets too tired to breathe in their own but still has enough good lung function to be able to respire with their lungs (the alternative being ECMO, or artificial blood gas exchange). I’m on mobile and it’s late so am not at liberty to pull up the research but I recall the consensus being that there was a contradiction: patients who were sedated and ventilated were being so done on the basis of a rapid deterioration in o2 sats; but generally we’re still alert and potentially orientated. It was quickly found that prone positioning (putting a patient on their front to get more gas exchange to the apexes of their lungs) could keep then unventilated and they did better - a lesson learned pretty quickly as regions of Italy and the UK ran out of ventilators')
