Item(by='cytzol', descendants=None, kids=[24864051], score=None, time=1603406093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24863649, text='I disagree, and I&#x27;m a little bit insulted.<p>I&#x27;m pretty much in Gemini&#x27;s <i>exact target market</i>: my websites are simple and almost entirely text, with no tracking, minimal JavaScript, and a hefty CSP. I like implementing simple network protocols and I&#x27;m annoyed with the ever-increasing complexity of the Web. And I write command-line software, so Gemini is right up my alley. So when I first heard of it, about a year ago, I was really excited for there to be a new way to convert my sites to this new, simpler hypertext–<p>But when I tried it, it didn&#x27;t let me build the sort of site that I, personally, would want to read.<p>• The documentation sites for my software (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specsheet.software" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;specsheet.software</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dns.lookup.dog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dns.lookup.dog</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the.exa.website" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the.exa.website</a>) all feature inline code samples, complete with the colours you&#x27;ll see in your terminal. Being able to see an example command and then see its <i>exact</i> output really helps me learn a tool, and I wish more programs were documented in this way. When I re-wrote the documentation as man pages, it was like going from colour to black-and-white, and when I Gemini-ified the documentation, it felt like I was reading man pages.<p>• My personal home page has blog posts that use styles to sound like the way I talk. I <i>emote</i>. I <i>emphasise</i>. I bold important sentences, and shove side-notes to the side. If I&#x27;m writing technically, I&#x27;ll include charts and side-tables of data. And, again, I like to include syntax-highlighted code snippets and images where appropriate.<p>I&#x27;m not a marketer. I abhor advertising. I&#x27;m not trying to usurp the world&#x27;s communications channel for my own gain. I&#x27;m just trying to publish content I want to see more of, and my attempts at offering a Gemini version resulted in exactly zero pages.<p>This is why it disappoints me when you say this:<p>&gt; The rest of the web is either (1) best served some other way or (2) not worth keeping.<p>Do you really think I belong with &quot;the rest of the web&quot;? Or do you think my sites are not worth keeping?')
