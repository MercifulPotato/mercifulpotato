How I got here is pretty complicated. I can only attribute my ability to overcome these experiences to those who genuinely cared. These are the people who cared enough to help me succeed but also let me fail and deal with the consequences. In high school, I was a low C to D student. I slept in class. I refused to do homework. I thought the schools were only temporary, so therefore they did not matter. I only passed classes because I excelled at test taking and understood the material. I felt like it was all a game-- people, school, relationships. None of it mattered and all I had to do was find the right way to play. After foster care, I had a free ride (I was still in care), but failed out of college because I didn&#x27;t see a point. I joined the military. This forced structure and  discipline actually helped me. I understood this game and excelled. I used my experience in the military to get an entry level job in IT and continue to grow. \nThere are residual effects that I will always deal with. I have huge gaps in memory from when I was a kid- I don&#x27;t remember much before age 11.  I compartmentalize things too easily. I can be impatient with people. I dislike and distrust bureaucracies. I don&#x27;t have enough patience for incompetence. I could go on, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s not why you&#x27;re here :)')
