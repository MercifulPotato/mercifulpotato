I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that that position <i>does</i> exist, which your post lines up with ;).<p>However, I think something significant to note here about if it&#x27;s an overreaction or not is that even these cups are still traditional Christmas colors. We&#x27;re a really long way away from them saying something like &quot;it&#x27;s not a holiday season at all,&quot; or &quot;the actual holidays are some other time.&quot;<p>So if on one side we have a &quot;let&#x27;s be a little more inclusive of our friends celebrating different holidays&quot; and on the other side we have &quot;let&#x27;s replace your holidays to help encourage a future violent revolution&quot; it seems to me that they&#x27;ve only taken the babiest of baby steps towards the former, not the latter. (One wonders what the reaction would be if they came out with Hanukkah colored cups - lets not forget that there are non-&quot;replacement&quot;-motivated other holidays out there...)')
