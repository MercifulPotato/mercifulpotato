This article presents the solution but to explain a little bit more, the general configuration for eSignature in Woleet Sign is the platform generating keys for each signer (generated randomly in each request) and then send private links by email and OTP SMS if a phone number is provided. So in the end Woleet timestamps a proof that the person controlling a specific email and a specific phone number had a specific document in his possession and agreed to sign. It&#x27;s also possible to use our signature system with your own keys associated with people with verified identities (KYC), to comply with &quot;advanced&quot; eSignature regulation in Europe.')
