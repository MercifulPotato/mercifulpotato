You can literally observe earths rotation from mosque timings). There&#x27;s no such thing like national prayer time, muslims use apps or leaflets with the timings calculated for each city.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t know much about religion practices. Maybe the precision timing is a Turkish thing.')
