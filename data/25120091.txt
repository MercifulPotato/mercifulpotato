Some team members just could not accept the constant litter of `if err != nil` no matter how many times I repeated that Rob Pike says it&#x27;s OK. It goes against deeply held beliefs that all programmers internalize early on, for good reason.<p>Itâ€™s probably why some parts of Go internally have also used panics for flow control (the JSON decoder, famously), and just convert them to errors at the boundaries. This was our plan, but we were not careful about protecting all the goroutine launches. As I said elsewhere in the thread I think we would have welcomed working together on this if the Dolt folks had wanted to.')
