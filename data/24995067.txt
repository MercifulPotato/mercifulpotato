Illegal != immoral, take for example the Jews in Nazi Germany because it&#x27;s required by the internet to invoke Nazis :) . Anyways, had cryptocurrencies existed when the some Jews were trying to escape Germany, and had those Jews moved their assets into crypto it would have certainly been illegal but that does not mean it would have been immoral. There are quite a few people in which anonymous funds not trackable by the government lends to their moral cause, though that cause may very well be illegal in their country.')
