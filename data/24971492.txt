They don&#x27;t always include the conclusion, or without sufficient detail to act on it without reading the actual conclusion section.<p>This contrasts with the style GP talks about (also used in the US military, referred to as &quot;Bottom Line Up Front&quot; or &quot;BLUF&quot;). The <i>first</i> thing is the conclusion&#x2F;actionable part with enough detail to start acting without needing to read the rest, and often zero justification (more a statement of fact or a directive: we will do X starting on Monday). Most of the rest contains things like analysis of alternatives or rationales, useful for some of the people to use but not essential for most to read.<p>Some academic papers (taken as a whole) are similar to this, but it&#x27;s not universal.')
