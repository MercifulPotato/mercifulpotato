Well, there goes the newsworthiness...<p>Edit: Can someone please explain my error here? This comment [1] (as well as the immediately surrounding thread) indicates the limit applies to a <i>business account</i> that pays <i>lower rates</i>, and you have the unlimited right to ship on a non-business account that pays higher rates. Thus, the limit is really just a limit on the discounted rate. Which is equivalent to a price increase. Which is totally unsurprising and dog-bites-man for a case of high demand and difficulty increasing capacity. Thus, no longer newsworthy.<p>So where&#x27;s my error, really?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25348485" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25348485</a>')
