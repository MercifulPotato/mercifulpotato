The more you work the more you feel in control, and&#x2F;or the more you distract yourself from your feelings. The pay and job duties don&#x27;t matter so much, I know someone who is a workaholic on low paid low skill job.<p>If you don&#x27;t have those personal issues, then yeah, you&#x27;d find it hard to relate to.')
