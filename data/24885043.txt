The RIAA probably won&#x27;t try to take it down unless the youtube-dl development is actually relocated there or they become aware of it somehow. You&#x27;d have to host it in a country where DMCA can safely be ignored (anonymously of course), e.g. the Netherlands or Russia, if you want it to stay up reliably.')
