For the vast majority of projects though I&#x27;d assume the following to be smart behaviour:<p>- Is it robust<p>- Is it fast (enough)<p>- Is it the simplest way to achieve those levels of robustness and speed<p>If the answer to the first 2 is largely &quot;yes&quot; and the 3rd is &quot;no&quot; then I&#x27;d call it a bad hack. OTOH if the answer to 3 is also &quot;yes&quot; then it&#x27;s a good hack. If the answer to 1 or 2 is &quot;no&quot; then it&#x27;s not ready to ship.<p>In either case a comment saying &quot;this is the simple&#x2F;safe way, performance opportunity via...&quot; Or &quot;this is the complicated way because &lt;reasons complicated way was needed, usually perf&gt; and it this is why it works...&quot; is good to leave in case performance requirements ever change or someone is trying to figure out why you went the way you did.')
