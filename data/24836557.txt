Some of the early Smalltalk demos exhibit this beautifully, and they&#x27;re from the 70s. It almost feels like the era of &quot;rich media&quot; embodied by Encarta, &quot;animated storybooks&quot;, etc., was the dying gasp of that conceptualization.<p>The common association with computers as mechanisms of boredom, exclusion, and wage slavery is so strong now that it&#x27;s hard to imagine anyone seriously countenancing the old paradigm that the technology was meant to allow. I don&#x27;t know whether that outcome was ultimately inevitable or not, but either way, it&#x27;s massively disappointing.')
