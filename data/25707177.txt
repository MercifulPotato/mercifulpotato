Item(by='jacques_chester', descendants=None, kids=[25712898], score=None, time=1610241109, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706204, text='&gt; <i>The CRD schema is global but versioned, so it&#x27;s annoying-but-manageable with multiple tenants.</i><p>It means every controller for a CRD winds up installing <i>another</i> webhook. And having to test a variety of orderings. It&#x27;s hard to get right.<p>&gt; <i>Controllers can be scoped to a namespace without requiring cluster-level permissions, no?</i><p>The difficulty is that Kubernetes RBAC is good at expressing rules &quot;Role &#x27;foo&#x27; can perform operation &#x27;list&#x27; on kind &#x27;Deployment&#x27;&quot;. But it&#x27;s less capable of saying something like &quot;Role &#x27;foo&#x27; can perform operation &#x27;list&#x27; on kind &#x27;Deployment&#x27; which were created from kind &#x27;CoolerDeployment&#x27;&quot;. It&#x27;s also hard to delegate something, along the lines of &quot;Role &#x27;foo&#x27; can delegate (&#x27;create&#x27; over kind &#x27;Deployment&#x27;) within namespace &#x27;bar&#x27;&quot;.<p>I think dissatisfaction with PodSecurityPolicy will cause Rego to worm its way into the core architecture over the coming years. It&#x27;ll then eventually crowd out RBAC because you can impose (sort of, more or less) arbitrary rules. But none will dare call it ABAC.')
