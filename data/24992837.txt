I&#x27;ve heard good arguments to suggest it isn&#x27;t very robust in the hands of kids... but from my own perspective all my micro HDMI cables are much thinner than my full-sized HDMI ones and they... just sit better. That said I&#x27;ve got an M.2 PCIe 2230SSD hanging out of the USB port on an adapter, so any grace or elegance is gone from my setup.<p>Edit: mini to micro (mini on the Pi Zero, micro on Pi 4&#x2F;Pi 400)')
