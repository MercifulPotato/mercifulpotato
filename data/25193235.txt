I can point to multiple systemic disadvantages that men have right now - but your examples are from 100 years ago or are very vague.  If the systemic oppression of women in the US is so vast as to necessitate laws that advantage or disadvantage individuals based on their sex, then I think it should also be pretty easy to point to.<p>As far as talking with women about the sexism they&#x27;ve experienced - I&#x27;ve never denied women experience sexism.  I&#x27;ve explicitly acknowledged that multiple times.  My point is that the sexism they experience is not an organized system of oppression (i.e. it is not &quot;systemic&quot;).  There are multiple, explicit, and codified systems that disadvantage men and I have pointed to several of them.')
