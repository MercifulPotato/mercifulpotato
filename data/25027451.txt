Many others were delayed until March 2021. I found another model that was supposedly available now, but 1 week before delivery in October my order was bumped out to 2021. This happened two more times.<p>Luckily I don&#x27;t have very particular needs in a dishwasher and I have a trailer. Somebody at the big box hardware store near me canceled their order and because I&#x27;m constantly looking, I was able to pick one up just this very morning. When I picked it up, another customer was trying to buy it.<p>If you&#x27;re able to be flexible, then you can probably get something in less than 6 months. A buddy of mine has a less-commonly sized space for their fridge which he cannot change w&#x2F;o tearing apart the kitchen and the soonest he can get a replacement is February. They are living out of a couple dorm-room refrigerators until then.')
