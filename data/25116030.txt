In fact this tends to be -more- of a problem using Legacy glass on Mirrorless systems today.<p>I also doubt it will prevent the use of &#x27;legacy glass&#x27;. If there&#x27;s one thing my experience with Sony mounts has taught me, -somebody- will make an adapter. Yes, it may involve another element or two in the path to rectify. But I would be -shocked- if Sony didn&#x27;t have a path here; a decent amount of e-mount adoption has been thanks to the adaptability of the system, and my guess is they can easily price this in a product where they can make money without worrying about attach rate (how many lenses the consumer buys).')
