Well, I built this mental model that goes like this:<p><pre><code>    1. If a task is difficult, simplify it by splitting it to smaller tasks. Sort them in ascending order of ease.\n    2. Start questioning the &quot;how&quot;s on your smaller tasks and do your research to find multiple solutions, suggestions for improvement, optimizations, potential rewrites before becoming a bottleneck that would demand a major refactoring.\n    3. See whether you have answered your &quot;how&quot;s from #2 or not. If not, go to #1.\n    4. Based on #2, find the best material possible other experts in that field suggest or highly recommend; try not to fall in commercial traps or biased reviews. There are lots of valuable resource on such topic, and trust me GitHub has incredible content in markdown format with ultra-advanced levels of explanations.\n    5. Narrow down your expertise in a specific tool set, be it languages or IDEs &#x2F; editors of your choice and learn them inside out as much as you can. E.g.: you want to master your craft around web development; fair enough. Learn JavaScript in depth and use the framework your current job demands you to know. Go to #1, then to #4, and then #3.\n    6. Start writing a blog or an ebook. Guess what; after a certain amount of time, you have just become yourself the mentor you have always wanted.\n</code></pre>\nAt least that was my own experience so far ¯\\_ (ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>It does not mean I&#x27;m a success though :D I&#x27;m a living failure, that&#x27;s why I always push myself to become better at what I do.<p>I&#x27;m an eternal student!')
