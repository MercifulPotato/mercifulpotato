I quit my highpaying job and its been fun for awhile, but since the pandemic hit I&#x27;m finding zero work. I keep getting passed over after going through all the hoops of tech interviewing. It&#x27;s exhausting.<p>One thing you should talk to your doctor about is  temporary leave of absence. I took 3 months off although it wasn&#x27;t nearly enough it was enough to get my shit straight. I quit shortly after because corporate America is a toxic shithole especially for people like us with mental health issues.<p>Even if you quit and worked part time, the only real option out there is upwork. Pay is crap and you&#x27;re competing with India.<p>I would say find a way to stay where you are until this pandemic nonsense is over.')
