It seems I wasn&#x27;t clear enough in my original post, but this is my overall point. GDPR doesn&#x27;t require consent, but consent is required because of ePD.<p>&gt;  latest draft of its new version<p>&gt; So Matomo can still do without the user consent<p>The new draft is not law yet. It&#x27;s been 6 months away from passing for several years now. In the meantime, fines are still being issued under the existing law. Google got fined a hundred million euro last month in France, and that fine was <i>very specifically</i> ePD and <i>not</i> GDPR for a variety fo reasons.')
