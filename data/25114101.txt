Your comment also contains other, specific false statements:<p>&gt; <i>long term effects failed dramatically in animal testing.</i><p>That is incorrect.<p>&gt; <i>They use tests that can give false positives (PCR&gt;26 cycles)</i><p>This false claim about how PCR works is a deliberate lie spread by conspiracy theorists. This is emphatically <i>not</i> how high cycle numbers of PCR are used.<p>&gt; <i>Or just look at symptoms that are similar to flu.</i><p>What does that mean?<p>&gt; <i>They do not have a proper (long term) placebo group (why not also use untreated patients as well).</i><p>They do that.<p>&gt; <i>Other factors with huge impact as health, habits, food, Vitamin-D.</i><p>That’s why you use large, randomised cohorts.<p>&gt; <i>Big pharma wants to collect &quot;their&quot; billions for their medicine.</i><p>I’m in favour of socialising big pharma companies. But this claim is still bullshit. Pharma companies can hike prices for <i>working</i> medication. They don’t need to invent fake medication that will be exposed in the long run and leads to company-destroying lawsuits.')
