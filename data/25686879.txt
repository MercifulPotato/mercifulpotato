Espionage is one of Russia&#x27;s core competencies, it&#x27;s just how it is.<p>I really question this assessment. Russia is not USSR, not by a long shot. Russia has lost an entire generation of the most educated people it did have, and I see no evidence that it ever recovered or will ever recover. Economically tiny and outright insignificant Russia simply isn&#x27;t capable of developing serious technological capabilities to rival that of the US.')
