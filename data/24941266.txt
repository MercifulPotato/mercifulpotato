If that’s what you seek, then factorio will give it to you.<p>A side project may well give you that some of the time, but will also involve tasks that don’t give you that.<p>In other words, factorio is a game! They rigorously exclude more realistic features if they believe they&#x27;ll make the game less fun. You can&#x27;t do that in real life!
