What I mean by that often characters are in 3&#x2F;4 view, which naturally means one eye will be smaller than the other due to perspective. But some art styles have bigger eyes than others. What I see sometimes is that the AI then produces an image where each eye comes from a different art style.<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear to account for the concept of a three-dimensionally spherical head and how perspective works with respect with such shapes.<p>It most certainly would not produce good results unless you specify that stuff like shirokuma cafe[0] characters are not human.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shirokuma_Cafe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shirokuma_Cafe</a>')
