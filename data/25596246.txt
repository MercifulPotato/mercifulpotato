Paired with the virtual video out feature of OBS it’s really easy to use with zoom as well.<p>Another option is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elgato.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;epoccam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elgato.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;epoccam</a> but I haven’t used it much. Their software feels very janky compared to OBS Camera but I know it works (my teacher uses it in his end for our lessons)')
