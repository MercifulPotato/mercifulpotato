The former is good so long as your country continues to grow, remains wealthy &amp; educated, and retains the ability to constantly produce better replacements.  Not every country has that luxury.<p>The VW Type 2 (what Americans call the &quot;VW Bus&quot;) remained in production for the Brazilian market until 2013.  That&#x27;s a poor country and cars are expensive, so the ability to have a vehicle last a lifetime is very important.  The Type 2 is something that can be repaired by almost any machine shop with basic fabrication tools.<p>You&#x27;ll see this a lot in developing countries.  Where &quot;new&quot; automobiles would be recognized as a 1980s or 1990s model by those living in developed countries.  Manufactures keep them going because the tooling is cheap and easy to keep going.<p>Those 80&#x2F;90s cars are dead reliable too.<p>Once the spare parts for an American 2020 Honda Civic are exhausted, it&#x27;s unlikely that new parts can be fabricated.  That&#x27;s fine, so long as there&#x27;s a 2050 Honda Civic or similar to available replace it, and that such a vehicle can still be afforded.<p>&gt; I would never have maintained a thousand-dollar toolbox to fix and maintain my car<p>You might be surprised by how much work you can do on a 90s-era Japanese car with a 14mm wrench and a screwdriver.')
