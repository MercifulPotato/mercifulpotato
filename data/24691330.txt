Dates are typically attributes of events involving one or more people in various roles, and these events are (hopefully) attached to one or more sources. The type of sources you use affects the confidence of various attributes of the event (like dates or participants).<p>In my area of research death records are typically a bad predictor for date and location of birth. When the records were managed by the churches (until after WWII pretty much), priests did not want to pester grieving family for the exact date of birth, so they relied on approximate age. Naturally the subject of the death record would not typically point out errors. On the other hand marriage records required looking at the actual birth records (sometimes mailed across the country), as these contained notes on all marriages of the individual (this was done to ensure monogamy).<p>Is it on the genealogist to consider this confidence when specifying the date of the event, or should the software intervene? Due to complexity, the former is the industry standard. But maybe there are some brave (or stupid) people who will try to take it into account in the future.')
