JS (well, node.js and browsers) doesnâ€™t expose GC internals (partly due to a spec requirement that the language be deterministic), and barely gives you good exception introspection.<p>There is also the ergonomic advantage of no static typing: you just get a reference and can figure out the type later. Very useful when poking around unknown objects. I imagine an API like this in Java would be much more verbose and requiring a lot of casts etc.')
