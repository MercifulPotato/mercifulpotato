I think this text is probably meant to protect the IP outside the USA mostly if they have a plant patent, seems like an interesting legal strategy.<p>I&#x27;ve also had these grapes and never noticed the text, I wonder if it is new, and yes these grapes taste amazing! They are super sweet, and a slightly different almost artificial seeming flavor.')
