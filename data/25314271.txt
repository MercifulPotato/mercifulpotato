And anyway, I am blocking all my &quot;IoT&quot; devices accessing internet or rather, every network communication is forbidden unless I explicitly allow it. And in this case it goes trough mitm transparent proxy where communication is examined and cut. I dislike dns based blocking anyway, it is a patch, not a solution. I prefer &quot;owning&quot; my communication.<p>Not to mention I dont buy a toaster if it requires 3rd party servers and it is not rootable (my roborock is playing Sepultura while cleaning, I dont know how much time the &quot;beeper&quot; will but feels good. :D). Vote with your money (!), no one will protect you from your behavior but yourself and once you figure out that the device is ignoring your network rules, return it. Or soon all the devices will be like that.<p>It is 2020. Peak of surveillance capitalism was ~5 years back. Why anyone would allow its devices freely roam the internet is beyond my understanding.<p>aaomidi: Sure. Then I wont buy the device. It is that simple. That means &quot;vote with your wallet&quot;. If this is the society that everyone wants I wont join it. And legislation is always on the side of capital. Have you seen this &quot;shit&quot;? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;digital-single-market&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;digital-single-market&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;proposal-...</a>\nGDPR havent even started to fly yet and the EU commission is  already undermining it with help of industry (&quot;think of the children&quot;... eee.. or covid in this case). Voting with your wallet is the only option. And if people are incapable of doing it, I will just stop buying devices - they are just toys as I like to tinker but I have yet to find any device that is so useful that I cant live without, more or less they are leveled with toaster with internet connection.<p>GekkePrutser: then you are living in wrong universe (and so do I). You cant help if people are oblivious to what is going on so use your time wisely and inform people. I have personally helped a lot of people to get rid of google and facebook adiction (even serving my own searx instance to them and hosting a few for free email). And the one that is making the hardware CANT change the stance if you dont allow the device to internet. Firmware was updated and this is not what you have bought (do you get the hint ;) ? ) so make the life of the seller a living hell. And if you are living in EU you surely can.')
