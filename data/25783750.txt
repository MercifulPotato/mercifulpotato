Item(by='emerongi', descendants=None, kids=[25785746], score=None, time=1610663547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776525, text='Last year, I deployed a system consisting of 4 Elixir applications, and recently added a new one built with LiveView, which took 2 days to write (1 of which was more of a learning day). I also built some helper services that are used in other projects. Phoenix nicely fits the microservice as well as the full-stack use-case.<p>LiveView is a bit of a game-breaker for me. Most of my job is writing CRUD apps and you just can&#x27;t beat LiveView on that turf. Unless you have some super complex interactivity in your app or are a unicorn planning to scale to infinity, I don&#x27;t see a reason to use another stack. If the web weren&#x27;t so terrible and just plain old, we could have even better solutions, but this is the best for now.')
