Even my example definition has ambiguities.<p>I defined an agent as being a non-random consistent being, but what does consistent mean exactly? What I meant was that I have reasons for my actions. After all, if I can give reasons for my actions, and I&#x27;m not deluded, surely my reasons determine my actions? Take that deterministic relationship away in the name of some abstruse philosophical concept of &#x27;free will&#x27; being the ability to do otherwise, and why did I perform that action exactly?<p>Of course dualists have a very different conception of a human actor. They deny that we are &#x27;mere&#x27; mechanisms and that there must be more to humans and their minds than the merely physical. Whatever that &#x27;more&#x27; is. How exactly that gets round the problem I really don&#x27;t know. Ive never read a convincing account of that. You&#x27;re right, we need to dig into these assumptions. What is an actor? What is a consistent being? In dualism, what is this dual other thing, that isn&#x27;t physical and what role does it play in decisions? That is the real question for dualism. Free will or lack of it is merely a consequence.')
