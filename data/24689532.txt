It&#x27;s a recruitation tool, where the candidates fill out a questionnary with several questions and three types of question: multiple choice, text typing and video recording.<p>When searching for a tool to use to record the videos, I was very happy to find this open source server, so I wouldn&#x27;t be locked to some service provider. The documentation is quite good and I didn&#x27;t have difficulty integrating it to our project, despite the fact that I&#x27;m mostly a front-end and NodeJS developer.<p>Now that the project is live, we are having a few problems with some users. The videos that our users record are stored and watched later by specialists, we don&#x27;t watch them live. But after the user start and stop recording, sometimes the .mp4 video file is not found on the server. But it is very nice that Ant Media has a admin page with CPU and memory usage, and it also reports when there&#x27;s been a server crash.<p>It asks my email address and the support service receives the log files and reply at most a few days later. We&#x27;re in contact right now, I&#x27;m sending them all the information I can to help resolve this issue. Of course we tested the integration ourselves, with 5 concurrent users recording, but not a single one of our tests has failed the way our users are reporting.')
