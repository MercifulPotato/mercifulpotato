Most of my coworkers are well past 80wpm (we played a few of those typing games during the shelter-in-place order), and stenographers or court reporters generally average above 200wpm with some in the low 300s.<p>Anecdotally, I never had an issue transcribing college lectures when it was just spoken word. My problem was when the professor started to write on the board. Diagrams and stuff were always obnoxious to transcribe quickly, but that was before the days of the iPad and such.')
