The biggest problem is, most OEMs nowadays lock bootloaders and make it a lot tougher to use custom ROMs for longer support, non malicious pre-installed applications, and removing Google services - almost non-existent FOSS support from Qualcomm devices doesn&#x27;t help either. I only buy for myself and suggest to others devices that are more likely to get community driven support, that for example bars some manufacturers with ridiculous lock-ins.')
