Either you have some scammy anti-virus firewall premium service that does things you don&#x27;t understand, or you have an Ungoogled Chromium with uBlock Origin and uMatrix where you can block per domain basis (which most people don&#x27;t even understand in terms of terminology).<p>Why is the Web not allowlisted?<p>Say you browse a website, and you disable everything by default. Then you want to allow a payment provider because you want to buy something, and you click on &quot;Allow PayPal&quot;.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t a collective list of services and SDKs and their required assets in the form of a named &quot;web service&quot; list make more sense than the adblocking approach?<p>I think that this can be improved a _lot_ in its UX.<p>Coming back to Automation of the Semantics of the Web:<p>I think once a Web Browser gets smart enough to understand the semantics of a website, and the implications of user interactions ( e.g. &quot;make a payment&quot; or &quot;subscribe to channel&quot;) - it can be recorded, trained, and automated.<p>And I think this is the reason why I started to build a Browser from scratch, even when it is an almost impossible task to do. I believe that Web Automation is a necessary step to get to a superintelligence level.<p>And such a Browser would push our collective efficiency far beyond what we can imagine right now.')
