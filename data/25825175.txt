The only evidence cited by this article in this accusation of a series of treasonous felonies is purportedly an accusation by an ex-lover.  Unfortunately the level of mania is so frenzied in the country right now that rational thought is out the window.  Especially concerning to see on Hacker News, where presumably necessary skepticism and critical thinking would be in higher supply.')
