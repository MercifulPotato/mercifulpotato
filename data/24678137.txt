I like the topic, and I think it makes some fair points. I do have to question the use of the quote from GNU, because it doesn&#x27;t engage with the GPL where the GPL is. The GPL is not a guide for how to create a software project that survives. It&#x27;s not a license optimized towards maximizing funding for project. The GPL exists as a tool to protect the 4 essential freedoms.<p>It&#x27;s possible to have long and boring discussions about how Linux would have turned out if it had been MIT licensed, but they&#x27;ve been had before. for GNU, the GPL, and the FSF, it&#x27;s clear that if your project can&#x27;t survive while protecting the users 4 freedoms, then it does not deserve to exist.<p>If you want to engage GNU and the FSF (and supporters of either project) in a discussion about dual licensing and the GPL, the 4 freedoms have to be central. It&#x27;s not an engineering discussion, it&#x27;s a moral and ethical one.')
