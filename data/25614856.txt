Option paralysis. Same goes for practicing, there are many individuals that give great exercises alongside their training materials (which can&#x27;t be found on the big websites). But it&#x27;s hard to find them unless recommended by someone.<p>With that being said, I am looking to aggregate on some github page great courses and exercises grouped by technology (C, Node.js, Reverse Engineering, Networking, etc.).<p>With that being said, please share any material that you really enjoyed and feel it&#x27;s worth sharing.')
