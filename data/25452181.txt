And does anyone know why we aren&#x27;t using english words to compare PGP key IDs yet?)<p>PGP invented that, and if you use actual PGP it will tell you your key fingerprint in English words, using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PGP_word_list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PGP_word_list</a> . Someone submitted a patch to GPG to do the same, but it got rejected for being non-localisable and bikeshedded to death.')
