On the contrary many airlines are being clear what they are doing to bring back their MAX aircraft, and not trying to hide it.<p>The -7 -8 and -9 designations have been used since the beginning.  The -8200 is a special high capacity -8 with extra exits for a really high density 200 passenger layout that RyanAir wanted.   The MAX name is a generational marketing name like how the -700, -800 and -900 got named &quot;Next Generation&quot; and the previous generation named &quot;Classic&quot; at that time.<p>Renaming it is not going to work and would not inspire confidence, and Boeing knows that.')
