Absolutely nothing is gated off by taking your time to do it. If it takes you seven in-game years to finish the community center, there&#x27;s no downside. It&#x27;s a common misconception that you need to complete everything as quickly as possible. I think this stems from the fact that after your second year you get a kind of &quot;grade&quot;. But this doesn&#x27;t matter since you can choose to get graded again whenever you want!<p>Some people find the min-maxing to be part of the fun, but it sounds like it stressed you out, so you just shouldn&#x27;t play it that way. Take as long as you want, the game will not punish you for doing that.')
