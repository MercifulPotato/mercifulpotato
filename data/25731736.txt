DBT is largely stuck utilizing the SQL capabilities of the warehouse it sits on, so for instance, with Redshift you have a really bad time working with JSON based data with DBT, Airflow can solve this problem. That&#x27;s one example, but last I was working with it we found DBT was great for analytical modeling type transformations but from getting whatever munged up data into a useable format in the first place Airflow was king.<p>We also trained our analysts to write the more analytical DBT transformations which was nice, shifted that work onto them.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, you can get really far with just DBT + Fivetran, in fact, it removes like 80% of the really tedious, but trivial ETL work. Airflow is just there for the last 20%<p>(Plus you can then utilize airflow as a general job scheduler)')
