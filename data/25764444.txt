It took me a solid year of significant studying to get to the point where I could comfortably read a medical research paper, and that was coming from an engineering background.<p>However, when I look back at my life, some of my most impactful contributions have come from doing dumb risky things in fields I knew nothing about. I think the Kay quote &quot;A change of perspective is worth 80 IQ points&quot; applies here. Novices have a different perspective, which sure can be dangerous, but also gives them an 80 IQ point advantage.<p>Anyway, I agree with your point that it would be nice to make it safer to do biohacking, but at the same time I think we shouldn&#x27;t be too quick to discourage it, as it&#x27;s actually a smart strategy for society to have outsiders try things that would seem dumb from an insider&#x27;s perspective.')
