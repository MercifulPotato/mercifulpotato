Until peer review and published in a serious journal, it is no more relievable than a blog post in random WordPress site like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terrytao.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a><p>They have a complex calculation for the formation of civilization, but I can&#x27;t check it.<p>Then they make a model and for the calculatiosn they peak some values for the unknown parameters. They assume that self destruction rate per mega year is 0%, 50% or 99%. Unsurprisingly, after 1000 mega years most of the civilizations that appeared had collapsed.<p>Ignoring the 0% chance that is also unrealistic, with a 50% or 99% chance of dying, the civilizations would last at most a few mega years, so the surviving one are jut the one that appear just before the simulation ended.<p>The main problem is that nobody know if P_{ann} is 99% or 50% like they choose, or other number like 1% or 0.001%. In a simulation with a 0.001% most of the civilizations would have been alive at the end.')
