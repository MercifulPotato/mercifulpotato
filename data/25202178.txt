Appearance matters, but more so for females\n2. For men, it is more important that you convey what you are <i>doing</i> than absolute attractiveness. Women are most attracted to “rocket ships”, people that are going places with their lives (it doesn’t matter your current state).<p>Also, I recommend Hinge over most of the apps out there... for what it is worth, I have had my most success there, including the girl I am currently dating.<p>Just my two cents...')
