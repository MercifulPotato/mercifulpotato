Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611844067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941981, text='What you say is sadly 100% correct.<p>I think it&#x27;s economical incentives and supply&#x2F;demand games above all else these days though, not so much about technical prowess (which is IMO aplenty in most teams I ever have been in). I have met some extremely intelligent lawyers and business managers and a good chunk of them are VERY KEENLY aware that most programmers are of low quality and are unwilling to change their (barely learned and never revised) ways. They know, trust me.<p>But they sleep better knowing there is a bigger supply pool out there because they mostly care how do they manipulate the tech worker into their agendas and objectives -- and thus [want to] view IT workers as replaceable cogs, even if we all know (them included) that this is factually untrue.<p>That&#x27;s a huge cultural problem. Not because I feel threatened by some 20 y&#x2F;o smart guy who feels like a God after two JS hackathons, no; it&#x27;s mostly because the shot-callers play on people&#x27;s egos. Meritocracy is still mostly a theoretical construct.<p>---<p>RE: &quot;we need to want it bad enough&quot;, I do want it very badly both ways: (a) have intelligent AGI-level of tooling and (b) people not shoving their current hype-train ideas into a 5-year old project -- but I personally am not willing the put the work in both because both are not my job. And even if they are made my job, I am 99% sure I will not be paid enough to (1) deliver direct business value with my tech expertise, (2) mentor youngsters and (3) work on automating myself out of the job, all in parallel.<p>So while I do agree with you on all accounts, I think the incentives outside of our tech bubble are wildly misaligned with our interests and objectives.')
