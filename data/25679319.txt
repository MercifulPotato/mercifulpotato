I doubt the average German cares what a French cheese is called or what the dimensions of the wheel are, as long as it&#x27;s safe to eat. Similarly, the average Frenchman gives absolutely zero shits about what&#x27;s happening in Germany as long as there aren&#x27;t troops forging through the Ardennes.<p>That and the structure of the EU government is a mess, the parliament has precisely zero impact on decision making and everything is run by the unelected bureaucrats in Belgium.')
