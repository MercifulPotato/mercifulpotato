Most of the modules (meaning Rails models coupled with Vuex modules) are turned off with feature flags, meaning that currently only the home page, the pricing page and the legal pages are available. The rest will be gradually turned on over the next week or so.<p>This is the first time I&#x27;m talking about it publicly except for my personal Facebook.<p>The project is called Moonka.space - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonka.space" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moonka.space</a><p>(&quot;Munka&quot; means &quot;work&quot; in Hungarian, so it&#x27;s a double pun on work&lt;&gt;space and moon&lt;&gt;space)<p>I will probably do a Show HN once everything is turned on.<p>EDIT: forgot to mention, progress is public via GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moonkaspace&#x2F;launchpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moonkaspace&#x2F;launchpad</a>')
