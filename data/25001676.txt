We used pure basic in the class, mainly for it&#x27;s great support for making games easy. This was all on desktop PCs and pure basic &quot;just worked&quot;. I never had a compiler or other technical problem. The kids loved making sprite based 2d games with it. The debugging utilities were more than sufficient. Thanks to the pure basic team for the couple dozen students they helped to educate!')
