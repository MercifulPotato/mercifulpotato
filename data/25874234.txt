If someone is going to call AOC or Bernie Sanders as &quot;centrists&quot;, then I am going to need you to point to an actual, real life example of a true &quot;leftist&quot; government to understand wtf you are talking about.<p>Examples are needed so you can&#x27;t make a bunch of stuff up, and wash you hands with the actual, real life examples of how your &quot;ideals&quot; turned out in real life.<p>&gt; unwilling to actually engage with what leftism means<p>Hey, I did try to give examples of actual leftist governments, so we can evaluate how those real life, not made up in your head, examples actually turned out.<p>When talking about this stuff, the only actual thing that I will except is real life examples of your ideal government. Because, if I don&#x27;t do that, then leftists will just make a bunch of stuff up, that is not grounded in reality.<p>Unfortunately the gap in what a leftist will claim that they want, and how they claim things will turn out is miles and miles away different from how actual leftist governments attempt to implement their ideals.')
