Item(by='qppo', descendants=None, kids=[25039597], score=None, time=1604953879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039423, text='Totally agree and if you listen to community leaders in Chicago, they pretty consistently advocate for economic change and housing&#x2F;education desegregation above police reform and gun control.<p>But I&#x27;d contest that the bridges that separate the Loop from the rest of city is symbolic as a divide between rich and poor. Plenty of the near west side across the river is affluent, as are the near west suburbs, and the lower north side. It&#x27;s remarkable how much of the violence (especially homicides) are concentrated to East and West Garfield Park outside the south side where it&#x27;s less concentrated. Raising the bridges doesn&#x27;t really inconvenience anyone but commuters going between the Loop, West Loop, and River North. The bridges were raised to prevent looting of the store fronts, not stop violent crime. I wouldn&#x27;t compare the boarding up of stores in Emeryville at the same time as symptoms of the divide between rich and poor in the east bay.<p>All that said, the violence is much better today than it was even a few years ago, and orders of magnitude improved over 30 years ago. Though there is debate whether crime was reduced or just spread out to the suburbs after the demolition of housing projects like Cabrini Green.')
