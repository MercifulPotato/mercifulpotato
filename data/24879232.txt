Perhaps different people are good at grokking different writing styles, because it was quite easy for me to extract the lessons:<p>- It really is true that big companies move much more slowly than startups.<p>- Consequently, startups should be wary of projects that depend on partnerships with big companies.<p>- Big companies are slow because knowledge is widely distributed and tough to wrangle, and liabilities and gotchas are numerous. Even simple things require a lot of know-how.<p>- To minimize slowness, find a single person who knows all of the moving parts involved.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.')
