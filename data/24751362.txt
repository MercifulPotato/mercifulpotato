So it&#x27;s not like large swaths of completely innocent people are being held in jails. I&#x27;m okay with pre-trial incarceration as long as everyone gets treated equally.<p>Since they aren&#x27;t, I think non-cash bail is a good idea, with strict requirements to check in with an officer, etc. If they don&#x27;t meet their appointments or break the terms of their bail, I&#x27;m also okay to see them incarcerated pre-trial.<p>However, there needs to be some provision to make sure that they don&#x27;t stay in jail longer than what their offense would have garnered. If someone is in jail pre-trial for half the median time an average punishment if they were found guilty, then the charges should be immediately dropped. This should give prosecutors more incentive to get their acts together and have a trial in a reasonable amount of time.')
