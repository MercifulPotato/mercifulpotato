Thus your measure of intelligence <i>also</i> says that protein complexes are intelligent, but they aren&#x27;t, so your argument is invalid.<p>As I said, this is literally the watchmaker argument with the nouns swapped out. Ant minds are not general intelligences, they are programs created by natural evolution. Their pathfinding and identification and anthill-making and communication are all fixed programs in their genetics, not learnt during life. They cannot execute other programs.')
