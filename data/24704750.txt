Item(by='elteto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602037762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704538, text='&gt; ... is pretty easy<p>It&#x27;s not that it is complicated, it&#x27;s the amount of it. Your threshold may vary, but I find that with 3+ adults, or 2 adults and children (one or more) then I prefer the dishwasher.<p>To me a dishwasher is the equivalent of asynchronous execution: load it up, start it and come back a few hours later to clean and dry dishes. In the meantime I keep on doing whatever else I need to do, which is something probably more important than doing dishes.<p>Another thing that helps is having extra dishes and silverware. That way I keep on loading during the day and turn it on only once before going to bed (pots and pans that are not solid metal we still have to do by hand though).')
