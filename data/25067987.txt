Contrary to what the parent comment says, R doesn’t actually do <i>any</i> dependency resolution at all, and the official package repository (CRAN) doesn’t even archive many old versions (though MRAN does).<p>I strongly prefer R for data science, but its dependency management story is poor, even compared to Python’s (which, in turn, is poor compared to Rust&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;…).')
