There are huge fines for running YouTube businesses without putting business details at every location your video appears on the internet.<p>German State administrators have sent out such fines simply because videos made in Germany (even in English) which have advertising do not carry such additional business information.<p>These administrators will not know, nor care if you are in the YouTube Partner Program or not. They will simply send out the fines, which could bankrupt a small hobbyist.<p>This affects me directly, and I would have to remove my hobby channel from YouTube if they go ahead with this.')
