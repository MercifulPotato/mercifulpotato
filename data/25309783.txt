Since we&#x27;re treating youtube IDs as acceptable, let&#x27;s assume 64 bits is enough.  It&#x27;s 11 characters with this encoding.  With something like Base32, designed so that you can read it out loud and ignore the case, it would take 13 characters.  That sounds like a worthy trade-off to me.  It&#x27;s not visually much bigger, and saying it out loud or transcribing it is actually much faster because you don&#x27;t have to specify case or squint to determine I&#x2F;l&#x2F;1 or O&#x2F;0 etc.')
