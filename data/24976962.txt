You&#x27;re still paying exactly the same price for exactly the same house.<p>The only people that will hurt are those who have gotten a mortgage on a property, rented it out to someone, used that rent as leverage to get another mortgage, rented that out to, and so on, and those people are all absolute scum directly contributing to mass homelessness and a generation who can&#x27;t afford their own roof to sleep under, so I have absolutely no sympathy for any of them.<p>Not a hugely tenable position politically, but I can&#x27;t pretend to give a toss about someone who profits off of contributing absolutely nothing to society undergoing the same hardship they&#x27;ve caused their fellow citizens for the past several decades.')
