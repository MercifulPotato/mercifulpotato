The existence of a two-party system is intended to keep parties in power.  Yes, there are other parties, such as Constitution or Libertatian, but until things change they are inconsequential.<p>People should elect candidates, not parties.  If we do not stop electing parties, we will continue to elect gatekeepers and politicians who spend all their time creating and then pretending they can&#x27;t solve wedge issues, while spending money frivolously to bribe people and pay-off the corporations who later hire them.<p>These politicians, who all seem to hate each other, are friends with each other, and they play citizens for fools.  Why don&#x27;t we all take a step back and stop playing _their_ game?  The problem isn&#x27;t the electoral college, it&#x27;s the people who we let matriculate and the party system.')
