They written books about monopolies, I would not be able to explain it a single comment.<p>For Twitter it&#x27;s clear (to me) it&#x27;s kind of monopoly: if you a politician (or commercial company), it&#x27;s critical to you to have twitter to access your electorate (or customers).<p>&gt; Do you include oligopolies like Apple, Google who donâ€™t have monopoly in the phone market but both banned the same apps?<p>Yes, I completely agree that these companies need to be regulated. In particular:<p>* 30% tax seems arbitrary<p>* app moderation policy is anti-competitive<p>* promotion of own services (like Apple TV+) on iPhones is again anti-competitive<p>&gt; What if there were 5 (50?, 500?) competitors that all independently decided it was economically beneficial for them to ban the same thing?<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer to that question.<p>But I believe that Trump&#x2F;Parler bans have nothing to do with economical benefits.')
