Item(by='philh', descendants=None, kids=[25096652], score=None, time=1605395402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095974, text='&gt; Maybe you are right, but itâ€™s not your place, as a language designer, to dictate that.<p>I disagree with Evan on this question and many others, but I just don&#x27;t understand your criticism here. That seems like exactly a language designer&#x27;s place? Someone needs to decide how the language is tokenized, what counts as a valid variable name, and so on. Very few languages have the answer &quot;everything not explicitly used for something else is okay in variable names&quot;. (And Elm does use the &#x27; character for other things, the rule which would allow &#x27; would allow many many other things.)<p>Maybe you mean he should have made a decision and stuck with it? But that would severely limit exploration.<p>Is your hypothetical that Bjarne Stroustroup tries to do that now, when C++ is 35 years old and ISO certified? That doesn&#x27;t seem a close match with Elm, which is less than nine years old and not yet on version 1.')
