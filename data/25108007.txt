One of the positive (for us) results of the particular make-up of that atmosphere is to foster life. Absent that protection (or if we were to act to circumvent it) life struggles to find a foothold. Can&#x27;t think of anywhere life flourishes other than here.<p>Places that lack this protection tend to get burnt to a crisp or freeze. Lack of energy is a problem. Too much energy is a problem. The wrong KIND of energy is a problem.<p>What we call &quot;radioactive material&quot; that is the effluent by-product of nuclear fission is all the wrong kind of energy. I won&#x27;t recount all the reasons why, but the fact that it is the least likely source of scrambling heritable traits in DNA is actually kind of low on the list (especially given the speed with which it scrambles DNA in living entities).<p>I am suggesting we shouldn&#x27;t act to circumvent the protection we have been graciously afforded by the atmosphere. Fucking about with fissile material inside the atmosphere and on the surface is stupid and short sighted.<p>There is nothing mystical about any of this, it is pure science.')
