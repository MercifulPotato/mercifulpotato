Item(by='the_only_law', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609988721, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660901, text='Currently working on a handful related to retro tech and networking. None of it is very monetizable.<p>1. I have a handful of old ISDN video terminals that use the H.320 standard for video conferencing. Working on getting these up along with a server that will let me use them with more modern tech.<p>2. I started briefly on a few prototypes for an X.25 implementation. I haven&#x27;t worked on this in a while. X.25 is still mildly confusing to me.<p>3. I have a CMTS and a decent SDR to eventually maybe build my own DOCSIS modem prototype. I&#x27;ll probably use the SDR for a handful of other things in the future.<p>4. Provided I get any of the prior done, I might try to build a token ring stack.<p>5. Even further out, there are a number of technologies I want to play with, notably visible light communication. Perhaps when 802.11bb is released Iâ€™ll take a look.<p>The cool thing is I have all these old network protocol analyzers from the 80s-90s that will actually get used for a &quot;practical&quot; reason. Funny enough it&#x27;s significantly cheaper to buy these than to get the cards to implement T1&#x2F;E1, V.35, RS449, etc. interfaces for a modern PC.<p>Eventually, I want to build a custom piece of furniture to house and rack a lot of my equipment for my retro network, complete with modular panels on the side for access to serial &#x2F; network ports along with servers and my dummy terminal. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have the space, skills or environment for this any time soon, though.')
