I actually delibrately removed a load of books from my bookshelves that can be seen on Zoom etc (if I&#x27;m not using a background or blurring etc).<p>Working in NGO security I prefer that people don&#x27;t always know easily all the qualifications I have. Similarly I love what I do but studied and read widely about stuff like terrorism, counter-terrorism, intelligence. &quot;Blood and Rage&quot; for example is a very interesting book but prefer people not spend half a call distracted by what&#x27;s on my shelf!')
