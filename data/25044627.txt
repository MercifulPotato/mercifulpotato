It&#x27;s louder. Could it be? I resolve to try a daring escape. If I can get this new C++ project set up properly, I might be out free! I&#x27;ve chosen an accomplice of good repute: VS Code.<p>After 30 minutes of figuring out which extension to add for the project, how to configure the build, I still haven&#x27;t managed to get it working. What could be the issue? It builds fine in the IDE but won&#x27;t find declarations and headers properly. The google oracle offers no help. Hey, mr. Magician: I can compile the project just fine myself in a terminal, why don&#x27;t YOU read my Makefile and figure it out?<p>Too late, the vim guards arrive. They open my CMakeLists.txt parchment, and write &quot;set( CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON )&quot;. Immediately, YouCompleteMe whirrs to life and works perfectly. The guards drag me back in my old cell.<p>Oh well, it&#x27;s not so bad here, at least I can focus. And it keeps the mouse away. Until the next time I hear people outside chanting &quot;Modern IDEs are magic&quot;.')
