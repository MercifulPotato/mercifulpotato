It takes the reader through some of his war-time experiences in WWII while he was in Great Britain.<p>In one passage he relates the story of passing along a lane late at night on his way home or back to base and seeing a cozy cottage warmly lit beside the road.  It looked homey but he didn&#x27;t remember seeing it before and when he revisited it during daytime there was nothing there so he asked around and discovered that indeed there had been a cozy cottage at that location where an old lady lived. It had been destroyed by a bomb which killed the old lady and consequently, it no longer existed.<p>I probably butchered that tale so if anyone else read that book feel free to correct me. That book and Catch-22 were a couple of my favorites growing up. Excellent writers both of them.')
