He clearly describes his side of the story and convincingly explains why he thought he did nothing wrong.<p>What is a little more troubling is that he (A) describes codes of conduct in detail and repeatedly affirms his allegiance to the general idea behind CoCs, including describing &quot;previous sexual assault allegations&quot; as &quot;behaviors&quot; he &quot;strongly agrees&quot; should be stopped. (B) He goes some way towards portraying himself as a victim, describing in graphic detail his lack of &quot;emotional resilience&quot;. I wonder if he realized what a thin line he was walking with (A), because he now has a &quot;previous CoC violation allegation&quot; on his permanent record, regardless of his acquittal.<p>In other words, he very strongly backs the spirit, letter, and zeitgeist of CoCs before describing why he thinks he did not violate them in this specific case. I think these were very wise tactical moves, although they leave a bad taste in my mouth, and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this approach affected the outcome. I don&#x27;t recall seeing an apology ever given, let alone changes instituted, for CoC violation allegations.')
