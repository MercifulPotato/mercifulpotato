Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605435611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099642, text='&gt;  I know this from talking to him about it, specifically.<p>Perfect! So what&#x27;s the exact story, then, finally?<p>1) Was the quote from him completely invented?<p>2) Was he allowed to check in or not? Did he need the test to check in at that moment to which the quote refers? (I don&#x27;t care about the moment when it was published).<p>3) And even more specifically: were there ever the times where he was in Google but when he not able to check in the code lacking some Google-prescribed &quot;test&quot;?<p>Just &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; there, please. Also (just for my curiosity):<p>4) How long that period lasted?<p>Then you can elaborate where I was wrong by searching thorough what I&#x27;ve written -- I&#x27;ve specifically quoted the article and talked about his C background and involvement in a new language, never claimed anything about his C++ code and a &quot;certification.&quot; I have an impression that your perception of what I&#x27;ve written and that, what I actually have written don&#x27;t match.')
