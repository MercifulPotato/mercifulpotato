The first is an bitstream from a hwrng, and you&#x27;re right that if it was non-uniform this would probably mean that it was biased and would be a weak key. Not because it has a bunch of zeros in a row, but because the attacker could assume that it did and guess it more easily.<p>The other issue is the key itself, and in AES for example, there are (believed to be) no &#x27;weak&#x27; keys. All zeros is just as secure at mixing the plaintext as anything else. If you reject keys with too many zeros in a row all you&#x27;re doing is lowering the keyspace you have to work with.<p>So no, uniformity is not a goal for keys.')
