You should take a workshop.<p>&gt;but being on the receiving end of consensual &quot;abuse&quot;&#x2F;disrespect etc in a sexual context is something loads of people are actually into.<p>There is a difference between being &quot;in&quot; to fetishes, or being &quot;in&quot; to the trust play surrounding something like rape fantasy.<p>But that&#x27;s not what is happening in these videos.  These people are <i>acting</i> like they&#x27;re &quot;in&quot; to these things when they&#x27;re not, but still having to experience the act involved.  It&#x27;s not simulated.<p>Tom Cruise isn&#x27;t really getting shot in Mission Impossible.  In many of the videos on pornhub, the women really <i>are</i> being coerced into performing sexual acts that they don&#x27;t want to.<p>And that isn&#x27;t even the point I&#x27;m making.  In some (many) cases, these women are being <i>literally</i> raped, and then pornhub, and their employees, are profiting off of people enjoying seeing them be abused.  Read some of the accounts from &quot;girls do porn&quot;, or like I said above, watch the &quot;hot girls wanted&quot; docu.')
