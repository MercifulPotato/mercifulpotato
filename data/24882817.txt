And I don&#x27;t think useful information should be hard to understand, so I hope someone can clarify.<p>Here&#x27;s what I figure:<p>- If I caught it a week ago, I would be sick by now<p>- So, I didn&#x27;t have it a week ago<p>- I haven&#x27;t had contact with anyone outside my house for a week<p>And it&#x27;s the same for my spouse. We can&#x27;t catch it from each other if we don&#x27;t have it.<p>So, the payoff for distancing and masks inside the house seems very low for a very high cost. I can only stand 6 months and counting of lockdown because my best friend (spouse) is locked down with me.<p>We did have a scare once, and did a 2-week quarantine within the house. I just don&#x27;t see any point doing that all the time when neither of us have it right now.')
