Do you think we are? If so, why?<p>I haven&#x27;t been an active Twitter user for years, but whenever I visit it these days, Trending looks like it&#x27;s at least partially optimized for outrage. I understand it&#x27;s not actually &quot;what&#x27;s popular&quot; (because otherwise it would constantly be about Justin Bieber &amp; co), it&#x27;s curated, or at least topics need to be approved in some form to be allowed to trend, right?<p>&gt; Non-toxic political engagement is a net positive for us.<p>I&#x27;ve seen very few non-toxic political engagement on Twitter, but maybe we have a different understanding of what is healthy engagement. I&#x27;m not sure there is a baby in that bathwater. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s bathwater.<p>From my perspective, it&#x27;s either a shouting match with a lot of groupthink and -speech or somebody talking to their followers about how evil the outgroup is. And that&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m looking at controversial things, I believe. I visit some developer&#x27;s Twitter feed and one or two clicks later I&#x27;m in the middle. It&#x27;s like that Wikipedia game where you start on a random article and need to make it to Hitler with the least amount of clicks, but it&#x27;s less challenging because almost all clicks lead to outrage.<p>You seem to be more focused on whether what engages the users is factually true. Is it that advertisers don&#x27;t want to be seen next to obvious fake news? Do advertisers not care to have their brand associate with not-actually-honest-but-not-fake-news-either outrage-engagement by, say, Robert Reich?')
