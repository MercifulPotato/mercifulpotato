Item(by='jrsala', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605382158, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093161, text='&gt;I always advocate against opt-outs for security features like this [...] Because most users are not capable of evaluating the impact of opting out of a security process.<p>I agree fully with the author&#x27;s characterizations of the dangers of disabling features or ignoring warnings, but I can&#x27;t possibly agree with the conclusion that users should not be given a choice. So what if the user cannot understand the technical terms of a popup warning them about malware risk? How does that justify taking away their freedom  to proceed anyway and run the program? The author&#x27;s attitude is patronizing (and also intellectually dishonest as explained already by another commenter [1]).<p>There are lots of domains in life where we&#x27;re out of our depth and make decisions anyway that might be dangerous, and we don&#x27;t have anyone trying to hold or hand or to stop us altogether. Imagine you get into your Apple Car and plot a course on the GPS. The computer&#x27;s voice says &quot;there is a dangerous stretch of road on the plotted itinerary; please wait for your assigned Formula 1 driver to drive you to your destination&quot;. The car refuses to move no matter what you do. Half an hour later a small guy with a thick neck shows up, enters the car (because they&#x27;ve got the keys apparently) unlocks it so it can finally move and explains to you &quot;oh yeah, a car fell down a cliff on that road back in 93&quot;. You complain about them not even apologizing for the delay. &quot;You accepted the Terms and Conditions, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;<p>I get that the lack of freedom to run potentially malicious programs might be a feature, not a bug of Apple&#x27;s systems. But I don&#x27;t see them advertising it as what it is in practice. The notion of &quot;false advertising&quot; is well known and understood, but what about the notion of absence of advertising for a feature that might be unwanted to the point of making at least some potential buyers balk? Is there even a name for that?<p>Whether before the purchase of an Apple system or later at program startup time, the user should be able to make a decision as to whether to give Apple control of their computer in the fashion we&#x27;ve seen. All the necessary information and data should be provided to them. Whatever choice they make should be respected and they should not be judged for it, even if they did not understand the provided information. But the decision should not be made by some security nerd on a massive ego and power trip, imparting their enlightened guidance to &quot;the lowest common denominator&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25093906" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25093906</a>')
