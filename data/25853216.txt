It can be a tough crowd to break into though.  Coming at it from the right angle helps.  Deference and respect to the local history is just as important as a trip to any foreign place, or rather, a place where you are a foreigner.<p>Local businesses unlock a lot of connections.  Hardwood sawmills and butchers have worked well for me.  A good local butcher supplies the best local pubs so getting to know one can unlock access to t’other.  Pubs are extremely variable in the <i>localness</i> of their management.  A village pub that’s owned by Greene King and no longer has a snug is a world away from a village freehouse with a family friendly public bar and a saloon bar full of sozzled young farmers.<p>Knowledge of the countryside and Anglicanism helps too.  The old guard’s interests overlap a lot with bird watching and Christ.  I’m not religious but I am spiritual enough to enjoy chapel, and choral music is a free gig if you’re into that sound.  People are glad to meet you in church: it’s the easiest way of signalling you take the community seriously.  With all respect to the actual religious practice, in terms of the old ways far too many villages became Alpha &#x2F; evangelical over the past few decades and in my limited experience it’s those communities that are letting go of the past.  (This is a sweeping generalisation so I hope I’m not offending anyone.)<p>I used to think that venerable old cultures were a mystical thing one only found in the <i>Far East</i> but they can also be right on your doorstep.')
