Developers can efficiently use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, that define how the data should be indexed. Over the last three years, theyâ€™ve been running a hosted service that has been powering top Defi and Web3 applications like Uniswap, Synthetix and Aragon. Since June, usage increased 10x, from 1 billion monthly queries to over 10 billion this November. Today, The Graph Network launched, making truly decentralized applications possible.<p>The Graph currently supports Ethereum and IPFS and will be expanding multi-blockchain in 2021. The mission of The Graph is to enable internet applications that are entirely powered by public infrastructure.')
