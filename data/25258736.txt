The DRAM is separate dies that are packaged close to the SoC die, but they don&#x27;t have to be <i>that</i> close. A typical graphics card has an array of 8+ DRAM packages surrounding the GPU, with a faster bus speed than Apple&#x27;s using.<p>To scale up DRAM capacity and performance, Apple will have to increase the number of DRAM controllers on the SoC and maybe increase the drive strength so that they can push the signals a few cm over PCB instead of less than 1cm over the current SoC package substrate. Neither of those is a particularly difficult scaling problem.')
