Turns out, if you are confident learning the keybindings of a robust IDE is worthwhile (e.g. you know that you <i>must</i> use it for some particular project for a decent amount of time) the investment pays off just as well as learning shell commands. A good IDE can do everything a cobbled together shell pipeline can, often in two keystrokes instead of N trial and error command inputs because you forgot, yet again that, e.g. while `grep` takes a pattern argument before a path, `find` does the opposite--in spite of POSIX there&#x27;s an incredible lack of UX standardization when it comes to unix tooling.<p>People like to pretend that learning shell commands is somehow better because it&#x27;s more portable, but unless your work entails working across multiple machines and environments daily, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Most of us do most of our work on one machine, in one environment, so at the end of the day, it really comes down to preference. Personally, I <i>do</i> prefer working in the shell, but if you prefer working in a modern IDE, don&#x27;t let anyone fool you that you&#x27;re somehow wasting time or being less proficient than you could be in a shell--if you took the time to learn the IDE keybindings and the IDE is on par with anything Jetbrains puts out, you&#x27;re not losing in efficiency at all and possibly making gains when it comes to certain tasks.')
