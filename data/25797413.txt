Item(by='serf', descendants=None, kids=[25797556], score=None, time=1610749956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797093, text='I don&#x27;t get why the journalist is so aggressive towards the helmet right off the bat, really.<p>Lots of statements left me sort of dumbfounded as to where the anger&#x2F;hate came from.<p>Why is this helmet &#x27;douche-ified&#x27;? Is it because it looks weird, or is it because the manufacturer didn&#x27;t send the journo a free one? The price-point? <i>Style</i> ranks wayyyy down on the list for requirements on a medical product, personally.<p>Also, is it weird to anyone else that we&#x27;re listening to the complaints of a journalist when they can&#x27;t get a free testing unit?<p>This isn&#x27;t a normal consumer issue, and it elicits absolutely no sympathy from me. Boohoo, a startup didn&#x27;t send some random local journo , albeit an important locality, a free testing unit. I play the world&#x27;s smallest violin for their hardships.<p>Halfway down we learn that the helmet doesn&#x27;t fit : finally, an actual consumer gripe. It slips, it doesn&#x27;t work properly. Great!<p>An actual review -- it only took 6 paragraphs, some complaints about what the CEO of the startup looked like, and an introduction to the journalists activities of daily living... fantastic.')
