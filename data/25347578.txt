The reason I&#x27;d never use a nanopore for my plasmid work is because the reason I sequence is to confirm assembly and sequence, especially after cloninf protocols, which is going to be one of the more common (if not most common) use cases for plasmid sequencing. I need Sanger for the base pair level accuracy.')
