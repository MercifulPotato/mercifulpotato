I sell SEO, Content and Graphic design service at a fixed rate of $599&#x2F;month to SME&#x27;s.<p>In this amount I provide 4000 words of content, 6 good quality graphics and few quality backlinks. Anything on top of this is a paid add-on.<p>I have hired a team of SEO Specialists, Content Writers and Graphic Designers. Most of my revenue goes in paying their salaries.<p>I found few takers(all dentists) of my service from Australia.<p>The best thing is that I have not even built any website or any FB, Instagram Page and still I am making this money through my old contacts.<p>I guess with my website launching in next few days, I should be able to sell even more and reach to around 100 customers in next year or two.')
