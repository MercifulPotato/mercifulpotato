The kanji based words sound very different from what it would sound like in Chinese<p>This is because you are probably speaking in mandarin which has deviated a great deal from Middle Chinese ever since the Jurchen Jin conquered northern China.<p>But if you were to compare it to a more conservative Chinese language like min-nan or some other southern chinese language, the similarities are unmistakable.<p>examples of pronunciation:<p>忍者: Ninja (JP), Nin-jia (Minnan), Renzhe(mandarin)<p>美人： Bi Jin (JP) , Bi Jin (minnan), meiren(mandarin)<p>簡単: Kantan(JP), Kan Tan (minnan), jiandan (mandarin)<p>時間: JiKan (JP), Si Kan (minnan), shijian (mandarin)<p>世界: sekai (JP), Sei Kai (minnan), shijie (mandarin)<p>速度: sokudo (JP), Sok Do (minnan), shudu (mandarin)<p>確認: kakunin (JP), Kak Nin or Kak Lin (minnan), queren \n(mandarin)<p>区别: ku betsu (JP), ku piat (minnan)  , qu bie (mandarian)<p>人類: jin rui (JP), Jin Lui (minnan), ren lei (mandarin)<p>and korean:\n金  ： Kim (kr), Kim (minnan), Jin (mandarin)<p>新婦： Sim Pu (kr) , Sim Pu (minnan), Xin fu (mandarin)<p>學生： hag saeng (kr) , hak seng (minnan), xue sheng \n(mandarin)<p>參加：Cham Ga (kr) , Tsham Ka (minnan), Can Jia (mandarin)<p>Notice how minnan and korean preserves the ending consonants like &quot;t&quot; and &quot;g&quot; sounds while Japanese simulates the ending consonant with a new character. So the character 速 is pronounced Sok but in Japanese is split into So &amp; Ku where ku simulates the ending consonant.<p>Mandarin just does away with ending consonants completely. Many other changes such as the lack of the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;v&quot; sound in early middle chinese which is preserved in korean and minnan but not in other Chinese languages where many &quot;b&quot; consonants are converted into &quot;f&quot; consonants. Or the lack of ending &quot;m&quot; consonant in mandarin which is still present in minnan and korean.')
