Item(by='zepearl', descendants=None, kids=[25738203, 25738182], score=None, time=1610402371, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734681, text='Some notes about how all this is handled in Switzerland:<p>1- electronics HW (HDD, TV, microSD-card, etc..) recycling costs are already embedded in the cost of any new stuff that is sold (there is a little bit of extra price to be paid when buying new HW, that in turn will cover the costs to recycle the old HW that is probably being replaced or that will be replaced in the future). People dump their old HW to collection centers for free, which is then partially recycled (current technology cannot yet recover all metals etc.. contained in HW).<p>2- Some specific trash (e.g. PET, metals, etc...) can be brought to recycling collection centers and dumped there for free, which is then recycled.<p>3- To &quot;motivate&quot; people to produce as less non-recyclable trash as possible and to get rid of recyclable stuff in the right way (points #1 &amp; #2), anything that gets into the non-recyclable trash must be paid for - e.g. we have to pay ~2 USD for a 35-liters trash bag, big objects need a special &quot;sticker&quot; that must be bought (don&#x27;t remember how much it costs) =&gt; normal trash bags and big stuff without sticker don&#x27;t get collected, so you cannot just leave them on the street.<p>In general, during the last years this put quite some pressure as well on the retailers (meaning the final shops from which you buy stuff): in the past they used e.g. the many small chunks of polystyrene ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vertapak.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;polystyrene-packaging.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vertapak.co.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;polyst...</a> ) to cushion what was in their packages, but now they all almost always use small inflatable bags - in both cases still plastic, but the amount of material is like 1000 times lower. They did it because many people continuously complained a bit to them that on one hand polystyrene wasn&#x27;t environmental, but as well or especially because they had to use a lot of space in the &quot;special costly trash bag&quot; to throw that stuff away.<p>I admit that I&#x27;m not the best recycler (PET+HW+batteries+lightbulbs+clothes always, but rarely stuff like metal and glass and paper), but in the end I think that I&#x27;m at least &quot;ok&quot;.<p>Switzerland doesn&#x27;t have a nation-wide law about it, and if I want I can still throw away stuff into the non-recyclable loop, but if I do it then I have to pay for it (by buying the special trash bag or sticker) as I usually do when I throw away cans and bottles mixed with other stuff =&gt; freedom, but at a price - that sentence does sound horrible but in this context of recycling it just makes sense, and for me it works absolutely well :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Waste_management_in_Switzerland" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Waste_management_in_Switzerlan...</a>')
