Sure, anybody could spend a modest sum and get a bunch of roughly-printed pamphlets printed up. You could walk around London and hand them out. People did, and I suppose some of these ideas got traction. And some of those ideas were even good.<p>That was still a lot of money and effort, and it was still a lot of work to establish some kind of credibility so that your ideas might actually gain acceptance. Otherwise you were just a crazy person handing out pamphlets along with all of the other crazy people.<p>Today, you can post insane and dangerous COVID-19 falsehoods to half of the freaking world via YouTube or Facebook and your message is indistinguishable from ideas presented by people <i>who actually know what they&#x27;re talking about.</i><p>The gatekeeping America used to have was... not great. Network television&#x27;s self-censorship was often stodgy, at best. But you didn&#x27;t have absolute fucking lunatics screaming about chemtrails and Bill Gate&#x27;s 5G microchip mind-control scheme racking up literally millions of followers. That is a PROBLEM.<p>If you say to me that the ideal solution is to simply have a more educated populace, I wouldn&#x27;t disagree. However, that doesn&#x27;t solve things <i>now.</i> We need long-term solutions (education) as well as short-term ones (so we don&#x27;t have the loonies electing other loonies who actually get to steer the most powerful militaries on the planet)')
