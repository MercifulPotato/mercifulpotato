But it does not seem clear or even plausible that we&#x27;re ready to jump straight to full computer simulation. Our ability to predict protein folding via computer is pretty spotty, simulating the entire human immune system seems beyond our reach.<p>It also does not really seem to be supported by the evidence that things will never get back to normal if we don&#x27;t do something radically different. We <i>have</i> a vaccine, there is no indication that we can&#x27;t just distribute it and put this pandemic to bed.')
