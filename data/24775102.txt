I really hope there is, but there&#x27;s another possibility that looks more likely as time goes on: lockdown has permanently broken the brains of some types of political leader and they will in fact <i>never</i> fully release the restrictions. Places like SF and NY will have long term restrictions lasting years, justified in the name of public health, the &quot;new normal&quot; and epidemic curves that never flatten (given current testing levels the curve can never drop to zero just due to FPs alone).<p>Many parts of the US will definitely go back to normal, but maybe not everywhere. It may be a permanent structural change in laws and government approaches.')
