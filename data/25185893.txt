Reddit &quot;recommends&quot; popular subreddits, and regularly injects top posts from them into your feed. &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics is one of them. Also, a lot of the big subs that you&#x27;d think are benign (like &#x2F;r&#x2F;science) are filled with blatantly partisan posts that are guaranteed to have hateful comments in them. E.g. There have been dozens of &quot;science&quot; posts there about studies that effectively equate conservatives to religious, science-denying idiots using much more &quot;sciency&quot; words. Even if that&#x27;s not the intention, the comments inevitably go there, and you&#x27;re stuck reading very non-science related comments.')
