That way they can be loaded into a cassette interface using a hand-held voice recorder.  Instead of carrying around a suitcase of tapes, you can store everything in the palm of your hand.  It&#x27;s also supposed to help protect against bitrot, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true.  Still, bitrot is a serious concern in retro computing circles because one bad bit in a 10 GB Windows game is probably harmless.  But one bad bit in a 10K Apple ][ game will likely ruin it.<p>Also, I remember when I got my Amazon on-demand ordering buttons, they were set up using an analog modem sort of thing.  It&#x27;s been a long while, but from what I remember, when the buttons arrived, I&#x27;d open the Amazon app and tell it I was programming the button, then hold down the button on the button thing and the button and the phone would squawk to each other.
