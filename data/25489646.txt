The wording you are using indicates the belief that the breached company, in this case SolarWinds, was uncharacteristically stupid&#x2F;incompetent and extremely below average and if they just adopted good practices (such as those on the highly secure computers) then the problems would be unlikely to occur. Unfortunately, SolarWinds is, with high probability, above average and above average is, in absolute terms, abysmal. In fact, even the &quot;best&quot; systems are inadequate and effectively useless against credible attackers. FireEye was hacked. Symantec, TrendMicro, McAfee were hacked [1]. Kaspersky  was hacked and as part of the hack it was determined that the NSA was previously hacked [2]. Lockheed Martin was hacked and the F-35 blueprints were leaked [3]. That was done using the results from a previous hack months earlier on the company RSA as a part of EMC [4]. The NSA was hacked by The Shadow Brokers who were then themselves hacked [5]. Microsoft Windows gets hacked regularly. The same with MacOS&#x2F;iOS. Android as well. Hospitals, banks, cars. None of these organizations can protect themselves from their actual foes. In absolute terms, there is no meaningful difference between the &quot;best&quot; and SolarWinds as the difference is like arguing the use of a piece of cardboard as a bulletproof vest since it is more bulletproof than a piece of paper even though neither actual accomplishes the goal of stopping a bullet. So, to answer your question of: &quot;How many other SolarWinds are there?&quot; All of them.<p>Also, as a secondary point, any security process that allows random, insecure systems to be connected to secure systems without positively identifying if the integration retains the security properties of the secure system is not a security process that creates &quot;secure&quot; systems. That is literally the first step of any good security process as you point out. Therefore, the &quot;highly secure computers&quot; in your example are actually very likely not actually &quot;highly secure&quot; as they were developed by a security process that is incapable of developing high security systems. If they are actually high security, then that would be purely by extraordinary luck as even the most trivial, amateurish of mistakes would violate the security properties and we know experimentally that randomly walking into high security is effectively impossible. A more proper terminology would likely be &quot;high value computers&quot; as they are protecting things that are important, just with inadequate security.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;hackers-breached-3-us-antivirus-companies-researchers-reveal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;hacke...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;israel-hacked-kaspersky-then-tipped-the-nsa-that-its-tools-had-been-breached&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;10&#x2F;d48ce774-aa95-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;israe...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-defense-hackers&#x2F;exclusive-hackers-breached-u-s-defense-contractors-idUSTRE74Q6VY20110527" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-defense-hackers&#x2F;exclu...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;how-rsa-got-hacked&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;08&#x2F;how-rsa-got-hacked&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;564006460&#x2F;nsas-hackers-are-hacked-in-major-cybersecurity-breach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;14&#x2F;564006460&#x2F;nsas-hackers-are-ha...</a>')
