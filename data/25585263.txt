Just a uniform set of guidelines that leaders form using public health, scientific and economic experts and that is then promoted as the right thing to do. This nonsense of having an expert stand at the podium and say we need to be wearing masks and then the president standing up and saying he&#x27;s not going to wear one and it&#x27;s not a big deal has been very, very destructive.<p>Regardless of the initial mistakes of not promoting mask usage, once we knew that masks could help significantly, all our top leadership should have been on board and encouraging use through example and word. They were not and that alone has likely contributed to many thousands of unnecessary deaths.')
