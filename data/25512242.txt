Actually I think we have model based science quite many decades now, but those model need to be anchored on testable and refutable something.  (Phenomena is loaded word as I wonder it assumes model free and equipment free a bit). Model and refutable is key here.<p>We still have the qm to deal with.  Just hope our model is even understandable.  But at least that model is refutable.<p>As for correctness, I suspect we might never see 100% ever though.  That is partly we are just have a century of major re-think about the fossilization of good science.  And there is just happen our maths and mind can understand quite a bit of the universe.<p>There is always something to be found is good. And there is no guarantees we will know it all. That is good too. As it keeps the most important of science and philosophy alive:<p>Curiosity.')
