Item(by='ehnto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609496336, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602106, text='The delivery platform represents a business relationship with a restaurant that doesn&#x27;t exist, and uses it to pull value out of the services the restaurants offer. As a business you get to choose which other businesses you work with, and on what terms. In this case they haven&#x27;t given the restaurant the opportunity to negotiate terms.<p>It&#x27;s new ground sure, but I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that the delivery platform is a service provider to the restaurant and as such the restaurant should have some negotiating power. What if they want a cut of the delivery fee, or guaranteed delivery windows for their customers? Probably wouldn&#x27;t get it, but that&#x27;s a negotiation they should be able to have.')
