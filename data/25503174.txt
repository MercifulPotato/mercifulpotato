Unfortunately, since Aaron Swartz was the only sometime-Reddit leader I knew, I can&#x27;t immediately point to other people from Reddit leadership who were explicit about this (as Aaron certainly was).<p>I believe there was a rough Reddit equivalent to Twitter executives&#x27; famous &quot;the free speech wing of the free speech party&quot; statement, but I can&#x27;t cite one and I may be letting my memories of Aaron&#x27;s views get projected onto his colleagues.')
