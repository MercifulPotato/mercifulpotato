But visceral reactions tend not to make good social policy, and that&#x27;s really my concern. We have some number of people who commit violent crimes. We either have to imprison them forever or let them out sometime. If we let them out we either need to support them or allow them to work. If we allow them to work do we relegate them to some low class of work, or allow them into white collar&#x2F;privileged professions?<p>We should be concerned about creating the best society for everyone. That means sometimes we need to suppress our immediate&#x2F;unconscious reactions.')
