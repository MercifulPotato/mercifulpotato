This isn&#x27;t &quot;his&quot; story - he didn&#x27;t break it and he didn&#x27;t do the primary research.<p>Does his background give him insights that could make for a good editorial? Perhaps, and the Intercept used to pull no punches on that kind of content. But it&#x27;s not like he deserved any real &quot;credit&quot; or &quot;blame&quot; for the story itself, which was reported by other outlets.')
