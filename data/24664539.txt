There are a lot of techy reasons why I like it (self-hosted is always nice, back-search is fun, I like the customization, etc) but especially during these stressful times, it&#x27;s a great way of limiting obsessive scrolling in newsfeeds. I follow 300+ feeds, most only semi active so I can very easily get caught up on all the new article titles. Once I&#x27;m caught up, it&#x27;s much easier for me be done and not keep scrolling. This is in stark contrast to other newsfeeds, and the control I have over the rss subscriptions means I don&#x27;t get algorithmically manipulated to the same extent as other places. There are niche feeds I love and it&#x27;s great having them collated<p>So three things: 1. talk to your friends about it, I&#x27;ve been advocating it to a lot of people and lots of them are interested. Feedly is relatively easy to setup for a layperson and showing them cool lesser-known feeds is a great way of getting them started (as you all know, there are niche blogs lots of places and the act of self-curation is really empowering). But if you self host, maybe offer to give them an acct...<p>2. I think gReader was a start but it was a slightly different newsfeed environment. Now everyone I talk to understands the dangers of newsfeeds and algorithmic manipulation, but they don&#x27;t know what to do. I think there&#x27;s a space for a RSS startup (or even feedly) to really press their advantage on self-curated feeds and no infinite scrolling that would appeal to a lot of people. The little RSS advertising I see are not focused on this<p>3. One thing people might miss is some twitter&#x2F;fb&#x2F;etc accounts which they know they like, and want to bring to their readers. I think a lot of people know the difference between the people they follow who they actually care about and the ones that are just on the same platforms. I&#x27;m thinking especially about Cory Doctorow&#x27;s Adversarial Interoperability (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6c-cory-doctorow-on-adversarial-interoperability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ycombinator.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;6c-cory-doctorow-on-adve...</a>) but if the platforms won&#x27;t do it, having a free&#x2F;open source twitter&#x2F;fb&#x2F;etc scraper that is reliable would be a huge win. I&#x27;ve tried some but a lot of them are buggy or expensive and it&#x27;s annoying for a layperson. This could definitely be improved and I wish some of the platforms would export rss feeds too (e.g. youtube did and then it got weird). Also having easy integration to html-diff non-RSS websites would be great. I&#x27;ve used it to check for job postings, cdc news, etc, and I think a lot of people would like it.<p>All of which is to say, we have this old technology that is secretly adopted by a lot of websites (especially because of wordpress&#x2F;etc which make it a default) and which could solve a lot of deep problems that a lot of people are struggling with. I think HN type people could really make impact here in expanding the userbase')
