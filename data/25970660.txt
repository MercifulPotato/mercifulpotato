TCP hasn&#x27;t really changed much in the past 25 years due to routers on the internet being strict about its standards. Just look at &#x27;TCP Fast Open&#x27;, while it was supposed to drastically cut down on connection time in TCP, it can&#x27;t be used on the internet due to routers behaving erratically. Apple tried it in production and then reverted it.<p>Since QUIC is based on UDP, it doesn&#x27;t face the same limitations that TCP does. TCP also suffers from head of line blocking, which QUIC also eliminates. It is also more secure due to header being encrypted, unlike TCP. Plus you also get multiplexing built-in. QUIC is far better than TCP and for serving websites &amp; APIs, it is a much better alternative.')
