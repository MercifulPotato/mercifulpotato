E.g. a bullet point list in a linear medium such as a text or a slide in a presentation is like a star in a graph, where all children have the same weight. The thing is, when people see it like that graphically, they sometimes get ideas they wouldn&#x27;t have, if they stared at a long text. Sometimes they figure out, that actually the points are not equal weighted or that there isn&#x27;t such a clear boundary and connect some of these children together either by a link or by selecting the same colour to group them.<p>Btw. we program everything in Clojure + ClojureScript so immutability and the other points is like preaching to the choir.<p>Not related, I thought Manning will not publish the book. At least that is the last information I have seen a few days ago. I thought about buying that book.')
