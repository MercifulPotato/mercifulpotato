Instead rough edges are being polished. GATs for example sound like a fancy feature, but in reality, it just allows you to make your associated types generic, just like everywhere else where you can define a type. A Rust beginner would expect this to work by default, and actively has to learn that it currently does not work. By enabling GATs new learners will have to learn less, not more. Most other upcoming features have been planned for a long time, such as const generics and allowing more things in const fn (which yet again, you currently have to learn the limitations, which are constantly being lifted). I&#x27;d expect the development of new features to rapidly slow down once those are finished. In fact they are already struggling to justify a Rust 2021 edition, as there&#x27;s not a whole lot of features that would even require an edition.')
