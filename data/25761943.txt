I&#x27;ve taken remote college classes. I&#x27;m familiar with the concept.<p>Have you actually homeschooled? A lot of homeschooling parents don&#x27;t actively guide their kids through anything.<p>I used to have a page of education quotes, which included ideas like &quot;The ability to learn is older and more common than the ability to teach&quot; and &quot;Education should be the lighting of a fire, not the filling of a pale.&quot;<p>I surveyed everything in the house -- books, games, TV shows, etc -- decided which should be counted as educational and which shouldn&#x27;t and for what subjects and my kids mostly did various activities independently. I only actively worked with them when they had problems with something because they have learning disabilities.<p>I actually spent more time working with my kids on their homework when they were in public school plus taking them to school, attending parent-teacher conferences, etc than homeschooling took.<p>My oldest son tested at the senior in college level for at least one subject on a placement test at age 11. One of my rules was &quot;If you are above grade level in the subject, you get to do whatever the heck interests you.&quot;<p>My kids are twice exceptional. This is probably the hardest educational profile to try to effectively educate.')
