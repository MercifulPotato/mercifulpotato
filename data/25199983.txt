I just looked up a random Garfield strip from 1988 [1] and I have to say, it&#x27;s kind of a funny visual gag. Nothing groundbreaking but for a daily strip in a newspaper, it&#x27;s not bad, and I&#x27;m an adult now, as a kid I probably would have found it hilarious. Combine decent humor like that with recognizable and cute characters appearing in the newspaper daily and it&#x27;s not surprising that the strip became so popular.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.ucomics.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;ga&#x2F;1988&#x2F;ga880101.gif" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.ucomics.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;ga&#x2F;1988&#x2F;ga880101.gif</a>')
