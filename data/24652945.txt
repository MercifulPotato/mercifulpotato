We need to decouple if that&#x27;s a learned skill or not. Certainly there is some spectrum in native ability but it would make sense for the vast majority of people to have the basic ability but that they never hone the skill. There are people that are never about to write, but for practical purposes we expect everyone to be able to do it (after being taught).<p>I think a lot of people attribute to &quot;natural ability&quot; what is often learned because many times it isn&#x27;t obvious how those skills were learned. It&#x27;s obvious everyone went to school to learn to read and write, it&#x27;s not obvious a child learned navigation because their favorite game growing up was hide and seek.')
