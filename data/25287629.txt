But value isn&#x27;t an absolute. It&#x27;s always in the eye of the beholder and depending on where a stakeholder is coming from, they are prioritized differently.<p>From a business perspective, balancing between different types of values is paramount. The end goal, after all, is to always deliver value that generates revenue exceeding expenses at an acceptable level.<p>This is why legacy software is a thing. The business assesses that an old tool still generates value for paying customers and revenue while spending an acceptable amount of time on maintenance. In the context of a large system with a large userbase, this may imply dedicating one or two developers full time towards keeping the lights on.<p>Many software projects don&#x27;t get a rewrite. Why? Because over the course of years, business and technological contexts for all stakeholders - both the business and the customers - change so much that they become irrelevant. For instance, the business pivoting away towards a new lucrative market or product, or customers moving away to a competitor offering the same value but at a better price point and with up-to-date technology. Just consider many services and products you&#x27;ve used over the years and how many of them have been shelved or sunset without ever being rewritten.<p>While the necessity of a full rewrite may pop up over technical concerns such as security or performance. It&#x27;s only when business and functional requirements have shifted away to a serious degree from the original scope of the project that organizations tend to consider dedicating time and resources to a successor. At that time, a rewrite isn&#x27;t necessarily the only option: sourcing a product that does the same thing but better from an outside supplier could be a valid option as well.  For instance, chucking away your own homegrown decade old CRM for Salesforce as your business grew from a 5 person outfit to a 120 person business servicing enterprise.')
