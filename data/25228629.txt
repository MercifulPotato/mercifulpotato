Since CloudFlare switched to Hcaptcha, as a VPN user, every time I run into a site that has CloudFlare &#x2F; Hcaptcha, I can forget to pass that test. No matter how many times I try, CloudFlare still shows it all the time. It is so bad, so that now every time I see now Hcaptcha shown, I just close the site without even trying anymore. PrivacyPass :) - the biggest joke I seen on privacy - they that endorse it are either naive or have some other agenda.<p>These &quot;free&quot; zero-cost captchas for site owners are now in all places where a captca is not really needed. If CloudFlare, supper-dupper DOS solution relies on captchas, or if Google super-dupper search relies on captchas to get results, that demostrated how bad these companties really are at the main thing they do, and only want more data.<p>Even pirate stream sites ask now for captchas. It is so easy to integrate them, why not.<p>captchas, followed by 2-factor authentication with phone SMSs that we are forced to accept in all main life services slowly, combined with and laws to register phone SIM cards so they really know who we are, killed the web we know - people are being identified with hight quality.<p>We all rant about this here. It comes same in waves in HN all the time, but what can you do?<p>At least, if you own or manage a site or blog do not use: CloudFlare, Google, etc - no CDNs, no shared fonts.')
