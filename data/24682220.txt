The patch meets the GPL requirements, and the company can use the other license when distributing the patch with their own proprietary releases. Does that occur?<p>Is your main objection to CLAs copyright assignment, or that you prefer licensing to be pure GPL, or something else?<p>Edit: Rack say “To accept a contribution, all authors of the contribution need to: declare the patch under the CC0 license, or complete a copyright reassignment form, or perform the work under a paid agreement.”')
