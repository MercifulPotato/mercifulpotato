This is something censors say, because they don&#x27;t want objectively specific criteria for censoring things, they want the power to arbitrarily apply censorship to anything they feel like and that is in the nature of censorship, all that &quot;power always pursues more power&quot; thing we know from political science. Which also implies if you make the criteria very specific, the power to censor things will be very limited and nothing to test the boundaries of or to hunt for loopholes.')
