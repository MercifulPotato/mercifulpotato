That being said, convention is very useful until it is broken for further optimization and setting better standards. I&#x27;m just not sure that a debate over &quot;when it really started&quot; is useful in that specific applications can define the start and end based upon what is needed rather than what is right, wrong, or accepted by convention. One exception to this is that non-specialists or students may learn something from the debate (provided it is public). A more useful debate would be whether or not we should rid ourselves of daylight savings time!')
