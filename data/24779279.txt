We removed a lot of the weekly challenges during beta testing that we felt weren&#x27;t conducive to symbiotic participation...it&#x27;s a work in progress though.<p>In terms of benefits our end, all money from subscriptions goes straight into the prize pool and back out to the communities favourite projects each week. The main reward at the moment is the times when we genuinely see people helping one another. In the future if it can generate income for us that would be cool but we don&#x27;t really know how that would even be possible - for now so the community comes first :)<p>Loved your breakdown of gamification motives, it&#x27;s a really helpful perspective, thanks. If you have ideas for how something like HackerStash could offer the benefits of gamification without risking incentives that eventual lean in favour of the company itself that would be awesome!')
