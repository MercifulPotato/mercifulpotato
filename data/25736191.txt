I can&#x27;t imagine the CCP doing this in the era before Xi and post Deng Xiaoping. imo the CCP is gone. It&#x27;s the Xi Jinping Party now<p>The good news for the West and China&#x27;s Asian competitors is that he is effectively helping slow and cripple China&#x27;s progress. Xi advocates a return to Mao centralism while ignoring all the good that came with Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s decentralization reforms. With this act, he is also introducing a lot of uncertainty for any foreign investors. This gives the West time to recuperate since the failure of the anti-BRIC TPP.')
