I try to comvince people for quite some time now and whenever there was like a privacy issue on WhatsApp or other messaging apps, I saw people discovering and moving to Signal.<p>Sadly, whenever there was such an opportunities to shine, they ran into technical difficulties.<p>As a result, many friends tell me on a different messaging app like telegram that they finally tried out signal but moved on because it wasn&#x27;t working.<p>This makes me very sad and I hope that the Signal team is able to learn from that and plan ahead.<p>@Signal please take your opportunities and make a reminder like a big banner in your office reminding you to ask yourself &quot;is there an opportunity?&quot; Or more concrete &quot;did WhatsApp messed up with privacy?&quot;<p>For me, I will still try to convince more people to switch to signal :-)')
