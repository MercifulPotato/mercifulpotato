I keep no important files on my desktop (usually stupid screenshots to be shared, or quick notes for myself). My email inbox has zero unread messages. I have no unread Slack messages. My directory structure has basically been unchanged since 2002. I backup my files regularly to &quot;the cloud&quot; and to a local drive on my desk. My source code, and some notes, are all in a distributed version-control system (ok, we all know it&#x27;s Git). I keep our internal Wiki up-to-date as I delete, or archive, items that have become irrelevant or misleading. Some of us aren&#x27;t as you have stated.<p>Now, my physical desk at home is a friggin&#x27; mess. I need a larger one.')
