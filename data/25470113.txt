Mozilla was not directly involved in governance, and only employed a small number of people involved in project leadership, and those people didn&#x27;t leave their positions when they left Mozilla.<p>The closest thing to this is that the situation with Mozilla jumpstarted actually finally creating the Rust Foundation, and deciding its relationship to the project is a governance matter.
