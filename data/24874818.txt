Is Google Cloud &#x27;the&#x27; cloud provider? &quot;Just spin up a box on GCP&quot; the default thing for people to do in tech?<p>&gt; Today&#x27;s Android is a whole different beast.<p>Is it? Android 4 (which was around that time) is pretty close to android as it is now.<p>&gt; Google Home is a new product<p>And? Is it category defining like maps or Mail or GSuite, did it create something entirely new like GAE did for serverless? Is it the default home assistant? Do people outside tech even know the name &#x27;Google Home&#x27;?<p>&gt; hangouts video was a huge hit for a while<p>And now it&#x27;s close to dead. Never reached the heights of Skype or Zoom.<p>None of these products are category defining.')
