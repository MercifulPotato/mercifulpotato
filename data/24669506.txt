It has an &quot;exercise load&quot; feature which I&#x27;ve found a lot more useful than &quot;exercise minutes&quot; (which Garmin also collects.) Exercise load uses some sort of a dynamic scale that weights time based on how long you spend in the heavier heart rate zones. Walking on level ground pretty much never counts for &quot;exercise load&quot; since my HR stays under 130, but hills&#x2F;running&#x2F;biking can get up to 140+ where I get exercise load points.<p>A slightly clunky thing with the Fenix is that you have to explicitly tell it you&#x27;re doing an activity to get some metrics - but the heart rate&#x2F;step count&#x2F;calorie data is always being gathered. And the Fenix has at a minimum twice the battery life of an Apple Watch, and keeping it in no-GPS mode lets it extend to weeks of battery life while still gathering most of the key metrics.')
