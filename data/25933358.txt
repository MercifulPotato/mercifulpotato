Ultimately, the Internet has no arbitrator to enforce the rules of argumentation. By the time you&#x27;re reduced to arguing about the rules, no progress is going to be made.<p>I consider that primarily a reason to cease engaging entirely. When you believe you&#x27;re being sea-lioned, you don&#x27;t really need to call it out. People who do are hoping for some sort of closure, but they aren&#x27;t going to get it. You may be correct, or you may be merely trying your own dishonest means to win, but either way nothing productive is going to happen.<p>The best you can do is remind yourself that nobody actually cares. That&#x27;s really hard to remember when somebody declares: &quot;You&#x27;ve failed to supply the evidence therefore I win by default&quot;. Troll tactics rely on you feeling bad about losing in public, and believing that your side has lost adherents. Effectively, they&#x27;ve won before you&#x27;ve even started when you believe that the only way to win is for them to concede that you&#x27;ve supported yours side sufficiently. They will always be able to simply declare that you lost, one way or another.<p>The only way to avoid that is to not play at all. And the realization of sea-lioning is useful in that. It doesn&#x27;t win an argument. Rather, it&#x27;s your self-recognition that you will lose if you say anything else, and it&#x27;s not worth your time. The sooner you forget about it, the faster you regain equilibrium. Even stopping to declare &quot;No thanks, sea lion&quot; doesn&#x27;t really help unless you have the ability to shut down replies.<p>That can also be used badly, to be sure. It can be a troll tactic, and you deal as you would with other trolls. And it can be used to fool yourself; in the absence of an arbitrator you can&#x27;t really know when you&#x27;re missing a sincere argument. But I&#x27;d advise erring on the side of abandoning any arguments early, since it&#x27;s never as important as you imagine it is. Even if you&#x27;ve failed to recognize a serious critique, you&#x27;ll hear it again some day, probably soon. Sincere self reflection, offline, will bring you good answers faster than bashing yourself out against an army of trolls.')
