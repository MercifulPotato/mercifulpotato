And, I understand the sentiment you point out about a wallet not being worth another person&#x27;s life. But sadly, not everyone necessarily will take your cash and dash. I&#x27;m really mostly focused on someone who is determined to leave you dead for one reason or another.<p>And of course, use of a gun, even defensively, should only be a last resort. I&#x27;m not advocating that everyone become Rambo and shoot their way through problems. Every action has a consequence, and whether you were justified in your shooting or not, the jury will decide that in their deliberation of the evidence.')
