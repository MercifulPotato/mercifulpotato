This is done automatically by the apparatus.  As a side effect, it gives a heightmap, but with the lens used for the whole-painting scan (what HIROX calls &quot;35x&quot;, corresponding to ~5 Âµm sampling resolution), the elevations are not reliable, especially near the edge of the field.  For selected areas, a higher magnification was used that gives much more reliable elevations.  Sadly, only a small fraction of the painting was imaged using this higher resolution, so the 3D data is spotty.')
