Some differential equations feature conserved quantities or invariants that will blow up over long times if you don’t build their conservation into the numerical solver. Some equations can’t be solved with variable time step without careful consideration. Some problems are so huge you can’t solve them without taking some kind of approximation. For instance you might need to find the low dimensional sub space to project onto, and then write the equations of motion for the sub space. You might be solving a finite element problem and need to find the right way to discretize. For electromagnetism this requires writing your elements to be irrotational for the E field.<p>Furthermore, a lot can be gleaned from understanding the _structure_ of a differential equation. Writing the equation for the RG flow of a field theory and then understanding the fixed points of the flow is crucial. A numerical solution to the RG flow isn’t really that useful.<p>Basically, once you’ve simulated it—-assuming you’ve done it right—-what actually have you gained? Often less than you want, and generally less insight than you could have gained had you really analyzed it.<p>What I’m saying is that “trivial to simulate” is only sometimes true. Ansys’s business exists because solving Maxwell’s equations are not “trivial,” and they’re linear!!')
