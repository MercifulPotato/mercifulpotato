Rank-and-file members should be able to challenge the leaders. The employers can already fire employees for almost any arbitrary reason. Don&#x27;t like the way a subordinate talks about you? Fire the person.<p>Colleges promote (or should promote) independent thinking. Independent thinking makes it necessary that employees might disagree with the employer. Is that good for the efficiency of the company? Hard to say. But to say the society must cultivate a culture of obeisance such that people can work for companies better is upside-down. Companies should be built to favor independent thinkers.')
