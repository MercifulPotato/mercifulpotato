It is possible to explore the depths of the machine and do things that are rather unique.  Cheap FPGAs, 3-D printing, and such are all the same.<p>On the other hand, you have things like the Raspberry Pi 400.  It was fun to watch a tear down or two to see what is inside.  The vintage form factor is cool too.  Yet the moment it came to software, the interest dwindled since it is just another Linux box.<p>When it comes to software, I feel that the lack of scarcity also hurts.  Take those programming languages.  Once upon a time there was the anticipation of getting something new, and there was incentive to learn the details.  Now it&#x27;s all just there.  It&#x27;s often hard to find motivation to learn anything but the surface details unless it&#x27;s a truly unique language.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to diminish what has been accomplished.  In the hands of the right people, they are powerful tools.  In the hands of someone who just wants to play, they are much less cool.')
