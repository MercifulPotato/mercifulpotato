I particularly liked that many of the characters who would traditionally be the bad guys are treated sympathetically, and their &#x27;badness&#x27; is motivated by their personal circumstance and experience. This is in contrast to the somewhat cliched representation in many stories (fantasy or otherwise) of the bad guys who are evil just because the plot demands it.')
