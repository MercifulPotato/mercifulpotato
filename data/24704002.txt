America can be competitive on the world stage and pay a market rate. It&#x27;s not true that these workers have skills that are not available domestically. Make the H1B salaries the same as the senior tech employees you&#x27;re trying to displace and the calculations on firing all your senior employees goes out the window. This ultimately will be good for the foreign workers, as they will be compensated equally. This is equitable and just. anything else is modern day indentured servitude.')
