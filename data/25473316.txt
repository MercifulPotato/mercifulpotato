Remember Nokia? Intel looks like its in precisely such a situation now:<p>- AMD is as good as or beating Intel on performance on server, desktop and laptop (not just desktops).<p>- Apple (and now MS) looking to control CPUs in their laptop and desktop products and producing Apple has a superior product as a result.<p>- Nvidia will soon own Arm and will be pushing it&#x27;s own Arm CPUs.<p>- The cloud vendors all the see the (price) advantage of Arm based CPUs and are starting to promote them.<p>- Even a startup like Ampere can produce a product that is competitive with Intel.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of competition.<p>Add to this that Intel is still having process problems.<p>So on a backward looking basis all looks fine. Looking forward not so much.')
