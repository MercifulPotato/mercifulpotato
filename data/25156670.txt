Typically in TypeScript, runtime type checking is (manually) done when the type system cannot otherwise confidently guarantee the type of a value. For example, it’s common to have a runtime check for the shape of a JSON api response because you’re not necessarily in control of what that will actually return. There are community supported packages to help make this easier [1].<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;advanced-types.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.typescriptlang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;advanced-types....</a><p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gcanti&#x2F;io-ts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gcanti&#x2F;io-ts</a>')
