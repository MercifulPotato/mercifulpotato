When I said &quot;cloud providers make this option cheaper than traditional servers&quot; I meant it as in the <i>pricing structure&#x2F;plans</i> of cloud providers. That&#x27;s why I tried to contrive a scenario to make a better point. Meanwhile your definition of cost seems to center on performance and org overheads a team might incur.<p>You say that serverless will cost more &quot;to prevent noisy neighbor effects&quot;...but that is an abstraction most cloud providers will already give you. Something you already <i>pay</i> your provider for. So my DA point now is, is it cheaper to pay them to handle this or is it cheaper to shell out your own and manage manually?')
