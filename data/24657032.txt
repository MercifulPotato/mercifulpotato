Massachusetts (1905) allows for compulsory vaccinations by states for general health and welfare.<p>regardless of the legal basis, to me, it&#x27;s pretty clear that our governments (especially CA) poorly and blindly targeting its efforts for maximal political (and media) gain rather than for health and safety.<p>if it had been for the latter, the first highly visible thing we&#x27;d have done was immediately quarantined senior care facilities, super-PPE&#x27;ed all their workers, paying whatever it took to create a tight bubble around each facility, to protect seniors. that would have targeted 60+% of potential mortalities (and yes, we knew that was a core threat back in february). then we could address other specific threats and beefed up medical facilities as needed. and lastly, we&#x27;d have singularly messaged the heightened dangers of social gatherings and the effectiveness of distancing, along with an educational campaign on the mechanism of spread, co-morbidities, the age stratification of risk, and such, not masks and its complicity-signalling value.<p>then residents could make informed choices on how to protect themselves. some would choose to isolate, but many would just distance where necessary and avoid large gathering of strangers. we then wouldn&#x27;t need to worry so much about legal precedent, and we wouldn&#x27;t be dividing into stupid political camps lobbing vicious tweets (and sometimes more) at each other.')
