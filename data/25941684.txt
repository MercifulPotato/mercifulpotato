But programmer ergonomics don&#x27;t seem like a focus of their team currently.<p>I can only hope for Rust 202X edition that can introduce new syntax &#x2F; deprecate another and make certain things clearer (even if that means explicit with a little writing here and there). Lifetimes and traits in particular need a lot of upfront investment to grok intuitively, and the fact that some core aspects of the language are implied can later hit your assumptions really hard and confuse you for a while. At least that&#x27;s happened to me, maybe I am just dumb and mediocre though.')
