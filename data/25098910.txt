I&#x27;ve picked up bits and pieces of vim over the years. Recently, I even installed vimium on Chrome and the vim extension for VS Code in an attempt to get better at it.<p>It has been quite effortless to delete or replace words or lines but every time I&#x27;ve tried getting more adventurous with it - say, surround every line of text with double quotes etc, I end up finding the commands unintuitive or hard to remember.<p>There&#x27;s also an issue with my older muscle memory of `CMD+Z` which works on a different stack than `u` and `CTRL+R` and I end up messing up my code.')
