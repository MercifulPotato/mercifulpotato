In some ways it seems regressive tax rates are arguably &#x27;fair&#x27; in the most objective sense, but that simply doesn&#x27;t generate enough revenue, so a flat tax rate does sort of seem like a pretty good compromise, and proportional taxation seems like it helps even out benefits that are hard to quantify. But is there really a fairness argument to be made for progressive tax rates?')
