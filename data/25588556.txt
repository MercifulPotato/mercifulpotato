About 3 years ago I used it as the main text book for a QC course and came back to it multiple times during my master thesis. For me it was just concise enough to stay focused but not get lost every other sentence (unlike 90% of math books I worked through). However the parent is right in that it is a little outdated when it comes to the physical realizations and maybe some algorithmic findings.<p>Anyway it was an invaluable resource for me and I would love a new revision from both authors.')
