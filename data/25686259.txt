Money is an entry on a ledger, which tracks credits and debits. So yes, fiat currency is not redeemable for a physical asset. But if it was redeemable, what ensures that say gold or a chicken will suffice to settle a debt or serve as credit for a future transaction. Chickens die and gold is only as valuable as your skills as a trader. The ledger and all of the social norms and institutional structures that accompany it is what maintains financial wealth.<p>Preventing debasement of currency via inflation via printing money, which a lot of people use as their go to argument against fiat money, is simply adding economy wide debt to the ledger. This is necessary from time to time especially during crises and especially in a services&#x2F;financial services&#x2F; intellectual property heavy economy.<p>If no money existed, at all, how would you receive compensation for providing work of an IP nature to your neighbor. You would need either a perfect trade (you really want their chicken itâ€™s just the right amount of chicken for you) or you take an iou. Which is a debt. Now have them write that iou down on a piece of paper and hand it to you. Your neighbor just printed money. Not so crazy.')
