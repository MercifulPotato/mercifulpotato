We&#x27;ve built a data warehouse for you to access big data with no code.<p>As a former financial analyst, I used to spend a lot of time building spreadsheets but always wanted to step up my game and gain more understanding in big data. Then I was faced with a slew of &quot;big data&quot; tools such as Hadoop, Hive, Redshift, Kafka etc. They all seemed useful but I could not possibly learn them all since I&#x27;m not a full stack SDE or data scientist. This frustration led me conceiving this idea about building a data warehouse for non-programmer like me. Luckily I met Chen, who&#x27;s been building big data pipelines for big corporates for years.<p>This new data warehouse I&#x27;d imagined should integrate with data seamlessly, transform&#x2F;clean data like an Excel, update data maintenance-free, and send data with permission controls all without me having to understand distributed computing, database architecture, schema design, ETL, or SQL on a deep level.<p>Then we built Acho. Here&#x27;s how Acho works. First, you can set up an integration with a production system (eg. .CSV, MySQL, Salesforce etc.). Then you can load them into an Acho project. On each project, you can transform, update, and share your tables all without coding. Lastly, you can export data to a reporting UI, or BI tool.<p>Currently, Acho monetizes through monthly subscription on usage. We keep a free tier so you can test Acho out. When you process data on Acho, all data is encrypted in a batched file accessible to no one but you. We disclose detailed security practices, compliances and policies to our users.<p>Building a data warehouse for everyone is not easy, but we&#x27;re constantly adding more services to the product. From additional integrations, transformation widgets, built-in BI tools, to pipeline management, we love to know what you might need and we&#x27;ll get it built as soon as you need it.<p>Vincent, Chen, Sam')
