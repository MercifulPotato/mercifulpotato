It&#x27;s hard as a layman to keep track of what&#x27;s happening in real-time. I love going back to things in ~1-decade intervals and seeing lists and articles etc showing what&#x27;s happened &quot;in-review&quot;.<p>Usually those kinds of overviews are limited to things like media genres, not fields of science.
