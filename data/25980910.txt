You get compile&#x2F;runtime error like &quot;lock on COMMON-LISP package violated&quot;. So, unless author went to extra lengths to work around it, you can rely on the standard stuff like * when you read the code.<p>Even for user-defined functions, it&#x27;s not an usual practice to extend operation of any function (although again, it&#x27;s kind of possible). There are CLOS generic functions for that.')
