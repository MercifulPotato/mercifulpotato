If someone won a Nobel prize for physics, and then murdered someone, the murder doesn&#x27;t make the physics wrong. You understand that, right? Like, if we discovered tomorrow that Isaac Newton was a pedophile, the theory of gravity is still something important and still works. You can hold people accountable for one action and still recognize that <i>other</i> things they did may have been correct. You don&#x27;t have to hold an all-or-nothing approach like releasing murderers who might be physics geniuses.')
