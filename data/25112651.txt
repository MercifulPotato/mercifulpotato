Plus, from a platform perspective, software built on windows or osx is categorically not free (in the strictest sense - even if the software is gpl, if it&#x27;s built for a nonfree os, it&#x27;s still not very useful in the grandest scheme of things even if it&#x27;s better than if it were proprietary as well). However, software written for linux can be truly free.<p>Note when I say &quot;written for&quot; I&#x27;m not even really speaking very technically - lots of programs written nowadays won&#x27;t really have any particular dependency on a library that&#x27;s only available on a certain OS. But if you&#x27;re using an application that&#x27;s written in a platform-agnostic way but the programmer only develops it and uses it on a Mac, it&#x27;s usually easy to tell. Both in terms of system interop&#x2F;integration and how bugs are prioritized.<p>So, even if people do things you don&#x27;t like on their linux install, it&#x27;s still far better to have as many people on linux as we can get.')
