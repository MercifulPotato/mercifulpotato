Instead of playing video and sound the goal is to create new kinds of smart immersive experiences.<p>Nvidia and AMD are kinda sorta playing around the edges of the same space, but I think Apple is going to try to own it. And it&#x27;s a conscious long-term goal, while the competition is still thinking of specific hardware steppings and isn&#x27;t quite putting the pieces together.')
