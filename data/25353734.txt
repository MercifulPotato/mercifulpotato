Questioning the Vatican&#x27;s motivations for ignoring the mass of criticism, the study concluded that Mother Teresa&#x27;s &quot;hallowed image – which does not stand up to analysis of the facts – was constructed, and that her beatification was orchestrated by an effective media relations campaign&quot; engineered by the Catholic convert and anti-abortion BBC journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. [...]<p>&gt;She was sometimes accused by Hindus in her adopted country of trying to convert the poor to Catholicism by &quot;stealth&quot;. Christopher Hitchens described Mother Teresa&#x27;s organisation as a cult that promoted suffering and did not help those in need. He said that Mother Teresa&#x27;s own words on poverty proved that her intention was not to help people, while he quoted her words at a 1981 press conference in which she was asked: &quot;Do you teach the poor to endure their lot?&quot; She replied: &quot;I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people.&quot;<p>Christopher Hitchens - Mother Teresa: Hell&#x27;s Angel [1994]<p>In 1994, three years before her death, journalist Christopher Hitchens made this documentary  asking if Mother Teresa&#x27;s reputation was deserved.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=76_qL6fiyDw&amp;ab_channel=CaNANDian" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=76_qL6fiyDw&amp;ab_channel=CaNAN...</a><p>Christopher Hitchens explains why he didn&#x27;t like Mother Teresa<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wckZo3ks1ro&amp;ab_channel=moeman1984" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=wckZo3ks1ro&amp;ab_channel=moema...</a><p>Christopher Hitchens on Mother Teresa (2006)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GZiKAeJ9mAU&amp;ab_channel=Stipoon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GZiKAeJ9mAU&amp;ab_channel=Stipo...</a><p>Penn And Teller &quot;Bullshit&quot; episode: Christopher Hitchens on Mother Teresa<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V4nCaxHN-cY&amp;ab_channel=ChristopherHitchslap" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V4nCaxHN-cY&amp;ab_channel=Chris...</a>')
