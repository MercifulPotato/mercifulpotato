Authenticity check at the Physical -&gt; Digital touch point. Some efforts such as digital KYC for banking are able to solve this because the process involves a government issued identity, so the authenticity of the physical -&gt; digital transmission is sort of embedded into the physical asset itself. Tampering the physical asset can be quickly reverified using several of the asset parameters (photo, DOB etc).<p>For aspects such as meters or constantly changing physical data, I am not sure if it will ever be possible to ensure the authenticity of physical -&gt; digital touchpoint.<p>Is this something an embedded processor can help resolve ? In essence  eliminating the possibility of fake data emerging from the meters ?')
