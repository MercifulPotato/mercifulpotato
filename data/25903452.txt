It starts off defining some basic types, C for Character and I for Integer, and then the all-important Array. This is followed by some more shorthand for printf, return, and functions of one and two arguments, all of the array type. The DO macro is used to make iteration more concise.<p>Then the function definitions begin. ma allocates an array of n integers (this code is hardcoded for a 32-bit system), mv is basically memcpy, tr (Total Rank?) is used to compute the total number of elements, and ga (Get&#x2F;Generate Array) allocates an array.<p>This is followed by the definitions of all the primitive operations (interestingly, find is empty), a few more globals, and then the main evaluator body. Lastly, main contains the REPL.<p>While I don&#x27;t think this style is suitable for most programmers, it&#x27;s unfortunate that the industry seems to have gone towards the other extreme.')
