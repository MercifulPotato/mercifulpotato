With your cell data service, that happens automatically for you.  You don&#x27;t need to go in and explicitly join some guest network and sign their ToS.<p>Maybe if there was some &quot;cell-&gt;wifi&quot; standard that could happen, but I&#x27;m somewhat doubtful about the benefits there.  You&#x27;d also have to be super careful, for the same reason you wouldn&#x27;t really want to join a random open network.')
