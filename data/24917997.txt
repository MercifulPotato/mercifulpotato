However, that plan is on paper only and it won&#x27;t be implemented yet when Vulcan goes into service. As OPs article states, there isn&#x27;t even an official timeline. Presumably ULA is waiting for government money to develop the capability.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lftGq6QVFFI&amp;ab_channel=UnitedLaunchAlliance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lftGq6QVFFI&amp;ab_channel=Unite...</a>')
