The war is certainly not close to over, but I&#x27;m calling the result already. It&#x27;s like WW2 in 1943: far from over, but clear enough to see where it&#x27;s going.<p>The state of legalizing isn&#x27;t glacial if you compare it to what was going on in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and even 2000s. Even if it&#x27;s slow now, look at the rate: the population that can legally use weed is increasing exponentially.<p>The sate of expunging records is far from being dire as well, especially if you look at the dynamics since 2000[1].<p>The coming administration - which, by American standards is <i>moderate</i> (and by European, conservative) - has campaigned on decriminalization and expungement. Whether they deliver remains to be seen, but the odds are getting better and better.<p>And yes, fair sentencing act is merely the start of moving in the right direction.
