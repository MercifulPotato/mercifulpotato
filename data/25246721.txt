However, if you rank them by &quot;which is best for human well-being&quot; there is a best answer even if we can&#x27;t know it. So one can&#x27;t use this as a easy out &quot;all opinions are equally valuable&quot; kind of thing, which is just nonsense. Though one could argue that prioritizing &quot;human well-being&quot; is a value judgment, which it is.<p>I also agree with your last point, it&#x27;s usually me who&#x27;s misunderstanding something in that case upon digging deeper.<p>However, there are also classes of things that are objectively true like whether climate change is happening as a result of human activity. Or whether a politician said X or not when there&#x27;s a video of them saying X. It&#x27;s never 100% certainty in life, but some things are known sufficiently well that there&#x27;s almost no chance of them being wrong.')
