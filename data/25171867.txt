It would not always be open, though.<p>That &quot;appearing as not working while on the clock&quot; is, to me, a foreign fear, and not something I&#x27;ve ever really experienced at the places I&#x27;ve worked in.  I know that I (and the teams I&#x27;ve been part of) have been plenty productive without pressure to put in the hours.  I think that a culture of putting in the hours would have been counterproductive, in fact.  My work has not been flipping burgers, but designing and creating complex systems.  It doesn&#x27;t work out that well under time pressure.')
