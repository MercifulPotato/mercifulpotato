I suspect for a while the shiny new desktop stack will just be X on Wayland until someone writes a Wayland compositor that is also an X server just without the bits that can&#x27;t work. One \nof the reasons for Wayland was fast compositor updates, but I still don&#x27;t see why the compositor and window manager have to be one and the same, you could delegate management to a wm and present the full window. Heck, you could also replace Xlib and xcb with versions that know when they&#x27;re running locally and skip the network protocol for most operations.<p>Sadly I don&#x27;t have time to work on that, which really sounds like a full time job for a team of at least 3 developers, and from the looks of it, the people in charge don&#x27;t share my vision for integrated coexistence of old and new.')
