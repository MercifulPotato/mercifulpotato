If you have pull requests landing concurrently and you only clone the most recent commit, there is a race condition between when you queue the build with a specific commit id and when you start the clone.<p>All that being said, I don’t know why you would need you build agents to clone the whole damn repo for every build. Why not keep a copy around? That’s what TFS does.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;pull&#x2F;35109" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;pull&#x2F;35109</a>')
