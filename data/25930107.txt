AMD spent years betting heavily on concepts like the APU, HSA, tight coupling with coherent virtual memory access from GPU and CPU side etc.<p>They tried to do a &quot;build it and they will come&quot; but the software didn&#x27;t come and Intel ate their lunch with low effort iGPUs. Advances of GPU programming slowed industry wide, especially software &amp; dev experience &#x2F; programming language wise, and the GPU world remained far from CPU programming productivity. (And you can still get 2 orders of magnitude of parallelism staying on the CPU, from SIMD, multicore and SMT).<p>They learned their lesson, and this time around came back with a product that can beat Intel in their own game.')
