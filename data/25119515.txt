And it makes sense, if you think about it. An individual who ended up owning a particular piece of a codebase will be incentivized to obfuscate and obscure their code in order to maintain full control over it. It&#x27;s job security and furthermore if it&#x27;s a valuable piece of the product then it can keep praise and rewards centered on you. We should also not be quick to blame the individual for perpetuating this, the right incentives need to be in place to reward both team progress and individual progress.')
