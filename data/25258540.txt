If you can get the job that&#x27;d require, say, 200 POWERs or 250 SPARC64s with 300 Xeons that cost half per socket than a POWER, x86 will still be a better choice. This could be for many reasons - from intrinsic performance of the CPU to the quality of the code generated by the compiler and&#x2F;or architectural fitness to the task at hand.<p>Also, take into account the CPUs are not always the more expensive part of the compute node - GPUs, HBM, lots of DDR4, and fast networking gear are also pretty expensive and will be more or less constant as you change CPU architectures.')
