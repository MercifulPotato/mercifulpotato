If they don&#x27;t want to add features to Webkit, that&#x27;s fine.<p>The problem is that they prevent other browsers to add these features, because they prevent them from using their browser engines. That way, they prevent these browsers to really compete with theirs (Safari). Because if we could run the real Chrome on iOS, with all the APIs it supports, it&#x27;s obvious everyone would ditch Safari straight away.<p>And more importantly, that way they prevent Web apps from competing with native apps. Because obviously, who would use a Web app which can&#x27;t even send push notifications instead of a native app with all the native APIs it has access to?<p>So the problem is not Apple not caring enough about the Web. The problem is Apple having anti-competitive behaviour regarding Web browsers and application platforms on iOS.')
