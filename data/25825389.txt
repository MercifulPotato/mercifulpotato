Their traps often turn black and rot after trying to digest a single fly, and I had one Venus flytrap die after flowering (the advice I found online was: don&#x27;t let it flower, under most less than ideal conditions, the effort of producing the flower will spend the plant&#x27;s energy reserves and kill it, and the single flower it can produce is not pretty anyway. I should have followed this advice, but curiosity got the better of me).')
