It is exhausting.<p>For this round in particular, Apple is not competing against the Grados and Beyerdynamics of the world, they are competing against the Bose QCs and Surface Headphones of the world, particularly those with integrated mics.  The vast majority of people buying these ~$300 headphones for daily general use&#x2F;work&#x2F;travel can afford ~$500 headphones as well, if they want them.  So true to Apple, they do not reduce their addressable market with increased cost, but rather turn themselves into a status symbol among the consumers in their targeted market, <i>due to</i> the increased cost, not in-spite of it.<p>The headphones will sound at least as good as the direct competition because it&#x27;s not that hard to do among this class of headphones. Give them some common-sense credit.  The build quality is already better from pictures, compared to all-plastic which dominates the market.  The user experience will be better with Apple products than pure Bluetooth, as everyone knows.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to touch the audiophile discussion.  I&#x27;m an &quot;audio person&quot; as well, but again, exhausting discussion. Nobody knowledgeable about audio would use anything with noise cancelling DSP to achieve peerless audio quality.  Nobody would use a tiny integrated amplifier and expect it to perform like a full-size discrete amp and wired headphones.<p>Just like I wouldn&#x27;t expect my Bose QC headset to compete on sound quality with my Sennheiser IE8s, I do not expect my IE8s to work as a headset or reduce ambient noise while selectively allowing voices though.  It is pointless to bring up these comparisons, especially in the context of &quot;sound quality units per dollar&quot;.')
