The OP doesn&#x27;t mention it and the GP&#x27;s link isn&#x27;t explicit.<p>I can&#x27;t find a clear source, but it looks to me that 300B is total loans issued, not what Ant currently has on their balance sheet.<p>&gt; Even if they are just “warehousing” the credit this would be false, as they need to hold some of those assets on balance sheet while they try to sell them.<p>Yes, they would have to hold _some_ capital reserves, but that number should be based off of whatever they have on their balance sheet at any given time, not off of the total loans issued number.')
