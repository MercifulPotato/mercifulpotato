A cheap touchscreen on the back of the phone could really improve one handed usability. The larger phones really make you reach for things. Would love to be able to claw a few gestures on the back of the phone like unselecting an autocorrect (which always has me hovering over the autocorrect bubble, but I’d love to just swipe with my index or middle finger on the back to ignore autocorrect for the word).<p>Two finger swipe on the back could shuffle browser tabs.
