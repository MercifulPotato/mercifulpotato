If you borrow 100 and at the end, owe 110, you can&#x27;t pay it back. that creates a mort-gage death-gamble where not all can pay. If you borrow 100, pay the interest right away, you owe 100 and have 90 and the banker has 10 with which to buy your products and let you pay the bank back. Musical chairs with money only happens when you leave the interest to turn into usury at the end of the game.')
