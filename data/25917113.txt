That is not indicative of an issue to you?<p>I think people are trying to understand if you are working at or below your regional market value. That said, it sounds like a problem local to your region. I think if you look at Glassdoor you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re well below the national average, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just Silicon Valley inflating the national average. (I have an EE degree as well and on graduation it seemed like $75K was a pretty reasonable starting salary most places with lots of room for growth).')
