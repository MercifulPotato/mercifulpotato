Therefore you can only have proper OpenHardware movement with an open processor.<p>The RISC-V foundation was only created in 2015 before that it was basically a research project so saying anything RISC-V related is &#x27;always&#x27; 5 years away is a strange statement.<p>And I also don&#x27;t know where you get &#x27;good enough&#x27;, RISC-V is not a processor, its and ISA and we know that ISA have relatively little impact implementation speeds. We already have RISC-V processors at the same node as ARM processors that beat them in many criteria.')
