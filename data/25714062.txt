Since we have this far lacked the technology to modify ourselves directly, we’ve offloaded any of our super-human goals onto our environment in a symbiotic dance with the gifts evolution has bestowed upon us. There isn’t some inflection point where computers are a catalyst into an imagined decline: they are just part of the evolving process. Perhaps direct augmentation will change things, but that is unlikely to be available to us in the near to medium term.<p>People’s desires and perceptions have been shaped by–and in turn shaped–thousands of years of technology at this point; from fundamental tech like <i>reading and writing</i> through <i>hygeine</i> and <i>mass media</i>.
