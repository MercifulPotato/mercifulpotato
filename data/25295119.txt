GOG and other alternative stores didn&#x27;t take off. While Epic has their strategy of giving away some free games to attract traffic, I am not sure how well that translates to actual purchases. If a customer has a choice between buying a game at the same price between two stores, they&#x27;re going to stick to the one which they already use and have a big library on. And even though Steam&#x27;s community features are anemic, people do get SOME value from having friends on Steam that own the same game and so on. I think it&#x27;ll be hard for Epic to crack this one.')
