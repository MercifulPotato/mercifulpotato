Less money flowing? Less need for remediation. More money flowing? More need for remediation. More money than we know how to spend efficiently? Spend it on neglected public infrastructure fixes.<p>Personally, I worry when &quot;sin tax&quot; money is used to fuel unrelated social programs. The incentives are now inverted. If drug usage goes down and the money flow decreases we&#x27;re jeopardizing the foundation of other important things. Maybe its better to take the money when&#x2F;where you can get it and deal with the problem down the road? I dunno.')
