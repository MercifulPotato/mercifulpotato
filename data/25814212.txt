If anything they are killing off third party cookies just like Apple and Firefox.   Also they are making it so even third party Javascript is less likely able to track you - meaning everything has to be first party.  IMO this just means there will be a shift in how tracking works.  Moving from third party tracking scripts you install on your website to using CDN&#x27;s to pull code through or host on your own domain.   IMO this means you&#x27;ll be less able to identify when you&#x27;re being tracked much more like how it works today on native apps, e.g. you can&#x27;t tell whether that native app is tracking you.')
