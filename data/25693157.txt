For instance, most of the problems that led to the 2008 housing crisis were the direct consequence of Bill Clinton&#x27;s policies when it comes to deregulating Wall St, so it was a bit funny to hear all these democrats trying to look tough on bankers when they were directly responsible for the situation as legislators. But that&#x27;s the game, that&#x27;s politics.')
