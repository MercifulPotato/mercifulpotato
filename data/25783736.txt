That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s been banned. You can go tweet &quot;I really like Trump&#x27;s policy positions&quot; all you want and you won&#x27;t get banned. But when you start spewing hate speech or calling people to violence then don&#x27;t be surprised you&#x27;ve been kicked out of the bar. I can&#x27;t believe this nuance is missed on this forum.')
