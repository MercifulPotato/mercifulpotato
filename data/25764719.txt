Everything just worked out of the box.<p>All the other sync &#x2F; backup apps also work that way after installation.<p>I actually dislike Onedrive web interface look compared to the top competitors. Photo view often appears buggy when scrolling down (outlook.com file view also has problems). Sharing folders&#x2F;files as a public link gives full access by default.<p>Both web Outlook and Onedrive do not seem to have received much updates in the past few years.')
