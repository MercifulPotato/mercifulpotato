Language like &quot;If you don&#x27;t explicitly add a license to your repo, we assume you meant MIT&quot;. I think that&#x27;d clarify that gray area.<p>In that same vein, a torrent site could have something like this on their upload page: &quot;By adding this torrent to the tracker, you certify that you have the rights to distribute the file, and you hereby grant permission to distribute the file to every user of the site.&quot; I don&#x27;t think Hansmeier could pull off his stunt anymore, as he just granted permission to everyone to do what he was trying to catch them doing.')
