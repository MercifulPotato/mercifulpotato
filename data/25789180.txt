They themselves don&#x27;t even understand how their ancestors built it; and if they were to disappear or the machine to be destroyed, the civilization falls as it has forgotten everything about keeping itself afloat.<p>In the modern world, most &#x27;senior developers&#x27; are glorified plumbers.<p>It works, they don&#x27;t know why.<p>So when it doesn&#x27;t work, they don&#x27;t know why.<p>We&#x27;re becoming more maintainers and plumbers than creators at the cost of not understanding the sand under the castle.')
