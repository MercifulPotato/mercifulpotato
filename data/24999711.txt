For context, I started taking piano lessons online earlier this year, where we meet on zoom once a week and cover material together.<p>My idea is that I can use it with my teacher during our remote lessons to make our back and forth playing clearer (we both have digital keyboards with midi out). Sharing this over zoom without a good audio interface and microphone is difficult for people that aren’t tech savvy, \nI’m aiming to bridge the gap somewhere at least for digital keyboard players&#x2F;teachers, and then seeing if it works or not.<p>Midi data could be used to render inputs on the remote peer in the case where the user doesn’t have a good enough camera to capture many octaves, though I don’t think that’s necessary for a first release.<p>Anyway, development of a prototype is almost done and then I’ll be doing some internal testing with my teacher to see if it’s worth opening up to the world, let me know if something like this is interesting to you and I can follow up if&#x2F;when I need more testing done!')
