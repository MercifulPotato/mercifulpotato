There are very few pieces of software that I am able to praise like that with a clean conscience; SQLite is definitely one of them though. You might find it worthwhile to read e.g. about its memory allocation strategy, or its testing strategy.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think that the image files themselves are stored in the SQLite DB file; likely just their indices and metadata.')
