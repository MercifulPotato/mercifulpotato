Another view, more in line with the unix philosophy, is that &quot;using something in the intended way&quot; is a meaningless concept.  A tool must work always, no matter how it is used and abused.<p>Thus, instead of asking &quot;how is this UI failing them?&quot;, you could be more pragmatic and ask &quot;how can I optimize the UI so that this usage works correctly?&quot;')
