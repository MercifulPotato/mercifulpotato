I have nothing against the author. From a technically stand point, I am genuinely disappointed in acm for publishing it. I&#x27;m pretty sure, of getting downvotes for these. But heres my critique.<p>1. Fast enough means different things in different context. If you&#x27;re building HFT (high frequency trading) system 200ms is eternity. At the same time, for a simple crud application its good enough. Context is everthing!<p>2. As much as I love Go, its not really a good benchmark as the article suggests. The equivalent C program (without concurrency), will blow those numbers out of the water. This basically tells me, the higher level languages like GO, have skewed perceptions of what is considered fast.<p>The article completely misses one of the most important points. You have to measure&#x2F;instrument the code before one decides to &quot;optimize&quot; things.  Without instrumentation, its really hard to know where the program is spending most of its time. Once you have that data, then focus on optimizing the slowest parts.')
