Item(by='rtpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608778688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522471, text='the &quot;async&#x2F;futures&quot; way of writing code lets you write code that &quot;looks like synchronous code&quot; (write step 1, then step 2, then step 3, etc), while getting really good safety guarantees and not having to manage a state machine yourself.<p>The model doesn&#x27;t work for all forms of concurrency, but I think it works for a lot of things that people at the &quot;top of the stack&quot; (application developers) do.<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of code you&#x27;re looking at, in general, but you should be able to massage most async stuff into a list of things if you&#x27;re not in callback soup. Granted, lots of people don&#x27;t try to stay out of the callback soup, but.... I feel like even that is better than just like &quot;try to validate concurrency invariants&quot;, which is a much harder problem for arbitrary code IMO?')
