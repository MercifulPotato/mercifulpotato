An ISP is way harder to move away from than Twitter.  Switching away from Twitter was both free and an enormous benefit to my mental health; switching from Comcast to Verizon was less so.  It&#x27;s a harder argument to make when it comes to the paypal case, but I think that again we see that Twitter and Facebook aren&#x27;t really utilities at all.  If Twitter bans you, there are plenty of places to go even as a business or public figure.')
