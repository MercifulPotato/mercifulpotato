It has a great preview feature where you can set a cookie and then the site will pull in data at request time rather than from the static site (perfect for CMS previews!) and build times seem alright - I haven’t had cause to look into speeding them up, which is a good sign.<p>Personally I’d go with NextJS in future based on my experience... that said, I’ve no idea if it would work well for their reasonably specialised use case!')
