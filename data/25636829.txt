If the workers want social issues as their agenda then that&#x27;s fine but there should be a broad voting process for that rather than a dictatorial preemptive agenda. This just seems like a few dozen people trying to tell 100k what they should care about.<p>edit: I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen environmentalism come up as a desirable goal from proponents when people discussed tech unions. Pay, benefits, working conditions, abusive management and so on but environmentalism????')
