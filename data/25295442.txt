Look at how many businesses are now installing UV-lights in ventilation systems, allowing people to work from home, and how the wearing of masks has become normalized and accepted in many parts of the country!<p>People will no longer hesitate to throw on a mask if they feel ill, unlike before when we used to wander into Target sneezing and coughing all over everything! Think of how awesome that is for immunocompromised people!<p>The vaccine will be a <i>critical</i> link in a long chain that will hopefully save thousands, and thousands of lives. Whether it 100% eliminates the shedding of any measurable viral particles, knocks it down by 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% or whatever, it&#x27;s a huge win. Right now we have <i>zero</i> way to even think about reducing viral shedding in real-world populations. We&#x27;re relying 100% on social distancing and masks.<p>Get excited! We&#x27;re gonna kick this thing!')
