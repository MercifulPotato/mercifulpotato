Caveat emptor.<p>Here is what I am saying.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re very poor and have a son who isn&#x27;t very smart. He comes home excited about a new &quot;job&quot; washing the neighbor&#x27;s car for $2 every other weekend because it means he&#x27;ll be able to go to Disneyland this summer. Summer rolls around and it turns out he only made a quarter each wash because he had to replace his bike tires riding to and from the neighbor&#x27;s house, and pay for soap and rags and stuff. You go to the neighbors and they tell you &quot;tough shit&quot; because your kid was too dumb to realize not even Mr Clean himself could make it to Disneyland washing cars for $2, and that the whole game was rigged from the start. Your neighbor just wanted a clean car without having to pay for it. Then after all this drama, they&#x27;re texting your son that he should keep washing the cars for $2 because washing it for $10 isn&#x27;t in his best interest.')
