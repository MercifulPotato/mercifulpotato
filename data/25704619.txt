I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with cancel culture, for the aforementioned problem of it being mob social justice.  But it seems to me like it has arisen out of a failure by the real justice system.  Issues like sexism in particular, which affect half of the population, have been ignored and marginalized.  It took how long for Bill Cosby&#x27;s heinous crimes to finally be prosecuted?  More over, how likely would it have been for his crimes to yet again have been swept under the rug had cancel culture not fostered an environment where the victims felt comfortable coming forward?<p>The very topic we&#x27;re discussing, the terrorist attack on our Capitol, is another example of racist failures of our police force.<p>So is it really any surprise that society has collectively taken matters into their owns hands?<p>Again, I don&#x27;t _agree_ with the idea that society at large should pass their own judgements.  I&#x27;d rather the courts do that.  But they haven&#x27;t been.  And aren&#x27;t.  And we just suffered through one of the worst years on record of blatant police abuse and court inaction.<p>If we want to get rid of cancel culture I think we need to fix our policing and justice system to the extent that society feels they don&#x27;t need to take up the mantel of justice themselves.<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t see value in deriding cancel culture.  If one feels that cancel culture is wrong, my belief is that one should be calling for action to repair the _cause_ of cancel culture, not the symptoms.  And that cause is a prejudiced justice system.')
