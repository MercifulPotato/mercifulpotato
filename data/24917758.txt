Get a notification when the baby is crying, so I know when I need to get things done.<p>I wrote an AI that can identify baby cries with a 98% accuracy rate. Maybe some of you guys can benefit from my app as well. I just put it on the app store for free.<p>You need to pair at least two phones. As I said, the entire AI, Notification part is for free.
