My wallet once held ~10 BTC for a few transactions back in the early days.  I ended up with 5 btc left over that I rode the bull market with, selling half the position post bull run each time.<p>I kick myself for loosing the BTC my friend and I mined back in &#x27;09 on CPU time when it truly was worthless.  But I was a dumb college student at the time and was simply playing around with it for a few days.  I wonder how many BTC were permanently lost in this period.')
