Everyone must pay in the same national car insurance. You are unable to sue anyone for what happened to you on the road, if you get hurt, the insurance pays you a standard amount for the injury and that&#x27;s it. So it overall reduce the burden on the court system and the insurance self-finance itself, there&#x27;s no need for profits.
