Einstein&#x27;s Theories forbid <i>as fast as</i> light, but say nothing about faster than light travel. Of course, one probably must pass y to get to x.<p>Also, it seems pretty clear that Wolfram does not understand the concept of Warp drive, which is not used to propel the craft, but instead used to warp space to come to the craft, because there is nothing preventing space from traveling faster than light, and, indeed, the expansion of the Universe causes distant galaxies to recede from ours faster than the speed of light. So there you have it, we already have proof of faster than light travel, so we know it is possible.<p>But if FTL travel is not a one way trip, it will tend to introduce causality issues. Say you&#x27;re somewhere far away and observe some event on Earth that arrived by the speed of light, like maybe a lotto drawing or who wins a game. You could zip back FTL, arrive before the lotto drawing or the result of the game, and bet on those numbers or the game winner. If you were far enough away, you could observe your own birth, and possibly zip back fast enough prevent that from occurring. The Universe may allow FTL travel, but I doubt it will allow such paradox.')
