Others include direct experience, non-expert opinion, data from experiments&#x2F;studies, and so on. Ideally we&#x27;d weigh each source of evidence by how trustworthy and reliable they are, and then we&#x27;d use our brain to make sense of what may be true based on that evidence.<p>Society does <i>not</i> &quot;work better when gatekeepers decide what the truth is.&quot;  That&#x27;s especially the case when the &quot;truth&quot; is political, and people have ideological incentives to report what they see as the truth in a certain light. Instead, society works better when individuals are free to look at the evidence and think about it for themselves. This is because in this case, you&#x27;re treating the members of that society with human dignity.')
