We don&#x27;t know what the original crime was so it is hard to say in this case. Perhaps they have some deep, anti-social personality flaw and I wouldn&#x27;t want to sit next to them. I would be concerned about sitting next to an innocent person who spent 13 years in prison, though. For me, that is a root issue. How many criminals are flawed people vs people who made a mistake or reacted badly to an isolated situation or just didn&#x27;t have the skills or maturity to handle a difficult situation. I&#x27;m reminded of a quote I heard once. &quot;Crime is committed by the young but prison is full of old men.&quot; People aren&#x27;t the same their whole lives.')
