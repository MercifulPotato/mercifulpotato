I think another choice is to help educate folks when a dependency could be removed in favor of a little code. Take regex or aho-corasick for example. aho-corasick is a lot of code and only has one tiny dependency itself (memchr). There&#x27;s really not much left to break apart. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the use of aho-corasick for <i>every</i> case in which you need to search for multiple strings in one pass. A trivial solution using multiple passes is quite serviceable in a number of cases.')
