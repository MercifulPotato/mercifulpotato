But then you end up with a lot of weight you need to lose, which is not fun.<p>And besides, for most guys, I think losing weight is actually more important than gaining muscle if trying to look better. Obviously this depends on the person, but being at a low body fat percentage with a regular-ish amount of muscle is a look that&#x27;s closer to what most people find appealing, as opposed to being heavier but with more muscle (and probably as opposed to having too much muscle, which is also a negative for most people).')
