The polling systems may seem broken now but will inevitably get corrected over time.<p>Further, the US take states’ rights seriously and allows states to make many key decisions in terms of how they wish to hold elections. The thinking is that you’d rather have Johnny down the street dictate your election than someone you’ve never heard of in Washington DC.<p>It’s en vogue to shit on the US election system right now but y’all are still using first-past-the-post just like the US. Seems a bit hypocritical.')
