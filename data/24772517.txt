My Sony wireless headset works flawlessly on Windows&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;Android mobile without any extra installation or set up. By default the sound quality is awesome and call quality is awesome.<p>Now all the problems start when I want to use with Linux. By default, it uses HFP mode and you have to edit config file to make sure it faults into A2DP by default. Now headset volume is great but when I use Mic, the quality is horrible and I feel like I am living in 1900s era. There is no solution I have found to work with Linux?!<p>These are the things Linux will never get to the quality of Mac&#x2F;Android (both are based out of *nix and they solved the problem)')
