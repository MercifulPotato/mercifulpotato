But it&#x27;s not a choice between &quot;do nothing&quot; and &quot;force them to ask permission&quot;.  Under this law, a restaurant might refuse permission for <i>other</i> reasons.  And some of those reasons would be bad for consumers.  If a similar rule was applied to non-food items, it could be a very harmful blow to the first sale doctrine.')
