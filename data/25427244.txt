Real world numbers would typically involve drift measurable in seconds within a low integer number of hours.<p>(2) It absolutely is true that on most sensible audio interface designs, you don&#x27;t need interrupts except early after device open. At that point, you use them to set up a DLL (Delay Locked Loop) that will enable you to use the system clock to know where the audio hardware is reading&#x2F;writing to in the buffer used to move data to&#x2F;from the hardware. Once the DLL is correctly configured, you can just be woken by the system timer, determine the current audio hardware state and read&#x2F;write data appropriately.')
