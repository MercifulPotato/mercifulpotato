It was fucking terrible to work with and I only did it because it was R&amp;D, not a production grade project, and I was being paid full time for it.<p>Vendoring &quot;build&quot; processes, IME, are incredibly prone to breakage, and that alone is reason I won&#x27;t bother with them for a lot of production stuff. Debian is stable - I can &quot;apt install $PACKAGE&quot; and not have to worry about some random library being pulled from the latest GitHub version breaking the whole gorram build.')
