Gilles Roudiere is working on a new 2D tilemap system an editor that will hopefully overcome most of the limitations with the current one. You can follow his progress on this twitter account.\n</code></pre>\nThe tilemap interface is useable but I&#x27;ve personally struggled to get autotiling to work for tilemaps that were supposedly designed for autotiling.  I browsed through the twitter feed and the progress Gilles is making is really exciting and just a handful of the features will make the interface much easier to use even if autotiling remains challenging.  Lots of quality of life improvements coming either way.')
