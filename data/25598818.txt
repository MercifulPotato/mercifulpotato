Bitcoin isn&#x27;t something you use to spend wealth, it&#x27;s used to hold wealth. Unlike a stock, however, whose value is based on what price people are willing to pay for it, Bitcoin&#x27;s value is determined by its scarcity. Sound familiar?<p>That&#x27;s why I hate the term &quot;cryptocurrency&quot;. It has a lie baked right into it, the fact that this is supposed to be a &quot;currency&quot;, when in reality it&#x27;s just the same kind of digital assets that dominate all forms of entertainment these days. If the term you&#x27;re using to refer to your product is itself a lie, what does that say for the rest of the product? The organization creating it?<p>Crypto, overall, is just hard to trust.')
