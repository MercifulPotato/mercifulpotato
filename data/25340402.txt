Sometimes the 4th parties outsource to 5th parties I kid you not. They are like a weird telecom contractual based holding company with n number of partners for every contract.<p>It’s all run through AT&amp;T’s ancient ticketing system from the 90s&#x2F;00s. All the 3rd&#x2F;4th&#x2F;5th parties connect to the ticketing system’s APIs and hope their automated monitoring can detect the issue before shit really hits the fan.<p>All of the above is for enterprise grade customers with SLAs and monetary penalties associated with down time. Sucks to be a home subscriber with no SLAs and no engineers in sight.<p>The agents are probably using the same ancient ticketing system but it’s most likely a different customer instance. They have to go look in the right other systems and unless you get rep with good tribal knowledge you aren’t getting anywhere.')
