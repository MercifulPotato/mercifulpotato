Also top-down parsers don&#x27;t handle (well) some of useful grammar constructs, and it&#x27;s tedious to remember always formulate grammars in a certain way. Next, grammars are for many people more convenient to work with than actual parser code. So parser generators have their place.<p>&gt; To quote Feynman: “What I cannot create, I do not understand”<p>And this can be true for parser generators. After you&#x27;ve figured how to do that you could be tempted to never use external tools, and have a nice jump from, say, arbitrary CFG to a generalized LR, while controlling all the parts in between.<p>&gt; • It’s not actually difficult!')
