And everyone else who is similarly confident that it could never happen to them won&#x27;t necessarily be there for you, because it&#x27;s so far out of their experience and frame of reference that even if they&#x27;re a generally decent person, they have trouble relating to the situation you&#x27;re in or understanding how they might feel in your place. And so the people who are least at risk, who are often the ones who could make the most difference, don&#x27;t always act as strongly or as frequently as they could to mitigate the risk to others.')
