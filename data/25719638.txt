The problem is that almost everyone who complains about what you might call &#x27;bad code&#x27; thinks that &quot;writing good code&quot; is the end goal, whereas almost everyone who writes said &#x27;bad code&#x27; has &quot;shipping products&quot; as their end goal.<p>From the outside that might look like a difference in design philosophy, but really it&#x27;s more a difference between someone who codes well because they care about their product and someone who codes badly because they have to put food on the table.')
