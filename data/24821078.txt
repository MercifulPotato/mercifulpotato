Competent people don&#x27;t like having to provide a lengthy justification for a simple question.<p>In my experience, most people who push back and start saying &quot;You really want Y&quot; are simply <i>not willing to listen to the story about A</i> - especially if it will take more than 1-2 lines to explain it. I&#x27;ve found this to be the case both online and in person.<p>As a somewhat related example, a decade ago I was building a PC and had been given a huge discount on a pretty powerful Intel CPU. I figured out all the parts (motherboard, etc), and went to a well known forum to post it and solicit feedback.<p>Now the CPU was overpriced. You could pay 40% less and get another CPU that was almost as good. I knew this, but it was irrelevant as with my discount, I was getting it cheaper than the alternative.<p>I posted my question, and acknowledged the price discrepancy, and almost all the responses were: Don&#x27;t get that CPU, get the cheaper one. I made it explicit that I wanted a <i>technical</i> answer and not an <i>economic</i> one. I even said &quot;Well, assume I&#x27;m getting it for free.&quot;<p>The problem was that pointing out that I was getting my CPU even cheaper with a discount <i>did not change anyone&#x27;s response</i>. Some people ignored it altogether. Others simply refused to believe I had a discount, claiming I was a wealthy newbie who was hell bent on paying full price just to get a tiny performance improvement and wasn&#x27;t willing to admit it.<p>Eventually some people took me at face value and answered my questions, but I spent a <i>lot</i> more time justifying my choice of CPU than on the actual questions I wanted answered.<p>Also, asking:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to do X. I&#x27;m aware of Z and I agree it&#x27;s usually the way to go, but I have some restrictions such that Z won&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>Doesn&#x27;t work.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to do X. I&#x27;m aware of Z but I really want to see if I can do this with X.&quot;<p>Doesn&#x27;t work.')
