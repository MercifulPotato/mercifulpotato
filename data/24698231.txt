Item(by='zinodaur', descendants=None, kids=[24698304], score=None, time=1601995869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24698001, text='&gt; Does this mean I can&#x27;t farm old Dungeons&#x2F;Raids and Low-Lvl-Areas on my own anymore? This was quite nice to chill from time to time.<p>Most zones have ranges, e.g. level 1-60. So coming back to that zone at lvl 120, you can easily defeat even the most scaled up monsters. Old dungeons&#x2F;raids are easily soloable at max level.<p>The zone scaling has made leveling a much better experience, since you can skip the more this-was-made-15-years-ago content without being stuck without quests&#x2F;content to do.<p>I personally really like the pvp scaling as well since it results in a much higher volume of interesting fights. Its also sort of a necessary evil that comes with the zone scaling, since people do zones out of order. E.g., a level 30-60 zone will have level 30s and level 60s questing in it, and pvp with a level gap like that is boring for both parties')
