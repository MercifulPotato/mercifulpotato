That&#x27;s true from top to bottom.<p>There&#x27;s policy contributions (e.g., California Prop. 13 makes local jurisdictions dependent on development fees and other growth-related revenue because property taxes are limited to a low nominal level and decline in real terms as property is held because of the limitations on assessed value increases to significantly below the historical average rate of inflation), but new-project subsidies aren&#x27;t a root cause but a symptom of the cause which would exist even without the subsidies.')
