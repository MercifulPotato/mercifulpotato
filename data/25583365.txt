Many of them do not have any previous working experience whatsoever and I personally think that this is the best way to test their abilities.<p>The thing is, some of them aren&#x27;t familiar with the programming language we&#x27;re currently using, and I&#x27;ve been wondering whether they should be required to use it nonetheless in the home assignments, or use their language of choice.<p>What do you think? Is it too steep of a learning curve for a home assignment or is it legit? What did you do?')
