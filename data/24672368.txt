I realized it&#x27;s nonsense, because the first part contradicts the meaning of &quot;exact&quot;. I vowed to never use that phrase again.<p>I feel the same about &quot;probably almost the truth&quot; (not a criticism, just a thought) - unless truth is a range (100% true to 100% false) rather than a binary (either true or false).')
