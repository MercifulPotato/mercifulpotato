You get budget, you create the new team, if it sucks, reorganize or fire the team (and offload the services to other teams).<p>I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s all Conway&#x27;s Law. We literally just don&#x27;t want to think about the design in a complex way, so we make tiny little apps and then hand-wave the complexity away. I&#x27;ve watched software architects get red in the face when you ask them how they&#x27;re managing dependencies and testing for 100s of interdependent services changing all the time, because they literally don&#x27;t want to stop and figure it out. Microservices are just a giant cop-out so somebody can push some shit into production without thinking of the 80% maintenance cost.')
