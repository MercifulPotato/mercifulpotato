I read through that paper, which is not very much about the treaties, but I also didn&#x27;t find any compelling arguments that the treaties say more than below.<p>What I gather they say is Japan gives up rights to the SCS and territories they siezed from China are returned to China (RPC, ROC, whatever).<p>However it doesn&#x27;t say the Spratlys and the Paracels are returned to China, for example because Japan seized them from China.<p>I agree with your last points - the larger picture is that China can claim whatever they want, but their arguments aren&#x27;t good enough to get the approval of major world players. So they&#x27;ll have to protect their position with force or trading favors.')
