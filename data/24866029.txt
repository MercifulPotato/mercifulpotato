Chargers for nickel-metal-hydride batteries won&#x27;t correctly charge lithium-ion batteries, or worse nickel-cadmium batteries. Not to mention that some battery packs (the ones in the Thinkpad come to mind) have a &quot;battery monitor IC&quot; actually built into the battery pack so it helps to start with an existing pack and then &quot;re-manufacture&quot; it with cells rather than just wire together the same number of cells.<p>Perhaps to most critical element in these &quot;smart&quot; batteries is the temperature sensor which dials back the current when they start getting hot to avoid thermal runaway. (source of MANY battery fires in laptops from counterfeit battery packs).<p>As for matching the cells, in our battlebot we would take each &quot;unit&quot; (which in our case was 20 NiMH batteries) and condition it by draining it and charging it in cycles while monitoring voltages to level out the batteries and &quot;sync&quot; their charge levels. We still ended up with a couple of fires but that was because we were charging them right at the limit of what is reasonable to do because the time between bouts could be pretty short.')
