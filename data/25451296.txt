The use of very small trickle charges is preferred to reduce the negative effects of overcharging.<p>C&#x2F;40 constant trickle-charge is good for NiMH chemistry.<p>-----------<p>The simplicity of trickle-charge is one of the defining reasons to use NiMH over other chemistries. 15mA * 40 == 600mA-hrs, which should be safe for even tiny AAA-NiMH cells.<p>EDIT: Ah, I assumed the article was going for the Trickle Charge technique. Hmmm... it uses a 555-timer for &quot;current limitations&quot; which seems... harder than just using an OpAmp + transistor.')
