However there are some things that I wish I could have:<p>- a good terminal mode so I don&#x27;t need to switch to another terminal, the builtin terminals either lag badly after 10K lines of input or render&#x2F;behave strangely when used with ncurses programs<p>- pervasive, non-blocking async, this has gotten better over time especially with language servers being on separate processes, however many common tasks block usage completely, such as upgrading&#x2F;installing packages<p>The reason I bring this up is because imagine those points but applied to your window manager.  Since Emacs is not multi-threaded, if something inside Emacs freezes your whole X session will become in blocked case you run Exwm. For the same reason, it is a bit more responsive.')
