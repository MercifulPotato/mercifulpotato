Back in 2004 or so you got full cartridges along with new printers, and the printer cost <i>less</i> than an ink set would. So a friend at the time would buy a new printer every time theirs ran out of ink. He had a leaning tower of printers in his closet (and about half a dozen drivers installed).<p>Later on they started including &quot;starter cartridges&quot; instead.
