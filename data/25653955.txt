The programming courses on Khan Academy are great. I will mention your child needs to be ready for it. At that age, a few months one way or the other is huge, as is having the mechanics of typing and mousing.<p>Next step from there is the book &quot;Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software (Developer Best Practices) &quot; and Nandgame, as well as Micro:bit.<p>I recommend against Scratch. It&#x27;s a rabbithole that goes in the wrong direction. You get stuck in a local minimum, where it&#x27;s really hard to move onto real programming, and within Scratch, there are a lot of local minima (move to random position).')
