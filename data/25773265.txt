Yay diversity!<p>You have people in positions that shouldn&#x27;t be there.<p>For instance, Ann Kelleher is an idiot. She will not get Intel to 7nm.<p>Period.<p>She has the position because she is a woman. When you point out her mistakes, deficiencies, you get fired.<p>How about hiring a woman that knows what she is doing? Lisa Su seems to know what she is doing.<p>No. Not Intel. Let&#x27;s promote solely because she is a woman, then spend every 6 weeks celebrating her promotion, the diversity, and how woke we are.')
