The amount is staggering.<p>You know my hypothesis why, because they don&#x27;t have side projects. They have silo&#x27;d themselves into whatever niche project or have been on maintenance mode on a piece of software for years and never evolve. Sometimes it&#x27;s not their fault, their company has pigeon-holed them into whatever software and they can&#x27;t escape for whatever reason.<p>They should have side projects (if they care to keep learning) or lest be left behind those in more dynamic companies or those that have side projects to evolve.')
