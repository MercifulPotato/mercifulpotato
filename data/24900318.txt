Open &#x2F;home&#x2F;user&#x2F;my-image.png. Ok.<p>The capabilities model re-orientes operations like this. The app starts with some kind of handle to a starting directory. Maybe it&#x27;s to &#x2F;, the root, maybe it&#x27;s to &#x2F;home&#x2F;user, the user directory. Whoever has a reference to that directory handle can use it to open files &#x2F; other directories inside that directory, but can not go upwards!<p>So if you have a file-saving middleware, you can be sure, whatever libraries that middleeware uses, that it will never write to anything other than the directory you give it.<p>This is a subtle &amp; small change, with massive impact. Most OS have a parallel system-call that works similarly, openat(2), which is built around this idea of directory handles.')
