Chromebooks (used by my kid&#x27;s school and issued&#x2F;recommended by many districts) just seem to suck at connectivity. Even with a symmetrical 1Gbps internet connection, it was a non-stop battle for the first 2-3 weeks of school. A few things I learned along the way:<p>- Chromebooks hate dual-band SSIDs. All of the kids were issued different Chromebook models, and this was a universal truth for all of them. Separate SSIDs for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz is critical.<p>- Chromebooks hate mesh networks. May not be universally true, but is at least the case for the mesh network created using a standard ATT Fiber gateway and the Airtie extenders they sell[2]. No matter the disparity in signal strength, they&#x27;d do their damndest to try to connect to the AP they first connected to.<p>- Chromebooks hate &quot;wide band&quot; networks (i.e. 40Mhz 2.4Ghz networks and 80Ghz 5Ghz networks). Even in uncrowded airspace, they seem to have problems.<p>- Chromebooks seem to have decent plug-n-play support for USB ethernet adapters, but mediocre support for USB wifi adapters. Neither of which is found in the official documentation; the only way to have any confidence that a particular dongle&#x2F;adapter will be supported is to cross-reference the chipset of the adapter with the net drivers in the source code[3].<p>- It&#x27;s an oddly common issue for Chromebooks to have loose wifi antennas internally. Probably not in higher-end models, but definitely in the lower-end models issued by schools.<p>I finally got things working stably, but it was mind-boggling how fussy they are. And many of the issues (such as the first two) only became apparent during live video streams, so it was a constant battle of fiddling with stuff in the evenings and testing it via performance during classes the next day.<p>With the amount and type of troubleshooting required to get to that point, it&#x27;s no wonder wifi issues are the prominent complaint.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.t-mobile.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;education&#x2F;project-10-million" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.t-mobile.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;education&#x2F;project-10-milli...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.att.com&#x2F;buy&#x2F;accessories&#x2F;internet-equipment&#x2F;att-smart-wi-fi-extender-white.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.att.com&#x2F;buy&#x2F;accessories&#x2F;internet-equipment&#x2F;att-s...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neverware&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neverware&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;drivers&#x2F;net</a>')
