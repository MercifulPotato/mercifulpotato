A 2015 13&quot; MBP (which is Broadwell) can drive two 4k displays; the only limitation is, that each of them must be connected to separate TB port.<p>For Linux, I don&#x27;t know, the only older machine with Linux that I have is Ivy Bridge one, and that is capable only of 4k@30, which is uncomfortable. With Kaby Lake, it&#x27;s nice.<p>Also, lag is a latency. That would suggest, that your problem is somewhere else, not in the raw GPU performance. GPU itself doesn&#x27;t have anything with the output resolution anyway, it is handled separate, dedicated block called output encoder.')
