But as the old adage goes: I know 50% of my advertising is worthless, I just don’t know which 50%.<p>So why haven’t we run out of suckers yet if this stuff is really that bad? If businesses weren’t seeing the ROI, you’d think they’d see that. So either, as bad as it is, it’s still worth it, or they aren’t able to measure ROI properly (a distant third: they are able to, and still do it?)<p>I’d love to hear from someone with first hand experience.')
