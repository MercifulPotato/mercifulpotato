Item(by='aequitas', descendants=None, kids=[25227305], score=None, time=1606469529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226847, text='&quot;You only need a lock that looks better than your neighbours&quot;.<p>If you take your average thief, they will walk past your house and if it looks like it&#x27;s worth breaking in they will do this, or go to the next house that looks easier or more promising. They won&#x27;t even notice your custom smart lock solution and think it might be hackable (unless it&#x27;s a common brand with a generic explain available, think of scriptkiddy hacking skill requirement). They will go for the easiest thing, like a open window, or break a small window to open the door from the inside.<p>Now if you have a dedicated thief that wants to rob you specifically, they might want to invest into hacking your lock. But only if the rest of your house is already a fortress, or covertness is really key. But if they really want something they might just take an axe to your door and threaten you to open your vault.')
