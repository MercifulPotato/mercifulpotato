She (along with many other researchers, over years, not a  sudden thing) has come out with some rather startling results that, as I said, are being applied by these guys and many others. A key result is that it is the quantity and diversity of the life in the soil that is as (or more) important to soil health and hence farm results (now <i>and</i> long term)  as the actual levels of plant nutrients in the soil. And this is because it is the soil life (they use the term &quot;biology&quot;  for it, but okay, go with the prevailing term the experts use) that makes the chemical nutrients <i>available</i> in forms that plants can actually use, via a deep symbiosis and mutual helping that happens between plants and the soil biology, which includes bacteria, fungi, archaea, nematodes, arthropods and small animals.<p>Another quite surprising &#x2F; non-intuitive result is her saying that <i>most or all</i>  soils on earth, already have many times more  the amounts of nutrients than  plants need, like 1000x more, including macro (e.g. N, P, K)  and micro ones (like trace elements), so the limiting factor is really the soil biology, which depends a lot on soil organic matter content (all those critters need to eat), humidity and temperature, all of which are helped by organic farming, permaculture and regenerative agriculture practices like applying organic fertilizer (manure, compost, etc.), mulching, and cover cropping (according to her, more for the organic matter than for the nutrients per se).<p>Check her video below in which she talks about all these things.<p>Watch &quot;The Roots of Your Profits - Dr Elaine Ingham, Soil Microbiologist, Founder of Soil Foodweb Inc&quot; on YouTube:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;x2H60ritjag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;x2H60ritjag</a>')
