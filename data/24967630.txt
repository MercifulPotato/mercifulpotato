Meaning, the &quot;immediate action&quot; requirement on GitHub&#x27;s behalf, doesn&#x27;t appear to even exist here.<p>With most companies, Hanlon&#x27;s razor would probably apply (&quot;never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity&quot;). But in this case it is rather dubious (if not shocking) how GitHub&#x27;s legal department appears to have completely failed to do their basic job.<p>As a company, GitHub at least has a legal duty to know the law, or be held accountable for the consequences of their actions when they monumentally fuck things up (while doing serious harm in the process).<p>Either way .. with Microsoft&#x27;s track record in mind, GitHub&#x27;s silence on legitimate questions regarding the validity of the RIAA&#x27;s actions, and now this warning of inflicting harm to people if those dare to not play along with the companies dubious legal decisions .. all in all, I&#x27;d say that GitHub has long lost any benefit of a doubt by now.<p>With every day passing, this appears to be shifting more towards plausible (if not likely) malice. On top of that, this isn&#x27;t a light matter either. Most likely a serious anti-trust violation and might even constitute a criminal enterprise. Not that I expect US authorities to do anything about it, considering its own dubious and dismal track record, for at least several decades.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;808cf690f8e801381778002590d8e506" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;808cf690f8e801381778002590d8e...</a>')
