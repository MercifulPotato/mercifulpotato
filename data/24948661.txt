For example: work from home -&gt; spend less on transport, spend less on mobile food, company spends less on office space.<p>Regrettably there&#x27;s transition pain for workers in  abandoned sectors but other sectors will grow out of this (e.g. deliveries&#x2F;home office equipping&#x2F;remote work centres).<p>This transformation of what work entails, to its essentials, with less office face time, will benefit civilization at large in the long run (Antifragile).<p>I support financially assisting &amp; retraining displaced workers through this transformation, and am against &quot;bailing out&quot; obsoleted corporate entities.')
