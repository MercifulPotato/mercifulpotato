It&#x27;s a bad idea because it slows you down and is unnecessary because your project isn&#x27;t at a size yet where normal social management techniques break down due to scale.  The vast majority of projects don&#x27;t need a statement-of-the-obvious CoC until it gets to a scale past dunbar&#x27;s number IMO.<p>I don&#x27;t need to see a person&#x27;s behavior rulebook if I&#x27;m going to play D&amp;D at a meetup, or jam on some music together or whatever.   The vast majority of casual stuff like that doesn&#x27;t need it and shouldn&#x27;t need it.  Neither does joe&#x27;s casual github project either.')
