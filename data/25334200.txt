Branches are cheap in Git, and you can do PRs between branches so that the reviewers are only seeing the new changes in that branch.<p>In your example, I&#x27;d create a branch for R1, and publish a PR for R1 -&gt; mainline when it&#x27;s ready. Then I create a branch for R2 from the R1 branch, using R1 as the upstream.<p>When R2 is ready, I publish a PR for R2 -&gt; R1, and create a branch for R3 to start working on it.<p>When there is feedback for R1, I switch to that branch and make those changes. I&#x27;ll squash those changes back into the original commit(s) of R1, and update the PR.<p>Then you rebase R2 with the changes you made from R1, rebase R3 with the changes from R2, etc.<p>As long as the changes between each branch are not on the same lines of code, the rebases are painless and quick.<p>I name the branches with a key to support ordering, something like:<p>1_add_dependencies\n2_add_scaffolding\n3_feature_A\n4_feature_B<p>This way they show up sorted when you list branches, and it&#x27;s obvious what their dependency ordering is.')
