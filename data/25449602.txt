Given that it does exist, it’s a horrible choice I wish upon no one. Given that choice is ever made, it’s a horrible thought to consider punishing a woman for making it.<p>All of that said, as a society we have a responsibility to do better than almost a million abortions a year (~20% of all pregnancies) in the US.<p>I think a better male contraceptive choice would go a long way to reducing that number. As usual, I believe in a technological solution to societal ills.')
