In multiple RCTs, a wide range of targets, including skeletal muscles[19-22], risk factors[21], vasculature[19-22], respiration[22,23], autonomic function[24], cardiac function[20,22,25-27], exercise capacity[26], inflammation[27], quality of life[27], physiological markers such as VO2peak, and endothelial function, showed better improvements with HIIT than with MCT.<p>This is true even though the HIT groups were spending just minutes sprinting a few times a week, vs the MCT groups that spent 30 minutes to an hour running or jogging.')
