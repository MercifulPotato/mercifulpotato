And even if its instant, losing all my state is annoying. Sure, a proper window manager can restore state, and a good tab manager will preserve those too, but its a freagin pain in the ass. Plus the pre-boot sequence is slower than the actual OS booting, so I still consider that a pain.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m petty (to each their own), but rebooting once a week would drive me nuts, nevermind once a day.')
