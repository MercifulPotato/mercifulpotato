I promise I&#x27;m not a quack.<p>I pretty much ignore anything Trump has to say, since he was obviously going to say it was rigged upon losing, so his opinion contributes no info to my mental model.<p>I keep hearing from conservatives that the actual evidence was never properly examined in court, and that the cases were mostly dismissed on issues of legal standing.  Not being a lawyer, I have no idea how to interpret the legal results from any kind of objective standpoint.<p>I feel crazy, because every rational person I usually turn to is saying that it&#x27;s a settled matter, but I haven&#x27;t seen any good &quot;breakdowns&quot; of the actual allegations and their validity.<p>Back in November I felt pretty confident dismissing stupid Benford&#x27;s law claims and sketchy graphs pointing out &quot;Biden spikes&quot; in Michigan.  I had the data in hand and could confidently dismiss those.  No fraud.<p>I watched the whole interrogation with the PA whistleblower mailman who talked with Project VERITAS, and I came away understanding that he was paranoid and confused and probably in way over his head. No fraud.<p>Electronic voting has always been criticized, so I don&#x27;t know why this year should be any different.  But that just seems worse, that potentially decades&#x27; worth of elections could have been tampered with if any of those Dominion claims are true?<p>But it&#x27;s been weeks and weeks and there was a bunch of &quot;evidence&quot; since then, and I don&#x27;t have the time or energy or legal expertise to make any sense of them.  I feel like I&#x27;m going crazy because all my moderate&#x2F;liberal friends are convinced it&#x27;s the stuff of conspiracy theories.  This is keeping me up at night, feeling like the whole exercise of democracy could be a total sham, and possibly always was.<p>Is anyone else having this epistemic crisis since November?  Is this how people become conspiracy theorists?  Can anyone else relate?')
