After 3 years of preaching, most of the actuaries now use RStudio + git as their primary work tool. It is happening.<p>What we did :<p>1) Provide documentation on everything from install to using internal R libraries for ETL.<p>2) Provide mostly problem free, always updated VMs with RStudio Server&#x2F; Shiny Server.<p>3) Establish an hotline channel for instant help on R or git.<p>4) A couple members on the team developed really close working relationship with IT and we have great respect for each other work.<p>What we provide is way better and by being active, we built users trust in the tools.<p>We are phasing out SAS and proprietary modeling tools. Python never took hold even if we bought Anaconda entreprise. Excel is there to stay for sure but since actuarial student learn R in school, it is easier to onboard new hire.<p>If you want to go down this path and have a chat, hit me up. I&#x27;m in P&amp;C.
