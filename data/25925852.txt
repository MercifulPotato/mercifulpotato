When the environment is right there&#x27;s no upper bound on the pace of delivery, it&#x27;s just that modern day dev is, in many places, less about quality of the output (in terms of product&#x2F;market fit and user value, not code quality) and more about the satisfaction of ceremony. You couldn&#x27;t product manage Google into existence, or any truly valuable piece of software, hardware, or any other innovation, but it&#x27;s customary for organisations to create structures which feel grown-up in order to yield software.<p>The talents now required to enter the field are also different, which has naturally played a part in the perceived slow-down. Development is a new field, and research into what makes teams effective is limited - we&#x27;re still using the ideas of industrial steel production to try and bolster the present manufacturing line. This means there are plenty of undesirable behaviours.<p>But ultimately, it&#x27;s about what you&#x27;re optimising for. If you hire outstanding people and give them an excellent brief, you can deliver incredible software at pace. Most modern companies don&#x27;t optimise for this, it&#x27;s more about satisfying sprawling teams, polishing egos, and chasing incremental gains. In that environment you can bet delivery is slow.')
