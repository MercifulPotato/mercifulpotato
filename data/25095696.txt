Generate a phrase on one then import to the other<p>3. Put the second one in a safety deposit box in another city or state, or a safe with a family member also out of the city or state.<p>4. Keep a copy of the phrase on steel seed phrase tool (Steely, etc)<p>5. Mount the steel seed phrase backup inside of a wall of your house and plaster and paint over it.<p>6. If your phrase ever gets seen by any electronic means, it&#x27;s compromised and the process must be redone (note that importing uses a randomly shuffled alphabet on the device to make MITM or keylogging attacks unusable).<p>So... Security is hard. We should build systems that make it easy. There should be ways to recover from backups of a service goes offline, but we can&#x27;t expect everyone to make good decisions.<p>Not to mention having passwords synced between devices and available on demand is really a requirement of you use random passwords for every site and need to log into something (heaven forbid) on someone else&#x27;s device.')
