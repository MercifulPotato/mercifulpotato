I may be wrong, but it would appear that you feel personally attacked. I am not sure how people storming capital AND fighting cops AND leaving pipe bombs in said building want to kill you specifically. I do not see the connection. Are you a staffer&#x2F;lawmaker&#x2F;cop there or something?<p>I recognize that tensions are high, but shouting &quot;literally neo Nazis&quot; is not a great argument in US for a variety of reasons ( not completely unlike antisemitism, it lost some of its punch ).')
