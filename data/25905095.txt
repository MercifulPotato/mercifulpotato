(and yes, in most cases I can find it within seconds when I need)<p>Some would rather miss on information, but have less cognitive overhead, with minimal organization (e.g. a daily diary&#x2F;todo-list, and that&#x27;s it).<p>I&#x27;m also not sure it directly relates to doing &#x27;productive&#x27; stuff (in whatever sense) -- there is certainly a plenty of people who don&#x27;t keep track of any information, and also don&#x27;t do much apart from passively consuming. You could be super concentrated on your work and have no mental energy for learning other subjects, or you could be more relaxed at work and be engaged in more topics outside of it.')
