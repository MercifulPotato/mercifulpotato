Yes, it might be more valuable to users for a program to be cross-platform, but it is definitely more enjoyable to develop something that just has to run on a single platform.<p>For cross-platform work, you have to use languages, runtimes, and libraries that are supported across multiple platforms.<p>When you are doing single platform work, you can use all the cross-platform languages and libraries and tools, plus all the other languages, libraries and tools that are on the single platform.<p>I suspect the difference was even more stark in 1999 because Windows was even more dominant than it is now.')
