And if you are accessing live instance, you can be pretty sure that you won&#x27;t accidentally break it by obtaining a database lock.<p>Now &quot;csv&quot; in particular is kinda bad because it never got standardized, so if you you have complex data (punctuation, newlines, etc..), it you might not be able to get the same data back using a different software.<p>So consider some other storage formats -- there are tons. Like TSV (tab-separated-values) if you want it simple; json if you want great tooling support; jsonlines if you want to use json tools with old-school Unix tools as well; protobufs if you like schemas and speed; numpy&#x27;s npy if you have millions of fixed-width records; and so on...<p>There is no need to bother with SQL if the app will immediately load every row into memory and work with native objects.')
