What, if this would be true in general? What do these implementers actually implement then?<p>I also think, I have another definition of &#x27;idea&#x27; than most people here. It is common especially in software development, to see the way as the destination and incremental change as development caused by some magical good-ending evolutionary process. This includes a quite unsubstantiated belief in getting the right ideas automagically along the way.<p>You need both things. A good idea does not descent from heaven. Also, it has history in the person, creating it. This history is hard work in its own, inner fighting against the common and the environment. Jumping out of the box, all these pure implementers are unable to do.<p>I am working for 25 years in the industry. I have written real code from the beginning. But I am also a mathematician and can say I had a few good ideas along the way. I am proud of it.')
