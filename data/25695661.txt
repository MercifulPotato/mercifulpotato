If election observers are 6 feet away, they can&#x27;t read the letters written on a piece of paper, so can&#x27;t tell if an election worker is, for instance, allowing someone to vote multiple times and crossing off some other name instead, or accepting a ballot with a signature that doesn&#x27;t match the voter&#x27;s records. If election observers are 20 feet away, they can&#x27;t even tell if there&#x27;s any writing on a piece of paper, so election workers can let through blank mail in envelopes, or switch papers around, or put papers in the wrong box, or pull papers from a box into the wrong stack.<p>&gt;coordinated fraud<p>Do you think it&#x27;s implausible that a group of people that have all been selected at some level by democrat politicians, who have a deep seated hatred of Trump, would have some difficulty coordinating to engage in illegal activity?<p>&gt;because an election official was watching from too far away<p>No, election <i>observers</i> were too far away. I do not trust election officials in these controversial areas, because they are, at some level, there because democrat politicians want them to be.<p>&gt;And no hard evidence of this conspiracy anywhere exists, but it totally happened.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it exists at this point. Some forms of election fraud would be very easy to get away with carrying out without any evidence remaining. How would you ever know if an election worker got two mail in envelopes, one obviously fake and the other real but from a part of town that goes heavily republican, took the inner contents of the fake one and put it in the good pile, and took the inner contents of the real one and put it in the bad pile? If an observer couldn&#x27;t tell it was happening, how could anyone find out after the fact? How hard would it be for a box of invalid election materials to never be found again? Do you think the FBI is rummaging through the garbage of all of these facilities?<p>&gt;Is this your position?<p>Allow me to turn it around on you. Is it your position that it would be unjustified for the democrat election officials and workers to cheat to make sure Trump lost, given the list of things they (I assume sincerely) believe about him that I posted above? (Owned by Putin, elected due to russian interference, climate change, women&#x27;s rights, racial hatred, border separations, voter suppression, undermining democracy, etc etc)')
