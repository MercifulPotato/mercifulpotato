I&#x27;m doing my best to figure it out with my armchair sound theory but i&#x27;m very far from an expert in that or PCM... correction invited:<p>A semitone at 440 = +-26.16 Hz<p><pre><code>   1&#x2F;64 = 26.16&#x2F;32 = +-0.8175 Hz\n</code></pre>\nSo i guess the question is: Are 0.8175 Hz differences close to limitations of PCM at a normal 48 KHz sample rate for reasonable tone lengths?<p><pre><code>  48000&#x2F;440      = 109.0909090909091\n  48000&#x2F;440.8175 = 108.88859902340538\n</code></pre>\nSo for 440 Hz there are either 109 or 110 points per sinusoid, averaging 109.09. For 440.8175 Hz there are either 108 or 109 points per sinusoid averaging 108.88<p>Although the true sinusoid doesn&#x27;t start and end at exactly on those points, this is how many points &quot;land&quot; on each period. There are also subtle differences in the amplitude of each point on different periods with the same number of points - i&#x27;m not sure how to rate that in terms of perception but my suspicion is that we are affected more by the average period, by using the highest&#x2F;lowest points (half a period).<p>If true, the duration becomes very important, 108 periods fit into 1 second, which gives us a max precision of 1&#x2F;108 = about 0.93% i.e +-1.013 Hz error... which is larger than the difference we are trying to detect.<p>I&#x27;m not confident in these calculations, but It does at least seem very close to the precision limit of 48KHz... So I&#x27;m guessing the starting position of the modulation has quite an influence on which way that error swings, and this could account for the differences we are hearing between +1&#x2F;64 and -1&#x2F;64<p>&lt;&#x2F; hand waving&gt;')
