I was aware that NAD+ could accelerate cancer growth, but does anyone know if there&#x27;s any evidence to suggest NAD+ could cause cancer or at least increase the likelihood of developing it?<p>From what I understand most experts seem to think it&#x27;s probably safe and will extend health &amp; life span, but the cancer risk is something that concerned me when I started. Surely if healthspan was as easy as just raising NAD+ levels the body would have already evolved this trait?')
