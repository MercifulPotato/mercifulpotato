Unfortunately guidance has been inconsistent. Some states have qualification standards that prohibit network connections on tabulators, some states have standards that allow it, and some states don&#x27;t have standards at all. In non-binding recommendations, the NIST is against network connectivity but the FEC takes a softer line on the topic. This is a great area to lobby state governments, all state standards should prohibit internet connectivity.<p>Generally, from a network security perspective, electronic pollbook systems are a much greater concern as they are connected over the internet as a matter of standard practice, and it&#x27;s difficult to avoid this while preserving functionality. There are also more, smaller vendors for EPBs and they receive significantly less scrutiny or security review than tabulators.')
