So many actually that the school had to construct a drop-off zone. I&#x27;m not entirely sure when it started or why, but when I went to the same school 20+ years ago it was not a thing. Everyone walked or cycled to school (or used a kick sled the few days of winter when that was possible) from their first day. I know they have the same problem at most schools in the country, which is Norway BTW.')
