The paper&#x27;s title is \n&quot;No evidence that vitamin D is able to prevent or affect the severity of COVID-19 in individuals with European ancestry: a Mendelian randomisation study of open data&quot;\nWhich is correct; no evidence was found in the study that correlated Vitamin D levels with Covid severity. But yes, this is not an RCT and we cannot use the study&#x27;s conclusion to definitively disqualify Vitamin D supplementation.<p>&gt; it was not even based on data about actual vitamin D levels<p>Medelian Randomization is a pretty well-established study technique which _isn&#x27;t_ an RCT, but often yields results close to them. It&#x27;s a bit simplistic to say that &quot;the data isn&#x27;t about actual Vitamin D levels&quot;, when MR is specifically a study method used to step around direct measurements to analyze effect.')
