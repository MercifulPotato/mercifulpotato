The Department of Labor, or some other government agency, could publish many different metrics that explore the issue of unemployment in many different ways. Because like any social phenomenom, there are lots of different ways to slice this pie.<p>Instead the USG deliberately chooses not to, because they don&#x27;t want the issue of unemployment explored. Congress could mandate that unemployment metrics be gathered in dozens of different ways, with dozens of different definitions for what it means to be unemployed. But they don&#x27;t. This is the point, and really the only point that matters.')
