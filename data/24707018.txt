Yes, I know that many of these issues are due to Apple&#x27;s way of handling third-party password managers.<p>Almost all of my devices are Apple or PCs with Linux.<p>So:<p>1. I&#x27;m a Firefox &amp; Safari user (use Chrome only for web dev and work).\n2. I&#x27;m looking for something with good cross-platform support, decent UX.\n3. I don&#x27;t think that price would make a difference, but if I had two similar options, I&#x27;d pick an open source one, or one that is supported by a privacy aware org. (I tried Mozilla&#x27;s Lockwise as soon as it became available)<p>What do you use and why?')
