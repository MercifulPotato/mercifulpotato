Item(by='abruzzi', descendants=None, kids=[25521330], score=None, time=1608750463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519785, text='after an accident ~15 years ago, I was discharged after 6 months on 120mg of Oxycontin daily (40mg 3x a day)  After being frustrated being tethered to the oxy bottle, I went cold turkey.  The first thing that happened after the withdrawal symptoms subsided was I found I had chronic diarrhea.  After years with my doctor trying different things, I found that the symptoms could be managed with about 16mg of loperamide.  That was great for a while, until the FDA restricted the bottle size.  At that point I could no longer buy enough over the counter, so I now have my doctor prescribing it for me.  Unfortunately 16mg a day is the largest amount they can prescribe (IFAIK) so if it gets worse, I&#x27;ll have to figure out another solution.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this happened, but my suspicion is that while hospitalized I was infected by MRSA, and to try to get rid of it they were dumping some of the more toxic anti-bacterials into me to get rid of the MRSA (which took a year and a half to get rid of.)')
