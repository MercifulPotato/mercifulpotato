You&#x27;re comparing these things against Guix and Nix, which <i>require you to learn a new language</i> to use. Not to mention that AppImage, at least, is only complex because it kinda has to be in order to be portable, single-file, directly-executable application. Which is to say, it is only complex in its implementation so that it can be much less painful to interact with [0].<p>&gt; Nix on the other hand solves the problem extremely well. You can have different complex applications running side by side with very different dependencies trees and they will not cross paths.<p>Which AppImage can do without you having to learn a new language, and as a bonus will even let you store those applications on entirely different media without recompilation or anything.<p>&gt; Similarly, Nix is easily installed on any existing system.<p>AppImages work on most Linux systems, which is about as well as anyone can do with something that requires no pre-installed runtime.<p>[0] and it actually isn&#x27;t that complex really.')
