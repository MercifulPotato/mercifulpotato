And performance (or power consumption) may still suck, if you can&#x27;t use the frame buffers directly for output to some HW overlay.<p>Linux kernel APIs are fairly straightforward, and easy to use, if you use them directly from some simple app. But making it work across all the abstractions from browser, to compositor, to display server, via ffmpeg, via libva, etc. is not easy at all.')
