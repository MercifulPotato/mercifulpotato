It&#x27;s also about partitioning application-level data to reduce inter-core synchronization to let speculative, out-of-order cores run independently as much as possible. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, user-level threads are great, and arguably much simpler programming model than async&#x2F;await. But they&#x27;re not _the solution_ either.')
