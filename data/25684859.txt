Most consumer-ish hardware falls prey to all sorts of various TEMPEST attacks. You can even get started with a HackRF and some inductive loop antennas. It would set you back $130 or so on ebay.<p>From there, you would have to establish some sort of baseline - that would be the hard part. Once done, you&#x27;re going to be dealing with amplitude based signals (2ASK primarily). The next step is to determine the frequency the device is running at, and tune to it or 2nd or 3rd harmonics.<p>From there, it&#x27;s getting the signal out of the noise, and decoding it for the win.<p>I&#x27;ve done it a few times. Sorry, I don&#x27;t have a CVE to my name.')
