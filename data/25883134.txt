The second one already is longer. So whatever your model of reality, the <i>complete</i> model is reality itself and it proves that point. What else would be better for arguing than the actual real-world outcomes?<p>If you want to say things like &quot;but there were less people working on the problem&quot; you are removing things from the real world to build a more limited model to fit your argument. Overall getting enough people to work on the problem is part of it. Including <i>everything</i>, which includes getting attention and resources devoted to a problem in the first place, the moon landing indeed was easier. I think it&#x27;s not much of an argument that exactly that, getting a vast effort rolling and people and resources devoted to a problem, really <i>is</i> one of the hardest problems. It was pretty easily achieved for the moon landing.<p>If you want to separate the policy problem of getting the resources from the technology problem you are only looking at a part, to get the desired outcome both are needed. Sure, the technology part was harder for the moon landing - which makes it even worse that the other part, the policy stuff, is so hard to accomplish.')
