If it wasn&#x27;t compelling to do these things, they wouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>FOSS and copyleft isn&#x27;t about requiring anyone to do anything, it&#x27;s about increasing user freedoms. Users and developers have more choice today in the Java ecosystem thanks to all of JDK distributions. I think it&#x27;s you who has mistaken OPs comment to mean companies are being required to do something, when in fact everyone is benefiting by playing by the same copyleft rules.')
