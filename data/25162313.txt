For example, &quot;African-American&quot; is often used to describe any black person in America. But what if you&#x27;re a native Ugandian who lives here but not yet a citizen? That term is useless. Had a good friend from school who came over from Nigeria to study here, and he hated the term because he neither identified with Americans blacks, nor did he want to.<p>The fact that we&#x27;re now back at just Black is where we should have been all along.')
