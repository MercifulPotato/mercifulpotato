Not sure if this was because of the light intensity or that mutating the cell with channelrhodopsin just made it weaker in general....<p>granted, not sure how intense of a light you&#x27;d need; I&#x27;d think the channelrhodopsins activate w&#x2F; just a few photons at the right wavelength...<p>Coming from the clinical&#x2F;Parkinsons&#x27; disease world, if someone made a stable viral vector specific for the basal ganglia though, that would certainly help w&#x2F; one of the biggest problems of clinical DBS - after 30 years of doing this, the biggest biggest biggest problem in whether the implant will work or not is still the +&#x2F;- 2mm accuracy of the stereotactic frame implanting the electrode...(no matter what surgeons&#x2F;stereotactic engineers claim...)')
