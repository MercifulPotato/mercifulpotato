Chess, Infosec, Atheism, philosophy, reddit, etc HATE trump for example. Then I have other echo chambers that tend to love Trump. Personally I&#x27;m neither side as I&#x27;m not American. I also enjoy looking at both sides and it&#x27;s remarkable how different the viewpoints really are. The echo chambers worked exactly as expected, those places that hated trump only hear about things that are terrible about trump. Nothing negative about Biden at any point. Every single Gaffe by Biden was portrayed as completely fake as deepfakes or old footage dubbed over etc.<p>Generally speaking my echo chambers leaned anti-trump. The one thing I failed to find in the last 2 months is any actual discourse. There is absolutely no neutral viewpoints. There is absolutely no discussions between the 2 camps. The political divide in the USA is worse than I have ever seen it.<p>The perception I have, that wasn&#x27;t a free and fair election. What&#x27;s even more curious is that nobody seems to care. Ends justify the means. Which hey, I personally very much prefer Trump to lose. However, if healing the political divide is a goal, that&#x27;s basically impossible now.')
