Well, they harvested the thymuses of at least one of the miners, which then contained the fully passaged virus, no laboratory passaging necessary.<p>Why didn&#x27;t this cause an outbreak in 2013? Initially, the virus was not infectious to humans without the kind of megadose that the miners received, and by the time it had evolved enough affinity for human ACE2 receptors, all of the medical staff involved in the care of the patients were extremely careful.<p>I&#x27;m just paraphrasing the paper that is cited in the articles conclusion. It&#x27;s worth a read, and NYmag gets some of the details wrong. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independentsciencenews.org&#x2F;commentaries&#x2F;a-proposed-origin-for-sars-cov-2-and-the-covid-19-pandemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independentsciencenews.org&#x2F;commentaries&#x2F;a-propos...</a>')
