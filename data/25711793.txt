Check out the Telehouse website and try to find their AUP page. If they did have one, it&#x27;d basically just say you can&#x27;t use the peering point for illegal activity. Companies like Amazon are customers of exchanges and that&#x27;s how they get to enjoy things like section 230 protections. But it&#x27;s clearly &quot;common carrier for me, not for thee&quot; if you read their own policies, since the AWS AUP says &quot;you&#x27;re not allowed to host offensive content&quot;. Moral of the story is if you want your online business to be governed by law rather than aups, just buy a PC and drop it by an internet exchange and set up a contract with cogent or someone. Then you can&#x27;t be destroyed because you displeased a politician on Twitter.')
