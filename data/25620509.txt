They aren&#x27;t <i>impossible</i> to deal with, and if it&#x27;s clear they have made some obvious mistake they will generally quickly resolve the issue. However, the moment ambiguity comes up I have found that the people they send to talk to you don&#x27;t have the necessary context or authority to really tell you what is going on behind the scenes, and the process moves forward so slowly that you risk hitting the deadline they give you. At that point you have few options but to go public, after which they will get back to you immediately with a fairly sane explanation of what the actual problem was or perhaps an apology if they were wrong.')
