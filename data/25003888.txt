So I&#x27;m in the same position as OP, I maybe should not have spent time migrating my projects to travis-ci.com. Although I guess this buys me a bit of time to move to github actions instead.<p>Travis is the reason that many people DO CI at all, in my experience. They made it so easy -- and free for open source --  that there was no reason NOT to do it. Then once you see the value of it, you are hooked, you can&#x27;t do without it. But I think the number of projects doing CI (open source and not) skyrocketed <i>because of travis</i>. Prior to travis&#x27;s entry on the scene, CI was not nearly as universal as it is now.<p>So to say that offering free CI to open source is &quot;unsustainable&quot;.... I dunno, they managed to do it for 9 years, were they losing money the whole time?<p>I think the free service for open source literally <i>created the market</i>. Or expanded it exponentially. It was the first exposure a lot of people had to CI, and they took that first step because it was so easy and free.<p>And now we&#x27;re hooked. If there weren&#x27;t <i>other</i> free alternatives like Github Actions, I don&#x27;t know what open source would do... we all know we can&#x27;t develop this stuff <i>without</i> CI, but so many open source projects simply don&#x27;t have a budget for it.')
