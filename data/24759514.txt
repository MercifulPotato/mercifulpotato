So that problem could be entirely solved by issuing some fraction of officers hunting rifles to carry in their patrol car&#x27;s trunk.  No need to kit them out like infantry or give them APCs.<p>The police&#x27;s advantage in numbers and organization would take care of almost any other disadvantage WRT weaponry.')
