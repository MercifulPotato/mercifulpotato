Several acquaintances wanted a simple video hosting platform, and they didn’t want to go through Vimeo or YouTube. Having used Wistia before, I propose this one because it’s a great tool, but they are not attracted because they have to pay $99 as soon as they have over 3 videos and&#x2F;or want to put their branding on the player. So they kindly ask me to do you know IT stuff to make this for them. I did it once, twice, three times... and I just thought why don’t I make a platform for it. And thus was born Hodho an alternative of Wistia.<p>Hodho is a simple Nestjs application backed by a PostgresSQL database. On the frontend, I use React. About analytics, I only collect information useful to understand how your video is viewed. I don’t know if John Doe in his house in Seattle watched the video at 1PM. If the user has put the DNT in his browser, I don’t retrieve the information from the browser, country, language.<p>The demo video comes from the transistor.fm website. Justin Jackson has kindly accepted to let me use the player for showcase purposes.<p>I would love to hear your feedback. Thanks and smile! :)')
