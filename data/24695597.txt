When DNA recombines at conception, it only snips and stitches in a fairly limited number of places. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;mix&#x27; finely like paint. It&#x27;s more like taking two short pamphlets of ~25 pages, cutting each numbered page horizontally at a random vertical point, and then assembling a new pamphlet of the original size from each pair of pages (pamphlet A&#x27;s page from above the cut, pamphlet B&#x27;s from below).<p>All this to say that if you go back something like 800 years, you have ancestors from whom you didn&#x27;t get any genes at all.<p>This means that these infintesimal mixings have even less impact than you&#x27;d think. A modern Japanese person could have a European ancestor who traveled to Asia a thousand years ago, but have zero genes from that ancestor. Which means that while that European is technically an &#x27;ancestor&#x27;, this is just a bit of historical trivia, it means literally nothing about that Japanese person&#x27;s biology.<p>---<p>On to the color commentary:<p>I suspect that articles like this are <i>heavily</i> influenced by the politically-based drive to try to minimize intergroup genetic differences in humans. The reality is opposite the title - humans are far more distinct, especially on group levels, than is commonly understood. The notion that single common ancestors (among trillions) mean people from hugely divergent groups are &#x27;related&#x27; in some meaningful way is just exploiting and expanding the ignorance of the public around how genetics actually work.<p>It&#x27;s arguably a pro-social thing to do; I&#x27;d say I agree with the philosophy here, but that doesn&#x27;t make it true and the &#x27;noble lie&#x27; seems anything but to me.<p>The genetic evolutionary difference between distinct groups like Europeans, sub-Saharan Africans, and Australian Aborigines is something like 70,000 years of divergent evolution with very very minimal gene flow between the groups, in completely different environments. The genetic split between timber wolves and Chihuahuas was like 5,000 years ago and I bet they have common ancestors much more recently than that.')
