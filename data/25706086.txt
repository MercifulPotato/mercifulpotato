I&#x27;m heavy into Urbit now, learning their programming language, Hoon (more mindbending than Brainfuck).<p>I just checked on opensea.io; you can get a planet for 0.04 ETH--around $50.<p>Urbit is the Next Big Thing--I haven&#x27;t seen anything like it in 40 years; it&#x27;s a &quot;computing platform&quot; blank slate! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll ever go away because there are enough tech people to keep it going. I can also see academia using it.<p>Setting up your own planet is a real hassle. Soon, you will be able to &quot;rent&quot; your own planet for a monthly fee (like paying for an ISP), and the provider will take care of all hardware and software. On the other hand, you can put your planet on a server for $10-$20&#x2F;month.<p>Look into it; it&#x27;s going to be a wild ride!')
