Item(by='Tainnor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605914103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164839, text='Yes, this is definitely a problem.<p>I would just do away with the sin^{-1} notation (as, it seems, many textbooks already do) since we have the perfectly acceptable alternative &quot;arcsin&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also not a very good notation since it&#x27;s trying to imply that the sin function has an inverse, but it doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why &quot;sin^{-1}(sin(x)) = x&quot; is not even right in general. The inverse only exists on specific subintervals, and it&#x27;s also off by a multiple of pi, depending on that subinterval. &quot;arcsin&quot; is then defined as the inverse of sin, restricted to the interval [-pi&#x2F;2,pi&#x2F;2].<p>Of course, the bigger issue here is that f^n for any function f is inherently ambiguous, because it could refer either to the (pointwise) multiplication operation or to the composition operation.')
