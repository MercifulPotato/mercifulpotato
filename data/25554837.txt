Linear is much, much better. It&#x27;s much faster, the design is better (easier to understand what i&#x27;m looking at, switch between board and list views), and doesn&#x27;t have infinite complexity. You can create tasks, and subtasks, and projects, and that&#x27;s it. There are Cycles (sprints) with some neat scheduling tools for it, that may not be useful for you if you don&#x27;t work that way -- our team does so it&#x27;s very nice. I&#x27;d recommend giving it a shot, I think once you actually use the application for about 5 minutes you&#x27;ll understand if it&#x27;s worth it or not.')
