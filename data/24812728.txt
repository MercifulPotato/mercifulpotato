Item(by='aitrean', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602964649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812519, text='&gt; I&#x27;m genuinely surprised that the HN community thinks a toxic comment like this is upvote-worthy<p>Is this ad-hominem really necessary? I&#x27;m sharing a thought about the ridiculous nature of bay area hustle culture.<p>&gt; Contrast this to what the author actually said: &quot;Optimizing learning over money early in your career.<p>Contrast that to what she goes on to say in the article itself. She laments on how she missed out on Uber stock rising by not ditching Apple sooner. She then pulls a figure out of thin-air about how much net worth you&#x27;re going to lose by &quot;wasting&quot; your career on any given year by not following her arbitrary framework for self-worth.<p>&quot;Optimizing learning over money early in your career&quot; would bear far more weight if she actually used an example like going into academia, or joining a tiny startup with low pay. Going from one 150k+ position to another 150k+ position with (<i>gasp</i>) lower performing stocks (!!) is hardly a sacrifice. Moreover, she speaks as if she already knew Uber stock was going to go down when she joined. Uber happened to tank Apple happened to rise. But she acts like she factored that into her decision before she left Apple.<p>I&#x27;m genuinely surprised some people still can&#x27;t recognize how absolutely out-of-touch it sounds to lament over a &quot;wasted&quot; year of career at Apple, while most of the world is just trying to get by. Likewise, claiming you stopped finding opportunities to learn anything at Apple after only 6 months sounds like self-inflating bullshit.<p>So, I hope I have eased your surprise. It&#x27;s toxic to tell people that they&#x27;re wasting their career by valuing stability and work-life balance over weird learning frameworks, and net-worth. It&#x27;s not toxic to call out such privileged fools for doing so.')
