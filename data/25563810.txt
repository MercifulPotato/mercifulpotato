I finally decided to look into it as I was considering going back to fulltime work from working on my own projects. Great hour long chat with the recruiter, great hour long phone interview with a Googler who went to my school. Was told that I&#x27;d hear from a manager in NYC when they got back from leave in a month. Nothing. Heard from the original recruiter a few months after that asking if I was still interested. Said yes and relayed my experience. And then nothing again. It really saddened me as I was quite excited about the prospect - I had friends working there and loved the idea of possibly being able to create and then build a big thing as a 20% project in addition to working with a smart team of folks. I never wound up looking into Google again.')
