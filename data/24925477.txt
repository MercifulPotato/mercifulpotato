I assume the list that don&#x27;t use is small at this point - but any funds that use bloomberg are also contributing to the bloomberg empire and thus also putting money into moving the various needles he influences in different ways - or not.<p>A running tally of how much money has gone to bloomberg from the various places over the years &#x2F; lifetime of the fund or broker house, would be interesting too.')
