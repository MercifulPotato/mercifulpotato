There&#x27;s a very LOUD subset of programmers that absolutely do, because they&#x27;ll tell you they do every chance they get. But if you only listened to the comment section on sites like this you&#x27;d think that <i>nobody</i> uses Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc rather than them being more stereotypical for professional shops than Vim&#x2F;Emacs.<p>If you look at Stackoverflow&#x27;s survey[0] it gives you <i>some</i> idea, but because it is a [Select All that Apply] question it can inflate IDEs that are good for occasional&#x2F;general purpose usage (e.g. Vim, Emacs, Notepad++, VS Code, etc). They should ask people what IDE they use MOST.<p>It is the same thing as Windows, you come to any programming message board you&#x27;d think 99% of programmers use Linux professionally, but in the corporate world (which is the majority of programmers) Windows rules the roost.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2019#technology-_-...</a>')
