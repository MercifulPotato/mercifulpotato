Because I&#x27;m a happy user of ActivityWatch -- a fantastic similar tool, which, quoting the authors is &quot; The best free and open-source automated time tracker. Cross-platform, extensible, privacy-focused.&quot;<p>I encourage you to check it out, if you haven&#x27;t already.  The pluggable and diverse watchers that AW uses are the true source of its power.  It&#x27;s under active development (donno why another comment claimed otherwise) and I&#x27;ve been using it on everything for 2 years now.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to do a head between the two, and a writeup.  I&#x27;m sure there are features that will &quot;cross potentate&quot;  between the two projects')
