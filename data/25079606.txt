The vast majority of the country is working normally, much more so than anywhere in Europe or the Americas.<p>Similar measures could have been taken everywhere else, and we would have been long over this, and with minimal deaths. Instead, we are where we are. We still have the option of doing a 3 week heavy lockdown that could probably reset the clock on the virus, with direct government payments for every person affected to reduce the economic hardship. There is no better known solution to this problem, until the vaccine proves to be efficient.')
