It&#x27;s the only thing anyone can give me when they assert that the O&amp;G industry is the recipient of subsidization. And it&#x27;s a total joke. It mentions stuff like asset depreciation and LIFO inventory accounting. Basic accounting principles are not subsidies,  and are not specific to the oil industry. The author was clearly stretching to try to prove a political point; it is not an accurate representation of the facts.<p>The point is that the government does not pay you incentives to consume oil like it does for electric cars or solar panels.')
