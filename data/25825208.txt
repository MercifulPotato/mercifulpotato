Other people here mentioned that sounds like a waste of money, but I honestly am not sure as I don&#x27;t have good figures about how different treatments cost.<p>However, I believe that by doing so I can avoid preventable conditions later in my life and it&#x27;s well worth it both for my quality of life and potentially for other people as I might not need that much medical assistance and leave it for those who need it.')
