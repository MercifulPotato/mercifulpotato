It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for two nations to have border skirmishes <i>and</i> have bi&#x2F;multi-lateral trade agreements simultaneously.<p>A nation is a multifaceted entity and it isn&#x27;t possible to model it as one single blob. Inter-nation relationships are very fluid, and evolving all the time.<p>I find it funny when I see Indian social media flare up with &quot;ban Chinese goods&quot; whenever there are border skirmishes. It&#x27;s as if trade and border-disputes somehow won&#x27;t fit together and that there is a very sharp line between &quot;ally&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot;.<p>Unfortunately, politicians take advantage of this sharp divide in people&#x27;s mind to rally large groups of people against an imagined threat from a nation to garner support&#x2F;votes. My father-in-law was very agitated about India-China border skirmish thanks to all the media coverage. In his mind Indian economy would be doomed. I asked him if the condition of the shitty public road he travels by each day improve if India won that dispute. He is perfectly fine to accept the crappy day-to-day life (non-existent roads, shitty power supply, un-usable water etc.,) but would suddenly get riled with some random dispute thousands of miles away!')
