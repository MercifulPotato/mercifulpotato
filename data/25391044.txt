So it&#x27;s not so clear.<p>&gt; The expansion in the productive possibilities linked to tech was combinatorial, but even in a period of ten years it barely improved your business.<p>If you are focusing on one business, there&#x27;s little change between barbering now and not just 10 years ago, but even 200 years ago. But small changes are enough - even taking appointments online frees the barber time. So there&#x27;s some growth.<p>&gt; The expansion in the productive possibilities linked to tech was combinatorial, but even in a period of ten years it barely improved your business.<p>However, you are missing the 99% of businesses that are impossible with 1800 technology.<p>This cause growth, and much more than the little growth seen in barbering.<p>&gt; The truth is that every frontier has a point of diminishing returns<p>Diminishing returns are perfectly compatible with asymptotic behavior.<p>&gt; We might still see a lot of economic growth left in the future, but it&#x27;s clear there will be plateaus and it&#x27;s clear that we are nearing one<p>You don&#x27;t understand (or you do, but don&#x27;t want to see it): as long as f(yu) &gt;= f(yt) for yu&gt;yt, there&#x27;s infinite growth.<p>It may be less and less, if it&#x27;s asymptotically going to 0, but it will never reach g=0.<p>Plateaus are fine - just like recessions. Yes, the economy is not strictly increasing with a time granularity that too small. But group years by pack of 20, do a moving average and you&#x27;ll see a strictly increasing function. g&gt;0 which means infinite growth is possible, even if g may not be to your liking.<p>Perfect? No. Good enough? Yes!')
