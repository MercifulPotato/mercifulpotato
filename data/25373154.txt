CentOS Stream is <i>not</i> a pure &#x27;rolling&#x27; distro; it&#x27;s still tagged by CentOS major release, i.e. there will be a CentOS Stream 8, CentOS Stream 9, etc. The &quot;rolling&quot; logic applies to <i>minor</i> updates within a CentOS major release, but even before this, it&#x27;s not like RHEL or CentOS were publicly releasing backported updates to earlier minor releases, so practically speaking you were forced to be on the latest minor release anyway. People are correct to point out that this is somewhat of a trade-off in stability but it was always there.  The one thing that&#x27;s new with Stream is that there will be a faster release process for these updates, and that&#x27;s a very good thing.')
