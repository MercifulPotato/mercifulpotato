New college hires rarely have much a clue about this but engineers and senior engineers should be able to have a conversation about it. To be fair because of time constraint, I don&#x27;t have candidates code this but do want to entertain the discussion. For example, what happens if i pass &quot;illegalValue&quot; to your method, or what do you think your solution should do when the service dependency you call fails to return.<p>The sentiment is important because it shows how a candidate ties the requirements to the customer use case that it is serving. Not being able to connect these two is a concern in my mind especially for those who are not new college hires with little real world experiemnce.')
