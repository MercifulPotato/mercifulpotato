There’s even infighting within the LA County Board of Supervisors, and talk of some cities to create their own health departments.<p>&gt;14. The new State framework is rife with inexplicable inconsistencies of logic.<p>Not just that, you should read Garcetti’s stay at home orders last week, ordering people to stay home with 12 pages of exceptions.<p>&gt;15. Beyond the basic human needs for air, water, food, shelter, and safety, it has, to date, been impossible for me to define what is “essential” to the 800,000 people who live here.<p>At this point, it seems like it’s up to the business owner to decide if they’re essential. Anecdotally I’ve heard of every small business owner here in LA call themselves essential simply because they “support essential infrastructure”.')
