That right is inherent in the company being a private entity.<p>The Republicans, who are furious because Twitter blocked stories about the Hunter Biden laptop, like to claim that their freedom of speech was impeded, as if the first amendment applies to private individuals or companies. It does not, it only applies to the government limiting a persons right to free speech.<p>The vitriol against Section 230 is really designed to punish companies for not allowing proven false materials by the far-right. The Republicans want to open up the floodgates of lawsuits against these companies for this reason.<p>Repealing it will not made free speech more open, more likely it’ll construct it greatly as companies heavily restrict what can be published.<p>Per a question as to how this could hurt small business&#x2F;startups, FB and Twitter have the resources to fight the lawsuits, startups don’t.')
