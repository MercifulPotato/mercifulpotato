If they do, no money is asked for them benefiting from the global IP rep DB. The one willing to use it without contributing will be able to do so, through API calls, but at a (moderate) cost. We&#x27;ll have 2 plans, premium &amp; enterprise. They we will provide support, tools for fleet management (like deploying a policy on X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z servers from a central location), AI (to spot larger trends), cold log analyzes (forensic, but harder coz of GDPR), tailor made bouncer responses, bounce back to us and self IP monitoring (to see if they are caught in a consensus, hence have been hacked). Also, bouncers, the components blocking Ingress IPs are able to work without the GO daemon, by just using the IP rep DB. Think for exemple someone willing to protect a group of IoT machines, low CPU, low mem, the API approach is close to costless in terms of resources and allow those machines to be protected without running the daemon.')
