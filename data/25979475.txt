Item(by='csydas', descendants=None, kids=[25980337, 25979662], score=None, time=1612106876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25979096, text='The so called power users, like any other, have many facets. Sometimes they&#x27;re quite cooperative and indeed, they push edge cases that other users simply don&#x27;t, advance powerful workflows using your tooling you never thought of, etc.<p>But they can also be down-right arrogant and self-centered ;)<p>I think the scale of influence the article is talking about is bigger than personal circles and is focusing more on huge user bases. The power users I deal with daily are a mixed bunch; some are very earnest in their pursuit of using our product to its fullest extent, which is great; they open themselves up to risk by pushing new features their limits, and we&#x27;re willing to work with them as they continue to invest further into us. This is great because in this scenario we have the same end goals, so it works out and it&#x27;s a good investment for everyone involved.<p>For some power users though, as soon as our goals deviate and we&#x27;re no longer looking in the same direction for a given feature&#x2F;product, it&#x27;s like a really bad break up, and quite a few do not like to take it silently or easily. I have some that have been threatening to leave the product for 3+ years because we&#x27;ve elected not to invest resources further into a specific feature (low demand, market is turning away from this feature, the investment is simply too great at this point to justify the cost). But they never leave, for reasons I&#x27;m not going to speculate on.<p>The way that our power users act regarding such decisions is frankly borderline harassment at times; spamming forum posts, harassing our support team with endless cases just to complain about a feature they know we don&#x27;t have, it can eat up a lot of time. The power users insist they are right, and that our decision is &#x27;a huge mistake we just don&#x27;t understand&#x27;, and they continue to remind us of this -- it&#x27;s hard to not consider the attitudes arrogant, and the language used to describe themselves feels a bit too self-congratulatory.<p>Frankly speaking I don&#x27;t like the tone of the article even if I agree with some of its points as it sounds too much like the bad users mentioned above.<p>So as with all things, it&#x27;s best with moderation and constant doses of reality. Without these checks, it&#x27;s easy to get a very bad relationship set up and such relationships take a lot to advance to a more stable position.')
