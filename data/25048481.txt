If you use Rider or VS pretty much every one of those lines can be auto generated with autocomplete.  Also, this can easily be worked around.  Just create a Singleton which has the settings injected into it.  I prefer the testability of the injected version but if you&#x27;d rather access a static global it is very easy to do.')
