The design of the language is biased to make slow compiling across the full pipeline.<p>Is possible to get into a shout contest about this :), so just look at what Pascal(Delphi) do and how absurdly fast it is, despite the fact is still a &quot;batch compiler&quot;.<p>So in the presence of pascal (that is even more complex than Go, to be a really close to C&#x2F;C++ in capabilities) is clear that Rust is MADE to be slow.<p>And to the point, I used more than +12 languages already, super popular things like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endler.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;rust-compile-times&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endler.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;rust-compile-times&#x2F;</a><p>NOT exist for Delphi. The &quot;how make delphi compile fast&quot; is to just use delphi. It will compile fast.')
