That&#x27;s a pretty big difference; is it because of design changes required to be legal to drive in the U.S., or largely just shipping and tariffs?<p>On their website, they list the bigger K23&#x27;s battery type as &quot;Ternary lithium&quot; whatever that means.  They describe the K27 battery just as &quot;lithium&quot;.  I wonder what they actually use; is it lithium iron phosphate?  Or &quot;regular&quot; NMC lithium-ion?  It would be interesting if they use different batteries for the US version and that&#x27;s a big part of the price difference.')
