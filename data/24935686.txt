They&#x27;re so focused on insane metrics they don&#x27;t realize that by killing everything new - good and bad, people are just going to give up on the company entirely because their reputations sour over time.<p>I mean why am I going to try something new from Google just to find out they&#x27;re cancelling it in 2 years?
