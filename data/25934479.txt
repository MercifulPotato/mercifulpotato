I wrote almost 50% of the code base. Those two projects use very few classes, probably only the models. Everything else is a bag of functions organized in modules.<p>It&#x27;s very similar to an Elixir &#x2F;Phoenix project I&#x27;m working on for another customer. Modules and functions and a couple of dozens of GenServers that act as objects to maintain status where we need it.<p>And yet, I easily follow the OO model of Ruby of Rails. I feel it right in that context, probably because the rails of RoR are more well defined than the ones of Django. Of course when I script in Ruby I bet rarely write a class. A few functions, actually methods of Object, are all I need there.')
