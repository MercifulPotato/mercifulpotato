Anyone who thinks Socialism is some <i>de-facto</i> virtuous ideal needs to see that collusion between State and X happens in just about every Industry already for private largess. And often is sanctioned, regulated or at least likely to have light to no punishment if caught: see banking fraud.<p>I honestly want COVID to make the University model obsolete, it will have been worth it if people see how nebulous and impractical the absurd expenses when in reality you can do 75% of courses online anyway; its entirely a predatory model. This is such a drag on young people&#x27;s lives to have 50k+ in debt in your 20s and are some how sold the idea that you are &#x27;making it&#x27; by working to pay that off just to get some entry level position you could have done with a 1-2 year apprenticeship by the time you were 16 like they do in many Germanic Countries.<p>It&#x27;s absurd to think this model can go on, and as you mentioned the pernicious statistic rates they are worse because not only is it short sighted thinking that doesn&#x27;t add value to Society, it can only extract it from those least likely to afford it.<p>I got honors and letters of recommendations while I was in my undergrad and the only time I ever too them out were to show employers when I applied&#x2F;interviewed for jobs, and most didn&#x27;t care either; otherwise they sat in a desk in an envelope as they&#x27;re reminders of time poorly spent in something I had no interest in by the time I was a sophomore and would come to hate entirely but couldn&#x27;t get out of until I was 26 due to the debt.')
