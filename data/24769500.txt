Some of the ideas behind Haskell intrigue me, but I&#x27;m a complete idiot. Now everyone is going to say that you don&#x27;t need to understand the different theories behind purely functional languages to learn Haskell or know any math, but I&#x27;m not quite convinced. Just the vocabulary alone of most Haskell programmers I talk to seems foreign to me. I&#x27;m not just talking about half-jokes like <i>zygohistomorphic prepromorphism</i> either. The dictiob used in normal programming discussion makes no sense to me.')
