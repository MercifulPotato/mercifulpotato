It&#x27;s not reasonable for me to expect websites to keep working the way they always have.<p>For SaaS of course, that&#x27;s something to be aware of. Since I don&#x27;t have the hardware and software under my control, I have no say in when the supplier stops providing it. Many people have learned this the hard way with Google services, just as an example (there are many others, not picking on Goggle in particular here).')
