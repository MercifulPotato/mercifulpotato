Though I do think this problem could be solved without a union. It&#x27;s really about opening up compensation information.<p>Broken promotion process&#x2F;age discrimination&#x2F;interviews:<p>First of all, broken processes are not going to get better with a union. They will still be broken, just in different ways.<p>Union favors&#x2F;protects seniority therefore the promotion process will still push out high performing employees because they need to &quot;wait for their turn&quot;. In fact the running joke we had about promotion was that you could only get promoted if someone:\n1. Dies\n2. Retires\n3. Quits<p>Age discrimination happens less than in SV tech companies but not by design. In general the workforce in a union shop is older but you also have a lot of low performing lifers counting their days to retirement. On the other hand, interview is far less rigorous since the key factor is &quot;likability&quot; (aka culture fit). Many interviews took place just to satisfy a policy when a pre-determined candidate was already chosen.<p>Will I ever work for a unionized IT shop again? Not a chance.')
