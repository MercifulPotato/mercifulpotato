The only thing being used is the name of the project to mislead consumers without being openly fraudulent, in such a way that it damages or limits the ability of the original authors to monetize their work.<p>The closest analogue in FOSS is the forking or reuse of projects to intentionally cannibalize the original work - which is covered by less permissive licenses like AGPL.<p>Whether it&#x27;s music or software isn&#x27;t the point, it&#x27;s about the rights of the original creator to control how the work is spread and copied, which can be a bigger deal when that impacts the ability of a creator to monetize it. Music is only substantially different than software in that it isn&#x27;t maintained after creation that requires continual support payments by its consumers.<p>If you&#x27;re in a position where you can freely distribute your work to others, you&#x27;re in an incredibly privileged position to begin with.')
