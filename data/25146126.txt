Even then, there&#x27;s a very active question of how many uplinks each given uplink (&quot;gateway&quot;) would need to make, to provide the massive amounts of bandwidth required. Anyhow, I found a couple numbers on spectrum that are semi-interesting to me to assess what spectrum resources Starlink has purchased. According to this site[1], Starlink has:<p>27.5 – 29.1 GHz and 29.5 – 30.0 GHz and 47.2 – 50.2 GHz and 50.4 – 51.4 GHz = 6.1GHz of spectrum for uplink from base-stations (&quot;gateways&quot;) to satellites<p>10.7 – 12.7 GHz and 37.5 – 42.5 GHz = 7GHz of spectrum for downlink from satellite to user &quot;terminals&quot;.<p>According to this page, a year ago they were authorized to run 6 gateways.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much throughput they can push to a satellite with 6.1GHz of total spectrum. It&#x27;s still interesting to me to try to consider how even the current 893 satellites get anywhere near enough throughput up to them to be well utilizing their own downlink capabilities. I&#x27;m still only inuiting, but it still feels like something doesn&#x27;t add up, I still don&#x27;t see how the fleet is going to get enough bandwidth. My previous image of a data-center bristling with dozens &amp; dozens of dishes pointing &amp; tracking upwards indeed doesn&#x27;t seem quite right (and the side-lobe interference question I was asking about), but the alternative, of a massive network of ground stations each boasting colossal connectivity, seems almost equally hard to imagine.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonx.net&#x2F;starlink-compendium&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elonx.net&#x2F;starlink-compendium&#x2F;</a>')
