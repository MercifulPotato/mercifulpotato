I have worked in a different tech market before coming here - India.<p>The whole of Europe&#x27;s tech scene is smaller than India&#x27;s. I think that is the reason for the pay gap. Even despite that the pay for engineers is significantly above the median wage.<p>I live in the Netherlands and I make a salary similar to doctors, lawyers and dentists. So the face value of the salary may be lower but it is a lot for here.')
