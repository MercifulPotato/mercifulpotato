I remember the time well because DOOM had just come out on PC and suddenly there was a compelling reason to have a home network! I believe this was the first well-known PC game to have a multiplayer mode over LAN.<p>We got the LAN cards, coax cables, and T-connectors for cheap (or free?!) as I guess many businesses were already upgrading to the simpler and more flexible 10Base-T around that time. Terminators were very difficult to get, but we could make them at home by taking a segment of coax and soldering a resistor between the inner and outer conductors!<p>You loaded a DOS IPX driver for the LAN card before starting up DOOM. I think there was some way to share files and mount drives between PCs without a server, too, but I forget the details of that.<p>No switch or hub hardware was required - all the nodes on the network were just connected by one big string of coax with our home-made &quot;terminators&quot; at each end.<p>The whole thing was very fragile as any break on the cable (or disconnection of a terminator) at any point would take the whole network down. But for a home network it was fine. Good times!')
