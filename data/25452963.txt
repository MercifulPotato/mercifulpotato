I read up and practice speed-reading for quite a while. I&#x27;m no longer interested in the number of books read per year but I&#x27;m more picky these days, digesting the best I can of the lesser number of quality books that I read.<p>I still do speed-reading when I stumble on part of the book that are not interesting to me or I have read very similar concepts before (most non-fiction books in the same genre).<p>For context, I used to hit 60-70 books per year when I was counting. This year, due to the Pandemic (last time I checked) I have read over 70+ books as picked up by Goodread from Kindle. So, I will likely be hitting about 100 in total this year.<p>But yes, I will slow down and try to be more picky ahead.')
