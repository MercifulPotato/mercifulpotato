That means there&#x27;s very little in the way of discrete logic to unit test without a bunch of mocking. In a system like that, I think the only meaningful tests are integration tests.<p>For people who only work on that kind of glue code, it&#x27;s easy to forget that testable units really do occur in other kinds of coding. But I promise they do.')
