Love the idea, I&#x27;ve built a card game to teach innovation (www.intrapreneurs-game.com) so I appreciate the effort that goes into designing a game, I&#x27;m currently trying to get my game developed as an app because I&#x27;m doing some remote workshops in 2021 and want to use it, thanks for sharing')
