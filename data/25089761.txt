Much more simple plan that trying to feed humanity with pills, or drawing veins in a chunk of soy.<p>Some people has in mind a fixed, immutable THEN part and -after that- they look for an IF random part that would support the narrative. A part that would typically involve cute things crying in danger and emotional distress.<p>Who cares if it tags people with real names as &quot;torturers&quot;? (is my opinion, so it must be reality because opinion = true facts, right?). Who cares if the facts were faked, distorted of shown in a questionable way to fit into the replaceable part of the slot?<p>This is not an honest way to do things.
