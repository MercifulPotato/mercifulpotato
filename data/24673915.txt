Meaning you can’t use a different ticket selling service for that venue.<p>There was an attempt to argue they were a monopoly that should be regulated due to the % of the ticket they retained (Pearl Jam spearheaded this in the 90s).  It didn’t work.<p>Also I see nothing wrong as a business model with the Firebase analogy.  If you could convince customers to go for it, then why not?  Will the business model police arrest you?<p>What I don’t get about these arguments is that they’re trying to get the government to punish a couple of companies that built a very successful business model purely because others want some of that dough.  This isn’t about monopoly by any historical definition, it’s about sour grapes.')
