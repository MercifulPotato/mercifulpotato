From the article, it looks like they were frauded mostly by in-app ads. And they were paying for installs - not actual trips.<p>So, no, Uber&#x27;s advertising here is a little different than (I think) the majority of companies. They are mostly paying for installs rather than sales &#x2F; conversions. A lot of newer &quot;app&quot; companies could be in similar situations.<p>Though, honestly, this seems like a massive fail on their analytics team for not figuring this out earlier. They should have been able to see that all of these &quot;installs&quot; from certain advertisers were not leading to trips.<p>In fact, it says they turned off 66% of ads. They didn&#x27;t randomly turn of 66% of ALL ads. They turned off this TYPE of ad, which they failed to earlier recognize was ineffective.<p>Step 1) assume your ads won&#x27;t work.<p>Step 2) have enough analytics &#x2F; logging in place to convince yourself the ads do work.<p>Step 3) if they don&#x27;t work, turn them off.<p>Looks like they skipped step 2 - which honestly, is not uncommon for a fast growing business - even if they are huge and already make a lot of money.<p>What they found isn&#x27;t even what people are discussing. They found that certain networks they were buying ads from were almost 100% fraud (which is pretty well known).<p>Instead, people here seem to be discussing that most online advertising is fraud, and&#x2F;or that there&#x27;s no way to prove it&#x27;s effective. That is absurd.')
