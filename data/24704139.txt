But people will make the (disingenuous) argument that you can transfer the H-1B to another employer...<p>The reason it&#x27;s a disingenuous argument is that the H-1B is not technically transferred: The new employer is actually filing a <i>new</i> H-1B petition, which, yes, is not subject to the lottery.  And the employee can start working while the petition is pending.<p>But here&#x27;s the thing: Even though the new petition is <i>very likely</i> to approved, it&#x27;s not <i>automatically</i> approved and there&#x27;s no guarantee that it will be.  Particularly if the new job doesn&#x27;t use the skills that make the employee special.<p>It also adds uncertainty to the job hunting process.  And, if the current employer finds out that they&#x27;re looking, they could be fired... which technically makes the ex-employee immediately eligible for deportation... which means there&#x27;s no counter-offers.')
