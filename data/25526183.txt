Although I won&#x27;t judge your opinions or preferences, the real issue with Youtube or any recommender system is the way it games your dopamine system.<p>Studies have shown how the prospect of an unknown reward riles up users of social media platforms. Is this a bad thing? It might depend on who you ask. For someone like me, who has been through multiple addictions (cigarattes, drugs), I know that abusing dopamine affects quality of life, productivity and happiness in general.<p>In that way, I think recommendation systems which optimize for higher engagement is toxic. I think there&#x27;s value in having an AI do the heavy-lifting of choosing the right content for us. But, the AI&#x27;s rewards should align with what I need, which is quality content tailored for me (whether or not it increases my engagement on that platform).')
