But, I agree, vegetarian diets are far more common due to poverty than ideology outside of most developed nations.<p>I don&#x27;t have strong reactions as a carnivore (omnivore, really) I have them as a former farmer, chef and a person that has an obsession with how broken the World&#x27;s food supply is and how it affects Humanity&#x2F;Society and our Ecosystem as a whole.<p>The truth is that most vegetarianism&#x2F;veganism isn&#x27;t more ethical despite the rhetoric as most vegetables are grown using conventional Ag practices and tons of inputs, using migrant labour that often results in a significant maladies for them. Furthermore harvesting of anything but a small scale garden will ensure that many animals are killed in the process as Ag machinery like combines are constantly catching up animals in the process. This happened to me several times.<p>My first year of apprentice in Biodynamic Ag was really eye-opening and even though that is the most holistic form of sustainable Agriculture, and often a mainstay for more affluent vegetarians and vegans in the EU, you soon realize that that reliance on solely a typical person&#x27;s plant based diet has its own dire consequences--massive water use, contaminated soil due to pesticide usage and soil nutrient depletion to keep up with demand.<p>Whereas an omnivore diet can acquire those essential amino acids, fats, and proteins from a relatively low-impact and sustainable sources like chicken eggs.<p>In short, their is no perfect diet and a plant based one has lots of unintended consequences that go beyond just the person who chooses to be one. Obscuring the facts behind rabid and uninformed ideology isn&#x27;t going to change that.')
