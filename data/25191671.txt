I hasn&#x27;t heard of the project before, knowing its failure makes me unhappier ;-(<p>BTW, In my dream, I hope there exists an ATX compatible motherboard and a standard specification for its CPU-board, so that you can fit an ARM machine inside an existing computer chassis, and allowing you to upgrade the chips by simply swapping CPU boards. On paper it looks possible, but in practice there are some potential problems (based on my limited electronics knowledge): signal integrity (PCI-E should be solvable, but DDR3 is extremely problematic) and heatsink. However, a compromise to put DRAM on the CPU board (soldered or socketed) should be fine, and heatsink is hopefully solvable if the CPU is power efficient. The HoneyComb LX2K workstation [0] is essentially designed based on this idea, it has a CPU board on top of a Mini-ITX board, and it doesn&#x27;t need heatsink.<p>Still, without many high-performance ARM CPUs for selection, it&#x27;s essentially only a big Raspberry Pi...<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solid-run.com&#x2F;nxp-lx2160a-family&#x2F;honeycomb-workstation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solid-run.com&#x2F;nxp-lx2160a-family&#x2F;honeycomb-works...</a>')
