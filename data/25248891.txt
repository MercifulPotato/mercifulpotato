It&#x27;s trivial-ish if you&#x27;re operating over a custom data link from a nearby location.<p>The more remote the operator, the bigger the lag and the bigger the threat of signal loss.<p>And you can&#x27;t rely on the Internet because of lag and potential packet loss or congestion.<p>It&#x27;s hard enough to get everyone on the same screen in a Zoom meeting. Driving a car remotely and shooting at people over a patchy mobile data link is a whole other level of complexity.')
