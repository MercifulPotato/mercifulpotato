If you bought a machine and 2 months later, exactly what you wanted two months ago comes out, you probably won&#x27;t enjoy that experience very much.<p>However, less discriminating users probably both won&#x27;t know about the leak, and won&#x27;t find certain things coming out quite as disappointing.<p>I think it probably works out decently for Apple even if they really don&#x27;t want the leaks, much the way piracy probably helped Microsoft Windows by helping make it a complete de-factor standard (though Microsoft seemed aware of that and seemed not to crack down as hard as they might for that reason.)')
