I think there&#x27;s some inheritant bad faith (even if unintentional) in asking sensitive questions to a forumn with no validations on identity or expertise. Your odds of finding someone that knows these things deeply that doesn&#x27;t also have an emotional connection to them are relatively low (there aren&#x27;t a lot of phds in sports medicine floating around HN for example).  So instead it becomes up to someone directly effected to provide such responses and that&#x27;s just a lot; save the sensitive questions for the experts or come with direct quotes from published sources.')
