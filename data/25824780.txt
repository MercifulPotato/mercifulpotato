There are later intrusions into the peninsula, as it were back then. Oceania was settled even later by boat. The language divide in Australia is overwhelmingly that of earlier indians (if you&#x27;ll excuse the pun, the land bridge was connected to the Indian subcontinent), with other language families mostly limited to the north end<p>This I think might strengthen the argument significantly.')
