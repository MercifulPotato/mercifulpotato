In many instruments it isn&#x27;t even perfectly in tune, never mind perfectly in phase.<p>In fact it isn&#x27;t always in phase in electronic instruments. As soon as you add a filter sweep the harmonics are going to have small time-varying phase shifts because the filter phase offsets change with frequency.<p>None of this alters that this is a perceptual issue. Timbral fusion - which is a form of perceptual modelling - means we hear closely related harmonic patterns as single sound objects coming from a single physical source. We use our models to identify sound-generating objects&#x2F;animals&#x2F;events around us.<p>That happens in brain firmware, possibly because it&#x27;s evolutionarily optimal. But it&#x27;s possible - at a stretch - to imagine evolutionary contexts in which timbral fusion wouldn&#x27;t be a useful answer, and it would be more effective to hear individual overtones.<p>Or possibly both. Some trained musicians, piano technicians, organ makers, and so on can pick out individual overtones.')
