Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=[24934977], score=None, time=1603998946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934216, text='&gt; scared you into not fulfilling the genetic imperative, ending your own genetic line<p>&gt; It&#x27;s always a shame when an intelligent person chooses to ignore the sacrifice every one of their ancestors made to bring them to this point<p>Ok please don’t project your creepy literal-Darwinist ideology on other people. The parent comment literally said “one of many reasons.” I am not having kids because my “genetic imperative” is about the species itself, not my specific genes, and I sincerely don’t care about whether or not the Ojnabieoot Dynasty makes it to 2100. The idea that I’m “ignoring the sacrifices of my ancestors” is idiotic and unnecessarily insulting.<p>&gt; to know that generations of people eked by just for you to play video games all day would be a truly disappointing conclusion.<p>Seriously what in the world is your problem? You don’t know anything about this person. This comment is pure toxicity, completely undermines the point I think you are trying to make, and adds nothing to the conversation.')
