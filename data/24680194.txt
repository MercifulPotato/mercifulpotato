Other professions that do this have real codes of ethics, so this reason is BS.<p>&gt; The boundaries around those decision are very grey.<p>And they aren&#x27;t in law? Medicine? Again, that doesn&#x27;t prevent a real code of ethics.<p>What <i>does</i> prevent such a thing from meaningfully existing for software engineering is the fact that it&#x27;s not a regulated profession with a professional licensing and enforcement body.')
