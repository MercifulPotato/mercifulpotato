And many could see that it would probably transform society (which I know about from personal conversations with people before 1993). And before 1993 there was basically zero investor interest in the internet.<p>Before 1993 the internet was funded mostly by the US Government, which started funding research into packet-switched networking in 1961. In 1977, unhappy with the cost of operating the network, the US Government offered the internet to AT&amp;T for a token sum. AT&amp;T could see no way to make money from it, so declined. In 1987, they offered it to them for a token sum again, with the same response.<p>(Some pedants maintain the internet did not begin until 1987 with the introduction of the TCP&#x2F;IP protocol, and that before then there was the ARPAnet. I feel that using the word &quot;internet&quot; for the network before 1987 is justified because the same services, e.g., email, mailing lists, ftp, telnet, netnews (what we now call Usenet, i.e., the newsgroups) that ran on the 1987 internet ran on the ARPAnet. Many users of the network probably didn&#x27;t realize (or were only dimly aware) that anything had changed!)<p>Starting about 1986 for-profit corporations started offering access to the internet for a fee, but before 1993 even the largest of these for-profits -- Netcom probably -- was small as American corporations go. I would not be surprised if most of Netcom&#x27;s revenue came from renting out shell accounts on Unix boxes with internet connections for $20 a month to individuals. (Before for-profit ISPs, the way an organization got on the internet was basically to lease a dedicated phone line from a telephone company. The organization at the other end of the dedicated phone line rarely charged money for routing the new organization&#x27;s traffic.)<p>Aside from government contractors (e.g., Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc, and the Mitre Corporation) and the early ISPs I just described, possibly the largest internet for-profit at the start of 1993 was Brad Templeton&#x27;s Clari-Net, which posted the output of some &quot;news wire&quot; (e.g., Associated Press or such) to netnews. (Netnews was much bigger then the web at the start of 93.) I doubt Clari-Net ever had more than 3 employees. It probably only ever had one.<p>In comparison, before the start of 1993, the US government had spent many billions of dollars on the internet -- over the course of 32 years if we count the package-switching research, not just when the internet got deployed in 1969.')
