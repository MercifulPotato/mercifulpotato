Item(by='hollerith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608064384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434635, text='You describe the post-1993 evolution of the internet, but I feel the need to add that in 1993, the internet had already been in constant operation for 24 years; it was already the largest network of computers ever; and a significant fraction of the people who knew about the internet could see that it would probably transform society. And before 1993 there was basically zero investor interest in the internet; it was funded mostly by the US Government, which started funding research into packet-switched networking in 1960. In 1977, troubled by the cost of operating the network, the US Government offered the internet to AT&amp;T for a token sum. AT&amp;T could see no way to make money from it, so declined. In 1987, they offered it to them for a token sum again, with the same response.<p>(Some pedants maintain the internet did not begin until 1987 with the introduction of the TCP&#x2F;IP protocol, and that before then there was the ARPAnet. I feel that using the word &quot;internet&quot; for the network before 1987 is justified because the same services, e.g., email, mailing lists, ftp, telnet, netnews (what we now call Usenet, i.e., the newsgroups) that ran on the 1987 internet ran on the ARPAnet. Many users of the network probably didn&#x27;t realize (or were only dimly aware) that anything had changed!)<p>Starting about 1986 for-profit corporations started offering access to the internet for a fee, but before 1993 even the largest of these for-profits -- Netcom probably -- was small as American corporations go. I would not be surprised if most of Netcom&#x27;s revenue came from renting out shell accounts on Unix boxes with internet connections for $20 a month to individuals. (Before for-profit ISPs, the way an organization got on the internet was basically to lease a dedicated phone line from a telephone company. The organization at the other end of the dedicated phone line rarely charged money for routing the new organization&#x27;s traffic.)<p>Aside from government contractors and the early ISPs I just described, possibly the largest for-profit was Brad Templeton&#x27;s Clari-Net, which posted some &quot;news wire&quot; (e.g., Associated Press or such) to netnews. I doubt it ever had more than 3 employees.')
