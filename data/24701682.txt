Companies exist in a system that should serve everyone and when an imbalance occurs the whole system morphs around them. They are no longer players but dictators, willingly or not. Their sheer size forces rules of the game in ways even they do not control.<p>This isn&#x27;t really the whole story. Large firms don&#x27;t just exist because of power, but also because to manage an increasingly complex environment (scientifically, economically etc) large institutions are required to hold the necessary knowledge to function effectively. The concentration towards larger firms is thus not just a power grab, but a necessary condition for modern production.<p>This was Schumpeter&#x27;s basic insight. Monopolistic competition is more dynamic than the free, small-firm dominated market. Size gives companies the ability to earn surplus profit which is turned into long-term innovation rather than short-term fighting for market share.<p>The central dynamic around data collection in the information economy even amplifies that trend. Smaller firms are not going to reap benefits on the same scale as large firms can, and the primary economic case for break ups, which is that large firms are unproductive due to being unable to deal with complexity, has been turned on its head. Information now functions as a way to make centralisation <i>more efficient</i>, not less.')
