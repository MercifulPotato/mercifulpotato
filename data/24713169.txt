First off, the formation of a union does not require that all employees instantaneously join it.  Second, the union still needs to have an agreement with an employer.  So if your workplace doesn&#x27;t unionize, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the one on the other side of town does.  It doesn&#x27;t magically just flip an &quot;isUnion&quot; bit and completely change everyone&#x27;s employment situation in one fell swoop.<p>&gt;if your colleagues organizes a union there you will be forced to join<p>If you workplace unionizes, then you _may_ be forced to join.  There is no guarantee that a union would force joining to keep your job, although historically that has been the case.  Much of that was due to a lot of the improvements that unions were negotiating for being very hard to &quot;split&quot; between union an non-union members (i.e. safer machines in a factory were a benefit to everyone, not just union members).  In a tech union, who&#x27;s to say that has to be that way.  If unions negotiated for things like always having the latest hardware for members, it would be easier for non-union members at the same shop to be given whatever hardware your employer decided.  Basically, a tech union may not be bound to the same constraints as traditional unions might have been.<p>&gt;likely a lot of its members don&#x27;t actually want to be a part of the union.<p>But if it&#x27;s members don&#x27;t want to be part of the union, then why is there a union.  Part of that statement doesn&#x27;t jive with the other.')
