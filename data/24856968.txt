The author&#x27;s argument is that while religious theology doesn&#x27;t drive the cultural norms, the religious boundaries define a grouping wherein people tend to converge on or copy cultural norms. Thus, you end up with a particular religious group behaving like X, even if X didn&#x27;t come from the religion itself.<p>One could easily apply the same reasoning to visible ethnic groups: they don&#x27;t behave similarly because of their ethnicity, but the ethnicity defines a grouping where the people within tend to converge on shared cultural norms regardless. Ergo, you would indeed end up with people within said grouping behaving similarly, and then it follows that increasing diversity of which groups you hire from would increase diversity of cultural norms or thought&#x2F;behavior.')
