Nuclear requires certain types of expertise and I&#x27;d hope, certain certifications for construction.<p>Also, historically, they&#x27;ve each been multi-year ventures.<p>These are likely different humans and different companies than people doing urban gardening projects and rooftop solar.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t see the conflict here.  I don&#x27;t know too much about nuclear construction and maintenance but I&#x27;d imagine it takes years of specialized training and experience to be competent.  If that&#x27;s true, I can&#x27;t imagine someone sliding from say, retrofitting insulation to older apartment buildings to nuclear in any reasonable time. I think we have to conclude they&#x27;re as different as any other sophisticated skills; you&#x27;re still starting at zero if you want to switch.<p>The GNDs problem has been the same since Jill Stein was talking about it in 2012 - it&#x27;s too grandiose for a society and time that has rejected grand visions.<p>We would need to fix our systemic cultural inability to be able to subscribe to a collective imaginary before a GND is  broadly entertained.<p>However, you crack and divide GND as separate goals, such as increasing the usefulness and efficiency of mass urban transit, most people are on board. And each of these concrete goals doesn&#x27;t preclude Exelon and GE from building nuclear power plants.<p>Once you reframe the GND as simply a basketcase of low hanging fruit of city and neighborhood level projects, then we get into nuclear&#x27;s real issue in this conversation - It is the biggest project of the bunch.<p>Ignoring possible futures and going with historical pasts, nuclear plants are what are called &quot;megaprojects&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Megaproject" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Megaproject</a>) and that&#x27;s their main Achilles heel for our times. Americans at least, have stopped believing in them. They think &quot;big = broken disaster&quot;. Some american may even feel obligated to respond to this, &quot;But it&#x27;s true&quot; and then my point will be made.<p>The GND proponents could finally understand marketing and branding and successfully reposition their project to our collective appetites as a collection of small bite-sized community projects but nuclear cannot do this.')
