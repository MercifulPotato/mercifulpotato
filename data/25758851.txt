If you’re American, you have to pick a side. Do you condemn or condone? No one is sitting around going like “I feel like they had some good points but I donnu”.<p>This is bigger than covid, and at some point, at this point in my opinion, we have to make a decision. We either nip this in the bud now or watch it get worse. And if you work at Twitter, that might mean pushing to ban Trump for the last four years. Some tech savvy individual went and reverse engineered Parler’s API and archived 96% of public content. All this in the hopes that it’ll dissuade any further escalation. And if that isn’t a good enough explanation, then maybe people are just fucking tired of enabling or doing business with people they consider to be deranged and dangerous.<p>I realize you want everyone to come together and find some compromise or common ground but like, where do we even begin? There was no election fraud. Not even Trump’s lawyers could utter those words in court, because they understood that repeating their clients’ overt lies could get them disbarred. I genuinely think that the stop the steal is run by opportunistic leeches who prey on the mentally ill. And that taking away their platforms on private social media might actually give us the pause we need for a peaceful transfer of power. No one should be forced to bake a cake at gunpoint and no one should be forced to go to work on making an online platform work for people we (and the law) view as terrorists.<p>That’s my rant. You can disagree with all of if you want, but you can’t argue with individuals not wanting to go to work for other individuals. Whether it be Salesforce or Twitter or Facebook...they chose to do something and frankly, those who are worried about this potentially happening to them need to realize how bad what happened at the capitol was, and how rare it is. There’s no slippery slope here.')
