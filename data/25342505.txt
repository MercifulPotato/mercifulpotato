I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of tcpdumps, so had to go with what was reported in the thread (I tried to reproduce with a few people, but my server wasn&#x27;t in the broken path, so I couldn&#x27;t get a lot of real data).<p>That tweet in particular doesn&#x27;t show any retransmits.<p>tcpdump&#x2F;wireshark gets a little hard to read at times; especially when the packet dump is a lie: all those packets marked red for bad checksums are from the dumping machine, and the checksums are wrong because the NIC is filling them in, and the capture interface doesn&#x27;t get to see what they are). Perhaps the other people in the thread who said mac os was ignoring bad checksums were also confused; or perhaps it does ignore bad checksums, it&#x27;s pretty bad at networking (it can&#x27;t handle a synflood in 2020 because it&#x27;s got synhandling code from 2000)')
