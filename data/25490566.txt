For example, the revenge movie. Such as Peppermint, with a totally by-the-numbers plot. The twist is this time it&#x27;s a female lead, but she could have been swapped out for Bronson&#x2F;Lundgren&#x2F;Stallone&#x2F;Schwarzenegger&#x2F;etc without changing a scene or a line of dialog and it would have been exactly the same :-&#x2F;<p>Then I watched &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, yup, same old revenge plot.')
