Can&#x27;t I have someone go shop on my behalf at non-restaurant businesses? And if so, isn&#x27;t it reasonable that a menu of options be shown with items and the costs? I agree that there should be transparency about who is delivering the food, there should be no impersonation of the restaurant, no false listing of phone numbers, and so on. But allowing restaurants to deny a courier without prior agreement seems like a government overreach.')
