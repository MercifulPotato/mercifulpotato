First, it says buttplug is a library. Then, in architecture overview there are &#x27;protocol&#x27; and &#x27;client&#x2F;server&#x27;, which does not make sense for a library. So it is not a library, but a deamon handling these devices? Wh then call it library? If it is a deamon, is there any user configuration? Am i only one who is totally confused?<p>Perhaps some picture with components and relations between them would be helpful?')
