Item(by='zerkten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610723142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789920, text='&gt; I actually had a conversation with a product manager; I checked the yes you can contact me when I cancelled my account. They simply refused to admit that an upsell was a advertisement and that disrupting my workflow on my paid, professional account for an ad was wrong.<p>I&#x27;m not in the slightest bit surprised. As product management has exploded as a role (look at the number of courses, books, etc.) there has been a huge influx of people with less experience, and most importantly perhaps, less breadth of experience. This is a good thing in the long-term, but there will be growing pains.<p>I feel like the usual trope for programmers is that &quot;PMs aren&#x27;t technical enough&quot;, but the bigger issue for companies is that they don&#x27;t have a breadth of experience and develop a narrower set of skills than they historically have. They smart and driven, but cost is what you are seeing with the cognitive dissonance.<p>This is less noticeable in smaller startups. The problem is exacerbated in more mature products like Dropbox where they are trying to move an existing user base onto a higher profit line of products. You need to have the broader base that PMs at legacy companies (e.g. Microsoft) have to make this shift. Further, it&#x27;s harder to appear credible with enterprise customers beyond shadow IT.')
