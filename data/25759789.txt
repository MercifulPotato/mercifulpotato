It probably took me about 2 weeks to build my first NixOS desktop about a year ago. Now I manage everything in a single repo, including all my dotfiles, all via nix. It works great. But there was a very steep learning curve.<p>After that experience, I&#x27;d actually hesitate to use NixOS in a production environment. The main problem is Nix and the library functions themselves are incredibly obtuse. It also doesn&#x27;t help that it&#x27;s a dynamic functional language, so everything just looks like magic when you&#x27;re first using it. I think most engineers would really struggle with it. I&#x27;d be more comfortable introducing Haskell - I think it&#x27;s easier to learn and understand!')
