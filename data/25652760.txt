Heck, you can even host a multi-lead ECG sensor that is more capable than the latest smartwatch products from Apple and Samsung with the &quot;decade old&quot; processor. Couple that wearable smartwatch based multi-lead ECG sensor with any latest Android phone then you have a potent and energy efficient ECG system that is probably as good as the most expensive ECG machine at any hospital but powered only by a coin battery! This out-of-hospital gadget based on &quot;decade old&quot; processor is going to be useful to detect heart arrhythmia and ischemia that is the main cause of mortality in the world and capable of detecting pre-symptomatic Covid-19 as well [1].<p>I know this is a bad cliche, but this &quot;decade old&quot; processor is more powerful than the most powerful PDP-11 systems that have ever existed, that were last sold back in 1990s.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41551-020-00640-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41551-020-00640-6</a>')
