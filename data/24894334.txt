Item(by='vidarh', descendants=None, kids=[24895861], score=None, time=1603705250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891125, text='Part of the issue is that there are still things many people - even those of us who haven&#x27;t used an Amiga in years - miss from AmigaOS.<p>The tight integration of everything via AREXX, for example (though AREXX is an awful language, the <i>expectation</i> of a tightly integrated AREXX port in applications was important).\nThe device model that led to a plethora of device drivers and filesystem drivers doing interesting things (e.g. FrexxEd, an editor co-written by Daniel Stenberg of Curl fame, exposes a filesystem where you can find all open files, so anything that can read or write a file can manipulate the editor buffer directly). Datatypes. Widespread &quot;standard&quot; libraries for pluggable compression. A culture of tightly controlled APIs to the point that e.g. the default file requester etc. was easily replaced across huge swathes of applications just by dropping in new libraries.<p>It&#x27;s especially notable that none of it is down to <i>technical</i> limitations of modern OS&#x27;s, but cultural differences. You could do the above trivially in Linux (or any other OS) if you wanted to, for example, but it only matters if it gets wide traction. Amiga had a culture of quickly coalescing around standards that promoted reusability and modularity and sticking to them.<p>And that is also part of the reason why some of the hardcore fans stick to it: Their 30+ year old applications can open modern file types if someone writes a datatype for it (and they often do). Their 30+ year old apps can transparently compress and decompress new formats if someone writes a suitable library for it, and so on.<p>I&#x27;m not going back to AmigaOS, but I do still wish we&#x27;d see a resurrection of that culture, because in the ~25 years since I used AmigaOS as my primary OS, while we&#x27;ve surpassed it in a whole lot of areas, there are still areas where it was more pleasant to use an Amiga.')
