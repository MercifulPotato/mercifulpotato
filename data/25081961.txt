I spent a few hours working on this small fun project. I thought it might be cool to be able to use Excalidraw (which I love) to create minimalistic slides. Here is the result :)<p>Note that it is <i>very</i> basic for now, and I know there are a lot of features that should be implemented: display a preview in slides list, export to PNG or even PDF, handle better the zoom and elements position, etc.<p>For now I didn’t want to fork Excalidraw, so I just used the embedded components they provide (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;excalidraw&#x2F;excalidraw-embed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;excalidraw&#x2F;excalidraw-embed</a>). This has some limitations, so I had to use a few tricks to make it work (such as hiding some elements by CSS…). There is probably a better way to achieve this.<p>What do you think?')
