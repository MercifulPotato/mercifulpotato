It&#x27;s easy to reason about and a pleasure to use. It absolutely checks the &quot;navigable&quot; box in my book.<p>However, it got constant flack (esp. here on HN) for being too complicated. Apparently asking a dev to spend a day learning the tool before getting started on a new project was too much to ask. Now the best practice is to use a meta-tool like vue-cli or react-scripts to abstract away Webpack, trading navigability for simplicity. Simplifying complex tasks requires magic and good luck debugging when your magic incantations don&#x27;t work as expected.<p>I totally agree that navigability is super important and I wish I knew how to better emphasize it in my projects over the &quot;batteries included&quot; approach that has the best marketing.')
