Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It&#x27;s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with the energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals - sounds that say listen to this, it is important.&quot;<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ojoven&#x2F;google-docs-highlight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ojoven&#x2F;google-docs-highlight</a>')
