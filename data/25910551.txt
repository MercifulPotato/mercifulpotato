Rigging up an iPad stand for a C2 would be pretty trivial--and may well already exist.<p>If I were seriously looking at something like this as a business, I&#x27;d probably want to do a non-subscription offering that let you row down the Charles and other such rivers in an immersive and somewhat randomized environment but tried to get people to pay for real P2P interactions--which a lot would.<p>Not an actual interest of mine to do but I think someone could retrofit a much better virtual experience on a C2 than currently exists that people would pay good money for.')
