You could use the snapshot&#x2F;seek features to replay messages from a particular point. It&#x27;d be useful retain messages for a long time so you could replay messages from any point. I could even imagine a feature for replaying back messages from only a time range. We&#x27;re also aware of requests for more seamless integration with other GCP services; they may augment or provide a similar set of features. I can&#x27;t comment on timelines unfortunately. :)<p>Disclaimer: I work on Cloud Pub&#x2F;Sub, but this is my own opinion.')
