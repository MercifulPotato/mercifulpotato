I said my impression is that it&#x27;s a B+ game at it&#x27;s best, which means that its horrible technical failures and unscrupulous marketing are particularly glaring.<p>It has not been regarded as a flawed masterpiece, but something more like 2001&#x27;s Anachronox - a solid game with strong elements, but in many ways mediocre and hardly justifying a tortured development cycle and myriad bugs.')
