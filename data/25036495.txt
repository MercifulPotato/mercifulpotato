There are also too many investors who panicky buying and selling without much knowledge of the industries they buy&#x2F;sell stocks.<p>Zoom has been doing up ~500% this year. The large fluctuations are expected. Online learning&#x2F;work will continue to grow regardless of a vaccine. It&#x27;s not going to be in a crazy rate like it has been this year because of covid. I&#x27;m not even talking about companies, cause that&#x27;s a no brainer. I&#x27;m talking about education and hospitals. For example, the convenience of having a virtual appointment is great for both doctors and patients and it&#x27;s not going away no matter what.<p>My opinion about Zoom. Selling because of a vaccine is pretty stupid. You should sell if you think they are over valued and not be able to compete with the big companies long term. One thing to pay attention to is their future plans. If they don&#x27;t have plans to expand their product line I would worry long term. There&#x27;s no problem for a company to pay for Zoom for video calls and for another company for things like slack&#x2F;docs etc. But when you have companies like Google&#x2F;Microsoft who package and integrate everything together, and can give you a good price for it too, then it&#x27;s a concern. Google&#x2F;Microsoft make many subpar products, and this year zoom showed it nicely. But they keep copying the important features and will eventually close the gap.')
