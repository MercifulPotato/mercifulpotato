It still does present some friction moving forward, but it&#x27;s much more pleasant than listing every file individually, and there&#x27;s a kind of an elegance to the system when you get used to it. And it does warn you if you include files that you didn&#x27;t depend on. (Pro tip: <i>never</i> use include=...; always depend directly on a cc_library(hdrs=...).) That, said I do wish there was a way to make it easier and avoid the redundancy.')
