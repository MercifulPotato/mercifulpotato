I work for a small innovation group (not a startup), so my work environment is flexible. I am also trying to bootstrap a startup project in my free time. \nI will have days that I am super productive and can get through a ton of work, but then I have other days that I just can&#x27;t bring myself to work. It feels weird cause when I force myself to work I get way less done, so I then feel like it is pointless cause I get such little done compared to when I am in the mood for the work. I don&#x27;t really know how I should feel about it cause I feel guilty on the days that I don&#x27;t get as much done, but it feels like a waste of time and is draining to just sit there and force out a small amount of work.')
