This was early-days for my &quot;paying attention to macs&quot;. I only used them at all because that was all the school had, I was a die-hard, PC-master-race, build-your-own-computer, windows user at this point. So yeah, we had the gumdrop shaped iMacs and then we upgraded to the chunky white-bodied-on-a-stand iMacs. We did have a few Mac Pros in the library (for video editing) and in the shop class (for 3D modeling), the cheesegrater style ones.')
