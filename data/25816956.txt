But it could just as easily be made in nearly any language, the difference at the level of “is abstract-able” is meters rather than kilometers.<p>True, most languages could do it, but there are some hard stops to how easy it is to abstract in golang, and performance also knocks some languages out.<p>&gt; The problem is that as soon as you need something more than a command line call the engineering burden explodes relative to languages that natively support greater abstraction at the lexical and logical level.<p>Agreed, once you&#x27;re off the happy path things can be many times more painful in Rust than Go. I personally think Go will replace Java in most enterprise-y software shops within 5-10 years. Unless there&#x27;s a specific reason to use the JVM, Go is more than good enough and it&#x27;s goals align with industry very well.')
