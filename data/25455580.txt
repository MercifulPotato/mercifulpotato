Most box fans that I&#x27;ve seen are very noisy relative to &quot;real&quot; air cleaners&#x2F;purifiers.<p>I&#x27;ve used a box fan plus furnace filter for years to deal with cat litter dust.  Since the particles I want to filter are quite large, I can get away with using a fairly cheap furnace filter.  The nice thing about this is that it&#x27;s really easy to scale it to your requirements.<p>To deal with the noise, I used a motion sensor and switched outlet to only run it for 10 minutes after the litter has been used.  This runs through my existing home automation stuff (Home Assistant+Node-RED), but it could also be done with an Arduino (you don&#x27;t even something that powerful - two I&#x2F;O lines is enough), a PIR sensor, and a solid state relay for the fan control.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a number of low-dust&#x2F;no-dust litters, but most of have lead to the cats finding other places to do their business or have disappeared from store shelves when I&#x27;ve needed to replenish it.  Everything about this is a compromise between litter acceptance, litter availability, litter cost, filter cost, filter life, noise, and dust production.')
