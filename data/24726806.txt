Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=[24728953, 24727881], score=None, time=1602217478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723765, text='&gt;I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if Oracle wins on copyright (I think it is almost impossible for Google to count to 5 on their merger doctrine argument) but I disagree that fair use is a long shot.\nI wonder about the differences (which <i>definitely</i> do exist) between Oracle&#x27;s Java API and the OpenJDK Java API.<p>While they really <i>have</i> to be substantially similar to allow interoperability, OpenJDK is open source (GPL) and Oracle&#x27;s Java is not.<p>That brings up a couple questions which don&#x27;t <i>directly</i> bear on the case just heard by the Supremes, but are (IMHO) relevant to potential second-order consequences of a ruling for Oracle:<p>1.  Given that the OpenJDK API is substantially similar to the Oracle Java API, could Google avoid repercussions by switching to the former from their &quot;adaptation&quot; of the latter?<p>2. Should an API be considered eligible for copyright, wouldn&#x27;t that enable opportunities for language and library developers to restrict others from developing competing (via performance or utility enhancements) languages&#x2F;libraries by forcing anyone who wished to implement enhancements to either purchase a license or flat out deny them the ability to do so (assuming the product --including the API isn&#x27;t open source)?<p>3.  If (2) is the case, what does that mean for incremental improvements of languages and libraries?<p>I&#x27;m not a java dev or a copyright expert, so pardon me if I missed an important point.')
