When I put in directions to Google Maps for Yakutsk to Magadan it still goes along the P-504 (aka Kolyma Highway or &quot;Road of Bones&quot; [0]).<p>The Wikipedia page also says that the road is called the Kolyma Route &quot;since it is the only road in the area and therefore needs no special name to distinguish it from other roads&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R504_Kolyma_Highway" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;R504_Kolyma_Highway</a><p>Edit: Okay, it was pointed out in the comments below that Google maps does go on the correct route now. It is the same general road, but there was a section called the &quot;Old Summer Road&quot; that had fallen in to disrepair but was shorter.')
