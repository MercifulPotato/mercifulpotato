Item(by='l0b0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603576944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880979, text='&gt; If you&#x27;ve ever used JSON between processes, then QSN is the exact same idea. JSON strings are also encoded (but they can&#x27;t represent byte strings).<p>I don&#x27;t see how they are anything like the same idea. JSON is an object serialization format. These objects may contain strings, and the encoding of those strings unfortunately is not binary-complete. But most importantly objects have <i>structure.</i> QSN is a binary string encoding format, and has no structure outside of the sequence of bytes. In any case I&#x27;m not sure why you keep bringing up JSON.<p>On the other hand, if it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that JSON is so strongly tied to JavaScript QSN might&#x27;ve been a good string encoding format for it.<p>&gt; There are probably people who never use JSON, and that&#x27;s fine, but there are a lot more who do! The goal is absolutely for tools like grep to adopt QSN support. [1]<p>I know what the words mean (and I&#x27;ve been using JSON and grep for years), but I don&#x27;t understand what that sentence means.<p>&gt; Another argument is that in networking framing, you have a few choices:<p>I don&#x27;t know what &quot;networking framing&quot; is. If you mean actual network packet structure, I don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;ll be able to convince a single network engineer that QSN is a better choice than netstrings.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m going to have to shut down this thread now. I don&#x27;t expect anyone else is reading this, I&#x27;m not learning anything new, and I can&#x27;t convince you that QSN is a bad idea for IPC.')
