CTO is highly specialized position that is supposed to be approached after many years as an engineer, manager, director, vp, etc.  A person might be able to grow into the job quickly depending on the circumstances.  But usually this is going to create lots of strife for everyone else.  Usually, this is going to come as lots of pointless edicts and stuff like pointless meetings.  I would suggest an inexperienced CTO that did not come up through the ranks needs to find a CTO mentor.')
