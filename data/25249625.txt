Because you asked this question in good faith, I&#x27;ll give you a summary in good faith:<p>1. The book you linked is just technical content. It teaches you how to use AWS, not how to sell books about using AWS.<p>2. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek examples of the original post based on minimal success, this book is written based on years of professional experience as a developer building AWS.<p>3. His content pops up pretty often because people like it.<p>Of course, if the book was part of a ponzi scheme, then part of that scheme would be having people like me defend it on HN :)')
