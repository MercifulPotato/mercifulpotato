I&#x27;m happy that my employer has sane Mac policies and management software, but it is due to the large fleet of Apple devices. My wife&#x27;s employer tries to manage their Macs like it is Windows and it is terrible, IT doesn&#x27;t test anything on Macs and they don&#x27;t know how to troubleshoot issues.<p>She has similar issues with the VPN too.')
