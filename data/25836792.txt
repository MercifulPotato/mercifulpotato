I can&#x27;t help but notice that the increased competition made the product severely less neutered, as Amazon did publish their Elastic distribution as open source just as the model prescribes, and this put pressure on Elastic to reduce some on the limitations from theirs. No Tivoization seemed to have taken place.<p>While partnering would have been much better for Elastic, I&#x27;m not sure Google would have done it better in this case.')
