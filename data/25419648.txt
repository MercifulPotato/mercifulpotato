If you have unsatisfied sexual needs, it&#x27;s awful to suggest that you should attempt at relationships (or even start a family) for that reason. No, people should do these things because they genuinely want to have them, and not to pretend they want them just for a bit of nudge nudge.<p>I am grateful for porn existing, because it lets me not to have a (sexual) relationship if I don&#x27;t need the emotional component. I think it&#x27;s more honest that way, actually.')
