But I was answering to &quot;Why would anyone (who is not forced) buy an Intel PC laptop when these are available and priced as competitive as they are?&quot;. The answer is simple, everyone, who does not want to spend $999 will buy an Intel&#x2F;AMD laptop. And $999 is quite a lot for someone who does not need a powerful workhorse. That Insiron is extremely underpowered, yet it&#x27;ll launch web browser and office apps with some swapping here and there. Apple is not going to kill x86 laptop market with it, just like it won&#x27;t kill smartphone market with their $400 SE phone when you can buy $100 android phone.<p>Another thing is that you can buy &quot;gaming&quot; laptop for $999. Something like i7-10750H with GTX 1650. And it&#x27;s powerful enough to run almost any game on high to medium setting. Apple GPU is awesome compared to Intel GPU, but compared to dedicated Nvidia GPU - not so much. So if you need GPU for gaming, that&#x27;s another area where Apple does not compete with their new laptops. At least for now.<p>Ultrabook with focus on portability and long battery life - Apple is awesome here.')
