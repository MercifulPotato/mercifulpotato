When I joined the team, there was already a <i>Result</i> library which is just a wrapper for return types with predefined set of result codes and a field for error message. It was first used for our bridge with JavaScript code, now it is used (and abused) everywhere in the app. I though it was a big PITA when I joined the team but I see the value now and I think the .NET ecosystem is lacking some standart way of doing this. Yes, there are exceptions, but we have a some states which are not &quot;failured&quot; per se and the Result library fits this well. The system is not perfect because the set of predefined result codes cannot be used everywhere and I am constantly thinking about how it could be improved. Does anyone have a clean way to do error handling in C#?')
