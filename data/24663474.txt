My parents are pretty old (they had kids late) and they really don&#x27;t like telling revenue (the taxman) anything, and would be inclined to overlook tax avoidance and whatnot. My wife&#x27;s parents are of a similar age, and also similar on this.<p>Now, all of them were born a generation after independence, so it&#x27;s definitely not just that.<p>However, when the government has historically not given a crap about you (as the British government did not), it leads to a disconnect from the society and institutions that increases the probability that you&#x27;ll be OK with tax dodging and not have as much trust in the overall society (because historically, it didn&#x27;t care about you).<p>So, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s slowly changing because we&#x27;re not a colony anymore, but it definitely didn&#x27;t just disappear in a puff of smoke in 1921.')
