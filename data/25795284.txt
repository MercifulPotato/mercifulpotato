Literally anyone in my hundreds of contacts could be getting notifications that I am on signal, do they want to connect with me? Do I want them to also know I am on signal?<p>A lot of my contacts are ex clients, networking flybys, even random people I shared numbers with drunk at a club. Many are professional contacts, others I just want to monitor if they ever try and contact me, maybe one day I want to talk to them, on my own terms.<p>By consenting to give signal access to my contact list I didn&#x27;t want to opt in to giving them carte blanche to broadcast my presence to every random person I have ever sent a message to. But that is not an option when setting it up, \nand that is what it will do.<p>I have 20 years of contacts, and I don&#x27;t want many of them getting any kind of notifications with my name in it. I don&#x27;t even have anything interesting to hide. But if I decide to re enter a person&#x27;s life I want to do so on my terms and not that of an algorithm.<p>So I uninstalled. Then I reinstalled and did not grant permissions to access my contacts.<p>Lo and behold after reinstalling without contact list permissions it knows the names of people in my contact list if I manually enter the mobile number. On the second install, these details must be getting fetched from the server, assuming android permissions are solid, because I provided my contact list in the first place.<p>I checked with a friend who also reinstalled and he is seeing in signal the full name of a person he hasn&#x27;t contacted through signal, by their phone number. Which must be due to sharing the contacts the first install.<p>Lesson learned not to share contacts with any app ever.<p>Signal is not a panacea is all I can say.')
