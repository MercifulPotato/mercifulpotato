After a few minutes of their bragging falling on deaf ears they said “I could be playing Doom right now [while talking to you in a separate window]!”<p>I thought that was the most nonsense ability to brag about because clearly you couldn’t actually focus on both and to drive home the point I said “Yeah, but would you be <i>winning</i>?”<p><i>Fair play: I was a bit of a jerk at the time</i>')
