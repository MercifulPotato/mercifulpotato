Or ActiveCampaign?<p>We&#x27;ve hard-coded our notifications &amp; templates (sending them with Mailgun). I&#x27;m curious how others have architected systems that go beyond even the user notification. For instance, you may be collecting user events for (a) activity feeds, (b) analytics, (c) notifications. Supposedly a tool like Sentry (expensive) sits at the front and then plugs into (a) PSQL for activity feeds, (b) time-series DB for analytics, (c) and marketing automation tools like Autopilot for notifications.<p>This is all theoretical and I hope someone chimes in with their brilliantly thought-out architecture on this.')
