I want Bruce Schnier to be on that counsel, and ideally get all the major committers on major projects to <i>review each others work</i>. Do it transparently. I&#x27;d pay $100&#x2F;mo for this service, maybe even more, since it is insurance on critical infrastructure. Could be a nice chunk of change for some deserving folk, too.')
