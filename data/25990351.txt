The senators were in the process of doing that on his and his voters&#x27; behalf, but the events that unfolded against his wishes destroyed his opportunity to have the objections heard.<p>Secondly, the group that stormed the capitol was a separate group that was already at the capitol, which is a 45 minute walk away, while Trump was still speaking so they could not have taken direction from Trump.<p>Thirdly, the Trump supporters that did arrive from the speech told everyone NOT to participate in the breaching of the capitol, because they understood Trump&#x27;s words and intentions.<p>Lastly, while there were Trump supporters present that were caught up in the Q anon disinformation campaign that co-opted a minority of the Trump base to undermine Trump, there were also Antifa agitators present that led the charge and incited the violence (this is captured on video).<p>I know Trump is the ideal scapegoat, but you really cannot pin the blame for this on him if you know the facts.<p>What really happened on January 6th is that a small group of radicals at the fringe of Trump&#x27;s base (+ antifa infiltrators), that are not responsive to Trump himself, but to an anonymous online cult leader going by the name Q, took advantage of the intentional lack of security measures despite the FBI monitoring Q world and knowing of nefarious plans, accompanied by some random bewildered folks walking around the capitol because they were let in, while the vast majority of Trump&#x27;s supporters in DC did nothing but peacefully attend the rally hoping the senators would be able to present Trump&#x27;s case convincingly, which was cut short by a few idiots that fell for an elaborately crafted years long disinformation campaign.<p>The media and democrats immediately ran with the insurreciton narrative to discredit Trump and promote more government surveillance and infringement of rights based on their fear mongering about domestic terrorism. You don&#x27;t have to like or agree with Trump, but the misrepresentation of what happened on Jan 6th is dangerous to our rights.')
