If Zebra mussels turned the Great Lakes sterile, it would be fine by nature.<p>When we care about a system, we care about specifics - we want it to look in some way, do some thing or provide us with some things. E.g. we want clean-looking, odorless lakes safe for recreation and full of fish to eat. That&#x27;s a specific outcome that may or may not be what the natural selection will provide; to ensure we get what we want, we need to supply a strong selection pressure of our design.<p>Adversarial processes are effective given sufficient time, but about the least efficient way to build a system after just waiting for it to appear at random. Humanity&#x27;s dominance over other life on Earth is in big way based on the ability to predict and invent things &quot;up front&quot;, without any competitive selection. I feel we should refine that skill and find more opportunities to use it, because it&#x27;s much less wasteful.')
