They were honestly not seeing good profits for a while, because they had to pay so much for films to the studios&#x2F;distributors.<p>Most of the chains in my area have gone under and won&#x27;t reopen, and it&#x27;s difficult to see anyone getting investment for new ones any time soon - even if they came back to 100% of what they were before the pandemic, they wouldn&#x27;t be a great investment.<p>Smaller theaters showing older movies will probably pick up, though... places where you can have a beer and watch Casablanca or a 1970s war movie, that kind of thing.')
