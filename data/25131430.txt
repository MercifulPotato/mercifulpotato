You basically have to run their OS to develop apps for Apple products, and people who don&#x27;t develop apps for Apple products don&#x27;t use Mac&#x27;s anyway. Just make a laptop appstore with everything you need to develop Apple products and they could force all programs to go on it and they would lose almost no users of their laptops.')
