They profoundly change how every single piece of code in the language is written, starting from how nulls are handled, and <i>cannot</i> be retrofitted into an existing ecosystem. (You can add them later, but baking in sum types from the start is very different. In particular Java would not have its terrible exception system if it had sum types.)')
