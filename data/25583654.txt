Using Python and Pandas for my day to day scripting. Common Lisp does not have the ecosystem in terms of packages compared to Python (or JS &#x2F; NodeJS), but hacking Lisp feels extremely good. I intend to use it for prototyping, for all kinds of hacking that does not involve using available packages.')
