People sent me messages about it because it has a lot in common with what I&#x27;m working on: [Walden Pond][3] ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;WaldenPond.press ).<p>You connect your [Pocket][4] account, and once a month you get a printed magazine. You can subscribe for 1, 2 or 4 hours of reading time. I got my 7th one on [Monday this week][5].<p>We deliver anywhere in the world, except Antarctica.<p>It has been a pandemic project to build it as a &quot;real&quot; product, but I&#x27;ve been making these zines for my friends for a bit over 2 years now. This means that I&#x27;ve come across and fixed an amazing number of edge cases!<p>I initially started building it because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that did the job. I&#x27;ve since turned up [Quarto][6] by [Elan Kiderman][7], which is similar; [newspaperclub.com][8] had a product that did something along these lines but using their presses, and as [jamez][9] noted in the replies to [yorgos_kats][1] post, [Memeoirs][10]; and [pulp][11] by [Outofthebot][12], but that&#x27;s shut down.<p>The pagination is done using [Paged.js][13], and their community has been super helpful. It&#x27;s amazing what can be done with the holy trinity of HTML, CSS &amp; JS.<p>If you want to see some pictures of the physical thing, take a look at [Instagram][14] and [Twitter][15].<p><pre><code>  [1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=yorgos_kats\n  [2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myscreenbreak.com\n  [3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;WaldenPond.press\n  [4]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;getpocket.com&#x2F;\n  [5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;notionparallax&#x2F;status&#x2F;1313313422499483648?s=20\n  [6]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elankiderman.com&#x2F;quarto&#x2F;\n  [7]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;elankiderman\n  [8]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;newspaperclub.com\n  [9]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=jamez\n  [10]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamez.it&#x2F;project&#x2F;memeoirs&#x2F;\n  [11]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getpulp.io&#x2F;\n  [12]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=Outofthebot\n  [13]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pagedjs.org&#x2F;\n  [14]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;waldenpondzine&#x2F;\n  [15]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;WaldenPondZine</code></pre>')
