Make them implicitly commit to finish the conversation and not run away<p>2. Explain how the X thing works and how it doesn’t, to eliminate strawmen and educate (eg mRNA vaccines inject RNA into cell, not DNA into nucleus... masks reduce R0 by massively reducing the momentum of the airflow that carries particles going out, they don’t prevent particles from coming into your eyes etc.)<p>3. Ask them, given the information in 2, what they are still worried about. Really listen and understand their points.<p>4. Present them with a double standard where in other areas they do Y but here they do the opposite where the criteria are met at least as much<p>5. When they say “it’s totally different”, explore how, and be prepared to genuinely have your own mind changed if it turns out they don’t have a double standard<p>Use the seat belts analogy for example, when asking about vaccines. Seat belts can harm in certain rare cases, but if the “bad” stats are higher for seatbelts, why do you use them?')
