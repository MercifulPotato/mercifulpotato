Was hired to fill a real and actual &#x27;gap between engineering and business&#x27;. As senior with decades of experience.<p>Turns out the team I&#x27;m working in (not above) really does not like change (i.e does not accept been-there-done-that-failed, as valid argument to do things different), looks down on &#x27;business&#x27;, often even on &#x27;users&#x27; (technical pureness above everything else, above working software even) and most of all hates  me for pointing out problems.<p>I&#x27;m still trying to find ways to fill my original &#x27;problem&#x27; for which I came on board, but am also close to giving up, due to the negative energy all this is costing me.<p>So: good advice. But be certain the &#x27;problem&#x27; you&#x27;re hired for, is actually something that people want to solve.')
