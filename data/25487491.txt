Porn and &quot;free sexual expression&quot; have a lot of damage they do to individuals and society as a whole also. I don&#x27;t even need to list the examples because everyone already knows them. The rise of dangerous choking accidents during sex is a direct result of the popularization of that act through pornography. BDSM and the socially acceptable connection of sexual pleasure with real physical violence is another. Like many other vices our extreme opinions about freedom allow everyone to fall victim to (gambling, alcoholism, drug abuse, etc) porn addiction and it&#x27;s various consequences is also on the rise and it&#x27;s not going to get better any time soon.<p>Many feminists still believe that pornography is the oppression and exploitation of women. And they have good reason to believe that.<p>Who are you to say that everyone else is a prude and you are right and they are all wrong? How come you get to dismiss the real world effects of this activity?')
