Controlling &quot;disinformation&quot; is a dog whistle for censorship, hoping that average citizens don&#x27;t realize what they&#x27;re really after. We all know who is going to be the moderators in flagging &quot;disinformation&quot; and we all know which ideology they overwhelmingly favor. I&#x27;d sooner trust a pyromaniac as fire chief of my local county than I would trust big tech companies to manage &quot;disinformation&quot; on my behalf.')
