Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=[25318695], score=None, time=1607190779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316230, text='&gt;Most people don&#x27;t even know there are doctorate degrees other than PhD<p>I think you sort of answered why institutions often award a PhD rather than ScD&#x2F;DSc&#x2F;etc. (And there are some related examples related to Masters degrees.) If there&#x27;s an industry job opening for a PhD, how many ScD resumes end up getting filtered out because the candidate doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;right&quot; degree? I&#x27;ve definitely heard this type of thing on occasion from graduates who don&#x27;t or at least didn&#x27;t award the standard degrees. Even my undergraduate degree isn&#x27;t quite &quot;normal&quot; (SB vs. BS) so I use the standard form on my resume not that it matters at this point.')
