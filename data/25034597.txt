If this provides spread prevention as well, then places can start opening up in about 6 months as enough locals get vaccinated as to slow the spread to the rest.  On the other hand if this provides only some immunity but you are more infectious (ie  the body doesn&#x27;t fight the virus off, just makes it less dangerous - I don&#x27;t think this is possible but....) we can&#x27;t open up for years as anyone vaccinated is a risk to everyone else.<p>Of course there are other vaccines in development. If any other them pass trails that changes things too. we can only speculate as to how.<p>No matter what though, there is now a real light at the end of the tunnel.')
