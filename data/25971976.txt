This is the “magical thinking” to me.<p>The original GME investment groupthink (Reddit always works this way, it’s lovingly called “the hivemind”) was based on complex, but logically-sound technical reasoning. A lot of due diligence was done. QAnon, as far as I know at least, was based on a post on 4chan with no verifiable evidence whatsoever. WSB’s GME buying was motivated by logic and evidence at its core, and many aspects of this logic have happened exactly as predicted (for example, the multiple gamma squeezes). Unlike QAnon, the more you learn about this, the more it makes sense (though, very obviously, the price is going to crash eventually, and these people know it). Respectfully, I think it’s disingenuous and below-board to try to baselessly compare something you don’t understand well to an alt-right hate group. Show me the solid due diligence and technical analysis that underlies QAnon, and maybe I’ll give your comparison a closer look.')
