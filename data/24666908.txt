Cubemates aren&#x27;t exactly best buds, but today, we talked about: 1) motorcycle tire geometry 2) are Can-Ams really motorcycles 3) mechanical stethoscopes &amp; car noises 4) the different types of superchargers 5) sports car vs super car 6) catalytic converters... I don&#x27;t know, I would much rather telework 2, 4, even 5 days&#x2F;wk.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re missing much, but I don&#x27;t know your coworkers.<p>I think after-work hours are the big suck right now: teleworking 9-5 would be way better if 6-10 all the restaurants &#x2F; bars &#x2F; coffeeshops &#x2F; .. were open (for that matter, coffeeshops 996 or st).')
