You can find good live music in some parts, depending on the genre. Like bad college jam bands? Move to Gainesville. Like afro-funk, punk and indie? Move to Miami. Like bad cover bands? Probably all large cities in Florida got you covered. Alternately, few national&#x2F;international bands actually tour down into Florida, or only hit a few towns.<p>As someone who moved from Florida to the Northeast, the biggest drawback to Florida is the outdoors. It&#x27;s warm, humid, there&#x27;s showers half the time, bugs everywhere, there are no seasons or elevation. So what you&#x27;re left with is water sports [minus surfing].<p>It also lacks culture. Not so much music, but any other form of art that isn&#x27;t centered around Wynwood only exists as much as the elderly will invest in it. Compare to Baltimore, a tiny northeast city with a crap economy, which has probably more arts diversity than all of Florida combined [outside of Miami]. Why? Everybody sits in their house or goes to the bar. Why be an artist when you can do heroin on the beach?<p>And the people really are garbage. I was one of those garbage people. I changed <i>so much</i> after moving away. I don&#x27;t even know why. I just know when I left, everywhere I went, people seemed nicer.<p>If you just want to live alone and still be able to go to the beach, there are an infinite number of cities on either coast where you can do that without all those downsides. I dunno. Maybe there are reasons people move to Florida other than the weather. I personally cannot fathom it.')
