Pretty sure if they had to make financial compensations for their mistakes, they would start using humans more often to support this crap automated system.</i><p>How exactly would you enforce this? Media companies have the right to not show content from a given artist, at any time, for any reason. If you passed a law saying that twitch has to pay fines for false DMCA takedowns, they would simply take down the same artist anyway, without giving them any reason whatsoever. Which hurts the artist even more - now they can&#x27;t even appeal the decision, because they would have no idea why it occurred')
