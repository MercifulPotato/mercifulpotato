I had a colleague AIDS denialist, he told be that AIDS doesn&#x27;t exist and that&#x27;s a fact because Mullins sayd so. So I read about this man that is a brilliant biochemist but with no title or specialization or experience to qualify him as AIDS expert. Reading about his personal life, I learned he was also an hallucinogens addict.About that, he also claimed &quot;to have been rescued from a fatal accident by a person travelling in an astral plane, and to have conversed with an alien disguised as a raccoon&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;kary-mullis-scientist-surfer-dude-lsd-aficionado-won-nobel-prize&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.telegraph.co.uk&#x2F;obituaries&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;kary-mulli...</a>). So I asked to my colleague: &quot;what&#x27;s your opinion about aliens?&quot;, his response: &quot;they are among us, I&#x27;m sure: Mullins sayd so!&quot;. :-)')
