I&#x27;m the founder of HashiCorp.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see Boundary here! I want to note a few things about Boundary, why we made it, why it is different than other solutions in the space, etc.<p>* Boundary is free and open source. Similar to when we built Vault, we feel like the solution-space for identity-based security is too commercialized. We want to provide access to this type of security to a broader set of people because we feel it&#x27;s the right way to think about access control. Note: of course as as a company we plan on commercializing Boundary at some point, but we&#x27;ll do this similarly to Vault, the major featureset of Boundary will remain free and open source forever.<p>* Dynamic resource catalogs. Other tools in this space usually require manually maintaining a catalog of servers, databases, applications, etc. We&#x27;re integrating Boundary closely with Terraform, AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Azure, Kubernetes, etc. to give you live auto-updating catalogs based on tags. (Note: this feature is coming in 0.2, and not in this initial release, but is well planned at this point)<p>* Dynamic credentials. Existing tools often require static credentials. Boundary 0.1 uses static credentials, too, but we&#x27;re already working on integrating Boundary with Vault and other systems to provide full end-to-end dynamic credentials. You authenticate with your identity, and instead of reusing the same credentials on the backend, we pull dynamic per-session credentials.<p>And more! Remember this is a 0.1 release. We have a lot of vision and roadmap laid out for this project and we are hard at work on that now. We&#x27;re really excited about what&#x27;s to come here.<p>Specifically, as a 0.1, Boundary focuses in on layer 3 connections (TCP) with minimal layer 7 awareness for protocols such as SSH. This will be expanded dramatically to support multiple DB protocols, Microsoft Remote Desktop, and more.<p>Also, we&#x27;re releasing another new product tomorrow that is more developer-focused, if security is not your cup of tea. Stay tuned.<p>The Boundary team and I will be around the comments to answer any questions.')
