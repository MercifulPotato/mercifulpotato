Cellular electrical dynamics matter, but we already know that surface physics matter (see: any mammalian lab with those flat little red bottles). Those dynamics (physical, electrical, chemical) are all derived from genes coded in DNA, and so long as you have the basic ribosomes &#x2F; mitochondrial structures, you can re-instantiate an entire organism from just the DNA.')
