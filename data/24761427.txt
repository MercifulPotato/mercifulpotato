By the time you hit save in your editor, your changes were ready to be reloaded in the browser.<p>With SAM we&#x27;re talking ~6-7 seconds with an SSD to build + LOCALLY invoke a new copy of a fairly simple function where you&#x27;re changing 1 line of code, and you need to do this every time you change your code.<p>That&#x27;s even with creating a custom Makefile command to roll up the build + invoke into 1 human action. The wait time is purely waiting for SAM to do what it needs to do.<p>With a more traditional non-Serverless set up, with or without Docker (using volumes) the turn around time is effectively instant. You can make your code change and by the time you reload your browser it&#x27;s all good to go. This is speaking from a Python, Ruby, Elixir and Node POV.')
