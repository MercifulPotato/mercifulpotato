The BBC actually produces a lot of these types of documentaries but they are probably not sold to broadcasters outside of the UK. I presume it&#x27;s because they lack the big-budget, glossy look that is attractive to bigger audiences (and to international broadcasters). Or sometimes documentaries are trimmed or edited for international audiences. (I don&#x27;t know if this is the BBC editing the programme or the broadcaster who bought the programme.)<p>A lot of the &quot;old-school quiet&quot; documentaries can be found on BBC4 - a specialised channel that shows programmes on specialised or niche topics.')
