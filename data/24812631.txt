My server gets a heck load of brute-force attempts and after visiting the IP addresses, most of these attempts come from compromised routers with default passwords :&#x2F;<p>Unfortunately these regulations don&#x27;t protect against routers with software vulnerabilities, sure randomised passwords help but it would be interesting if router software was more open and could be audited by anyone to ensure we can squash these bugs. Some may argue that this is counterintuitive since attackers could also review the code and for less popular models with less eyes reviewing the code it could mean disaster.')
