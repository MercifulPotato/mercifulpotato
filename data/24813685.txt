It does the job as well as any other character set, because language is not merely a tool, like a set of bits for your screwdriver. It&#x27;s a part of your identity and your place in the world.<p>You can, of course, pick up other languages and with effort use them either skillfully, or just pragmatically. But no one will ever feel that Esperanto is &quot;their&quot; language. It will always be either a curiosity or, at best, a utilitarian tool (and even then only if it ever becomes wildly successful).')
