I have the same experience as you when I use it, regarding other drivers, but then I realize they&#x27;re going to drive that way whether I&#x27;m using it or not. Therefore, I&#x27;m of the opinion that human drivers other than myself will cause the same amount of accidents, but I may cause less using while using it, so in the end there will be less accidents caused by human drivers as more people use adaptive cruise.')
