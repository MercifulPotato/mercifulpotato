What was considered typical &quot;capitalist free-market&quot; thinking <i>then</i> is not typical &quot;capitalist free-market&quot; thinking <i>now</i>.  For instance: <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> was only published in 1957 and Friedman&#x27;s <i>Capitalism and Freedom</i> in 1963, and it took until the 1980s for those ideas to start to have wide influence in popular culture and government.')
