Our motor cortex is.<p>We are the only animal which learns almost all skills after-birth, via our significant and adaptable motor cortex.<p>&gt; Try using it to explain it to someone<p>Yes, concepts need to be converted&#x2F;reduced to propositional (and then linguistic) forms in order to be cognized and then to be communicated.<p>You can&#x27;t really acquire a novel basic concept via communication, but you can acquire metaconcepts (like criteria for things) which are just combinations of basic concepts you have already learnt (ie., motor concepts).<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there is no propositional content to concepts, ie., that they fail in being instances of some abstract Form.<p>I am saying, rather, what they <i>are</i>; and how we acquire them.<p>I have significant doubts that the world can be conceptualised by mere cognition, ie., that the contents of an inferential process can be arrived at via an inferential process.<p>I think this is an illusion: and it is apparent with machines. There is no mechanism for their understanding what they are processing.<p>We aren&#x27;t aware, i&#x27;d say, at all, of how we actually conceptualise the world. All we&#x27;re aware of, as far as our intelligence goes, is inference(&#x2F;cognition). (Though many greats have attributed mysterious immediate insights to the divine: rather it is just their actual intelligence).<p>I think that sets us up for a highly misleading paradigm of intelligence (cf. Cartesian dualism, etc. )')
