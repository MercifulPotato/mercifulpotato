But none of these is a valid excuse to not publish your findings in the scientific record, says study co-author Kimberley Wever, a metascientist at Radboud University Medical Center. “All animal studies should be published, and all studies are valuable for the research community.” </i><p>I hard disagree that pilot projects and results from data with technical issues should be published. There is a real cost to write-ups (time). Pilot projects usually are done just to prove feasibility of a protocol, and data retrieved from experiments with technical issues is likely noise. This could include inaccurate measurements, cross-contamination, etc. Taking the time to write and publish all the junk is, frankly prohibitive. I do think null-results should be publishable, however.<p>The title is a bit of click bait also: The animals are not missing. Make a request of the relevant Institutional Review Board.<p>Are any of you voting my comment down actually scientists?')
