I completely agree with you that understanding git very deeply is not needed or useful to the level of detail suggested here in other comments.<p>The level of understanding of git you need to stand out is very very limited in my experience. Most devs in &quot;regular&quot; companies struggle to understand even the basic rebase. Even on a logical, abstracted level. Never mind how and why it actually works as well as it does.<p>The types predicaments I see people get themselves into even with git vs say subversion is mind boggling. I have never gotten myself into a situation that wasn&#x27;t resolvable by simply making sure that everything I try is done after committing my changes. You can just always go back and retry. And just slapping a label (branch in git speak, sure) on a commit before force pushing after that rebase with lots of conflicts so that I have a backup. And even that is not strictly necessary. I&#x27;ve fucked up conflict resolution only to notice when the build server tells me and I had to go find a commit hash in my terminal output somewhere to resurrect it (I guess I was lucky I didn&#x27;t hit an auto cleanup of dangling commits in between ;))')
