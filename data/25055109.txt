Item(by='stubish', descendants=None, kids=[25055284], score=None, time=1605064207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051292, text='“how many different roles are there to be played in video”<p>Which to me is the core of subscription fatigue in video streaming. I subscribe to three different services because <i>none</i> of them provide the single role I&#x27;m interested in. Consumers want a single service providing all the content they are interested in, and the industry as a whole is actively hostile to that desire. So I&#x27;m a customer to several services, each providing <i>part</i> of the role I&#x27;m interested in, waiting for a competitor to come along and provide the service I want. But the situation won&#x27;t change, so I just juggle my services switching them off and on as shows come and go. Won&#x27;t change unless consumer friendly legislation is passed restricting exclusive distribution rights for digital content.')
