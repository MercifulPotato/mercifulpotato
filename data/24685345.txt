I know it&#x27;s not a popular opinion here - but as there&#x27;s no reasonable way to prevent people from unrestrictedly distributing copies, the business model of licensing books sounds reasonable to me.<p>What&#x27;s not reasonable is the <i>lack of transparency</i> when you&#x27;re suspected of abuse. I understand that there are many bad actors, but these companies are judge, jury and executioner when it comes to handling what they think are abuse cases - and honest people who get caught in the crossfire have no recourse.<p>Regulation needs to be put in place saying that if you paid a company any significant sum for services, you have the right to contest any claims of abuse and must be provided with all reasoning they have on that abuse within 24 hours. And you have a right to take them to court without needing to show damages when they&#x27;re being unreasonable.')
