Item(by='adwn', descendants=None, kids=[25032806], score=None, time=1604912150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25032646, text='If I had written <i>&quot;Marak doesn&#x27;t want to prevent big companies from using their code [...]&quot;</i>, the gender-neutral &quot;their&quot; could have refered to the companies&#x27; code, giving the sentence a different, incorrect meaning. I would have had to completely restructure the sentence just to avoid the sin of accidentally misgendering someone; instead, I placed a &quot;(?)&quot; after the pronoun, to be on the safe side.')
