But for me the SaaS is the overhead. Moving away from my terminal and local dev environment. Waiting for web requests to return before I can continue really breaks my workflow. Also the idea that formatting and other coding standards are not decleratively enforced (and autofixed) but an arbitraty choice during review has become strange to me over the past few years. As with Black for example. Every choice about formatting can be premade and automatically applied by a computer. This saves so much time in the review process. No bike-shedding about tabs or spaces. Just conform to one autoformatted standard and optionally convert it to your local preference (and back) in your IDE&#x2F;Git-hooks.<p>That said, if you live in Github and other SaaS services this fits really well. In the past I&#x27;ve setup similar workflow to cater to people who never dared to touch a terminal or Git itself. So there is certainly enablement this tool brings to some people.')
