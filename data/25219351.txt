My wife having no idea what to do (go to Urgent care) went to the ER...<p>She had 5 stitches and was in and out in about 90 minutes. A plastic surgeon did the stitches and at one point there were 8 folks in the room.<p>She has no scar and the experience was very good.<p>We had full insurance, and when the bill came, it was ~$4500 of which we had to pay roughly $990 ourselves.<p>Still not sure how to feel about it - that&#x27;s a high price for a few stitches, but if I had a choice of going to a UK hospital for free, or paying a grand to know my daughter will be perfectly cared for, assuming I had that grand, I&#x27;d rather pay.<p>Not everyone has that option though and that&#x27;s the problem.')
