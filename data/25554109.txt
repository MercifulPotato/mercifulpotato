It seems like the cherry picking is being done by you.<p>It’s completely meaningless to compare it to the US as if it were similar.<p>If you compare the US to <i>Europe as a whole</i>, you’ll find just as many problems, and the comparison with individual smaller states would be equally meaningless.<p>You’ll find this is even true with things like Covid.')
