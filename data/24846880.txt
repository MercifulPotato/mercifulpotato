And it was proposed to the C++ committee, but with things like ADL and SFINAE existing, making any substantial changes just isn&#x27;t possible. What happens if you SFINAE on a class derived from an STL container with a method removed in Y from a module in edition Y when it is declared in a module with edition X (where it would exist)? Does the method exist or not? When using contracts from different editions which holds? In what context is the question asked?<p>Even things like integer promotion rules or &quot;trivial&quot; things like &quot;deprecate NULL and 0 for nullptr&quot; are likely untouchable with any edition mechanism for C++ that doesn&#x27;t end up Breaking the World.')
