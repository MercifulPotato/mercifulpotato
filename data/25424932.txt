However you have then arrived at the basic truth that underlies the distorted version you were originally exposed to. So then you can discuss the issue with the person using a set of shared assumptions and perhaps bring them around to the steel manned version. Now you have changed their mind. If they then say &quot;what about this &lt;more preferred, less supportable version&gt; that I started out with&quot; they are more open to your summarized dismissal &quot;that doesn&#x27;t work because of w, x, y, and z&quot;<p>&gt; The more I read such works<p>You&#x27;re not justified in labeling a work as this kind of work until the process here has been done. You may have been exposed to a weaker version and dismissed that because of fallacies, while a stronger version exists. You can&#x27;t dismiss the stronger version without examination merely because it reaches the same conclusions as the weaker version you were exposed to.<p>&gt; You may just as well say you should read Scientology, and you will surely find common points to agree on etc. I mean, it&#x27;s perhaps still useful to try that, I&#x27;ve read some Scientology materials myself and left with more knowledge about the specifics of Scientology, but I didn&#x27;t get closer to believing it. Perhaps I can empathize with why it can hook people, we could call that understanding in a sense.<p>I think my independent study of scientology was fruitful for my understanding of how someone becomes possessed by ideology. Studying scientology under the supervision of scientologists is dangerous because they prevent you from critically examining the ideas.')
