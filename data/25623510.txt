My project was to see what materials would break down styrofoam.  I took a big chunk and broke it into pieces, leaving each in a jar of different liquid (and burning one).  As one would expect, burning it worked really well, but of course let off a ton of black smoke.<p>But you know what else fully dissolved the styrofoam?  Coke.  One week in a jar of coke and it was gone.')
