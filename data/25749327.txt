Basically the one power any union has, that individual members can&#x27;t employ without simply being fired.<p>That&#x27;s not true, strictly speaking. A group of people could theoretically strike together without being members of a  formally-recognized union. In practice, it&#x27;s tough to coordinate that, and they may have a more difficult time actually <i>enforcing</i> those rights without a legal and financial structure of support, but it&#x27;s not true that people have to be members of a union in order to engage in a strike.<p>The law unambiguously grants that power to workers acting in concert with each other, whether or not they are doing so with the formal backing of a union.')
