What I <i>did</i> say is that nobody is marketing lottery tickets as an investment or (or posting screenshots of how much they&#x27;ve spent on lottery tickets to encourage others not to cash out). They&#x27;re literally not allowed to in those ads you mention.<p>&gt; You clearly haven&#x27;t read any of the GME threads on WSB. Pretty much everyone is saying to only invest what you can afford to lose. Most people are buying small amounts just to f##k with the hedge funds, and they are outspoken about it.<p><i>All</i> the top threads are people encouraging others not to take their money out because it&#x27;ll hold its value, honest, and the specific stakes people are sharing range from thousands to [options on] millions. You don&#x27;t see people make those kind of bets on lotteries, and people with financial upside from lottery ticket sales certainly aren&#x27;t allowed to encourage them to.<p>I mean, the whole reason we&#x27;re having this discussion about Wall St versus the common man is because people here are treating entering the market at this stage as an opportunity rather than a negative EV gamble for people looking to join the action. If a vendor stops selling tickets for a particular lottery, nobody acts like wannabe customers or ticket holders dreaming of bigger jackpots are victims.<p>&gt; Buying a lottery ticket for a dollar, hoping they make much more? Isn&#x27;t that the whole point of a lottery?<p>The point of buying a lottery ticket for a dollar for what even the dumbest lottery player knows is an tiny chance of winning isn&#x27;t very similar to the point of buying what used to be $20 stocks starting at $200 after reading an &quot;AT THIS RATE $5,000 IS GOING TO BE NOTHING FOR GME&quot; post.<p>&gt; But suddenly, when a big hedge fund is caught with their pants down, people like you come out and pretend like what&#x27;s happening is a big problem, and we have to stop the trading &quot;because some people can lose money&quot;.<p>Casinos block people from some gambles all the time (especially if something funny&#x27;s going on or they think they might get sued). Nobody cares. Some brokers stop people from some gambles on their platform and people gnash their teeth with rage at how unfair it is, before flipping to arguing that it&#x27;s just a game people are playing with what they can afford to lose. The double standard here isn&#x27;t mine.<p>And yes, most people buying today would lose money (with or without broker intervention). That&#x27;s not a reason to for Robinhood to stop the trading, it&#x27;s a simple observation which is hard to square with arguments that stopping the trades is some monstrous imposition on the common man.<p>As for the hedge funds and investment pros, some of the longs would have loved to see more retail investor action today, and some of the shorts are already out.')
