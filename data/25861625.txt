I push a new version of the dev dockerfile, and have the .vscode&#x2F;devcontainer.json reference that new tag. Next time all the devs open up this repo, they&#x27;ll get notified they need an update. You just updated a dev dependency across the whole group in a source-controlled way.<p>What&#x27;s your way to do it? Email everybody?')
