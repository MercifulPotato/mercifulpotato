This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above. In some cases, if the stock&#x27;s price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller&#x27;s position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)#Risks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Short_(finance)#Risks</a><p>Otherwise you&#x27;d make yourself liable for a literally unlimited sum of money. Any short could completely bankrupt your entire personal finances or your entire institution in that case.')
