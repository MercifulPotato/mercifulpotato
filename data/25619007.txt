If it doesn&#x27;t then it will only hurt you if you do. Just deal with it, work in the way they except (i.e. create even more tech debt for some fast results) and once it all crashes, tell them the whole thing needs a full rewrite (which you know will fail anyways). Not really much you can do here except for leaving.<p>If the company thinks strategically, then no need for something like a 20% schedule. You should be empowered to make these decisions yourself and you should sometimes create a lot of strategical tech debt and sometimes take a month to fix something if you know it will pay off. You are the expert - you need to understand the business for these decisions and then you communicate back (as you already mentioned), but that&#x27;s about it.')
