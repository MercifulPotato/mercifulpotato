For example what if we genetically engineered snack foods to be more like pistachios. The amount of effort required to open up a single pistachio often results in the expenditure of an equal number of calories to the actual energy content of the food itself. Thus it acts as a natural net negative caloric food.<p>Also I&#x27;m not sure how much we should be taking from the ancient Greeks considering that pederasty was commonly practiced there.')
