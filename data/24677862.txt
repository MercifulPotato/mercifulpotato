And while abstraction is certainly necessary to speed up work and declutter the brains of the end users, too much abstraction takes control away and bad abstraction takes the wrong decisions in your name.<p>If you take a look at how string handling works in most programming languages there is a lot of &quot;magic&quot; going on there. Which isn&#x27;t a bad thing necessarily, because most programmers don&#x27;t want to deal with the intricates of strings unless they really have to. The key is that this magic doesn&#x27;t get in your way and doesn&#x27;t do too magical things nobody ever asked of it.')
