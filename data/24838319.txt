Why was Unix free-ish? Because Bell Labs was forbidden from going into computers. After the breakup, they suddenly expected to make money from Unix, and that was a major problem for Plan 9. Okay, so that didn&#x27;t work out, but if Bell Labs had been trying to make money from Unix from the beginning, it would have been worse.<p>Two, it&#x27;s hard to get the exact cause-and-effect, but clearly the breakup coincides with a period of extreme telecommunications flourishing. Maybe it would have happened anyway, but it clearly didn&#x27;t hurt on the telcom side.')
