I don&#x27;t think anyone would claim MS was a great organisation during that period though, given how many major industry trends they just totally missed. Ballmer didn&#x27;t trash the business but the action moved elsewhere.<p>As for Apple, putting the questionable meaning of the stock market to one side for a moment, when was the last time they did anything truly exciting, that cut their competitors legs out from under them?
