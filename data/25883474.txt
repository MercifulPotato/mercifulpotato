I am using what I consider to be the standard definition which would pop up from a google search:<p>&quot;based on or in accordance with reason or logic&quot; &#x2F; &quot;able to think sensibly or logically&quot; &#x2F; &quot;endowed with the capacity to reason&quot;.<p>You made the claim that you do not believe people are rational. Following from this you would also have to believe that individual&#x27;s actions are without reason. Consequently, any perceived reason or logic, either by the actor or an observer, would actually be a post-hoc explanation for action. From a behavioural persective cause and effect would no longer exist, nothing could be predicted and nothing could be planned.<p>This is entirely at odds with what we know about post-truth. Individual behaviour can be modelled and population behaviour can be predicted to a degree.<p>Irrational actions do not imply irrationality. An irrational action is usually a consequence of rational thinking based on incorrect information.')
