I am looking for note taking application that can fulfill the following requirements:<p>- Plain-as-in-Plain Text - meaning I don&#x27;t have to export my notes as JSON or XML or something else. Each note is a single .md or .txt file.<p>- Full-text search<p>- No Markup Lock-in - Meaning, for example, that I can use any flavor of Markdown (in my case MultiMarkdown) that I&#x27;d like and export&#x2F;preview&#x2F;build the file elsewhere.<p>- Preferably Mac native...or anything not Electron if necessary<p>- Wikilinks, please<p>The Archive fills these needs but after looking at their Roadmap, I&#x27;ve realized that I have no intentions of paying for an upgrade when V2 is released and I do not want to risk V1 slowly becoming a mess to operate somewhere down the line if I can find an alternative. The Archive is great because it&#x27;s simple and it&#x27;s core but can be extendable if necessary.<p>Obsidian is nice...but has too much going on for my liking. Same with Org-Roam.<p>I&#x27;m really considering Emacs w&#x2F; Zetteldeft.')
