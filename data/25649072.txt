Simple code is often small, but small code is not always simple.<p>In fact, 3 well built microservices will usually have more lines of code between them than a single monolith that does the same job would as they have to have all the boiler plate for talking to each other and accepting RPC etc.<p>(Also converting a large system that&#x27;s hard to reason about into microservices generally results in a large distributed system that&#x27;s hard to reason about - system design is hard!)')
