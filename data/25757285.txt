I don&#x27;t believe Parler was putting Amazon&#x2F;AWS at risk in terms of legal liability (I&#x27;m pretty sure in the US you can only sue a hosting provider for material they host if it is copyrighted material and they don&#x27;t take it down when they receive notices. A Google search didn&#x27;t turn up anything else.) They also weren&#x27;t at risk of bringing AWS down.<p>What really happened, and should be plain to anybody is that something really awful happened last week that shook the country to its core. Parler played a role in that happening, and tech companies didn&#x27;t want anything to do with them because of that. Both for reputation reasons and I&#x27;m sure personal feelings of large swathes of their employees (including leadership.)<p>I don&#x27;t actually think they were wrong for what they did. I think private companies should have the right to make such a decision. The problem for me is that these companies were in a position to wipe something out like this in the first place.<p>This isn&#x27;t what the web was supposed to be. First it was the switch by most people to using a phone that is locked down as their primary computing device.<p>Now even websites are subject to unregulated private company control. After all - even if you set up your server somewhere, what&#x27;s to stop CloudFlare or Google or anybody else who run these huge DNS services from simply blocking the domain? (assuming you can even keep one registered) Etc...<p>I often hear the argument &quot;Private company, they can do what they want&quot; but at what point does a private company become so powerful that we really <i>do</i> need the government to step in? I&#x27;ve also heard people say that this isn&#x27;t a slippery slope because it&#x27;s all terrorist&#x2F;white supremacist websites so far, but I think to this article I read a while ago about how Apple had decided to ban apps that had anything to do with vaping. This was when some people were dying due to bad black market cartridges.<p>Vaping isn&#x27;t illegal. It isn&#x27;t hateful. It also isn&#x27;t inherently harmful. People used those apps for legitimate reasons. Some of them used iPhone sensors through APIs that aren&#x27;t available for websites&#x2F;web apps. And Apple just decided &quot;Nope, you don&#x27;t get to exist anymore&quot;.<p>I was not a Parler user and I do not support the attack on the Capitol. I also don&#x27;t vape. But both of these things do bother me. And they should bother everybody.')
