But they don&#x27;t get much buzz.<p>My own view is that the untreated problem for most attempts to apply time series analysis &#x2F; anomaly detection &#x2F; concept drift &#x2F; process control is that the time series observed are highly variable to begin with. A highly variable series means (1) you need more data to build the predictions, (2) those predictions are less certain and (3) the false positives will be higher.<p>Put another way: the need for such tools is a symptom, and a treatment, <i>but not a cure</i>.<p>Making software more predictable is more value-adding than building ever more elaborate predictors.')
