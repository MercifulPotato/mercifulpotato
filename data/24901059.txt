I don&#x27;t think there are a lot of folks that realize how much some areas of Toronto have increased over the last 15 years. It is not uncommon to have the a buyer from Asia purchase a house for 200-300k over asking and not even move in, or the buyer is a Chinese UoT Student and buys a 1.8 million dollar house. It is beyond insanity and even a crash won&#x27;t bring it back to reality.')
