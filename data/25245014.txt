So you can only die to Botulism if you properly seal a can. Actually... you don&#x27;t die to Botulism, but to Botulism&#x27;s toxins. As soon as you open a can, Botulism dies. The leftover toxins however will kill you.<p>-----------<p>You seal a can to protect it from all other infectious diseases: E. Coli, Black Mold, etc. etc. This stuff can kill you as well.<p>-------<p>&quot;Normal&quot; diseases die at boiling temperatures. So when you boil a can, its sufficient to kill off E. Coli, Black Mold, etc. etc. However, Botulism dies at higher temperatures... you need a pressure canner to raise the boiling point above 212F (!!!) to kill Botulism spores.<p>So the high-temperature is to kill Botulism. The sealing is to then keep all other diseases out after you&#x27;ve decontaminated the food.')
