He could say Stalin was a great person or whatever who cares. I certainly dont need or want twitter to decide whether that should be read or not.<p>&gt;Did you miss the parts where he said he loved the people who stormed the Capitol with rifles today?<p>He never said that that that&#x27;s just total nonsense not even misinterpretation that straight made up BS.\nYou could just as well says he said he loves rapists because it happens to be that at least one of the person at the protest was a convicted rapist. If that&#x27;s how you interpret things from someone you dont like you have a serious problem with reality.<p>Hes speech was to the people who attender the protest not specifically to thous who entered the building which obviously where a minority. And even if he included the people who entered the building he did not encourage them in any way to do anything they should not do, in fact if he includes them he too told them to go home peacefully.')
