EVERY election Democrats lose ALWAYS results in casting dispersions on the outcome and claiming fraud. It&#x27;s probably so normal to you that you don&#x27;t even notice, right?<p>2016 was the culmination of this and particularly egregious considering the unprecedented way intelligence agencies were weaponized first against the campaign by the outgoing administration and then against the sitting president ... because the assumption that Russia stole the election and Trump colluded with the Russians, was so ingrained.<p>&gt;Also, both of your links appear to be from 2019: You may want to strike &quot;last month&quot; from your claims.<p>I put a link from last month - they aren&#x27;t hard to find. Hillary has been doing this for years now. To be clear, this isn&#x27;t just Hillary, this is normal for Democrats, and allies in media.')
