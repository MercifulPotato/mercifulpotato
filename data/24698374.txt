The essential skill I guess would be literacy, knowing how to read and follow directions, knowing how to use a keyboard, not much.<p>To be a good programmer, if I have to pick only one &quot;skill&quot; I would pick systemic thinking&#x2F;understanding. This starts with the ability to learn and eventually understand how a system works. The next level is the ability to create a working model of that system in ones mind. Someone who can do that will be very successful at programming anything in any language on any platform given sufficient documentation.')
