Search engines and publishers are considering <i>intent</i> - which is relatively easy because they have a small area over which to infer it. Browsers are operating as smart tools capable of interfacing but not capable of understanding intent because the scope of possibility is so broad.<p>You&#x27;re right. User agents should be <i>for the user</i>. They should expose options and controls <i>for the user</i>. They should tune and change and transform things <i>for the user</i>. They should understand what the user wants and make life easier <i>for the user</i>.<p>I am just skeptical that browsers are ever going to be true user agents and capable of fully representing the user&#x27;s interests and intent.')
