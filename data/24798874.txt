Or at least, what the author believes a true polymath to be.<p>Software development does indeed beget an odd practice, in which practitioners can accumulate a large body of domain specific knowledge, almost by osmosis.<p>While I don&#x27;t know if it can be seen as evidence of polymathematical competency, it does make me wonder if this &#x27;skill&#x27;, misconstrued, is what the article is attacking.<p>But the only way to make that clear, is to illustrate the difference between:<p>- People who happen to accumulate deep knowledge of different fields, in the pursuit of others goals (like software engineers).<p>- People who obtain competency in apparently diverse skills, that are obviously related (like the author&#x27;s basketball player, a musician who can play many instruments, or a polylinguist).<p>- People who truly do have, or have developed, competency in two or more fields.<p>The last of which the article suggests is rare, but also muddies the definition by denigrating the most famous exemplar (Da Vinci).<p>Again, what would have helped, was a clearer, or alternative, definition of what we expect a polymath to be. Certainly, if the author is intent on ignoring Da Vinci (?), then you could possibly take Filippo Brunelleschi, or Descartes, and work backwards from there.<p>But this is just an idea...')
