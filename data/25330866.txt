Just saw their teaser video and it instantly threw me back to the late 90ies with LAN parties playing death match Duke Nukem or Doom.<p>The times when we kept our Burgers warm by placing them on the 17&#x27;&#x27; monitor heat outlets. Not that they really stayed warm, but that didn&#x27;t matter to us when gaming away the school holidays.<p>It was the time I got introduced to some very cool people on these nights who taught me html, taught me that there is more than Windows (something called Linux) and a lot of other stuff. Damn - these were interesting times. And it put me onto a track that led me to were I am right now.<p>Thanks a lot to these people.')
