If that holds, then combined, that would only cover 25% of the population. Well below herd immunity.<p>Yes, it would be an improvement, but we should really be embarking on a heavy public awareness campaign that, once available (and assuming a low risk profile) that vaccination is the responsible and safe thing to do.')
