Especially ones that run across multiple platforms but feel good in each?<p>I used to think the same of React Native a couple years ago but this year I picked it up again and was shocked how far its come - incredibly smooth experience, far better ecosystem, and it&#x27;s hard (impossible?) to beat Chrome DevTools + VSCode. Runs fast, too.<p>The thing is, Flutter is a no-go for the web as of now, it delivers a huge bloated bundle that&#x27;s not accessible or performant. But with React Native you can build an app that shares 90% of the code across all native platforms and the web, <i>and feels&#x2F;is more native on each of the three platforms</i>.')
