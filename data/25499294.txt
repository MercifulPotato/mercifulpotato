I experienced this incredible phenomenon a couple years ago after taking my son to the ER while out of state on vacation. We were there for a few hours to have a very horror movie-esc swollen lymph node looked at. He needed a CT scan to confirm that it was not an abscess and some IV antibiotics for strep. The doctor and nurses were great, I paid up front, and additionally provided insurance. Seemed like everything went smoothly. Three months later we received a bill for $2500 from a doctor we had not seen. Insurance had adjusted it from $3800. Perhaps he was the attending physician and the doctor we saw consulted with him. I have no idea and no one told me anything about it.<p>My wife, being the litigious trial attorney that she is, sent the physician&#x27;s group a letter disputing the bill, requesting documentation that this doctor did in fact work on my son&#x27;s case, and putting them on notice that she would fight them on principle over the amount of the bill. A couple of weeks later we got a letter stating that despite the fact that the charges were in fact valid, they would adjust the amount owed to $0.<p>A friend I related this to commented, &quot;yup, they just wrote you off because there are so many more people that they can go after and not fight with that it just isn&#x27;t worth it to them.&quot;<p>What a sad commentary on healthcare in America.')
