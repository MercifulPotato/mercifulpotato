I&#x27;m no expert in ZFS TBH (We use Lustre much more) but, IIRC, when I was benchmarking the then new Sun Oracle ZFS 7320, I remember it was resilvering the disks after  especially torturous loads, at night.<p>Maybe it was specific to the appliances (Our behemoth 7420 did the same) or, something was wrong. I remember Oracle&#x2F;Sun guys jokingly asking me whether I succeeded to make it resilver the disks and, hearing it did indeed resilver the disks a dozen times visibly upset them. They&#x27;ve only said that &quot;Pack it up, we need to go&quot;.<p>Fun times, it was.')
