There are some parties including those who are too young to vaccinate or who have poor immune systems whom are only protected by the surrounding population not passing around virii like baseball cards.<p>Having a large enough host population to sustain an outbreak means those vulnerable parties are fucked and the rest of the population even those for whom the vaccine is 90% effective are at still at some risk. Worse the selection pressure among millions of vectors to develop a strain that can infect the previously safe population is high and the possibility is real.<p>This is to say that the proper assessment of safety is the likely net effect on the entire population of an increasingly large portion of society not vaccinating.<p>Existing precedent would seem to suggest that its impossible to force you to vaccinate but possible to prevent you from participating in society if you do not. For example the state can put you in jail for not putting your kid in school but not let you do so unless you vaccinate your kid.<p>I would not be terribly surprised if people, especially vulnerable people argued that a work allowing anti vaxxers to work alongside them violated their right to a safe workplace.<p>Imagine one lawsuit from someones family that lost a baby or a family member resulting in an 7-8 figure settlement. There wont have to be a law. The lawsuits will be from anti vaxxers alleging that this violates their rights and will take place over the following 2 years after every major workplace in America adopts such rules giving American workers the choice between employment and remaining an antivaxxer.')
