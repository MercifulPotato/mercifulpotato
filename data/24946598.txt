Actors and athletes became media stars not for their area of expertise but for their political opinions (which should be worth exactly the same as the bartender&#x27;s but the bartender doesn&#x27;t make the news for some reason.)<p>I agree that Facebook is a huge platform for politics.  The difference is that you can post your own views and you can indicate if you like or dislike someone else&#x27;s opinions.<p>I think it&#x27;s actually progress.')
