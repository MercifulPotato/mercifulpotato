Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[24764813], score=None, time=1602580992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763051, text='&gt; as far as eight thousand years<p>Given that the oldest written records are only 5,000 years old (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_oldest_documents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_oldest_documents</a> ), I&#x27;m curious as to what that source might be. The Tassili cave art mentioned is 10,000 years old. I suspect the page you linked to made a mistake when writing that information.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dowsing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dowsing</a> says &quot;Dowsing as practiced today may have originated in Germany during the 16th century, when it was used in attempts to find metals.&quot;.<p>While the site you point to says: &quot;Today’s European method of dowsing (the method we use at Springbank Energy Healing) evolved from the system practiced in ancient Egypt. This system was based on quantum physics and sacred geometry; and some of the pendulums in use today were modeled on the originals found in these ancient tombs.&quot;<p>This sounds like standard pseudoscience nonsense to me.<p>But I can be wrong. Where is the evidence? How do we know that &quot;Cleopatra ... had dowsers with her at all times&quot;? I just searched Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the noble Grecians and Romans&quot; at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;ebooks&#x2F;674" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;ebooks&#x2F;674</a> and found no mention of that.<p>Concerning the Tassili caves, the site you pointed to in turn cites <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dowsers.org&#x2F;dowsing-history&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dowsers.org&#x2F;dowsing-history&#x2F;</a> , which claims &quot;Among the many fascinating wall murals, not only did they locate an art gallery devoted exclusively to the depictions of spacecraft and ET’s, they also found a remarkable huge wall painting of a dowser, holding a forked branch in his hand searching for water, surrounded by a group of admiring tribesmen. These wall murals were carbon dated and found to be a least 8000 years old.&quot;<p>So you aren&#x27;t exactly pointing to a good reference but an edited version of another source with introduced errors.<p>And .. really? Spacecraft and ET&#x27;s as well as dowsing? There&#x27;s a long tradition of finding old things and claiming aliens did it. But was also know it&#x27;s easy to look at something old, when we don&#x27;t know the historical context, and read the wrong thing into it. Like this &quot;time-traveling hipster&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;time-traveling-hipster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;time-traveling-hipster&#x2F;</a> or this 1943 beachgoer seemingly checking his mobile phone - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;conspiracy-theorists-spot-time-traveler-using-mobile-phone-in-1940s-photo-during-world-war-ii" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;conspiracy-theorists-spot-ti...</a> .<p>That other site claims things like &quot;how [in the Bible] both Moses and his son, Aaron, used a dowsing device referred to as “the Rod” to locate and bring forth water&quot;. But that 1) wasn&#x27;t a dowsing rod but a staff or walking stick, and 2) Aaron was Moses&#x27;s brother, not son, and 3) it wasn&#x27;t dowsing for existing water because God told Moses that striking the stone would cause water to come out.<p>It also says &quot;The Jews learned the ancient art from their captors and in the Old Testament Prophet Hozea [sic] wrote: “They now consult their pieces of wood then the wand makes pronouncements from them!”&quot;. That appears to be Hosea 4:12 &quot;My people ask counsel from their wooden idols &#x2F; And their [a]staff informs them. &#x2F;\nFor the spirit of harlotry has caused them to stray, &#x2F; And they have played the harlot against their God.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Hosea%204%3A12&amp;version=NKJV" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biblegateway.com&#x2F;passage&#x2F;?search=Hosea%204%3A12&amp;...</a> . The [a] is &quot;Diviner’s rod&quot;, and divining is indeed an ancient practice -  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divination</a> . But <i>it isn&#x27;t dowsing</i>. Wikipedia even cross-references &quot;&quot;Divining&quot; redirects here. For pseudoscientific attempts to find water or other things, see Dowsing.&quot;')
