If you use Unix timestamp, the timer will jump during a leap second.<p>This is because a day in Unix time is always exactly 86,400 “seconds”, but an actual civil day may be from 86,399 to 86,401 seconds. (It has never been 86,399 seconds, but it “could” be.)<p>So you should probably be using TAI. UTC is theoretically good enough but it is inconvenient to use because of the leap seconds. Unix time is a bit broken.<p>It is actually very easy to use TAI. You just need a GPS receiver. TAI is a fixed offset from GPS time (TAI = GPS + 19 seconds).')
