Like the Apple IIe came with manuals that taught you Apple Basic, and I remember my Dad trying to learn it, with some minor success (although not as much as me).<p>Middle school &quot;computing&quot; class, which all students took, also involved teaching programming, although on Commodore 64s.<p>Another thing I&#x27;d note about the OP is that most of the game splashscreens shown have &quot;cracked by&quot; attributions added to them, which goes without comment in the OP. :)')
