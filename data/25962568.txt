The only thing new about it is that the perpetrator is a subreddit instead of a licensed broker&#x2F;dealer or other regulated entity.<p>The appropriate thing to do is for the SEC to subpoena Reddit and RobinHood, correlate trades with posts to prove intent to manipulate the price (which IS illegal), and charge every individual with market manipulation.<p>Just like any other individuals guilty of market manipulation (Libor riggers, Navinder Sarao, etc).<p>Robinhood should probably also be investigated for abetting this, although it&#x27;s a gray area.')
