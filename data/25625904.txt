From what I can tell, if we assume that clicking the ad is a weighted binary variable, eg. what is modelled as a &quot;proportional distribution&quot; there&#x27;s a statistically significant difference between the two results. It&#x27;s even pretty strong at P=0.006 (per <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epitools.ausvet.com.au&#x2F;ztesttwo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epitools.ausvet.com.au&#x2F;ztesttwo</a>), but I might be missing something?<p>In other words, if I&#x27;m doing the math right, for him to p-hack this by rerunning the experiment in the case of no difference, he&#x27;d have to run it more than 100 times to get a 50% chance of getting as good or better significance.<p>There&#x27;s of course plenty of other things that could be wrong outside of the simple statistical test, he could be making the numbers up, the groups might not be properly randomized etc.')
