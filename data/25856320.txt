I hope this is ok on the Micro-USB port.\n  - The isn&#x27;t currently a version with header pins, so you&#x27;ll have to add your own, or get one from a Reseller who will mode them for you (like this one [2]).\n</code></pre>\nThe burried the lede is that Raspberry Pi have created their own silicon (just like that other fruit company).\nThey call their Microcontroller the &quot;RP2040&quot;:<p>It boasts some impressive specs:<p><pre><code>  - Dual-core cortex M0+ at up to 133MHz\n  - On-chip PLL allows variable core frequency\n  - 264K multi-bank high performance SRAM\n  - External Quad-SPI Flash with eXecute In Place (XIP)\n</code></pre>\nSource:<p>[1] I&#x27;ve had access to prerelease HW and work at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberry.piaustralia.com.au&#x2F;products&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pico" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberry.piaustralia.com.au&#x2F;products&#x2F;raspberry-pi-p...</a><p>[2] Maddy (with her steady hands) has hand modded 100 of these: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberry.piaustralia.com.au&#x2F;products&#x2F;raspberry-pi-pico?variant=32587824103473" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raspberry.piaustralia.com.au&#x2F;products&#x2F;raspberry-pi-p...</a>')
