Most established non-privacy-preserving products have been slowly killing interoperability because data lock-in provides a moat against users leaving and against potential competitors accessing valuable user data. There&#x27;s no economic reason why privacy-preserving products should have worse interoperability than privacy-violating ones. Especially in product categories where interoperability does not imply sending PII to third parties.<p>I agree. I don&#x27;t see a strong economic reason this would be the case. But there&#x27;s a strong practical reason (which perhaps has economic consequences): loss of control. If you make it easy for your users to interface with other services which don&#x27;t have the same privacy guarantees, you&#x27;re increasing the risk of their privacy being violated. If you implement an interface that&#x27;s so secure, that no leakage or abuse is possible, then you win. But if that&#x27;s not possible, and you end up restricting things that would otherwise lead to cool, productivity features, then you&#x27;ve hit the trade-off I touch on in the essay.')
