There are a bunch of really good tools for code search already which are a lot more sophisticated than this one - livegrep for example.<p>I built this partly as a learning exercise, to see how far I could push the idea of a Datasette plugin and to figure out how to call external processes from Python asyncio.<p>I also built it because I had a hunch that the &quot;datasette publish&quot; mechanism for deploying Datasette to serverless hosting providers such as Google Cloud Run could make it easy to deploy code search engines too. I think the most interesting thing about this project is the GitHub Actions workflow I wrote that deploys the demo instance running against code from 60+ repositories: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette-ripgrep&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;.github&#x2F;workflows&#x2F;deploy_demo.yml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette-ripgrep&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;.githu...</a>')
