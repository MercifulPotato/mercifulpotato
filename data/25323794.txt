Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=[25327324], score=None, time=1607266234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322911, text='&gt; default stylesheets if these were not a tasteless disaster that nobody can stand.<p>I beg to disagree.  Having browsed quite a few sites with css disabled over the years, I can assess that default stylesheets tend to grow in you and that you may end up liking them.<p>In a saner world, all sites would use default stylesheets (with empty css), and individual users would set up whatever css they deem beautiful each day.')
