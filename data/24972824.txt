Dominating SERPS with very little effort since we&#x27;re doing long tail. Our particular long tail means people are searching for very particular terms and buying the single item they are looking for, with this behaviour the business seems very viable(and exciting) by the growth google shopping gives. All other channels combined are very slow in comparison. We&#x27;re continuing trying to optimise those in the meantime.
