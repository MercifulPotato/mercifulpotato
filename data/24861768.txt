Item(by='gen220', descendants=None, kids=[24862141], score=None, time=1603392365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861467, text='&gt; The real scam is when things like health insurance premiums are deductible for a company but not for an individual.<p>To be fair, that this &quot;scam&quot; is still alive today is mostly by accident.<p>It stems from WWII times, when stateside laborers were uniquely low in supply and high in demand, and when labor had ridiculous bargaining power.<p>Laborers couldn&#x27;t really ask for higher wages, because that was politically impossible (appearing to be extorting wartime needs for money was&#x2F;is a faux pas).<p>So companies began competing on &quot;benefits&quot;: health, accidental death and disability insurance among them.<p>To help ease the burden on employers and employees, the IRS allowed businesses to &quot;temporarily&quot; deduct insurance premiums. (This relief came against the backdrop of unprecedented wartime tax hikes).<p>Postwar, it was unfeasible to remove this measure, as the majority of Americans who had insurance got it through their employers: it would upset both businesses who have to pay more, and employees who lose insurance.<p>Later, some government (I forget which...) signed this stopgap measure into the tax code, making it permanent.<p>Regardless of the interesting history, I agree with you, it should be universally deductible.')
