It helps me concentrate during the meeting (using a laptop would be counterproductive for that) and gives me a record that is more trustworthy than my brain.<p>Aside from that, I always have a scratch pad and plenty of post-it notes lying at hand. The former for any quick-and-dirty doodling, the latter for my to-dos.')
