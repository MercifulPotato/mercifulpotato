I use Hibernate for our platform, which is used at most by 10-20 people at once. There ORM is a huge help because I can just easily view and edit my model and all its relations and I accept performance hit in this case and if something is too slow, I rewrite it in sql.<p>Then we have API that uses data of the platform, and there I dropdown to plain handcrafted sql with a little help of JDBI and so far it has been working great and responses are fast.<p>So I think it is just about stepping back a bit to think and not to blindly accept either side of the argument. Each use case is different.')
