It was my primary browser for over a decade. The modern web has unfortunately left it behind but it still has utility. I have used it to test accessibility on sites. It is an excellent file manager. Just bookmark ~&#x2F; for navigation. It is useful for importing pages with -dump from the command line. It is arguably the best ever gopher client. It is also configurable beyond belief. Hopefully with a resurgence of interest in simplicity and text it will continue to be useful...')
