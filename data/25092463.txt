Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605364011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091824, text='&gt; I love when people find unused features or weird implementation details in things.<p>I also like trying to guess what these unused features were originally meant for.<p>My guess is that the &quot;directly giving an item&quot;, &quot;directly giving a pokemon&quot;, &quot;special map&quot;, and &quot;special route&quot; were meant to be used in real-life events sponsored by the game developer. For instance, all attendees to a convention who own that device could receive an item or a pokemon as a bonus; the convention booth would have a custom device which knows how to send the necessary commands.<p>The &quot;direct memory write&quot; was probably to allow the DS game a limited ability to &quot;patch&quot; the device in case a bug was found later, or a new feature had to be added.')
