And stopped following arguers. Still following informational accounts. But mostly Twitter is back to its original usage: a Google Reader replacement. No more a global chat.<p>Screens (TV):\nI now avoid any kind of TV series that is not already finished. No time for a show that is eventually a bad one after season 1. (a variant of the GoT syndroma. But you could call it XFiles syndroma too, if you are old enough :)<p>Screens (games):\nBut the most dramatic change, and the most unexpected one, is that I have started playing FPS games again. It has increased a lot my attention and &quot;good stress&quot; level.<p>Also, I have started learning piano. Passed the first 2 years and things are getting much better now.<p>In the end, I suppose that I am no longer able to survive the information deluge that Internet brings. So I now focus on a few things that I consider important, and I leave the rest out of my attention.<p>PS: oh and let me add that i now learn new tech things through books (from Manning and O&#x27;Reilly) instead of loosing my time reading blog posts. Sounds so basic that you may laugh at that, but it made my learning process much more straightforward.\n(once again, I was loosing myself in the information deluge of the internet).')
