Why does the TLS protocol not allow for using a key pair which is agreed-upon between a server and a client beforehand, like in SSH connections where a public key to be used in a connection is placed in a server prior to the connection?<p>There are many CAs out there and in the event of China or Russia hacking into one of them, it would enable them to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. I&#x27;d like to eliminate such a possibility, but the TLS protocol requires me to trust a certificate authority. I might just be a conspiracy theorist, but I am suspecting why it&#x27;s impossible to use TLS without trusting a third-party called certifcate authority is exactly because someone needed to leave a way to do MITM attacks.')
