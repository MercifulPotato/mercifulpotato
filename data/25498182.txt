It&#x27;s very expensive for insurance companies to fight charges, so generally mechanics know a magic number they can give that is way higher than they&#x27;d charge you, but the insurance company wouldn&#x27;t bother to fight.<p>Ever have work done on a car&#x2F;boat and have the mechanic offer to pay your deductible? I&#x27;ve had it happen most of the time.<p>And this part of insurance is hard to fix simply because of how valuable people&#x27;s time is, and the cost of the insurance company simply being wrong in the end (reputation hit, possible legal repercussions, and cost of the investigation).')
