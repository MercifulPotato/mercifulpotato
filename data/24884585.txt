This tech can run on bitcoin or lightcoin&#x27;s networks, if I understand correctly.<p>Another example would be decentralized governance. The bisq.io project has built a system on top of bitcoin to incentivize and pay for their project&#x27;s future development. They chose their model for censorship resistance (as they have concern that nation-states might not take kindly to a peer-to-peer permission-less bitcoin to fiat exchange) and its been functioning since April 2019. In historical perspective, the bisq network has innovated a new way for humans to work together that rivals the invention of the joint stock corporations by the English and Dutch at the start of the 17th century. There&#x27;s lots of talk of decentralized governance on top of Ethereum, but so far the only really resilient and decentralized project I&#x27;ve seen in the space is the bisq network. Bisq is the sort of new thing that can be built on top of bitcoin&#x27;s trust-decentralizing monetary technology.')
