Also the author ignores the tragedy of the commons - what if the last person broke the pasta maker or didn’t clean it.  Where is the labor coming from to keep up all this stuff?  How much supply is available?  How much does it cost to get a pasta maker delivered?  Does it come today or a month from now because I have to reserve one of my city’s 3 pasta makers and that was the soonest available?  What if I don’t return it?')
