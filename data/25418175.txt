If I get a junior candidate that can&#x27;t code, I write them off and say goodbye.<p>I can teach dev lifecycle to a junior, and often need to because every business I&#x27;ve worked at as a lead has a totally different model. I can coach them on inter-team dynamics (and often have to). I can help them with culture fit to a point (if they&#x27;re willing). What I can&#x27;t do is teach them to be able to reason and write code and do the engineering work I hired them for.<p>From the Reddit post (and from other reviews), it sounds like the students are not performing well and sinking without learning this core skill -- most didn&#x27;t understand enough to code in JS, for instance. This seems like a pretty dire failure in the part of the program itself.<p>Do you plan on at least giving these students a chance to retake prior units without further charging them for knowledge you should have already taught them?')
