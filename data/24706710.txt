And if you do stuff with small children in way they find pleasurable, they tend to start liking and valuing that thing.<p>Most parents introduce kids to things they themselves like or value.  Like, sport, reading books, music, video games, nature, shows they themselves like and so on. People do it even with math and grammar (through I was never able to fully understand the grammar thing). The list is pretty long and the more parents you know, the more normal it seems to be to show your kids what you yourself like soon.')
