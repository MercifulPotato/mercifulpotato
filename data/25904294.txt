This form of advertising is often associated with low quality &quot;clickbait&quot; links and articles. The term derives from the fishing practice of &quot;chumming&quot;, the use of fish meat as a lure for fish.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chumbox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Chumbox</a><p>This word is used in the article and while I’m quite familiar with the thing, I didn’t know it had a name. Very fitting for the low-quality content that it contains!')
