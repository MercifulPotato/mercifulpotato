Chrome itself won’t be consulting ckbi (i.e. it will take the same path as Linux, which will be to consult the Chrome store, even on Chromium OS builds, and only use NSS for user-added roots and client certs).<p>Whether we keep that overlay in sync with the Chrome store, or stop patching it and let it match upstream, it’s neither here nor there, and mostly just about what ends up being easiest and causing the least confusion. I’m lazy, but in practice the contents there won’t matter, since it’ll be baked into Chrome proper.<p>The etc-based store is a little more complicated, but it’s also not used by Chrome on CrOS, nor by the system apps that only talk to Google (they use the Google service set from pki.goog). Any code using that set doesn’t use the Chromium cert verifier, which as the mail and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;root-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;g.co&#x2F;chrome&#x2F;root-policy</a> explain, go sort of hand in hand with the root program, so it may just continue to use upstream as it does today.')
