I do believe that this is real, and you can see from 0:51-1:05 that there&#x27;s some reflections going on that would be a lot trickier to fake. But this footage has a similar quality to what I see in a lot of heavily processed drone footage, where it just doesn&#x27;t look like the same way I see the world.')
