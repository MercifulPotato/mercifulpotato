In 25 years of work, DNSSEC hasn&#x27;t put a dent in it --- look at the stats on which zones are signed (and note that most of those signatures are security theater, done automatically by registrars).<p>The fact is that there&#x27;s nothing you can do to authenticate DNS records, and turning some silly &quot;DNSSEC&quot; feature on in your own stack won&#x27;t do anything but make you feel better, because DNSSEC simply doesn&#x27;t have meaningful adoption. However, enabling DoH does in fact immediately protect you from attacks that really do happen, like ISPs monetizing your DNS.')
