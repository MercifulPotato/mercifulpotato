They are already offering their services to the private sector, nothing prevents their contracting by the public sector.<p>What blatently lacks right now, is counter intelligence and the capacity of detection of such initiatives.<p>I will conclude with what i believe to be two recent large scale communication campaigns. Note that I don&#x27;t have any evidence except from their relatively sudden apparition. The support for Johny Depp in his private problems and the various boycott of Chinese products in India.')
