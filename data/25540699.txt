Growing up in one of these areas, there was the occasional power outage (once a year or so at most) but I can&#x27;t recall any gas line outages. Those who had whole-home generators experienced no real outage, although in a colder climate having a gas heating system and a gas stove with a backup lighter&#x2F;match are definitely more essential than keeping the lights on.')
