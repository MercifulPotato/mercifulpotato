You can also ignore properties if they don&#x27;t need serialisation.<p>Your example looks sloppy but it can get messy as the project evolves. I had some code where I mistakenly removed some XmlAttribute attributes in one release and it was painful to resolve in the next release.<p>Having said that I will still use it again, just carefully.')
