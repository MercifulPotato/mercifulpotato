Even with the current relative calm in front end web development, JS is still a terrible language for almost everything that matters. TS is a noble effort to put lipstick on a pig that achieves some useful benefits, but only at the expense of adding even more complexity, a sometimes clumsy syntax because of the JS legacy, and an illusion of being safer than it actually is again because the decision to favour JS compatibility means you can break the type system.<p>Momentum is a huge factor in programming language popularity, which unfortunately tends to hold back real progress, sometimes for decades. That&#x27;s why we still write front end code in JS, and why we still write systems code in C. But with the progress of WASM, I think there is a genuine opportunity to create something so much better than JS (or anything that compiles to JS) that it might eventually take over, even if it takes more like 2 decades than 2 years to achieve success.')
