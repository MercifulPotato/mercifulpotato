Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=[24679422], score=None, time=1601821556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679213, text='&gt; If you count having lost effective control of a significant part of their country as a government having failed, there are plenty.<p>Losing control of a significant part of a country isn&#x27;t comparable to private enterprise failure, it&#x27;s more comparable to the CEO of a company being replaced.<p>Imagine what retail would have been like if, instead of Sears being essentially replaced, we just elected a different set of leaders to run the same organization.<p>&gt; No-one would say that Syria or Libya have a single functioning government controlling the country at the moment, and you can throw swathes of central Africa in there as well.<p>Right, and in general we consider that instability to be a bad thing, and a key goal of UNESCO (and adjacent organizations) is to make African nations as stable as Western democracies. That kind of stability just isn&#x27;t sought out in the private sector.<p>&gt; Other than a coup, civil war, or a foreign takeover, there isn&#x27;t really a way for a government to definitely &#x27;fail&#x27;, but no-one would say that these events are unheard of.<p>If you were to ask me to pick a system where change happens through violence and bloodshed (civil wars, coups) vs peaceful financial transactions (M&amp;A, bankruptcy) â€” I would choose the latter any day of the week.')
