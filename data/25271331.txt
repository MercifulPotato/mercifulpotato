Things like referential integrity and transactions get harder for sure, but they&#x27;re not unsolved â€” as noted in the article, we have prior art now in the form of products like Citus, Spanner, and CockroachDB.<p>But that said, even though Oracle et all do support these features even for large installs (on a single node), a lot of the RDMS niceties tend to be thrown out anyway. DBAs get afraid that non-trivial `SELECT` operations won&#x27;t be able to use an index and cause production havoc, adding fields as `NOT NULL` gets hard to do, and even the simple act of raising an index can get expensive&#x2F;scary.<p>This is a big part of what this piece is about: even where these features are still possible, there&#x27;s a bad tendency not to use them. Why is that, and how do we fix it?')
