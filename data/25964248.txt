All advertising has done is made everyone think they aren&#x27;t good enough and to buy too much crap and kill our planet and even cause wars and uprisings.<p>Also: Don&#x27;t try to confuse things you advertiser-pricks: &quot;advertising&quot; is whenever you cram your crap in front of my face or into my ears in places I don&#x27;t want to or need to see it, like TV ads, print ads, or a speaker in the newspaper someday.<p>No, industry events aren&#x27;t &quot;advertising&quot;, that&#x27;s &quot;networking&quot; and people choose to go there. No, it&#x27;s not &quot;advertising&quot; if Amazon tries to suggest useful things I might need&#x2F;want, that&#x27;s a &quot;recommendation&quot; and people choose to see them (somewhat). No, classified ads are not &quot;advertising&quot;, regardless of the name, that&#x27;s a &quot;market&quot; and people choose to look there.')
