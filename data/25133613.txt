Mere nationalist tendencies do not make one a fascist.<p>From wikipedia:-<p>&quot;Fascism (&#x2F;ˈfæʃɪzəm&#x2F;) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I, before spreading to other European countries. Opposed to liberalism, Marxism, and anarchism, fascism is placed on the far right within the traditional left–right spectrum.&quot;')
