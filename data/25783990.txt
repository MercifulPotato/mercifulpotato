Adults (and in some cases other children) can still be prosecuted if they encourage&#x2F;entice&#x2F;assist&#x2F;etc the child to do it, but the child themselves commits no crime.<p>&gt; Its not as if they&#x27;d be a registered sex offender as a minor.<p>A number of American states do in fact put minors on the sex offender registry. For example, [1] describes how a woman was registered as a sex offender in Michigan after being convicted of &quot;criminal sexual conduct&quot; as a 10 year old<p>&gt; Put this way: what if it was an illegal firearm?<p>A fifteen year old who takes a picture of themselves naked, the primary risk of harm is to themselves, and the harm they are risking is psychosocial rather than physical. By contrast, a fifteen year old with an illegal firearm easily poses a risk of death or serious physical injury, not just to themselves, but also to others. Hence, criminally prosecuting the later is far easier to morally justify than criminally prosecuting the former. The situations aren&#x27;t really comparable.<p>&gt; We can&#x27;t just turn a blind eye to youth breaking law<p>Well, like Victoria has done, the law can be changed so that they aren&#x27;t breaking it.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;classic.austlii.edu.au&#x2F;au&#x2F;legis&#x2F;vic&#x2F;consol_act&#x2F;ca195882&#x2F;s51m.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;classic.austlii.edu.au&#x2F;au&#x2F;legis&#x2F;vic&#x2F;consol_act&#x2F;ca1958...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;14&#x2F;when-kids-are-accused-of-sex-crimes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;14&#x2F;when-kids-are-...</a>')
