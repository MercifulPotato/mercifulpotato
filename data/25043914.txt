I get recorded then? WTF???<p>Who <i>owns</i> these machines? Is it the parents or the school or the government or who? What if they decline? Can someone explain why a child has to accept that they are being watched on a webcam without their consent? Without the consent of their parent? And, &quot;either accept it or don&#x27;t get allowed at exam&quot; isn&#x27;t a choice. They ain&#x27;t going to high school yet, but I don&#x27;t envision I would allow my children to be scrutinized by this. Then again, who expected COVID-19. I can only hope this is temporary, but perhaps its part of &#x27;the new normal&#x27;.')
