Either it&#x27;s as closed as iOS and apps can&#x27;t be pirated, or it&#x27;s as open as Android and it&#x27;s possible to pirate apps. Restrictions on what can be installed and user&#x27;s ultimate control of their own device are mutually exclusive.<p>That said, I&#x27;d choose to have control, even as an app developer. Piracy is a fact of life.')
