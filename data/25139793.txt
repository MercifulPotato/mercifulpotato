It&#x27;s not very PC to say, but quite simply being different is not inherently a moral good.  Downs Syndrome in particular is more controversial, because people who have this disorder typically are happy in their lives.  I&#x27;ve spent a not insignificant part of my life working with teenagers and adults with Downs Syndrome as a volunteer, and all of the people I&#x27;ve worked with have been cheerful and generally seem to have a high enjoyment factor in their lives.  On the flip side, all of them required life-long assistance and care, never able to function completely independently, and lacking in almost all other meaningful quality of life factors.<p>It is entirely possible, without any dissonance whatsoever, to respect the autonomy and wonder of human life and the rights of people with disabilities, while also understanding that having children with debilitating permanent disabilities can be a heartbreaking exercise that drains you emotionally, mentally, and physically.  Nobody reasonable wishes for their child to suffer from such a disability, so the moral implications of the shift towards prenatal screening and following abortion are more about the abortion than the rest of the conversation.  Denmark, in particular, has a very open social view towards abortion, so the fact that abortion rates are so high when negative screening occurs is unsurprising.  I&#x27;m sure the result would differ in other countries in proportion roughly to their social views on abortion.')
