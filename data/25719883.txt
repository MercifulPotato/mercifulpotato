Many engineers are much more offended by unmeritocratic pay than by absolute value of pay being low - hence why you can convince amazing engineers to work for peanuts at start-ups.<p>I want the greatest share of the returns of my own labor I can get. If that results in very high salary, great, it’s earned. If I take a risk at a place where that translates to much lower salary, that’s fine too - as long as it’s very objectively meritocratic.<p>If I am making $200k per year as a top, top performer, while my employer is paying far more mediocre performers $175k (perhaps based of geolocation), or where both of us are bringing in ~ millions of revenue, that’s super unacceptable.<p>As time goes on, the surplus of my labor productivity that a big corporate employer can capture beyond my total compensation should be decreasing heavily - and expert software labor is one class that has the negotiation power to actually push that issue.<p>So I’d flip your question on its head. Why do we pretend that rent-seeking executives deserve the surplus revenue generated by rare talented engineers? Why (with complete sincerity) aren’t many, many, many more software engineers paid on the order of what Hollywood actors are making, while executive salaries simply have to come way, way down in these lines of business?')
