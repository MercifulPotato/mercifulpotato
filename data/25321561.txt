They sold large systems. When they tried the Rainbow, they pretty much did everything wrong. They didn&#x27;t have a sales staff that knew how to sell a $2000 computer. You&#x27;d call them about the Rainbow and they wanted to send a sales team. Also, the Rainbow alienated the hackers at the time by its closed nature compared to the IBM PC. For example, you could only use DEC floppies that cost significantly more than normal ones.')
