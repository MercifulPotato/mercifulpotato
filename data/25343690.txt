The most prominently advertised benchmarks are generally the multi-threaded ones, which is fair. Then, single-threaded tests are often added because some applications don&#x27;t parallelize as well (or at all). From an end-user perspective, it is useful information. They are arguing for performance-per-core tests. The only fair way to do that would be 2-threaded workloads. Sure, why not. But it does not invalidate the use of single-threaded workloads as a (maybe niche? but) relevant data point.')
