Having seen Small Claims Court in person, there were companies suing people and people suing companies.  And all the companies showed up.<p>As for enforcement, here, you&#x27;re allowed to sell the debt the company owes you to collectors, and this pays 10% interest a year--not bad compared to a checking account.  You can demand they show up in court again and answer to the judge why they haven&#x27;t paid, and when they will, you can lay claim to rent and assets, et cetera.  The court won&#x27;t do that for you, but it very much does want to help legitimately harmed parties settle their score.<p>I agree it&#x27;s not fast, though.')
