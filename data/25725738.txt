But frankly if you are going to take a position that is kinda moderately in favor of violence, then you really should not be pushing back so hard at the possibility that there are other people who were a bit more supportive of the violence than you are.<p>That is what I am pointing out.  I&#x27;d put you at a 5&#x2F;10, on the &quot;is this person trying to justify the violence that happen&quot;.  So if an average&#x2F;random person such as yourself are going to moderately support the violence, then you really should not be so flabergasted at the suggestion that there were other people that were closer to an 8&#x2F;10 on the &quot;do they support violence&quot; scale.')
