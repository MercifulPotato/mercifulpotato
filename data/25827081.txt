My last paper was rejected when the reviewers hardly understood the basics of the topic. And I have been assigned papers to review about topics I have never worked on<p>&gt;In a wiki, where anyone can publish or change anything without control, the scientific level - at least in certain areas - will inevitably level down.<p>Not every edit needs to be approved<p>Open source with pull requests was not so bad for software quality<p>&gt;There is no perfect system, but there are many worse than we already have.<p>The current system is especially bad.
