ATM it&#x27;s around 75 cm from my eyes and it&#x27;s a little too close.<p>I don&#x27;t use scaling, so it&#x27;s basically like having four 21.5&quot; FullHD panels, and the distance isn&#x27;t that problematic because of the pixel density, but mainly because of the fact that it occupies my whole visual field and it feels a bit weird.<p>I have it hooked to a vanilla Ubuntu machine with GNOME, nothing special. I usually put RubyMine (I do Ruby on Rails) with all the bells and whistles and sidebars and toolbars on the left side of the screen, full height, which gives me a FullHD code editor and a FullHD debugger window, and on the left side I have a browser window with a terminal or a JS console. And some Spotify peeking behind it or something. This gets me through the whole day, I don&#x27;t need any i3-style black magic to handle my 5 windows.<p>The screen has been sitting in the office for quite a while. People tried it for a bit and went back to their 3X&quot; 4K panels, but I fell in love with it immediately.<p>Actually the &quot;having to turn your head&quot; is the most interesting aspect. Yes, I do have to turn my head a lot. I have to turn my head and sometimes move my whole body when I need to see some detail somewhere and I like that about this setup. Not sure whether it&#x27;s ergonomic or healthy but I like that I can physically move myself further left or right and focus on one part of the screen.<p>Unfortunately, I use a PS4 for gaming and my laptops are an iGPU-equipped Dell and a M1 Macbook Air, so 3D gaming in 4K is out of the question.')
