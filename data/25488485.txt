I actually find the machine learning the LEAST interesting thing about a data science career in the sense that it&#x27;s just another tool in your DS toolbox to solve open-ended problems that no one has properly tackled before. It sits in the same box as bar charts, web scraping, asking better questions etc. and you can do valuable work with a variety of approaches, not all of them machine learning. Not sure exactly what part of data science you feel you don&#x27;t enjoy, and it sounds like you DO enjoy a variety of technical disciplines, but I was just curious whether you wholly equate data science with machine learning.')
