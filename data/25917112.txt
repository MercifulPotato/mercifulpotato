And their &quot;bad people&quot; happen to be largely or entirely Jewish while going along with every lie told to their ignorant peasant ancestors by their aristocracy taken as gospel? That isn&#x27;t new at all. And it is why they all turn into hellholes when they are in charge.<p>This whole &quot;big Tech&#x27;s days are numbered&quot; is basically  QAnon for slightly smarter people with slightly less bloodlust. Assign all of the evils of the world to &quot;Big Tech&quot; and assume everything is a sign that it is going down as an article of faith. They complain both about them moderating too much and not insist there should be some kind of legal punishment.  A judge would call these complaints &quot;a very novel legal theory&quot; (read: no basis in the law and it doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it does).')
