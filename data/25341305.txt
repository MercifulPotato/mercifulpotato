I landed in Brooklyn, but always felt affinity for SF and traveled out there a lot from about 2008 onward. I&#x27;m not sure exactly when it happened, but at one point I realized SF had turned into a place I actually wasn&#x27;t excited to get to go to anymore.<p>If sf can transform back to a place where the people that are living there actually are in love with their city and not just there for a work I&#x27;d be very happy. It&#x27;s a beautiful city.')
