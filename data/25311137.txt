She was fine with the internal committee being anonymous but at this stage anyone would have demanded the same, i.e. who is the authority that thinks this paper sets a lower precedence for what google stands for i.e. some sort of human engagement and what does the authority do they take her at her word twist it and fire her by &quot;accepting her resignation&quot; what does this sound to you, for me a kind of high and might attitude by the authorities i.e. how come a black woman that too from the ethics department question our conception of the matter, let us how her what we can do Fire Her!!!.<p>This might sound a bit exaggerated but all of this is just putting google in bad light and top of that over 500 googlers have written a letter demanding an explanation for the same, those guys know about there internal workings more than you and me, so it is surprising how many review processes does google have, its just like double pressure first get the internal clearance and then work with the original reviewers of the conference.\nAnd now Jeff comes up with this explanation:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQ...</a>.<p>And for not once he mentions that the paper did already pass the internal standard review process.')
