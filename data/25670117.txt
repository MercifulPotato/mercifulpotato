I&#x27;ve never met an R application that uses it, but at my old work, we would take a dated snapshot of CRAN at the beginning of every new project. If we needed to update a package we could then &quot;update CRAN&quot; for that project. When productionising a project it would be frozen to a date in CRAN.')
