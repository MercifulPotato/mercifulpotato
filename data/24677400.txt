Most of the time you will have to construct it (or take an existing one and update it) manually. Sure there are tool that generate a dummy dataset for you but that would be just for playing a world and certainly not for a real world use&#x2F;production.<p>We are actually working on adding support for text, excel and json format in igel.<p>We already implemented some of the famous preprocessing methods in igel, which you can use by providing them in the yaml file.<p>Now about preprocessing libraries, I personally use numpy, pandas and some of sklearn functionality to preprocess data. Furthermore, I use matplotlib and seaborn for some visualisation &amp; further analysis.')
