So this new payment model just forced me to purge a bunch of crap that was never used or never actually worked. I could probably replace those two workflows too, at a push, with little effort.<p>TBH I never understood all the hype about IFTT; most of its usefulness can actually be achieved by the services themselves, once they choose to care about integration. The early focus on usability had already gone overboard years ago, when their redesign basically made it mobile-only. It always felt like a typical SV-hype-driven phenomenon, mostly based on short-lived home-automation gizmos, and I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re still around - although this sort of move might well indicate they are circling the drain.')
