It&#x27;s good to know that this still happens!<p>Out of curiosity, you mention depreciating value for fiat being a liability, which is absolutely true. That being said, doesn&#x27;t <i>appreciation</i> also create a different sort of liability?<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I buy a 1TB SSD for $60 worth of BTC on Monday, and then that same amount of BTC is worth $75 on Friday. In theory, would it be reasonable for me to feel like I&#x27;ve overpaid?<p>Of course in this scenario, I pay for rent, food, taxes etc. using fiat, so I&#x27;m exposed to the difference in conversion rates. I suppose if I lived somewhere where I could transact wholly in BTC for everything and its value wasn&#x27;t in any way tied to a fiat currency and the value of goods and services were negotiated in BTC in a way that&#x27;s entirely decoupled from market value on exchanges, this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue for me. Is this possible?')
