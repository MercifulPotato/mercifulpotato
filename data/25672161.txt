I am not a fan of Trumpists. I am just trying to balance the narrative. I explain it here as well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25368150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25368150</a><p>I am perfectly fine with media holding Trump accountable. And it should. What I am not okay with is that it is directed only at Trump and everyone else is given a free pass. This I say as an observer of US politics. Media must do its job and be objective. What you see today at the US Capitol is anger spilling out because the Right wasn&#x27;t even heard and dismissed as something dangerous. When you stifle expression it explodes in unexpected ways. Because people see how ridiculous it is that Trump was made to prove he isn&#x27;t a supporter of KKK some 35 times while Biden passed racist laws that incarcerated thousands of Black Americans and was given a free pass. Vice President Kamala Harris called Biden a racist during the primaries. Today she has happily taken up the job of being the Vice President under him. If she had an ounce of integrity in her she would have refused to work under a person she herself called a racist. In all this where was the media? No where to be seen. It just wants to milk Trump till the bitter end. Even if it leads to division, violence and destruction. The easiest way to pacify the Right is to hold the Left leaders accountable for their misdeeds too. Balance it. Then you won&#x27;t have any discontent among any base (be it the left or the right). But media thrives on sensationalism.<p>Think about it. Obama bombed a foreign nation 26000 times. 26000 times! Did any mainstream media (I am not just talking about CNN here. It includes Fox as well) rake this issue up during his tenure and make a big deal out of it. It did not. Why not? Because everyone got along. The political class, media and diplomats. Everyone were in sync. Trump was an aberration. He did not play by that rulebook. He was an outsider. What Trump has done may not be understood today but history will be kind to him. Once the dust settles and people introspect, they&#x27;ll realise how fucked up the system had gotten to that it took just 1 orange haired man to shake it all up. And please don&#x27;t think for once that I am singling out USA. My country has flaws too. Probably a lot more than USA. Just because we don&#x27;t drone other countries doesn&#x27;t mean we are perfect. But you can&#x27;t get to perfection by drowning out the voice of the people. Even if it means 75 million of them who voted for Trump. Trump was just a figurehead for the grievances that those 75 million hold. Those who voted did not vote because they believe in White Supremacy or that they are against immigration or they are fascists. Nor are people in the left communists, socialists and crazy lunatics. This sort of reductionist thinking is what is causing division and spite. In fact, if you look at the voter demographic in this election, Trump lost because he lost the vote of white voters and instead gained in minority communities: Blacks, Latinos and Asians (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;14&#x2F;joe-biden-trump-black-latino-republicans" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2020&#x2F;nov&#x2F;14&#x2F;joe-bi...</a>). Why? Why would a racist, white supremacist lose the white vote and gain the minority vote?')
