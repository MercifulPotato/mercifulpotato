I detailed my experience with it in a review of a third-party router, and found numerous issues along the way [0]. My favorite is that DMZ+ mode, which is what they offer instead of a traditional DMZ mode, just has some weird MTU issue that leads git and other services to break horribly when running behind a third party router. The solution? Don&#x27;t use DMZ+ mode. Instead, put the router into NAT mode, and then port forward all of the ports to one private IP address. Bonkers. This is sold as an official-looking solution on the AT&amp;T website for a &quot;speed issue.&quot; [1]<p>This is all because AT&amp;T believes that the edge of their network is not the PON ONT&#x2F;OLT, but rather, the router they issue you. If you want to be on their network, you have to use their router as some part of the chain.<p>My latest discovery is that in doing this, the router can actually get super hot operating at gigabit speeds for extended periods of time. When this happens, it magically starts dropping packets. Solution? Aim a fan at the router so it has &quot;thermal management.&quot;<p>Total. Garbage. I&#x27;d switch to Spectrum if they had decent upload speed, but alas, they don&#x27;t in my building.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;particle17.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;amplifi-alien-thoughts&#x2F;#appendix-at-t-fiber-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;particle17.xyz&#x2F;posts&#x2F;amplifi-alien-thoughts&#x2F;#appendi...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.att.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;article&#x2F;u-verse-high-speed-internet&#x2F;KM1322413?gsi=OekwbVJ5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.att.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;article&#x2F;u-verse-high-speed-inter...</a>')
