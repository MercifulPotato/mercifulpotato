The phones are getting a lot better all the time and I think we&#x27;ll see more watches in the next couple of years<p>There&#x27;s still a long way to go before it&#x27;s viable for the average tech-geek to go for a fully open-source setup (phone, watch, tablet, etc), so if your question is if it&#x27;s good now, then no<p>If you&#x27;re asking if this will turn into something good over time, then yes... A million times yes<p>The open-source space will most likely always come with its own set of problems and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever get an environment that has the same level of seamlessness as android or iOS.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the next 2-3 years will get us to a point where open source can get a user 80% of the way out-of-the-box, at which point I&#x27;m definitely ready to ditch android and move everything to an environment, that&#x27;s built to respect my privacy')
