Addiction and dependency are very well understood from a scientific viewpoint.<p>It&#x27;s not only “some” people that don&#x27;t overdo it. A very large percentage of the population has used marijuana and yet you don&#x27;t see most people in the conditions you described.<p>I highly doubt the root problem of your 60% of extended family is drugs (assuming we&#x27;re just talking about stuff like marijuana or psychedelics). If they feel like they need to relax all the time, maybe it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re subject to too much stress or are (maybe hereditarily) oversensitive to stressors, in which case they might need some help regardless of drug use.<p>One last thing (but the most important), psychedelics are decidedly NOT addictive (again, following scientific definitions). In addition to not causing an urge and immediately causing tolerance that lasts for weeks, they&#x27;re very well-known for <i>ending</i> decades-long addictions and all sorts of negative behaviors (including overuse of marijuana!). At high enough doses, they are nothing like a typical marijuana high. You really have to experience it to understand just how deeply and positively they can change one&#x27;s life. Ironically enough, they might be a great option for your family to try (under proper guidance) in order to get out of their situation.')
