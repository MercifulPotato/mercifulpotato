All that I have seen have been accusing Biden or his family of things that Trump and his family do much more often than the Biden&#x27;s are alleged to have done them.<p>In a rational world, that kind of attack would totally backfire.<p>But it&#x27;s pretty clear people aren&#x27;t rational. I&#x27;ve had people tell me that Trump must be trustworthy because he&#x27;s a billionaire, and had the <i>same</i> people tell me that Gates, Soros, Buffett, and Bezos cannot be trusted because they are billionaires. Huh!?')
