Your phone just won&#x27;t be supported any more.<p>Companies have argued that it violates DMCA 1201 because you could plausibly use the other app store to install pirated apps or something like that.<p>They&#x27;re trying to have it both ways, of course, so they tolerate a couple of small irrelevant stores in order to claim that there are competitors even though they still have &gt;95% of the market. But now explain why Amazon or Microsoft doesn&#x27;t make their own app store for iOS. Or just sell a mod officially supported by one of these large companies that allows any arbitrary store to be installed on one of their competitors&#x27; platforms.<p>&gt; Circumventing digital rights management to violate copyright protection is illegal, but that wouldn&#x27;t be relevant to the Parler situation.<p>It is if it&#x27;s the reason they can&#x27;t just distribute through a different app store.')
