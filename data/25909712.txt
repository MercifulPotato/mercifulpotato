I could have worked around the every-afternoon decline by carrying a number of glasses in -1.00 to -6.00 and switching among them as needed, or by wearing the ortho-k lenses, which I could tolerate with my eyes closed while I slept, but would have been intolerable while performing any normal activities. Either way, that completely negated my goal of being able to live corrective lens-free during my waking hours.<p>The other thing that really bugged me was the fact that these lenses could not correct my vision across my entire dilated pupil, and that issue also got worse as the day went on. That resulted in terrible halos around light sources in high contrast situations, such as at night when driving home from work.')
