Atlassian essentially surrendered Hipchat to Slack&#x27;s dominance (I think this was before Microsoft Teams).<p>Salesforce also has Heroku. Someone mentioned Salesforce owning Tableau. There hasn&#x27;t been much going on between Slack and Atlassian, if we could see a cohesive integration going on there&#x27;s definitely a chance they could become dominant within this ecosystem but for now it seems all so fragmented still.')
