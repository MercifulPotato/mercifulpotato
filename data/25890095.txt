It was built probably immediately after WW2. Most of the houses, if you look closely, are of identical design. (Sometimes a mirror image.) But over the years, they&#x27;ve diverged as the owners would add garages, bedrooms, expansions, etc. They&#x27;re nicely done, and it&#x27;s a charming neighborhood.')
