This seems like a topic where a political solution is called for, as there seems to be enough opinion on both sides to warrant an examination of the current laws. Certainly many people seem to feel that somehow these social media platforms now represent a type of public platform.<p>I wonder if the united States at this point is capable of that discussion? In a healthy democratic political process as applied to this issue, there probably needs to be input from both the free speech side and the societal protection side, and some compromise legal solution reached.<p>If Biden follows through on his rhetoric that seems possible, but that seems like a big if, with political power apparently firmly in Democratic hands for the next couple of years at least.')
