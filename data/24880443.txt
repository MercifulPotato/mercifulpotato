Leaving aside the fact that modern JS is ~3x slower than C++, i.e. slightly slower than C# and Go but in the same league as Java&#x2F;Haskell, not in the same league as Ruby and Python, programs like VSCode are written in JS and they have no performance issues.<p>It&#x27;s true that performance is often ignored for no good reason at all, but it&#x27;s not such a pressing concern for most applications. Very little software needs to be performant to the point that what language it&#x27;s written in even matters.')
