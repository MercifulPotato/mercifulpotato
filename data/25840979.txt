It contributes to the over-regularization that made diverse images impossible to learn. There might be some very weak value of PPL which is beneficial (probably the optimal value of the PPL regularization is not exactly <i>0</i>) but when the runs take a month or two, it&#x27;s not easy to experiment with them!<p>The dataset is actually ~3x bigger than ImageNet, FWIW.')
