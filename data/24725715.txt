A quick search suggests that these neurons fire somewhere around 10 times per second under stress, so we get about 1 million firings per second, say.<p>I build audio-oriented neural networks models with ~150 MFLOPS which can run single-threaded on all kinds of phones at about 1000Hz (ie, 1000 inferences per second, each inference using about 150k multiplies). This is single-threaded on an ARM chip.<p>Piles of caveats: fruit flies also have to maintain breathing, etc. The neurons are more complicated than an artificial neural network activation.  But they may contain a lot of vestigial crap, and an activation system which may just be a lot less efficient than silicon.<p>So, at least for little fruit flies, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s THAT far off.')
