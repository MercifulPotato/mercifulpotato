Especially on the internet, a lot of Americans pick up wonky spellings and phrases from your end of the ocean.<p>It&#x27;s just a fashion that comes and goes.  For example, back in the late 17th&#x2F;early 18th century, England went through a wave of Francophilia which altered the spellings of a number of common words.  By then, the United States was becoming more independent and because of geography wasn&#x27;t part of that craze, so some of the legacy spellings remained here.<p>In the early 20th century, American newspaper publishers pushed for simpler spellings of some words (&quot;thru&quot;), in order to save money on newspaper and ink.  They became common in the United States, but less so in other English-speaking countries.<p>Don&#x27;t let it irk you.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  Humans are messy.')
