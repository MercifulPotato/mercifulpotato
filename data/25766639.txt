Any connection to current events and big tech are coincidental only. This has been in discussion for years before today.<p>There is a guardian article that explains the context to date reasonably well. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;09&#x2F;australia-is-making-google-and-facebook-pay-for-news-what-difference-will-the-code-make" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;2020&#x2F;dec&#x2F;09&#x2F;australia-is-m...</a><p>As far as I understand it (you can read the explanatory memorandum for more plain-english explanations) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aph.gov.au&#x2F;Parliamentary_Business&#x2F;Bills_Legislation&#x2F;Bills_Search_Results&#x2F;Result?bId=r6652" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aph.gov.au&#x2F;Parliamentary_Business&#x2F;Bills_Legislat...</a> this merely sets up a process for Google (and other companies) to negotiate with media providers.<p>Google (and Facebook) are obviously strongly opposed to this (and the potential for precedents to be set around the world).

I haven&#x27;t looked into this in detail and have actively tried to ignore all the advertisements - but I am up and thought to try to explain this from my perspective.')
