It is expressed by the soundbite <i>&quot;don&#x27;t break the web&quot;</i>.  I would love for <i>typeof null</i> to not be <i>&quot;object&quot;</i>, and it seems appealing to say <i>&quot;well if JS won&#x27;t fix it, maybe TS should.&quot;</i><p>The problem is that this outcome has many negative effects including loss of trust.  Orta (a member of the TypeScript team) describes this exact scenario in his video <i>&quot;How Does the TypeScript Team Try to Avoid Negative Effects on the JS Ecosystem&quot;</i> in which he talks about TypeScript &quot;Embracing and Extending&quot; JavaScript:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qr0TnQ2mHwY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qr0TnQ2mHwY</a><p>The TS team seem to be firmly going in the direction of ECMAScript alignment and the JS + Types model, which is something the article advocates for too.  Overall this increases my trust in the technology.<p>On a related topic Bjarne Stroustrup once said <i>&quot;There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.&quot;</i>')
