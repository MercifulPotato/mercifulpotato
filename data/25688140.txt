Item(by='11thEarlOfMar', descendants=None, kids=[25688465], score=None, time=1610131235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687828, text='&gt; Tesla&#x27;s growth is almost certainly mostly predicated upon cannibalizing sales of its competitors.<p>Yes, this is a large element of the reason that Tesla&#x27;s stock price has grown quickly (though from here, who knows) while the incumbents have not.<p>A notable difference that plays into the discussion is the profitability of the business itself. Tesla should be able to achieve a ~30% gross margin. The legacy companies come in around 15%, once you expense their R&amp;D spend (it&#x27;s hard to find, I did it once. They amortize it over car sales on their P&amp;L.). A significantly higher gross margin is a significant competitive advantage, but also enables higher net earnings. In principle, P&#x2F;E is founded on &#x27;anticipated net earnings&#x27;. Clearly, buyers today (whether they are aware of it or now) are anticipating Tesla to be greatly profitable in the future.<p>In my mind, there is no rational thesis that justifies the current trading levels. Buyers today couldn&#x27;t possibly be thinking through the risk they are taking, unless they know they can hold for many years, and through stomach-churning gyrations. That said, if any NHers have a thesis that they&#x27;ve penciled out and which determines, &#x27;yes, buy TSLA at $860 (1:40PM EST 1&#x2F;8&#x2F;21)&#x27;. I&#x27;d be very interested in seeing it.')
