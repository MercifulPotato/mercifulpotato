Yes, integrating design and manufacturing was the foundation of Intel’s moat for decades, but that integration has become a straight-jacket for both sides of the business. Intel’s designs are held back by the company’s struggles in manufacturing, while its manufacturing has an incentive problem.<p>The only comparable data point says that this is a terrible idea. AMD spun out GlobalFoundries after a deep slide in their valuation, and the stock (as well as the company&#x27;s reputation) remained in the doldrums for several years after that. Chipmaking is a big business and there are many advantages to vertical integration when both sides of the company function appropriately. If you own the fabs and there is a surge in demand (as we see now at the less extreme end of the lithography spectrum), your designs get preferential treatment.<p>Intel&#x27;s problem isn&#x27;t the structure of the company, it&#x27;s the execution. Swan was not originally intended as the permanent replacement to Krzanich[0], and it&#x27;s a bit strange to draw conclusions about whether the company can steer away from the rocks when the new captain isn&#x27;t even going to take the helm until the middle of next month.<p>People are viewing Intel&#x27;s suggestion that it may use TSMC&#x27;s fabs for some products as a negative for Intel, but I just see it as a way to exert pressure on AMD&#x27;s gross margin by putting some market demand pressure on the extreme end of the lithography spectrum (despite sustained demand in TSMC&#x27;s HPC segment, TSMC&#x27;s 7nm+ and 5nm are not the main driver of current semiconductor shortages).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2019-01-31-intel-gives-interim-ceo-robert-swan-the-full-time-job.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2019-01-31-intel-gives-interim-ceo-...</a>')
