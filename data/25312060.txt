They are often seen as opposition to Gender&#x2F;Racial justice movements. People who bring up these issues are often labeled fragile or racist.<p>In my opinion, this leads to division and contempt&#x2F;hatred for the other group. I live in a super progressive US state, and the university near me got a lot of backlash for hosting White affinity groups.')
