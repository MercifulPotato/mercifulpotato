That said, as with so many other controversial topics, keeping things legal is ultimately better as it provides opportunities for oversight and regulation. Things being legal don&#x27;t make them okay though, I am in favor of legalizing prostitution but I also believe it should not exist in the first place.<p>Kristof&#x27;s piece is a classic &quot;moral panic&quot; article. It could have been written basically at any time in the last 100 years (at least). What is different this time is that the focus is on a modern delivery medium, the internet.

I remember being a kid and seeing headlines in the newspaper about &quot;internet pedophile porn web rings&quot; being taken in by the police, that was in the 1990s.<p>As for the motivations behind the people pushing the narrative, they&#x27;re diverse.
