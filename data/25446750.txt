Do you think it would be too late to change the name to &quot;Rock Linux&quot; or &quot;Rock Solid Linux&quot;?<p>Since branding is so important this really seems like something that should go through focus groups or crowd sources somehow? Maybe a poll on hacker news? Unfortunately, I really think changing the name would be critical to the success of the project. Imagine you are a technical lead and you have to convince your boss to switch from RHEL to Rocky Linux...<p>Edit: I know the name is in tribute to Rocky McGaugh, but I still think &quot;Rock Solid Linux&quot;  &quot;named in tribute to CentOs co-founder Rocky McGaugh&quot; would make the project more successful')
