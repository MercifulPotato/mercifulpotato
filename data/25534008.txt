But, I don&#x27;t agree with the parent comment that it is &quot;the ultimate and most powerful interviewing technique&quot;. Scheduling by preference is moot if (1) you don&#x27;t have a resume&#x2F;background that lands interviews in the first place and (2) you don&#x27;t have the chops to be successful in technical rounds.')
