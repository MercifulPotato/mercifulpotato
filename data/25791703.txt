When you start talking and hearing it like that it makes it more humane, it can be treated to be kind of xenophobic to say &quot;homeless&quot; about such individual.<p>Similar thing can be applied to people who are generally said to be &quot;disabled&quot; and there are good causes advocating for saying &quot;people with disabilites&quot; to shift the perspective we look them.')
