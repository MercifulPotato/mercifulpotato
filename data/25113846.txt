Can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve even touched the thermostat.<p>It shuts down when I leave home, it heats up when I&#x27;m on my way home. When it&#x27;s a sunny day it let&#x27;s the sun heat up the house in stead of using the heating.<p>It&#x27;s almost recouped it&#x27;s costs in the first year by just gas savings (as opposed to my time based thermostat).')
