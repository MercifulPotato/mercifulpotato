As I said I like Nomad and in fact I&#x27;d probably prefer to use Nomad if Kubernetes hadn&#x27;t become kind of an industry standard. When people are free to choose they should by all means use Nomad :)<p>That said Kubernetes is also simple with stateless workloads or host local storage. It becomes complex when you are using some kind of cluster managed storage and I guess there will be demand for it on Nomad (when you are lucky) and there will be no way around that complexity.<p>Eventually there will also be things like Nomad Operators and such to handle the increasing complexity :)<p>Anyway keep up the good work!')
