Papers built around a novel technique get a lot of citations because they engender new attempts to problems that were difficult to solve before the technique existed.<p>And when everybody is suddenly exploring a new technique, testing the boundaries of what the technique can do is very interesting, making negative results significantly more publishable than normal. Lots of people know that $OLD_TECHNIQUE can&#x27;t solve $PROBLEM_FOO, but the fact that $NEW_TECHNIQUE can&#x27;t solve it says something quite interesting about the capabilities of the technique.')
