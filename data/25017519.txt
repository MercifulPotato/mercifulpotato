Look at viewership of major media properties declining until around 2016. Opinion pieces, designed to induce rage-clicks, are vastly more cost effective than actual journalism or just reporting the facts. Plus, for the average viewer, it&#x27;s just plain fun to read your &quot;team&#x27;s&quot; spin on the facts. I&#x27;m sure the typical response to this is that &quot;the media has always been like this&quot;, but I certainly haven&#x27;t seen a situation quite this extreme in a while.<p>If you spent all of your time in a bubble reading these opinion pieces from a select group of sources and news aggregators that presumably aggregate the news that is most likely to generate ad impressions&#x2F;clicks (Reddit, Google News seems to push highly inflammatory opinion pieces), sure, I can see how you&#x27;d think Trump is some sort of fascist dictator hellbent on destroying the world. The average political junky isn&#x27;t going to spend brainpower trying to understand the diametrically opposed.<p>To be clear though, most level headed individuals don&#x27;t actually believe Trump is a fascist. That&#x27;s an extremist view (and obviously insulting to anyone who has lived under fascism) that&#x27;s just used to sow discord and get a reaction.')
