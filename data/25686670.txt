I see a lot images of people wandering around inside the building taking selfies and acting like tourists (albiet often poorly-behaved ones going places they shouldn&#x27;t). In hindsight the evacuation was probably overkill but I acknowledge it was probably the best reaction to a clear and present danger.<p>Like I say, it would be difficult to file under terrorism. You&#x27;re welcome to try.')
