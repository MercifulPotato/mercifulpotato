When he compared the bytes values, they were the same (around 629,145,600 bytes) and that settled it.<p>To be fair: It make sense to measure RAM in MiB, because it is addressed by binary address lines so you always end up with a power of two.<p>Files are, however, as big as somebody decided to write into them (modulo some rounding to the next sector, depending on file system implementation details). It does not make much sense to measure them in MiB. Quite often it just more confusing to calculate file sizes in MiB instead of MB. I dont even know why Microsoft stated that MiB business.<p>Similar with hard disks by the way. They contain as many sectors as the manufacturer was able to put on them. There is no power of two involved.')
