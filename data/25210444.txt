You can&#x27;t push a large percentage of your population into delusion without some very destructive consequences. Even if it does mean you keep your Senate seat.<p>I would argue that, for the individuals in question, the long-term consequences literally have no meaning, do not matter, and absolutely are not part of the calculus.<p>If I get power during my life, and secure my legacy as an important, and very wealthy person, my children can buy away any problem that may pop up for them.<p>Therefore, my actions of destruction today do not matter, as long as I am the one in power.<p>This is why I believe it is only going to keep getting worse; if the incentive is to stay in power, at all costs, we&#x27;re in for a wild ride.')
