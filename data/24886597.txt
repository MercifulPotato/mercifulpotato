You can&#x27;t find any George Orwell books in Gutenberg, because his books are not in the public domain in the United States just yet.<p>Australian law says life + 50 years for authors that died before 1955. That&#x27;d make Orwell&#x27;s work in the public domain since 2001 in Australia, and in the US starting from next year (died in 1950 + 70 years). For convenience copyright for those that died 70 years ago expires on January 1st next year, not <i>exactly</i> 70 years ago, so the author that died on January 2nd 1950 an author that died on December 31st 1950 enter the public domain at the same time: January 1st, 2021.')
