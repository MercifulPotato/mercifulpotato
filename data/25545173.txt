It’s a story, an epic,\na support ticket, a bug, an engineering design, a unit of estimation and work allocation, a source\ncode commit tracking number and much more.<p>This overloading is painful.<p>Competing with JIRA is hard though as companies have it and it’s embedded and it is good enough.<p>Something more engineering centric would make me switch but maybe not my boss or the team would be convinced to do a migration with other more pressing concerns.<p>A more elegant tool that drives JIRA in the background as a kind of no sql DB might be a way forward.')
