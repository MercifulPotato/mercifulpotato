Nearly 100 years ago, it was unthinkable to loan out money for that long (2 world wars fit into a 30 year window).<p>House prices are high because interest rates globally are low and the borrowing period is far into the future. I&#x27;m unsure what kind of market force is required to change this and I really hope we don&#x27;t see 40 or 50 year loans.')
