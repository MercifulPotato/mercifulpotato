The &quot;bankers&quot; you refer to, for instance, don&#x27;t personally own the money they disperse but are middle-men for it and consequently don&#x27;t usually own the risk. Elon, on the other hand, invested $100 million of his own money into SpaceX in the beginning of the company, way before he was a billionaire. AFAIK that was most of what he got out of PayPal.<p>That is the root meaning of risk - if things didn&#x27;t pan out, he would have been (financially) ruined. Engineers would go ahead and get another job from somewhere else. If you can&#x27;t see the difference here, I can&#x27;t help you further.')
