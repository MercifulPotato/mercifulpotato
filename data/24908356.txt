The sample return container could be filled to the brim with pure osmium or iridium and would make it through the atmosphere just fine.<p>The scientists are mostly worried because they want as much of the sample as they can possibly get, and they&#x27;re a little worried about closing the sample container - if there&#x27;s a rock that gets stuck somewhere, the container might not seal shut and then they&#x27;ve got a real bad problem they&#x27;ve gotta contend with.<p>It&#x27;s 2020, they don&#x27;t want to jinx it, just shut it up in the container and wait for the time capsule to arrive in 2023.')
