The original claim is &quot;Companies should not raise capital.&quot; Any time you see a &quot;should&quot; claim, try adding this to the end: &quot;, and should instead do <i>X</i>.&quot;<p>Now, when evaluating the pros and cons of the &quot;should not&quot; half, you have an actual relevant benchmark to compare to. It doesn&#x27;t matter how awful an idea it is to raise capital in some absolute terms. What actually matters is whether it&#x27;s worse than what you&#x27;d have to do <i>instead.</i><p>Almost all decisions are about choosing one from several options, so if you find yourself making an absolute evaluation, that&#x27;s a sort of &quot;decision smell&quot; that you should instead be doing a comparative analysis.')
