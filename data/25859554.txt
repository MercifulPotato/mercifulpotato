This distance is approximately the distance of Puerto Rico to the shores of Newfoundland [1]. The loudest animal goes to Sperm Whale with 230 underwater dB, and it&#x27;s louder than the sound of jet engine at take-off. According to experts, whale&#x27;s consciousness and sense of self is based on sound, not sight.<p>They communicate using sound types namely repeated songs (each song quantum duration of 15-20 seconds) and D calls (down-swept short pulse) [2].<p>I think that the longer repeated songs are for communication while the short D calls are for echo-location for determining sea depth, icebergs, islands and troupe of shrimps (their staple foods). The latter is similar to the mechanism being used by bats or blind human [3].<p>[1]<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;science&#x2F;nature&#x2F;4297531.stm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;science&#x2F;nature&#x2F;4297531.stm</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dosits.org&#x2F;galleries&#x2F;audio-gallery&#x2F;marine-mammals&#x2F;baleen-whales&#x2F;blue-whale&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dosits.org&#x2F;galleries&#x2F;audio-gallery&#x2F;marine-mammals&#x2F;ba...</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lAtVOK04XvA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=lAtVOK04XvA</a>')
