Tethering was usually not allowed but you could buy in. You get phones for free, but only if you pay 40â‚¬+ a month for the next 2 years for something you actually don&#x27;t need. E.g. some unlimited services (streaming) while your general data is capped.<p>I haven&#x27;t been in the market for such contracts for quite a few years, this has changed a lot in recent times due to &quot;contract-less&quot; cheap providers gobbling up the marketshare. And these packages always disappeared over time and became standard. I don&#x27;t think tethering is not allowed anywhere anymore.')
