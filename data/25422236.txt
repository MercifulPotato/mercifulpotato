During that same period, the independent, third-party Internet Watch Foundation reported 118 incidents on Pornhub.<p>Organizations like the IWF rely on reports, whether self-reported or not. Most people report CSAM on the website they&#x27;re visiting instead of going to a third party (at least I do unless nothing is being done about it). Therefore it&#x27;s not a surprise that the IWF only reported 118 incidents on Pornhub. It would be interesting to know how many instances Pornhub self-reported during the same time period since a high number is actually a good thing. I&#x27;d imagine that a sizeable chunk of the Facebook reports were quickly taken down due to being recognized by CSAM detection algorithms.')
