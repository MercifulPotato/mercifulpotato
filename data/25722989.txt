With handover at least China made the committee which selected the chief executive. So not sure which is more democratic an appointed head by UK or a person elected by people from various sections of society (although it&#x27;s flawed as most or rich and has allegiance to China, but it&#x27;s still better than what UK had in Hong Kong).')
