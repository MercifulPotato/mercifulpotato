For most of the world any dev is a genius. For devs, john carmack is a genius. For EE Shannon is a genius. For academics Galois&#x2F;Gauss&#x2F;Grothendieck are geniuses.<p>True genius as in having a burst of epiphany, an indescribable out of control impulse leading an eureka might not even be tied to a person..<p>It&#x27;s something that I wonder often about because as a kid I had a few eureka moments and this was a rare bliss.
