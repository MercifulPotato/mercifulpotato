We don&#x27;t even know if sharing it will be mandatory. If it were mandatory, I find it a little unlikely that it&#x27;ll be treated massively differently than the existing COVID test data that is shared from current test sites such that DHS will start labeling people as terrorists for testing positive or that law enforcement will start kicking down people&#x27;s doors if their test doesn&#x27;t report back (I mean, imagine if the WiFi went out, or they ran out of data on their data plan?). Given how the lockdowns have been policed on private citizens — that is to say, extremely lightly if at all — I find it a bit far-fetched that at-home COVID tests are what will push us over the brink into fascist dystopia.')
