Those are important to understand for optimization even if they&#x27;re not directly visible.<p>Also discussing MSRs but not special information tables like the page table and VMCS is a somewhat odd distinction.  While they&#x27;re probably stored differently, they are somewhat similar in how they are used.<p>Also, isn&#x27;t the TLB like a kind of set of registers?  The TLB entries are very frequently accessed.  How about store buffers and the like?')
