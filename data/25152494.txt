If Arecibo has not been getting enough money to maintain it, and if there is no plan for new telescope in its budget, it’s not because of “budget cuts”, but rather because of spending decisions.<p>I do believe that we are getting less than we used to for the spend, but it’s clear that it’s not budget <i>cuts</i> that are responsible: rather, it’s the productivity of science is falling, and so is efficiency of the government, despite growing expenditures.')
