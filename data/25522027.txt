The article directly addresses the “isn’t PFOF common practice” and “maybe PFOF was beneficial to the customer” arguments and provides fairly detailed evidence that RH did this at a different scale and with more significant detrimental effects on its customers than common practice.<p>Maybe you’ve read both and you disagree with the evidence presented. That’s ok by me: but it would be more efficient for you to state your arguments for why this case didn’t harm customers, rather than asking me to (poorly) litigate the SEC’s case. My only point here is a simple one: that opaque pricing schemes seem like a recipe for anti-competitive behavior.')
