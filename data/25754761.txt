It requires sideloading an .apk (literally &quot;install an app from a file&quot;) and jumping through a couple hoops (basically: changing your security settings to allow installing apps from a file) to get started, but it&#x27;s not an insurmountable barrier.<p>Apple is of course a totally different story, as their devices are 100% locked down walled gardens where Apple is the sole arbiter of what software you&#x27;re allowed to install.  It continues to astound me that a substantial number of HN users see absolutely nothing wrong with this.')
