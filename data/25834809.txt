Can you find it?<p>&gt;Definitely an abuse of power by Amazon<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re saying.<p>&gt;people were scared of using proprietary code without knowing...I&#x27;m not surprised they missed some as it was really hard to tell.<p>Amazon is a trillion dollar company that has every capability of doing their due diligence.  Sloppy communication, abuse of trademarks and stealing proprietary code are all inexcusable behaviors by a company with the size and power that Amazon has.<p>You&#x27;re describing the problem as if it were the excuse.  Amazon abused their power, stole proprietary code, abused a trademark, and violated the culture of the open source community whose code they were leveraging for profit.  There&#x27;s no excuse for it, even if it was somehow legal - and I don&#x27;t suspect it was.  I suspect that Amazon knows it&#x27;s not legal - they just figure they can get away with it.')
