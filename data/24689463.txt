Its one of those things where seemingly it&#x27;s no one&#x27;s responsibility to remove it, so there it will remain until they rust into dust or someone plows over one with their car.<p>LA is stuck in a bit of a time portal, though. Local mom and pop shops reign supreme still, especially ethnic stores, and there are even payphones still in frequent use by bus stops.')
