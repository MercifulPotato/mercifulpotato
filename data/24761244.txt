Life, by its very nature, capitalizes on improbability. It cheers when the bouncy ball miraculously ends up somewhere no one expected and had an effectively zero probability of going there. It cheers when  someone beats all odds. It cusses when the technology doesn’t work when it’s needed but worked every moment until that point. It sells when a stock unexpectedly goes high.<p>2. It ignores the fact that life is made up of individuals and some of those individuals will be sentimental. They will fight to the death to keep their night sky and keep things the same. To require the energy of the star is to have either a massive population or some tech (like an Alcubierre drive) that needs it. But if it’s population, then a very large percentage will probably fight very hard to forgo a Dyson swarm&#x2F;sphere.<p>For that reason alone, we should be utterly terrified to find one, because to build one requires not only tech, but a culture that doesn’t value sentiment and&#x2F;or FTL tech. Also for that reason, I expect 99% of civilizations to never build one.<p>I could be completely wrong. Probably am. But that’s my 2¢ and thank you for your comment. It was my favorite.')
