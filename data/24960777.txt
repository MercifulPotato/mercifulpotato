What kind of &quot;intelligence&quot; does one put in the code to download from a <i>future unknown</i> http source?<p>One could try to be clever and embed a &quot;intelligent algorithm&quot; inside youtube-dl to scan the Google SERs[0] for the latest host source but that&#x27;s not foolproof.  Google may also later block results with the all-too-common censorship message <i>&quot;In response to multiple complaints we received under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we have removed 6 results from this page.&quot;</i><p>Would youtubel-dl scan a well-known Twitter account or SMTP mailing list server to find the latest version?  (My previous comment exploring that[0])<p>Storing binary blobs in popular blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum would be near impossible because of technical and architectural limits. (E.g. youtube-dl binary is about 1.7MB and thus miners will reject your non-standard transaction.)<p>I&#x27;m unaware of a foolproof way to share future versions aka future sources that can be programmed into deterministic code.  Discovery will have to involve <i>humans</i> coordinating in some way.  E.g. PirateBay moves from host to host but <i>humans</i> (not code) spread the new location.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=youtube-dl+latest+download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=youtube-dl+latest+download</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24930317" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24930317</a>')
