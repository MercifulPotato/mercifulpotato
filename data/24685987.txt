Item(by='murrayhenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601890148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679952, text='Without these funds the infrastructure would either be poor or non-existent, making it expensive or unrealistic to move goods and people around within a country like Poland.<p>When I emigrated to Poland in 2005 (from the US) driving between Krakow and Gdynia at never more than 15% over the speed limit of 90 km&#x2F;h (the average speed everyone else is travelling at) (but often under 90 km&#x2F;h due to many lorries on the road, tractors, accidents, people in elderly Fiats, elderly people in Peugeots&#x2F;Fiats&#x2F;Polonez&#x2F;etc) with three 15 minute stops the driving time was about 10.5 to 11 hours.  Now it&#x27;s about 7 to 7.5 hours (two stops, not three, and usually driving right at the speed limit).<p>The change is because of the introduction of the proper A1 motorway.  Two lanes each direction and, most places, rated for 140 km&#x2F;h.<p>I should note that the &quot;proper&quot; A1 isn&#x27;t yet complete.  There&#x27;s no A-class motorway between Krakow and Czestochowa though it&#x27;s being built and should be complete in a few years.<p>Maintenance on the thousands of kilometers of motorways (and highways and smaller roads) will undoubtedly be a significant expense in the future.  But those roads allow for a staggering quantity of goods (and people) to be moved about quickly, safely, and inexpensively (even accounting for tolls).  I doubt that our current government is setting aside money for maintenance for all of that but the potential incompetence of today&#x27;s government shouldn&#x27;t be a reason not to do something that will have ripple effects for decades.')
