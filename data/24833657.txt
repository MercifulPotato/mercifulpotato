Perhaps you grew up elsewhere and there is a language barrier. I&#x27;m not sure how else to explain it.<p>This thread is filled with folks freely pointing out areas in which Commodore&#x27;s offerings were superior, that the Apple II line clearly stagnated for a decade before culminating in the intentionally crippled IIgs. I don&#x27;t see people even remotely promoting &quot;hagiorgraphy&quot;, just folks (besides you) attempting to have a nuanced discussion.<p>Not to mention my vested interest in Commodore&#x2F;MOS since I grew up just a few miles from MOS&#x27; HQ and have even visited the building. So to suggest I am locked into a US&#x2F;Apple-only view of personal computers in the 80s is absolutely absurd. Good day and good bye. I certainly hope the rest of your HN interactions are not like this.')
