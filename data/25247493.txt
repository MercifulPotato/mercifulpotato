It&#x27;s just a clever rhetorical ploy to promote some viewpoints and disqualify others. Specifically, it&#x27;s a species of bullshit[1]. If the actual facts support the bullshitter all the better, but if they don&#x27;t you can rest assured the &quot;fact check&quot; will be &quot;contextualized&quot; to whatever extent is needed to serve the bullshitters&#x27; rhetorical ends.<p>[1] Bullshit defined here as speech intended to persuade without regard for veracity. The liar knows the truth and conceals it, but the bullshitter doesn&#x27;t care if his statements are true so long as his bullshit is persuasive. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;385.On_Bullshit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;385.On_Bullshit</a>')
