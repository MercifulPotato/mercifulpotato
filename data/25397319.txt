Apparently there&#x27;s some online market where players can be bought and sold. The theory is that EA makes players lose, so they feel more incentives to spend money to buy stronger players.<p>I saw the video, but I have to say I am not wholly convinced of their argument. For example 1 of the &quot;scripting examples&quot; show a ball going through a goalkeepers&#x27; hands. In my opinion the game could have already decided that the player would shoot inside the goal (partially using RNG) and perhaps the rendering messed up a bit when the goalkeeper was jumping towards the ball. I am not sure if this is solid proof of so-called &quot;scripting&quot;. Other examples can&#x27;t really convince me either.')
