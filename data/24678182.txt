I prefer my personal life to have a good buffer from my work life (thus I speak about it as little as possible) and same for my co-workers personal lives.<p>I&#x27;ve seen these kinds of &#x27;calls&#x2F;meetings&#x27; to improve relationships in the work place, but whenever I talk off the record with folks (usually over drinks) most of them hate it and just go with it not to raise waves.')
