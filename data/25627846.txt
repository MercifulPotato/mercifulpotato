I do know of problems. they are everywhere, from capitalization and grammar issues to dropping problems and frustrating peeps.<p>Thank you for setting this in a way that is understandable for next steps.<p>I already solved someone&#x27;s problem- Open Source Blender made it impossible to key groups (containers) and so I programmed a workaround for someone as a $15 bet that I could, and made a GUI for it - he used it and thanked me, but it was kinda lame doing it for 15 bucks - I don&#x27;t know how to ask for gobs of money.<p>I also setup someone&#x27;s server (minecraft , gitea, docker compose, etc) for  $30&#x2F;hr - because I didn&#x27;t think he could pay full rate ($66&#x2F;hr) I got a few hundred on that.<p>I saw what FAANG&#x27;s employee&#x27;s make and it&#x27;s ridiculous - 1.2 million after 9 years ? I want to drink from that firehose, but depending on a FAANG for an amount like that seems like a massively corruptible dependency - similar to how Google is being charged for Sherman monopoly practices.<p>The world as I see it is kinda acting dumb. I cannot fix all the problems I see, only the ones that directly matter to me and are within my scope to fix. I can point them out and document for other people to notice. And yeah, if my outlook is skewed due to context, correction&#x2F;more context is welcomed. Thanks for caring about my issue, and providing context on a twitter that has, what appears on first glance to have good business advice - I wish it was in markdown on github so it would be easier to reference.')
