Often people who have problems get lost, in madness, in violence, in drugs.  Stop blaming madness, violence and drugs.<p>The people who have problems need help from their community, quite often.  It seems (from the outside) that in the USA community is being deprecated.<p>Most people who use drugs have fun.  They do not come to any harm, so long as they do not get busted by police, or beaten by the crooks that sell the drugs.<p>Time to get the law out of it.  Time to start being kind to each other.  People with problems do not need to be punished, usually that does not help.<p>Legalising drugs will lead, probably, to better drugs.  Powdered injectable heroin came about because it is the best way to market such a illegal product.  In the nineteenth century opium was mostly used in tinctures.<p>In South America cocaine was traditionally used completely differently chewed with lime (?)<p>Prohibition has been a catastrophe for the victims and good on you Oregon for looking for a way out.')
