The problem is, do the workers know what they are supposed to expect in terms of safety? Are their parents able to guide them in various ways? I don&#x27;t have a problem with 13-yo school students working paid internships on software for example, assuming that their parents and schools are in on it on the student&#x27;s side. What conditions are these child laborers working in and how much of a role do their parents take in tracking what the workplace is like? Financially stressed families seem to sometimes get overburdened with the hustle and in such cases start to miss this stuff.
