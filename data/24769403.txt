Fiscal policy is money printing, not monetary policy. This is very much not what is colloquially known as money printing, rather it&#x27;s the basis of modern money theory.<p>Monetary policy is just swapping one kind of USD denominated assets for another. It doesn&#x27;t really change the size of private bank balance sheets, hence it is not the printing of money. But increasing the size of the deficit does indeed increase the sizes of private bank balance sheets.')
