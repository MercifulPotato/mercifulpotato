Think of it like Pocket &#x2F; Instapaper but with the ability to share your collection of bookmarks with password protection for individual collections. One of the reasons for this website is to replace GitHub&#x27;s &quot;awesome-something&quot; repos. Instead of having a GitHub repo which requires Git abilities (it is trivial to tech workers to use command line but not to others), I provide a simple interface for them to share bookmarks.<p>One of the use cases is for course resources - the professor can simple provide a link to a collection and update course readings &#x2F; other resources there, and students will be able to access the most updated information. (The anonymous part is actually inspired by sharing of protest resources)<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;axomark.herokuapp.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;axomark.herokuapp.com</a>')
