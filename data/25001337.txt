The amount levied will increase in 0.1% brackets proportionally to the pay ratio. A company whose highest paid employee earns 200 times more than its median San Francisco worker will get a extra 0.2% charge on its gross receipts. For companies whose CEO makes 300 more, the charge jumps to 0.3% and son on. The tax caps at 0.6%, and only companies with gross receipts over $1.17 million will be targeted.<p>&gt; Under the measure, gross receipts and CEO compensation will include money made from stock options, bonuses, tax refunds, and property, a caveat seen by many as a way to target the tech sector where CEOs are often compensated in non-salaried bonuses. Tech is expected to account for 17% of the tax revenues, according to an estimate by the city’s chief economist, while retail and financial firms are expected to account for 23% of the revenues each.<p>&gt; The CEO tax is expected to generate between $60 million to $140 million per year.<p>Doesn&#x27;t seem that big in comparison to what SF annual budget is.<p>From (because the article doesn&#x27;t give exact figures on transfer taxes): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfcontroller.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Economic%20Analysis&#x2F;200654_economic%20impact_final.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfcontroller.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;Econo...</a> ?<p>&gt; Proposed legislation would raise the Transfer Tax rate on properties in\nthe city that sell for more than $10 million.
