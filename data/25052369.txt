Any JetDirect-enabled HP printer requires no local process&#x2F;service on your workstations or other devices. You just throw PS&#x2F;PCL at port 9100, or maybe IPP at 631, and install a reasonably-recent PPD for your printer&#x27;s model line (this is the point of installing hplip from your distro). There isn&#x27;t a driver per-se as the OS is responsible for creating the postscript and&#x2F;or PCL from your document, just as it would for making a PDF. If you can&#x27;t install a PPD you can just manually set the capabilities (duplex, highest PS version, resolution, tray sizes) in the native print UI, like for a mobile device')
