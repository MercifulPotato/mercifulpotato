Essentially, I think you need to be able to have a strong engineering culture that takes the time to actually optimize things as the scale&#x2F;scope changes.<p>As a not quite accurate example, think JS vs C++, there&#x27;s no way you can hammer a bunch of C++ to get something working without not shooting yourself in the foot multiple times, so you have, to a certain extent, to properly develop it from the start. Whereas with JS, you can probably get something working quickly and prove your point.  And it&#x27;s very easy for this shitty JS solution to end up in production because it just works.<p>You can write very good JS code if you have the engineering culture for understanding it&#x27;s importance, while with C++ it will be somewhat good from the start because it has to be.\nI think here is the same thing, for example what has been mentioned here, VSCode vs Slack.')
