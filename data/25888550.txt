It has almost 30 plugins for the most stupid thing (like scrolling text). So the first thing I did was updating it. Unfortunately it looked messed up afterwards. So I rolled back the backup and started updating it one by one. I was left with one plugin which I could not remove or it would break down parts of the design. So I&#x27;m again left with an possible problem for the future.<p>The joke is: the page is mostly static. There is one single news section which has not been used for more than a year...I hate this thing...I wish I could give it to somebody to rebuild in plain HTML or something but the boss doesn&#x27;t want it...')
