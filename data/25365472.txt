Item(by='panda-giddiness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607549710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25364365, text='&gt;  I&#x27;m almost a free speech absolutist, but I also really hate all the crazy, conspiratorial thinking that is so common these days. It puts me odds with myself. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m sad when crazy and dangerous ideas are removed from the internet. However, I think it&#x27;s clear to see how this could be abused. A system where the &quot;right&quot; ideas are allowed depends on the people in charge having the &quot;right&quot; ideas.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not a free speech absolutist (obviously) because I don&#x27;t trust other people to behave reasonably. But if everyone were perfectly rational, I probably would be; and maybe you and I are rational enough that we can handle &quot;dangerous&quot; ideas without succumbing to emotional manipulation (but then again, maybe not). However, while perhaps we can watch a purposefully mis-informative video, evaluate the merits of those claims, and dismiss them out of hand, do you trust everyone else to do the same?<p>That isn&#x27;t to say you or I should be the arbiter of truth, but there should be some bare minimum standard. In my mind, there are two pillars for public discourse:<p>1. Facts, upon which arguments are based.<p>2. Deductive&#x2F;inductive arguments, which appeal to values.<p>Obviously different people will have different values, so they will evaluate the weight of the arguments differently; however, facts are facts -- those should be the common ground. When someone denies reality by positing conspiracies without meaningful evidence, public discourse is impossible.<p>&gt; What if instead, it&#x27;s the company which is telling the truth, but the government which is malicious, and wants to censor them?<p>If the government is malicious, the correct response is voting. Unlimited free speech won&#x27;t help: a malicious government could censor free speech; or a malicious government could promote un-truths with as much weight as truths, transforming &quot;matters of fact&quot; into &quot;matters of opinion&quot;.<p>(As an aside, I&#x27;m nearly a democracy absolutist despite my distaste for free speech absolutism. While that might seem contradictory, democracy thrives in public discourse, and unlimited free speech can hamper that: think Citizen&#x27;s United, where money can give someone an outsized influence; or conspiracies, which deny facts.)')
