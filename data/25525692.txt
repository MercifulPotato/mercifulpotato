ACLU is neutral as in pro-democracy and pro-human rights. Changing political landscapes being for or against what the ACLU stands for has nothing to do with it suddenly not being neutral. Neutral doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;in the middle of the political spectrum&quot;.<p>Today we have a president that is firmly against the core set of ideals you speak of. That doesn&#x27;t mean the ACLU should suddenly change their ideals.<p>&gt;organizations like the ACLU, FSF, and EFF are really only useful if they defend a core set of ideals rather than towing the ever-shifting partisan line<p>Which are exactly what they are doing. Trump is against those core set of ideals.')
