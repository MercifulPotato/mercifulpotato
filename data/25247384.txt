An Android subsystem would be exactly that, and more, with near native performance, a shared runtime etc. And yes, even HTML5 applications that Android supports.<p>And it would be more than just a hack. Microsoft will have all the incentives to make it run properly, since it gives them access to a whole world of non-WinOS applications that their users will become dependent on.')
