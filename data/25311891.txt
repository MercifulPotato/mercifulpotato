I don&#x27;t think this so much means that one should get rid of training these big models but rather do their best to ensure that the data centers that these models are trained on are getting their electricity from mostly 0 emission sources. This actually seems like a doable task since you don&#x27;t need to be physically near your compute cluster. I think Google and Facebook could also turn this into a PR move by putting some research money into green tech (ambiguous).')
