I can estimate pretty well. I know more or less how long the writing will take based on length. I&#x27;ll allocate more time for research if I need to do more than a base amount. And then I add some slack in case I&#x27;m struggling with something, priority interrupts happen, or I&#x27;m just not into it on some given day. (Underpromise. Overdeliver.) It only gets harder with bigger projects. It helps that I&#x27;m quite fast compared to most people so even with significantly underpromising people are usually very happy with the estimate.<p>But where it&#x27;s really hard is work that involves getting buy-in and input from a lot of different people. Those always take forever. (And at this point I pretty much know they&#x27;ll take forever, a lot of which is just latency rather than actual active work.)')
