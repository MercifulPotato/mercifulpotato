Another example is implementing recursive functions with induction -- you can implement Fibonacci naively (fib 0 = 0, fib 1 = 1, fib n = (fib n-2) + (fib n-1)) and Lean will rewrite it into an efficient (non-exponential) form.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanprover.github.io&#x2F;talks&#x2F;LeanPLDI.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;leanprover.github.io&#x2F;talks&#x2F;LeanPLDI.pdf</a>')
