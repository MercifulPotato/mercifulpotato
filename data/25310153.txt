Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607127265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308964, text='&gt; As a manager I would only do this if I really wanted to fire the person already. For employees I care about I would give them an out.<p>One of the more difficult lessons I learned as a manager: Once a team member starts giving ultimatums in order to get their way or override decisions, it&#x27;s not in your best interests to give in for the sake of keeping that employee. The obvious exception is if you realize you were actually wrong from the start, but reversing decisions for the sake of caving to someone&#x27;s demands is a problem.<p>If someone is so ready to quit that they&#x27;ll flaunt it to the company, it&#x27;s doubtful that reversing a single decision is going to suddenly make them happy again with their employer. Worse yet, it sends a message that threatening to quit is the way to get what you want from the company. Once you validate the strategy, you will get a lot more of it.<p>Unfortunately, if someone already has one foot out the door and has been complaining openly (even on Twitter, in this case) about their employer, it&#x27;s best for everyone to go their separate ways. From there, focus on identifying and fixing any underlying problems to minimize the chance of this happening again in the future.')
