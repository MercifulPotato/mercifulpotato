The main thing is that you can guarantee there will be a transition every N bits and you can guarantee that the average number of ones and zeros is the same (you can&#x27;t have a DC component in your signal due to AC coupling).<p>For example let&#x27;s assume that the block size is 4-bits, if somebody wants to send 0x0000 rather than sending this:<p>0000_0000_0000_0000<p>You&#x27;ll instead send this:<p>10000_01111_10000_01111')
