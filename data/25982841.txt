The honest majority could, as a last resort, also decide to manually fork the currency to invalidate the attacker&#x27;s coins.<p>Assuming the ⅓ number is weighted by stake, the attacker is potentially risking billions of dollars in order to carry out this short-term attack.  With that amount of money it would be cheaper to locate and destroy the major bitcoin mining farms.')
