That&#x27;s a nearly meaningless measurement. How do you even distinguish between models in that measurement? Where do you set the thresholds? The supercharged gaming laptops are absolutely going to dominate that statistics no matter what, because there&#x27;s a huge number of models, lots of which only differ mostly by cosmetic changes. The margins are likely higher, so they don&#x27;t need to sell as many of a given model to make it worthwhile to put one out. Does a laptop maker even have to actually sell a single model for it to count? How many do they have to sell for it to count? Does it make sense to count models where every part is picked from the best performing bins, so that you&#x27;re guaranteed that the model couldn&#x27;t count for more than a fraction of sales?<p>Counting by number of laptops actually sold is the <i>only</i> meaningful measurement, at least you have a decent chance of finding an objective way to measure that.<p>And I thought it was 100% obvious from Apples marketing material what they meant, so I really don&#x27;t get why anyone is confused about this.')
