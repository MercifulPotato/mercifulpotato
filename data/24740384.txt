A naive copy-by-value handling of lists will usually end up in the same order of magnitude for performance as mutate-in-place  linked lists in C.  The compiler can track those immutable values and just mutate them in place, when it can guarantee that&#x27;s a safe operation.  The vast majority of the time, you can get away with just copying a pointer or renaming, not the whole variable.<p>The caveat is that, in my experience, it&#x27;s a fair bit harder to reason about performance, as the execution model is even more abstracted away from the hardware than even something like the C model is (which is no longer a good fit either, in this era of speculative execution and multi-level caches.)')
