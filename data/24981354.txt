And while the inflation adjusted numbers have been on the decrease since the early 90s (when shuttle production ramped down) they are still a little higher than they were in the 70s.<p>I&#x27;d love to see NASA&#x27;s budget increased, but not now - it would just get funneled into dead-end pork projects like SLS. I&#x27;d much rather wait till Starship is successfully operating (New Glenn would be a plus), and it is political viable to end the SLS entirely, and redirect all that money and some into missions (both science and exploration) rather than hardware development.<p>Or to put it another way, it isn&#x27;t worth it to me to spend 1960&#x27;s era money if we are only going to get 1960&#x27;s era results. If we ever want to move on to bigger things in space, like colonization, we can&#x27;t just throw money at the problem, we need to find ways to bring the cost down first.')
