So if Grindr requires money to keep their service active, then everyone should pay the same fee (leaving aside service levels) and not be forced to give up their rights. Alternatively, Grindr could come up with a business model that allows them to offer their service for free without processing their user’s un-needed personal data; an obvious first idea would be advertising targeted at gay men, but not at any one specific user.')
