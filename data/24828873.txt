I might still use it to play something else.<p>One thing is, it seems very targeted at TTRPG curious folks that have never played before, like people who have watched Critical Role or heard of D&amp;D and are fantasy fans but have no idea what the actual play experience is. This makes sense, it&#x27;s a fast way to grow your user base. But I&#x27;d be more likely to use the product if I could search by system and request specific games. I would use it to play more niche games that fewer people are running as one shots.<p>Based on your company description it seems like you&#x27;re moving in that direction.')
