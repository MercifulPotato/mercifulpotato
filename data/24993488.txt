Obviously they&#x27;re conscious and sentient to some extent; but that does not make them human, and I will not draw false equivalency here so as to be put in the position of having to have the same moral standards for how we treat animals as we treat people. Obviously, if I was going to do that, I wouldn&#x27;t accept killing and eating them, either.<p>Herds of domesticated pigs exist because _we created them_, by domesticating and farming them over thousands of years. Evolutionarily, they owe their existence to mankind. We&#x27;re certainly not going to let them die out.<p>&gt; That animal cruelty cannot exist even in principle, any more than cruelty to sand?<p>There is a distinct difference between animal cruelty (hurting an animal for your own personal amusement) versus farming an animal in a cost effective way (which it may not enjoy). It&#x27;s a slippery slope, for sure, and I&#x27;m fine with improvements to their standard of living as long as meat remains affordable to everyone.')
