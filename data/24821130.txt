The &quot;delete&quot; opinions also make reference to other policies and guidelines relating to the discrimination of others on Wikimedia projects.<p>The &quot;keep&quot; side makes the argument that pro-same-sex-marriage userboxes would also need deleting for the same reasons, to which others reply that such userboxes are not similarly problematic because they do not express discriminatory intent. This question cannot be decided in the present discussion because such other userboxes have not been nominated for deletion here.&quot;</i>')
