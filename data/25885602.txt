In a typical day I cover several pages with text and sketches. I want a pen that works well for both.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that ballpoints have better ink properties. Quite the reverse. I believe they make more predictable marks on low-quality paper, but that&#x27;s one of only a few benefits.<p>Ballpoints tend to have large balls and produce a fat line. I like finer lines with more detail.<p>Ballpoints tend to have thick ink. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly on the page.<p>Ballpoint ink tends to accumulate on the edge of the ball, and leave periodic ink turds on the paper.<p>Ballpoints tend to require a lot of pressure to produce a line. I want to use as little pressure as possible.<p>Put another way, I want a pen that with little pressure produces a fine line that is easy to modulate (thick or thin, dark or light) and dries fast. I&#x27;ve yet to find a ball point that comes close to those properties.')
