I&#x27;m in the US and we&#x27;re just exploring the states, and especially more rural states to keep an easier social distance. It&#x27;s been really fun actually splitting time between working and national parks etc. We&#x27;ve been in Vermont for the past 2 months where we did have to quarantine which was unpleasant but I was happy to do my part. It was also really heartening to read about how safe plane travel is recently too which helps. Our goal is to aim to be one of the first back into Japan when they reopen in April so we&#x27;ll see.')
