Everything else is beholden to one of those three, nearly all of them Chrome. Making a browser engine is an unbelievably massive undertaking, and every browser that deviates from its upstream has two choices: deviate mostly cosmetically and add new features or remove unsavory features, or deviate substantially and be left thoroughly in the dust by the rapid pace of the living web. Google will make decisions that benefit them as the leading ad provider and data seller, Apple will make decisions that benefit them as a hardware and platform vendor, and Mozilla is left, regardless of their values, as the only browser vendor with decision-making power that isn&#x27;t using their browser as a means to another business goal.<p>The real problem is though as always: users don&#x27;t actually think very much about what browser they use. The vast majority of Google Chrome and Safari users don&#x27;t use those browsers because of performance or features, they use them because that&#x27;s the one they know about. Safari comes with your computer and Google pesters you to install Chrome at all times.<p>My point being: Mozilla does need to figure out a way to get people&#x27;s attention, and IMO it should involve an expression of the values people associate with them, but it needs to stand to actually draw attention towards them and those values.')
