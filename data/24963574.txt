Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604274403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962566, text='That&#x27;s _you_ and people like specifically, not &quot;you&quot; as in &quot;everybody&quot;. The 500 and 650 are totally different styles of bike, and the 600RR is no less track focussed and ergonomically compromised than the 1000RR.<p>Lots of people ride &quot;dedicated track weapons&quot; on the street. The ergonomics are focussed, sure. But so are high heels - and nobody claims they are &quot;dedicated runway footwear&quot;, people choose to wear them in spite of or even because of the challenge in wearing them - because the results are rewarding for those people.<p>I don&#x27;t wear high heels, but I&#x27;ve owned an R1, and yeah it&#x27;s uncomfortable. I also own a &quot;dedicated track weapon&quot; 125cc two stroke (a Cagiva Mito), and I ride it in traffic all the time because it&#x27;s fun. Stupidly fun - big shit eating grin type stupidly fun commuting 15 mins thru city traffic to get to work type fun. And I do dumb shit like 1,200+km trips on it as well, in spite of owning much more sensible &quot;touring bikes&quot; (a Ducati Monster and a Honda VFR800), because for _me_ - sometimes the advantages of having my stupid little race bike for the twisty bits of road on the way is _totally_ worth the pain of riding it on the &quot;boring bits of road&quot; in between. And I&#x27;m not saying this as a flexible-bodied speed freak teenager - I&#x27;m 53, somewhat overweight, and need to preload on anti inflammatories to get through a full 10-12 hour day ride on a &quot;full tuck&quot; sports bike. But I do, and for _me_ it&#x27;s worth it.<p>That $17k buys you a 2.8 second 0-60 time, and a sub 10 second 1&#x2F;4 mile time - assuming you are capable of riding those (I&#x27;ll totally admit it&#x27;s way more capable a bike than I am a rider). It&#x27;s astonishingly fast, and a bargain for a street legal toy. It&#x27;s a good half second faster over the 1&#x2F;4 mile than the fastest time for a stock Tesla or Lamborghini. Any half reliable sub 10 second street car has probably spent more than $17k in engine mods. A talented rider can run 9.8second quarters all night without voiding the warranty on a CBR1000RR...')
