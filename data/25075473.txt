Today, true value is in this whole ecosystem. And that is the point. Third party developers combined have probably contributed more man-hours&#x2F;resources than Apple alone to increase the value of this ecosystem. Why should Apple have a total control of this ecosystem when they created only a part of it?<p>This sounds like a point that would come up often in critiques of capitalism.<p>&gt; Software developers also don&#x27;t have much choice. There are two platforms that control all the market share. They have to accept the rules given to them or leave the industry (one they helped create).<p>This is very true. Microsoft tried to turn the Apple&#x2F;Google smartphone duopoly into a... triopoly? (Is that even a word?)')
