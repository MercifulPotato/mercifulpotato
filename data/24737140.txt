If I didn&#x27;t have a distributor, the merchandise was always getting hung up in customs, would disappear in the mail, would take 6 weeks to deliver, I&#x27;d get paid in dollary-doos that no bank would exchange, etc.<p>Rinse, repeat for every country.<p>Today, I ship all over the world via the internet for $0, have no stock, no scrap, no middlemen, get paid instantly, ship instantly, and the transaction cost is 1% for paypal and 3% for credit cards.<p>Still have to pay taxes, though :-)')
