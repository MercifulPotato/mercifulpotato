Apps creating their own notification bubbles is an anti feature and should be prevented if possible. They don&#x27;t show in the notification box&#x2F; on the lock screen and ignore your do not disturb setting.<p>And what if you don&#x27;t like the one the compositor comes with and want to use a different one?<p><i>Pantheon</i>, <i>XFCE</i>, <i>Mate</i> and many other systems by design run their notification daemon as a separate process that can be disabled so that the user may choose what he wishes; there are also many standalone notification daemons to fill this gap.<p>&gt; Put the toolbar inside the app window or make it a new window and let the user decide where it goes. Apps being able to draw over the screen should probably be provided as a root feature as it is pretty dangerous left exposed.<p>I mean a global toolbar at the bottom or top of the screen.<p>&gt; I just checked and gnome allows launching programs via shortcuts. An app should not be able to passively sit in the background collecting keystrokes to launch itself. This is a massive security risk<p>It&#x27;s a “security risk” of a far lesser magnitude than “an application can read and write all data owned by your user”.<p>It&#x27;s silly to remove features because processes that run with your user&#x27;s rights have the ability to fuck you up. Might we remove the <i>rm</i> utility now because it&#x27;s a security risk that it can unlink files?<p>&gt; The window manager implements wayland and is free to arrange windows however it wants as it is a trusted component.<p>And what if it not do so as the user wishes to and the user wishes to use something else to do it?<p>This is why <i>X11</i> eventually evolved the <i>EWMH</i> standard to allow the window manager and a third program to coöperate without conflict on this.<p>&gt; Basically all of the stuff in your comment is achievable via the DE&#x2F;WM. Its a good thing that programs no longer have free reign to do whatever they want and passively record the users keyboard, screen and draw over anything.<p>Everything is achievable if it be built in to the compositor including fully fledged video games and web browsers.<p>The reason we have such a thing as software is because the compositor won&#x27;t have all those things we want, and if it did for every single user, then it would be so bloated beyond belief.<p>The <i>Wayland</i> solution to missing features is “the compositor should do it”, but no compositor has all these features; that is why software exists, and that is why one often writes one&#x27;s own software.')
