Are all of the above exhausted or infeasible? If so - why?<p>Further, the network doesn&#x27;t require a city coverage for it to work. It can be added piecemeal over time. Thus, you don&#x27;t need the entire city coverage to start with - but major population dense areas to make the $20k payback in a few months. And the profits there on can be reinvested into more PoPs. Starting capital is $1.3M - its not hard to raise with a working solid business - in debt format if you don&#x27;t want to give up equity.')
