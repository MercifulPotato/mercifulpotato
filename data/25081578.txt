It&#x27;s how I (as a tech person) approach most non-tech things in life. I rent because I don&#x27;t want to deal with maintaining a house. I use public transit because I don&#x27;t want to deal with maintaining a car. And so on.<p>I may be an extreme example in some ways, but everyone only has so many fucks to give, and most people have legitimately exhausted their budget by the time they get to tech policy.')
