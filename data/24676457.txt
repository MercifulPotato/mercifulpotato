Make it primarily easy for humans to interact with but also easy for cheap scripts to parse and manipulate. Create a super-fast CLI for it which ships with the ability to read keybindings from a file. \nShip with emacs keybindings as a default but also a file with the spacemacs keybindings. Add the ability to run the CLI as a daemon that can be started from neovim.<p>Keep the format open so someone else can write some npm package for including an editor in VSCode or a webapp.')
