Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[25955936], score=None, time=1611915714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955609, text='&gt; If a stock trading app manipulates the market by preventing purchases<p>They&#x27;re likely close to hitting their collateral limits with the clearing house[0].  During yesterday&#x27;s 5-minute interview with CNN&#x27;s Chris Cuomo, RH&#x27;s CEO mentioned their collateral obligations (plus unnamed regulatory requirements) as the reason for preventing new positions in GME.  Every trade creates a collateral obligation with the clearing house for 2 days, so if RH goes bankrupt while the trades are being settled, nobody loses.  The amount of this collateral obligation is a function of the volatility of the stock.  Lots of high-volatility trades in the middle of the 2-day settlement process eat up collateral very quickly.  If RH runs out of collateral, none of their customers can trade until some of the pending trades finish clearing.<p>The reason for still allowing people to close positions is presumably because people would scream bloody murder even harder if they were suddenly unable to exit these high-volatility positions.<p>Collusion to manipulate markets, particularly in such an incredibly high-profile situation, seems unlikely.  Whatever RH does, they know there will likely be investigations, so they&#x27;re almost certainly on their best behavior right now.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951475" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25951475</a>')
