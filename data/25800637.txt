(MVP prototype).<p>They didn&#x27;t understand why anyone would design a system like that and asked if I had the choice again, would I build it the same way. Their correct answer was micro-services up the wazoo.<p>I tried to explain that startups don&#x27;t have budget or desire for massive infrastructure or are generally only interested in building a prototype to validate product market fit. Wasting money on ivory tower systems was a waste.<p>At no time did they ask if the system supported the workload or even how many users we had. Nope straight to build massively complex infra.<p>I&#x27;ve forgotten that a lot of s&#x2F;w engineers who work in the real world&#x2F;large companies, don&#x27;t have any idea some of the pg mantras we all chant.<p>Major red flag. Pass. :&#x2F;')
