The issue is that the greeting card store next door is also open, because they&#x27;ve decided they&#x27;re essential. And none of these stores (including the super market) is enforcing mask requirements because none of the others are and they don&#x27;t want to be the only one.<p>In 1000 little steps you are suddenly miles away from a real lockdown. You&#x27;re basically BAU, but the pub is shut ever other week (unless you buy a scotch egg in which case it is also essential).<p>I don&#x27;t care if people are eating gourmet olives. But we need to realise that making excuses for doing nothing is still doing nothing.')
