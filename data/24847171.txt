Lately Sweden has also become a partisan gambit, in countries all over the world, and the press is eating it up. This means that foreign press will print any criticism of Sweden form anyone.<p>Are there people in Sweden who disagrees with the approach? Yeah! Are there any other countries where everyone is in total agreement over the handling of Corona? No. The fact that someone disagrees is not news.<p>Anders Tegnell, heard of the Swedish Corona response has repeatedly admitted the mistakes that where made, so the idea that &quot;no one talks about it&quot; is patently false. This article tries to make it sound like there is a conspiracy when there isnt one.<p>At the current state its far too early to draw conclusive judgment for a variety of reasons. A long string of people has come out of the wood work, making headline grabbing statements, that are provably wrong, or unknowable. Lena Einhorn is prime example of this. She hasn&#x27;t worked in medicine for 40 years, and when she did she did not work with infectious diseases. So yes, just like I&#x27;m going to be dismissive of articles about &quot;the other side of global warming&quot; I&#x27;m going to be dismissive of this.')
