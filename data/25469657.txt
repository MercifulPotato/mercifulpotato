I&#x27;ve certainly found it helpful in some cases; for example, handling &quot;cancel&quot; events that apply to a group of states.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen huge, multi-level, multiple-parallel-region monsters that were impenetrable.<p>Now, no formalism is immune to abuse: &quot;just because you can, doesn&#x27;t mean you should&quot;.  But I&#x27;ve often found that the simpler state model formalism - without hierarchy - has led to cleaner design and better separation of logic.<p>More generally though I do think state machines are somewhat underrated tools in the programmer&#x27;s toolbox.')
