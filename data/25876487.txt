The lumber is dried after dimensioning and shrinks as it loses moisture. But we still label it by the original dimensions because lumber is priced by the board foot (which is itself a weird archaic measure) of the lumber when it was cut.<p>For comparison, sheet goods aren&#x27;t priced this way.  A 3&#x2F;4&quot; sheet of plywood really is 3&#x2F;4&quot;, because the plywood was manufactured that way and as a manufactured product there is no seasoning.<p>You&#x27;re not being ripped off because a 2x4 is actually smaller. A sawmill had a tree, and they cut off a hunk of that tree, and they charge by how much wood they cut off. The dimensions of that piece of wood changed after they cut it (which in and of itself is a service they provide - it would be a hassle if you had to buy green lumber and dry it yourself).')
