Under the plain text of 230 they are protected against publisher liability if they comply with it (and under precedent they are also protected against distributor liability.)<p>&gt; FB and Twitter have the resources to fight the lawsuits<p>No, they don&#x27;t. They are unwinnable (Was it false? Was it harmful? Was it on the platform? You lose.) FB and Twitter are just big money piñatas without 230, until they radically retool the structure of their platforms.')
