Neither of those conflations are valid.<p>Perhaps but I&#x27;m not sure it makes much of a difference. Socialism (absent central planning) doesn&#x27;t have a means of allocating capital, so no one has ever tried it for long. When they do, everything falls to the tragedy of the commons. Even authoritarian socialists agree to this. Socialist anarchists have various opinions but agree that socialist organization is an unsolved problem. No one is prevented from setting up a socialist organization in capitalist countries, its merely the case that when they do, they aren&#x27;t able to externalize their costs and they don&#x27;t achieve very much.<p>&gt; That is all forms of socialism. It&#x27;s the only thing socialism is consistently about.<p>Then all forms of what you consider to be socialism will fail because of plunder.<p>&gt; No they aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re fundamentally incompatible with the theory of a free market. They are all focused on the abolition of private property.<p>yeah, its not cool to mess with other people&#x27;s stuff. that&#x27;s the problem here.<p>&gt; Because when they get a footing they&#x27;re actively attacked by capitalists. Economically attached with sanctions, invaded, coup&#x27;d, bombed, etc.<p>Maybe if &quot;getting a footing&quot; wasn&#x27;t synonymous with expropriating the capitalists this wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>&gt; There are many reasons that ruling powers maintain that power.<p>This is true. its also the case that rulers over a mixed economy have vastly more wealth at their disposal than rulers over a command economy and a collective that has norms prohibiting the collection of rents. This is because the market generates more wealth and rulers are able to extract more wealth because there is more wealth.')
