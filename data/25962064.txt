The mechanics are the model and the only part worth paying serious attention to, and the setting&#x2F;fluff&#x2F;etc is the essentially interchangeable view. The “8 kinds” perspective is a reminder that people engage with games in a lot of different ways, many of which really live in the interaction between the model and view.')
