Your tenants are only allowed to have things in their home that came from the market you control. Things bought in the market also cannot be placed in housing you do not control.<p>You argue you don&#x27;t have a monopoly because your tenants can always move, even though most of their possessions cannot be moved to other housing.<p>Reasoning by analogy is bad, but I think it&#x27;s important to note that most people&#x27;s phones are their digital home. It is not a low friction situation to just &quot;shop elsewhere&quot; for a single product when it wouldn&#x27;t be compatible with your home.')
