This is really no fun, and possibly the reason cash is considered a bad gift.<p>I think the sweet spot for a gift is something I would enjoy but would be unlikely to buy for myself (or in the case of experiences something I normally wouldn&#x27;t do often), as you pretty much said. But a safe way to achieve this IMO is something like a gift card to a nice restaurant or a spa. Of course you still need to know your target though.<p>Kind of reminds me of the Netflix problem, the large pool of choices can make none of them seem particularly exciting.')
