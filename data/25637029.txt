Then a dictionary&#x2F;network-of-pointers make sense.<p>But generally, if you&#x27;re doing that a lot, a database also makes sense which is why I don&#x27;t like the tradeoff NetworkX made at all.<p>If you don&#x27;t add nodes often at all, but traverse from edge-to-edge a lot, a CSR representation makes sense.<p>Adjacency array representations have other tradeoffs vis-a-vis CSR representaitons and are kind of an in-between solution.')
