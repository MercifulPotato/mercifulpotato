Assuming 5 weeks off and 10 days of national holidays, that translates to 157k-225k EUR. However, Ruby is practically not used in enterprise setting, and Python is mostly usually used for specialized jobs (automated testing or data science, both of which require more knowledge than just backend Python). Out of the technologies you mentioned, Javascript seems like a surest way to high-paying contracts, you just need to get good at React or whatever else is in demand currently.')
