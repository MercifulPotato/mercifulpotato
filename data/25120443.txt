Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25120739], score=None, time=1605589574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119339, text='&gt; Take the theory of the natural numbers with the new symbol &quot;Special&quot; and the axiom &quot;there exists a number n such that Special(n) holds.&quot; In every model of that theory there will be a concrete n that is Special (say 6). However, the theory will never be able to prove that a specific n is Special, precisely because it is under-specified which n it is.<p>Hmm. So which n is special in the model that you get from the model existence theorem? Doesn&#x27;t it all get somehow equivalence-classed away?<p>&gt; No in conjunction with Godel&#x27;s completeness theorem, the incompleteness theorem would say rather that there is no theory that is strictly only the &quot;full&quot; version of arithmetic. Any theory will always be too broad and have too many models that satisfy it, only one of which is the &quot;usual&quot; model of arithmetic.<p>Sure. The point is that there&#x27;s always a gap between the theory and the model, an &quot;implementation-defined&quot; part of the model.')
