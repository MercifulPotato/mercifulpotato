Because most partnerships eventually go south, there is something known as the &quot;Shotgun Clause&quot;.  (I don&#x27;t know who named it this, but this is what I&#x27;ve always known it as.)  If your partner wants you out and comes to you with a lowball offer, you can invoke the Shotgun Clause, which gives you the right to buy him&#x2F;her out at exactly the same terms, and THEY HAVE to accept.  It&#x27;s the risk they take by making an offer.  It&#x27;s designed to get them to make a &quot;fair&quot; offer, or one that they would accept.')
