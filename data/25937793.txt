We’re taking individuals who’ve had a large impact on society and then saying that this is caused by some hidden factor called genius. We then ask if this genius is present in all of us or can it be developed. Now this obviously has a lot of limitations.<p>I doubt my own opinions on genius will have much credibility given I’m not not one. But studying geniuses it seems to me that developing an intuition for the subject is what truly sets them apart. Einstein had the impact he did because somehow he knew what areas to work on.
