Out of curiosity I did a count of all the node_modules (top level + nested). There were &gt;2000 packages installed.<p>Now I know that if I follow the rules of a textbook professional (one that takes security seriously), then I&#x27;m obliged to audit all 2000 packages. But between you and the rest of the gazing internet, I don&#x27;t do this. That&#x27;s my dirty little secret. I don&#x27;t give a shit. Gluing orphaned half-assed npm packages together and pretending everything is okay is <i>my job</i>.<p>The ironic part is how many hours we are murdering worrying about TypeScript or unit tests or integration tests and trying <i>very very very</i> hard not to notice that landfill we have placed under our massive rug.<p>There are too many technologies and not enough time to master them. Every time I dive into a popular node package I become more and more worried for the human race. We get things fundamentally wrong and it <i>lives like that</i>. <i>For decades</i>. And people come along and just obliviously use it like that and don&#x27;t question it. Take something simple, like JWT. Or nonces. Or what people believe and implement around random numbers and how random numbers work (or, often, don&#x27;t work). Bad information becomes bad code that sits around for a lifetime.')
