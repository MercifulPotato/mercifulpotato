Essentially, given enough time, quantum effects will result in an entire new universe spontaneously popping into existence. That time is ~10^(10^(10^56)).[0]<p><i>But</i>, the number of ways that all particles in the universe can be arranged is only ~10^(10^115). That number is <i>much</i> smaller than the time to just go &#x27;pop, new universe&#x27;. So, the much larger number also becomes about the time it takes to just have a new universe <i>identical to our current one</i> just go &#x27;pop, new universe&#x27;.<p>The other entries in that article are just as joyously mind-bending. I really really love that page!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timeline_of_the_far_future" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Timeline_of_the_far_future</a><p>[0] Side note: The time for a &#x27;Boltzmann Brain&#x27; (a consciousness that just floats in the infinite void thinking away, somehow) to spontaneously appear is only ~10^(10^50).<p>EDIT: Changed Fat to Far')
