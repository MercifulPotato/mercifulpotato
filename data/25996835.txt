Amphetamine does not necessary make you &quot;high&quot;, even without having ADHD.<p>Only if you&#x27;re not used to it there is this &quot;bouncing off the fucking walls&quot; effect. But it goes away if you know this effect already.<p>Than amphetamines can increase focus, and make you chill instead of hyper-active. That&#x27;s why people take it to study for example actually.<p>After a few days of continual use only the increased focus effect stays. But it doesn&#x27;t have almost any effect on one&#x27;s mood any more. Actually it can even cause a significant <i>drop</i> in mood.<p>Still it&#x27;s addictive. Like tee or coffee, which won&#x27;t make you feel full of energy any more when your addicted, it just becomes a necessity to &quot;function&quot;. You can show all physical symptoms of &quot;being sky-high on speed&quot; like pupil dilation and such, but just go to sleep for example.<p>I don&#x27;t question that the effects of stimulants like amphetamines may help overcome some medical conditions, only that I don&#x27;t think that the effects are much different in otherwise healthy individuals.')
