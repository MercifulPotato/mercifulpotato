An attorney may have a line to the beneficial owner. Or it may be to another attorney. Either way, that is protected by attorney-client privilege.<p>There is nobody logging beneficial ownership. The closest are banks, which started requiring beneficial ownership information only last year. Unbanked entities are dark.<p>Put another way, this bill is putting that “more stringent eye” on the system.')
