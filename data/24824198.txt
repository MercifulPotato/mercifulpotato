The showroom was on University Avenue in Palo Alto, so the price was high (at least $3K for a queen). But the factory was in Marin, so they could do custom sizes, and then we asked about replacing all our couch cushions, and we could special order those too. So we replaced all our mattresses and couch and chair cushions with natural latex. For covering and waterproofing, we also bought a natural wool mattress cover.<p>Sorry, I don’t remember the names of the businesses, but this was 10 years ago when the flame retardants were mandatory for synthetic materials. I don’t even know if they are still in business.<p>For chairs that had built in padding, we bought 1960s and 70s furniture from thrift stores with the hope this was before flame retardants were in use. We did all this after my partner and our female cat developed Hashimito’s, had years of low energy, and needed daily thyroid medication.')
