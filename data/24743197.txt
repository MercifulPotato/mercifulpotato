I guess the real thing I would like to know is how your job is different from product development for the public. I very much realize that it&#x27;s an open ended question and is not answerable unless you&#x27;ve had experience doing what I do.<p>That said, here are some concrete questions. Do your projects get cancelled regularly for reasons other than engineering merrit? Do you get into a mode where you have to maintain projects that are &quot;past their prime&quot;? This one might be weird, but do you feel needed, as in do you feel like your contribution matters?<p>While I am asking these I realize that my fantasy bubble is busting and that maybe project requirements and management might not be that much different in our worlds, but I&#x27;d rather hear from someone in that world.')
