I find it very hard to believe that there&#x27;s going to be some kind of mass de-platforming event that leaves Facebook a ghost town. Maybe because of changes to political content policies, but definitely not because of UI changes.<p>Snapchat has gone through a number of major, controversial redesigns. It&#x27;s definitely not going anywhere (at least among its target demographic). Facebook is far more entrenched than Snapchat; its target audience is less quick to switch platforms as well.')
