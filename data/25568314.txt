The officials’ comments in this article are downplaying what they would use this information for, which seems like gaslighting. They can’t expect us to believe that they would collect this data just for fun.<p>Personally I don’t think coercive methods to get people to undergo medical procedures like vaccination is morally acceptable. Even the vaccinations that public schools in some states require is a violation of bodily autonomy. And the suggestions that we tie freedoms of movement like visas to vaccination scares me, especially for the precedent it sets. Why draw the line with COVID-19, where the survival rate is more than 99.5%?<p>And I say this as someone who has all their vaccinations.')
