You may have billions of bacteria but if you introduce billions of different types you may not have the bacteriophages to deal with those types and your body may produce these as a defense (or not if your immune system is weak) but what happens in many cases your body may kill off beneficial bacteria and that gets replaced with a similiar but non-beneficial bacteria and because the phages changed you can&#x27;t get back.
