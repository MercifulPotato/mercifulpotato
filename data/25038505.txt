Just learn their keybindings, literally what you have to do in any code editor as each has their own, just that these two have more, and they&#x27;re quite different compared to what you might already know.<p>Note, I&#x27;ve tried out many editors over the years: Visual Studio, Notepad++, Eclipse, Netbeans, Intellij and it&#x27;s language specific clones like WebStorm and RubyMine, Sublime, Atom, VSCode, pure Vim, pure Emacs, and now finally Spacemacs. Only the last one managed to fit the bill for me perfectly, being feature rich, fast, and it stood out of my way when I needed to focus.<p>If they dissapeared over night, it might surprise you, but I would go back to Netbeans, for the same reasons, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, giving me just enough functionality and then staying out of my way when I need to do my work is what I value the most in them.<p>That being said, I acknowledge both Vim and Emacs have their quirks and baggage, but so do the others, and I preffer to deal with learning Vim movements compared to staring blankly at a screen until I remember where to click through menues.<p>My advice, use all of them, but take it seriously, dedicate x &gt; 2 months to each one you would like to try and use them intensively, learn as much about their capabilities as possible. At the end choose what works best for you. And don&#x27;t just use something because somebody else tells you (or makes fun of you because you&#x27;re not on the latest trend). You are you, not them. It might not be what I would choose but why do you, or I, care?')
