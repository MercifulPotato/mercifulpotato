In general I would say that it&#x27;s less likely (on the other hand there will always be 100% chances of the opposite, meaning that there will always be N bad citizens brainstorming about how to use &quot;the system&quot;&#x2F;&quot;any system&quot; for their own advantage).<p>&gt; <i>When the government consistently omits threats from state bodies in its risk analyses, then the public tends to overlook that danger and ...</i><p>Well, it can be true (meaning that in general people are probably more prone to accept compromises when they feel threatened), but such a general discussion is in my opinion out of context here. Monero was designed to handle transactions in a way that pushes privacy to the extremes, unluckily at the same time the same mechanism can be used as well by criminals.<p>Personally I think that &quot;currently&quot; the ones benefiting of the features offered by a cryptocurrency like Monero are mostly criminals as I don&#x27;t think that most people have a strong need for highly-private transactions (might change in the future). Monero&#x27;s other features of flexibility&#x2F;access&#x2F;etc... (to e.g. be able to trade in 3rd world countries without the need to have a bank account) are already offered by other cryptocurrencies.')
