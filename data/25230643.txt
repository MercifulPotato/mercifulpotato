Think of school teachers. It&#x27;s clearly an incredibly valuable job preparing the next generation of society, but pays a miserable wage before the intervening of unions, and still not great even with that.<p>But there&#x27;s more teachers available in the labor market compared to demand than computer programmers, so the latter command a much higher salary. Even though I would say many deliver much less value to society.<p>Or negative value like Facebook engineers. Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t resist that cheap shot, and I do believe Facebook is a net negative for society.')
