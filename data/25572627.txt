Can someone please point me to significant leaks from out of china, russia, iran on wikileaks?<p>Edit: since it appears no one can actually answer this question with an actual answer, and only down vote and troll, I think that probably means wikileaks does not make significant leaks from the military-industrial complexes of China or Russia.')
