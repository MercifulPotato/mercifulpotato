Even if we completely discount all future earnings (which assumes again Apple never earns a cent - doesn&#x27;t look plausible unless there&#x27;s total collapse of the industry). This means there would be people that would be willing to buy at that bottom price - of course, the opinions of people at which price is the bottom would differ, but it&#x27;s unlikely - again, barring full collapse of the economical system - there won&#x27;t be any.<p>With virtual coins, the bottom is literally zero. It is completely plausible that one day just nobody wants to buy $CRAPCOIN at any price. If for BTC there&#x27;s probably always be <i>some</i> market (one has to pay the ransomware and buy drugs somehow ;) for novelty coins there&#x27;s no reason to have any hard bottom, and thus no real downwards limit to &quot;capitalization&quot;.')
