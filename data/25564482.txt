I&#x27;m saying some definitely can.<p>I was not disagreeing that SOME people can move. I am saying that it isn&#x27;t blanket advice that you can give to every poor person living in a big city.<p>My main issue is that the advice to &#x27;move somewhere cheaper&#x27; is often used as a way to dismiss the seriousness of poverty, that all it takes is some personal decisions and you won&#x27;t be poor anymore. In other words, it is poor people&#x27;s fault for being poor (because they choose to live in an expensive city).<p>Yes, there are lots of techniques that many individuals can use to improve their personal situation. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that we have solved the societal issues that are leading to widespread poverty.')
