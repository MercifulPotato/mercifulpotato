I hit one of these a few years ago when I set up a code search tool at my org and the IT department wanted a reverse proxy in front of it that would do basic auth against our AD&#x2F;LDAP backend.<p>On nginx, this was going to require either recompiling the whole server to enable to some non-default module, or delegating the auth to a separate script&#x2F;process that appeared like it was going to be painful to set up, or implementing the whole thing in lua. On Apache, it was a 10 line config file and I&#x27;ve never had to think about it again.<p>(And yes, I know the article is about the ASF and not httpd, but I just wanted to respond to this comment in particular.)')
