Take it from a musician: performance ability and teaching ability are not as interconnected as you&#x27;re implying.<p>And on top of that, even a fantastic coach can&#x27;t really do much if the one being &quot;coached&quot; has no interest in learning something, or in practicing what one learned.<p>&gt; As long we live in a free-market society<p>We don&#x27;t, and arguably never have.  A free market is pretty difficult to achieve when you have existing players motivated to hold onto that wealth and prevent competitors from unseating it.<p>&gt; social mobility in and out of the upper class is extremely difficult there.<p>You think it&#x27;s significantly easier here?  Especially with wages tanking relative to cost of living for all but the upper class, I don&#x27;t see this fixing itself any time soon without one heck of a course correction.  We ain&#x27;t that far off from a European-style regulated society (and indeed, political discourse in the US seems to be pushing for it).')
