So much time was spent playing games I don&#x27;t like, doing sports that weren&#x27;t my strength.<p>When I reflect on my younger years, I&#x27;d probably had been less sullen and depressed if I allowed myself to stay in my apartments, studying, making music, and just not concerning so much about people&#x27;s invitations. I should&#x27;ve just taken the damn violin classes instead of going to tennis courts; or written my damn novel, instead of going to the party watching people drink alcohol and blow on ping-pong balls.<p>For those who enjoy parties, they were fond memories. For me, they only exacerbated my loneliness.<p>There are two realizations that came to me too late: 1). I don&#x27;t need to appease to every interests of my immediate circle to maintain friendships; it&#x27;s in fact somewhat counter-productive. 2). however niche a hobby is, there are probably enough people also doing it to give me enough society, especially in the age of internet.<p>By first asserting to myself my actual passions, and seeking friends based on that, I actually get a broader circle of friends in a more organic way.')
