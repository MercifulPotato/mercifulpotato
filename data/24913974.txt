Consciousness demonstrates quantum non-locality. The U.S government via 3 letter agencies studied psychic phenomena like remote viewing for over 30 years under various names including Project Stargate(a). and was studied at Stanford Research Institute by scientists like Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff.<p>2. Consciousness affects matter. The water crystal experiments by Masaru Emoto(b) are the simplest and least fringe example. Project love, hate, anger, etc. to water results in changes to the crystal structure of water when frozen.<p>I tried to keep it as non-fringey and simple as possible. If you consider these, it leads to the framework that consciousness is not emergent from the physical brain but is  instead a field or carrier-wave from somewhere else and brains act like antenna receivers.<p>References\na. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stargate_Project" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stargate_Project</a>\nb. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitte.co&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-curious-study-of-water-consciousness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mitte.co&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;the-curious-study-of-water-consc...</a>')
