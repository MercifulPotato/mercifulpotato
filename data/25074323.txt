I want more people to learn ML and Data Science, I just don&#x27;t want them to learn snake oil selling. I&#x27;m particularly salty because being a snake oil salesman and a shameless self-promoter seems to be a legitimate path to success. As an academic and a scientist, it bothers me that people listen to advice from such snake oil salesmen.</i>')
