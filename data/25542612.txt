I found myself in the same position after roughly two years or career.<p>Fast forward about 8 years, and I&#x27;m now happily freelancing, working with an awesome team and yet very much working alone on my code.<p>A few things:<p>1. team matters. Humanly speaking, I mean. Everyone takes shortcuts, or sees &quot;best practices&quot; differently. Find a team that is willing to build a great product together, accept a few tradeoffs, and you&#x27;ll be a lot happier at work.<p>2. Find things you like working on, but that everyone else hates. You&#x27;ll love doing it, and the team will happily leave that to you.<p>3. Don&#x27;t get emotionally involved. A job is a job, it&#x27;s only a part of your life. Work on side projects if you&#x27;d like (outside office hours and on your hardware), or take on another hobby. Who knows where it&#x27;ll lead. Some niche you enjoy, maybe?<p>Do I like my job? Well, yeah I do, very much so. Truth be told, it&#x27;s the only thing I can do for so. much. time. But yes, with 40h of the same thing each week, you&#x27;re bound to look on the other side of the fence sometimes.<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to go full alone, but find a great team and take the responsibility for something you love but everyone else hates. Bingo!<p>Oh, and a last thought in edit: old software is awesome. Think about it, it&#x27;s still here because it stood the test of time. No small feat!')
