Thinking about dress shirts like I wore when I was in a business casual office most days? I tended to rotate through my shirts every couple of weeks. And I think it would maybe be a couple of years before collars started to look a little rough around the edges and elbows were maybe starting to get a bit thin. So maybe 50 wears&#x2F;washes. 30 might be a bit low but I&#x27;m pretty sure it wasn&#x27;t 100. (Of course, they would have been <i>wearable</i> for much longer but really too ratty for the purpose.')
