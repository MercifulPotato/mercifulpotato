(learn the origins of compartmentalization for some good reading) I think looking at the history and origins of it and it&#x27;s key founding and early members offer the greatest insights into the structure learned mostly from MI6 when it was the OSS formed by a bunch of Wall Street banker-lawyer types who were pioneering the international law movement. Understanding the Dulles days in Switzerland is a great start, for example. Another technique I have used (for other topics too) is to find all the whistle-blowers and read their books and articles. Usually only a juicy tidbit or two is found in an insiders book, but when you add them up in aggregate you can form a larger picture many tend to miss. Many revealing things exist for those with the passion to seek them.<p>Be warned though, this is one of those topics that is not for the naive, or the faint of heart. When you start to understand the horror... I have seen more than I like retreat into ignorant bliss in response.
