Item(by='throwaway189262', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609929041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655898, text='Elite has 100x the content and playability of star citizen and is probably thousands of times less buggy. They&#x27;re not even comparable.<p>I downloaded star citizen out of curiosity during free fly last year and there&#x27;s virtually nothing to do. That&#x27;s if you can even get into your ship without crashing. It took me many attempts. Core gameplay loops just aren&#x27;t there. The only people having fun are those that &quot;make their own game&quot; by role playing.<p>I&#x27;ve played a good amount of Elite. I got bored eventually but there&#x27;s a ton of solid gameplay and virtually no bugs. It&#x27;s a better game than star citizen in its current state in every way I can think of.<p>The buggyness of star citizen is unforgivable. I&#x27;ve played many early access and alpha games and nothing I&#x27;ve touched is as unplayably buggy as SC has been for years.')
