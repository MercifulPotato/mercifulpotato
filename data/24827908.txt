See the EKET cabinets for example. If you reverse it by naively prying them apart, it&#x27;ll strip the wood.<p>Or take the backing to any BILLY bookshelf -- it&#x27;s held in place with ~30 tiny nails. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to pry the backing and nails off without destroying the backing in the process.<p>Etc. etc. Yes, <i>some</i> of the pieces can be disassembled, if the assembly consists <i>entirely</i> of cam locks, dowels and screws. But it&#x27;s certainly not designed for it.')
