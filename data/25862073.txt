Impulse might even be an understatement - it&#x27;s almost a need. I wonder why that is.<p>Ex:<p>- &quot;vim sucks! why don&#x27;t people use emacs instead?&quot;<p>- &quot;katy perry&#x27;s music sucks!&quot;<p>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Many liked it. Many did not - yourself included. That&#x27;s okay. Art does not evoke the same response from everyone and we should not expect it to.')
