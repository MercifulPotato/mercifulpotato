But that doesn&#x27;t mean I know their entire business strategy especially when it comes to open&#x2F;closed source software.<p>I&#x27;ve also never had any reason to try it: I don&#x27;t have any kids (so no school, etc.) and I lived most of my life too poor to afford health insurance, and I&#x27;m afraid to leave my house during the pandemic, so I still don&#x27;t have a family doctor or anything of the sort to talk with. I work from home and use Slack for everything work-related (but Telegram elsewhere because <i>that&#x27;s where the furries all hang out</i> for reasons I find wholly unsatisfying).<p>&gt; Do you usually not perform a search query before you read a paper?<p>I&#x27;m curious: What precisely do you mean by &quot;a search query&quot;?<p>My search queries are usually of the form:<p><pre><code>    site:github.com zoom encryption\n</code></pre>\nSo if I was supposed to find something more enlightening on the subject, my search habits probably weren&#x27;t conducive to discovering it.')
