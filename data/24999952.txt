Corporate litigation expenses can easily be thousands of dollars per hour. You have multiple paralegals. Multiple associates, and perhaps a partner. A case that makes it to a courtroom can exceed thousands per hour.<p>I paid a trademark attorney for some work at it was $350 for about 15 minutes of work. $10k per hour would be a stretch, but $1000 an hour? Not particularly noteworthy.')
