There are some &#x27;experiences&#x27; that are better, like piloting games since they play to the &quot;sit here and look around&quot; model, but that places VR in the same category as a really awesome flight stick, steering wheel, or the Kinect.<p>Mobility is a huge problem that needs to be solved.
