It&#x27;s like screwing in a lightbulb with a hammer.<p>&gt; And I didnâ€™t want to do the task so, consciously ignoring Mr. Weinberg, I transformed the ordeal into an optimization problem, for which I wrote an application to help me with.<p>Treating people like robots is probably the <i>worst</i> way to solve people ops problems. It&#x27;s like managers learned nothing from the failures of stack ranking, whiteboard interviews, brain teasers, and other similar &quot;optimization&quot; methods. These ill-judged solutions show a clear misunderstanding of the scope and context of the problem at hand.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s pretty <i>antithetical</i> to being a good engineer.')
