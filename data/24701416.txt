Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602012456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701191, text='Note that the glibc release mentioned there (2.32) has been released only two months ago (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;828210&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;828210&#x2F;</a>), and its release notes don&#x27;t mention time_t now being 64 bits. The glibc manual page linked to by that answer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;libc&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;64_002dbit-time-symbol-handling.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;libc&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;64_002dbi...</a>) says &quot;at this point, 64-bit time support in dual-time configurations is work-in-progress, so for these configurations, the public API only makes the 32-bit time support available&quot;, which probably means in practice that 64-bit time_t is still not available for common 32-bit configurations (unless you want to lose binary compatibility with all existing software). I haven&#x27;t been following this Y2038 work, but it&#x27;s probably been postponed for a later glibc release (perhaps even the next one).')
