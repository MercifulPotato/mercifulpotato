The entire point of using cloud offerings as opposed to rolling your own, is cloud offerings are usually several orders of magnitude easier to configure. Using Event Hub, as an example, means that you&#x27;re getting a similar experience to Apache Kafka, but without having to scale&#x2F;configure everything yourself.<p>Sure, you have to become proficient with Event Hub, but becoming proficient with EH is probably 1&#x2F;100th of the difficulty as becoming proficient enough in Kafka to support the same scalability&#x2F;workload.')
