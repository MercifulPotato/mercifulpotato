Yesterday, things went from bad to worse when a user with the name &#x27;F<i></i>* T<i></i> RIAA&#x27; uploaded three MP3s of the songs the RIAA mentioned in its takedown notice<p>RIAA couldn&#x27;t care less. As far as I understand, they practically are just a team of lawyers whose job is to attack whoever they can reach, take whatever they can down and collect money when possible. They hardly even care about the actual recording business, let alone about how do people feel about them.')
