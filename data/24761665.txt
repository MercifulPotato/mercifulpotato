I understand some people have no problems doing this, but even though I&#x27;m very much an introvert, being forced to be at home all day with no human interaction was getting difficult.<p>Now I&#x27;m back at the office 50% of the time. The company is split in two, and you work in the office one week and from home the next. I feel a lot better, and I have to admit that I can now appreciate the weeks I&#x27;m working from home more, since I&#x27;m not stuck doing it all the time.')
