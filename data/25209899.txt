I can not think of a single example.<p><i>Not a single major venture from SV VC network even attempted to innovate the &quot;business model&quot;.</i> We can make machines reason now but, alas, a business model that does not depend on eradicating privacy is beyond the reach of the geniuses involved. It is &quot;Impossible&quot;? I think, &quot;undesirable&quot; is more likely. No one is even seriously trying. Point: money behind SV tech giants is not motivated at all to fund the anti-panopticon.<p>The salient, sobering, facts are that all these companies are sitting on a SV foundation that was and remains solidly &quot;national security&quot;, &quot;military&quot;, and &quot;intelligence&quot;.
