Inconsistency causing maintainability&#x2F;readability problems.<p>2. The desire to avoid discussions about style within a team.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about 1. here then what you&#x27;re talking about is consistency as a tool that can be used to further the goal of maintainability&#x2F;readability, but as with all tools it can be applied too broadly to problems it doesn&#x27;t suit, which I would argue includes the subtlety and nuance around the <i>intent</i> of some code rather than the function, and so to force consistency there, and to nullify intent, <i>harms</i> the persuit of the end goal.<p>Point 2. is in my experience so rare that I&#x27;m tempted to assume it&#x27;s just a post-rationalisation used to justify the pleasing sensation programmers get from making things the same. However, assuming it does exist, just in companies I&#x27;ve not experienced, this isn&#x27;t really a goal that in my opinion is best served by a linter, once you&#x27;ve got to the point that you&#x27;ve automatically fixed all the issues that are obvious (such as lead spaces, syntax errors, security issues etc).<p>Everything you&#x27;re left with after this point is a programmer either expressing intent, or making an unsound style choice, and this is best solved in code review. Expressing intent is <i>valuable</i>, especially in a language like Ruby where there is room for nuance.<p>If you&#x27;ve got two developers fighting over preferred style, bring in a senior developer to educate about this and perhaps even bring it up in the employee review. If you&#x27;ve got two senior developers who disagree about the style of a piece of code, then they should be expressing their opinions in a non-argumentative and suggestive style:<p>Senior a&gt; &quot;I would prefer to see this code written like this, but this is a personal preference&quot;<p>Senior b&gt; &quot;I wrote it like this to show x intent&quot; or &quot;I have amended the code as you suggested&quot;')
