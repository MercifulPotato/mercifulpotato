This is me, twice. It&#x27;s not that expensive. It&#x27;s not even painful. It&#x27;s normal - what most people do.<p>&gt; You will need first and last months rent (not to mention how will you find a cheap place in a city you have no connections in without being there?)<p>I have never paid first and last month&#x27;s rent for deposit. Having dabbled in real estate, I do know this is a thing and not that unusual. I also know this is <i>not</i> the norm. I&#x27;ve often paid deposits of amounts like $200. These are decent apartments - not crap ones, but not high end ones either. I remember the one time someone asked more than one month&#x27;s rent, I simply found a comparable apartment a few blocks away. It didn&#x27;t require much of a search because probably over 80% of the apartment complexes in that neighborhood did not charge that much.<p>As for finding a &quot;cheap&quot; place, all it takes is the Internet.<p>&gt; Telling poor people to abandon their social support system to move somewhere cheaper is really underselling how hard that is.<p>Both having done this, and seeing others do this from the now expensive place I live in: I can assure you the success stories outnumber the fail stories 10 to 1. Easily. Your support system in the expensive city is not much use if you cannot afford to pay rent. Your argument has validity if you&#x27;re moving between comparable cities, but we&#x27;re talking about people who are, in a sense, already below 0. The baseline sucks, despite whatever social support they have.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re starting with $0 in hand, you&#x27;re screwed no matter where you are. Barring medical expenses or similar sudden expenses, most people who end up there do so via the boiling frog syndrome. The trick is to get out when you see that your finances are dropping.')
