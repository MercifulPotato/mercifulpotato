One way to do it would be...<p><pre><code>   ifconfig eth0 | grep -o -E &#x27;([[:xdigit:]]{1,2}:){5}[[:xdigit:]]{1,2}&#x27;\n</code></pre>\n...another...<p><pre><code>   ifconfig eth0 | awk &#x27;&#x2F;^[a-z]&#x2F; { iface=$1; mac=$NF; next } &#x2F;inet addr:&#x2F; { print iface, mac }&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these are tied to the way the MAC address is printed in the output of the ifconfig command, and there&#x27;s no contract that says that can&#x27;t change.  In fact, there are probably versions of it out there where these won&#x27;t work.  In PowerShell you would do this...<p><pre><code>    Get-NetAdapter -Name Wi-Fi | select -ExpandProperty MacAddress\n</code></pre>\nThis is far more readable if you pass this script on to someone else, it won&#x27;t break if the way it Get-NetAdapter gets rendered to the screen changes, and best of all, since I know the discoverability tricks in PowerShell, even though I&#x27;ve never done this before, I didn&#x27;t have to go to stack overflow to find it.')
