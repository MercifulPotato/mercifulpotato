So battery issues, and solar energy conversion efficiency I expect. And these days the phone has evolved into a fully blown computer, so yeah - energy requirements. But those little credit card solar calculators were cool, I remember the one I had well... There are some amazingly small phones these days approaching that form factor... google worlds smallest phones etc. Anyhow - maybe a real engineer can comment further?')
