This property is important because it guards against bribing&#x2F;coercing&#x2F;pressuring voters to vote for particular candidates.  I don&#x27;t know of any practical way of enabling a voter to check that his&#x2F;her vote was correctly counted without also compromising the anti-bribery property, especially with a realistic model of the abilities and limitations of most voters.')
