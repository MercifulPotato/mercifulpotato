The tiniest particles are light enough to be captured using electrostatic forces rather than the more typical mechanical filtration that is effective at capturing large particles.<p>More precisely, many odors are not particles at all but rather gases&#x2F;vapors. Activated charcoal can capture larger organic molecules because it has an incredibly jagged&#x2F;porous surface - just 100 grams of activated charcoal provides over 1,000,000 square feet of &quot;effective&quot; filtration surface area.')
