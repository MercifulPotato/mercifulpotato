You&#x27;d still have old GTK, which wouldn&#x27;t be maintained anymore as the devs moved on, and new NTK or whatever, which would be what was still developed and used these days. Somewhat similar to old GTK since that was its roots, yet distinct.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly what happens, they just reuse the name because well, why wouldn&#x27;t they. You can still use GTK2 just like you can use Win32 API, but nobody does modern apps in either GTK2 or Win32 API or expects them to smoothly blend into modern desktop these days.<p>Not even speaking about the fact that The GIMP is a very special case that makes it probably the hardest GTK app to port to newer versions in existence.')
