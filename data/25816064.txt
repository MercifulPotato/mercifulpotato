Have you ever been in academia? Bias is everywhere. Bias towards certain hypotheses, political outlooks, methods, etc. The more senior someone is in a field, the more biased they tend to be! I&#x27;ve seen the founder of a field vote to reject a paper because it was &quot;already known&quot; because he skimmed the paper and misread it. There are entire fields of Alzheimer&#x27;s research that are suppressed because they don&#x27;t work with the Field&#x27;s Favorite Aggregating Protein. I&#x27;ve witnessed people add spin to the conclusion section of a paper so that it looks less politically incorrect, and I&#x27;ve also witnessed that this step is both necessary and effective for getting a &quot;dicey&quot; paper published. Get out of here if you&#x27;re going to assert that scientists are these objective Vulcan types that are &quot;above the fray&quot;. They are some of the most &quot;biased&quot; and opinionated people in existence!!')
