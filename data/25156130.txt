I have since removed the Product Hunt-like popup modal on the landing page. While I personally enjoyed the aesthetic and UX, my no-code pop-up was loading all of the images&#x2F;videos for 100+ job listings upon load. No wonder it was so slow.<p>The new simplified experience (and many would argue, improved UX) goes directly to a full page listing AND reduces load times by &gt;90%.<p>I have been operating this job board in beta for a couple of months and never had a complaint about load times (maybe it is all of us gamers that are used to download 12 hour game patches). I owe a great debt of gratitude the HN community for surfacing the issue.<p>Thank you!')
