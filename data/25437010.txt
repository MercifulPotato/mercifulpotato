Item(by='kohanz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608075899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435265, text='Some providers provide great pricing and service, but please, unless your project is a hobby project, do not use DO&#x27;s storage and CDN solution (called Spaces) in production. Made that mistake once and caused a lot of headache and regret. In fact, if you&#x27;re considering DO at all for production, subscribe to their status page for a steady stream of incidents to your inbox. And if it&#x27;s not an incident, it a 2-day long &quot;maintenance&quot; that gets announced literally one minute before it starts. I&#x27;ve stayed subscribed partially for the comedy of it at this point (migrated away from DO a while ago). DO engineering and devops must be a lively place.<p>As for the pricing reason, part of it is reliability, but part is that all of the other product offerings (which are available at the big players and not elsewhere) are subsidized by these costs that everyone needs. For example, Amazon Cognito is dirt cheap, why do you think that is? Come for the X, Y, Z and make us money back through storage&#x2F;egress.')
