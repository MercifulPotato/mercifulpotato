Even Nginx, apache or google&#x27;s own dns over https servers behave differently if the request headers expect multiple response bodies. Let alone the unpredictability of chunked encodings, which is another nightmare.<p>I really think that there should be an official testsuite that is maintained to reflect the specifications, similar to the intention of the (meanwhile outdated) acid tests.<p>Adoption rates to new http versions will always stay low if you implement it for months exactly as the spec says, just to figure out that no real world webserver actually implements it in the same way.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tholian-network&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;blob&#x2F;X0&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;source&#x2F;connection&#x2F;HTTP.mjs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tholian-network&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;blob&#x2F;X0&#x2F;stealth&#x2F;s...</a>')
