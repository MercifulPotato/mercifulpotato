Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603885765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917313, text='You know, a lot of poor people spend their time on Twitter and what not saying ugly things like &quot;Eat the rich&quot; because they feel powerless and feel like no rich people would ever listen to them and so forth. And then they are all <i>shocked</i> when the rich don&#x27;t give a damn about folks who are openly hostile to them.<p>And then some poor people have hobbies like becoming the (apparently) first woman to make the leader board of HN shortly after getting themselves off the street and back into housing. (That would be me, in case that needs to be said.) And some people close to me are of the opinion that me running my big fat mouth on HN while homeless and earning a pittance online while sleeping in a tent is why tablets are no longer expensive shiny toys for rich people and are actually productive and affordable for ordinary people with sucktastic lives.<p>So, studies aside, you will have to excuse me for sticking to my guns here. My apologies for having no idea how to convince you I&#x27;m the one that&#x27;s right in this case.<p>Oops. My bad.')
