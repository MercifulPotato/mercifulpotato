We originally had an account manager, then we got a new one, then we got told we&#x27;re not having an account manager and ended up getting a different person for the same expensive issue...<p>We were using managed accounts for our customers, wrapping Stripe to provide payment accounts to our customers. Stripe was allowing our customers to process refunds on payments even if they had negative balances and had no automated notifications in place to send us notice of these negative balances.<p>Stripe gave us no notice, and shut down payments for all of our customers and accounts until the balance was cleared. We basically got an email one day saying pay 40k~ and we&#x27;ll unlock your accounts. This behaviour was going on for about 18 months I think, it wasn&#x27;t just some issue that came about over 2 weeks. We were running our business in such a way that to us looked profitable and well-ran but Stripe was keeping an internal debit against us which they decided had reached it&#x27;s cap and email us.<p>Their thinking was that they didn&#x27;t have any responsibility to send notifications to us and they also didn&#x27;t need to restrict refunds, we should do it on our application.. except the information we needed wasn&#x27;t even available to us.<p>About 3 months afterwards, their platform magically started doing exactly what we were saying should have been their responsibility from day one. When you hit robotic support people who are reading from a script, your account manager is removed and your business depends on processing payments they really had all the power.<p>Very unhappy about this and we&#x27;re still paying off the $40k that they decided to collect overnight from us...')
