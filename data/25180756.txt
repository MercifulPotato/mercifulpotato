No one I ever met personally said that, but I heard plenty of &quot;chatter&quot; at BBQs where SF police officers were guests.<p>Where I grew up, in the &quot;East Pacific Northwest&quot;, some were violent enough to actually say that out loud. I never knew anyone personally that murdered a black person, but I knew several who got into fights for this reason. These were kids in high school, police officers, elected political officials, etc.<p>I&#x27;m very happy to say I&#x27;ve never personally heard anything like that in a professional setting, but I&#x27;m sure it exists and I hope it&#x27;d be treated very seriously.')
