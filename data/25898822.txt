But I don&#x27;t think it answers the GP&#x27;s question because<p>* Herd immunity numbers assume no ongoing vaccination -- they more or less say, &quot;If life went back to normal, would the virus slow down or speed up?&quot;<p>* Age-related mortality and age-related vaccination rates are important. If we vaccinate all of the people who are at serious risk, the danger is mostly gone. There have obviously been deaths in populations <i>not</i> at serious risk, but not in proportion to the economic costs of locking down the economy.<p>And as an aside, vaccine immunity is estimated to be about as good as post-infection immunity. And most estimates of the actual infection rate put them several times (some estimate 8-10x, but that&#x27;s looking unlikely IMO) the measured case rate.')
