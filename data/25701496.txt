If we&#x27;re talking about the latter, we disagree over whether it&#x27;s a bad thing.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily have a problem with the existence of sites like Parler that cater to extremists (I&#x27;m using &#x27;extremists&#x27; in a historical context here, rather than by present-day unpopularity).<p>What I think is harmful is the &#x27;hey man, it&#x27;s all cool!&#x27; environment, in which a ten year old can start out at PewDiePie and wind up two years later as some Qanon nut with cranial tongs and a poster of Dylan Roof in his locker.<p>So let a thousand Parlers bloom, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but give mainstream sites strong enough moderation to allow rational, humane people a place to discuss issues.')
