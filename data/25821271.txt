To put it in perspective, I subscribe to &lt;deep breath&gt; Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Now, Apple One, Office365, PS+, and Xbox Live, and that&#x27;s just off the top of my head. Most of them are for purely-optional entertainment, and all of them cost more money than the developer program. I suspect most people who frequent this board pay for several of these too. In comparison, the $100&#x2F;yr for the developer program is not a lot of money. It&#x27;s certainly comparable with other optional digital services. It&#x27;s less than a single restaurant lunch per month.<p>You can complain that it&#x27;s not right to charge for the program, but the developer program has a cover charge to keep out the riff raff. I don&#x27;t think this is a bad thing. We all know how much junk is in the App Store as it is, and how long it takes to get a review. Imagine if they didn&#x27;t charge for the opportunity to submit apps? How much soon-abandoned junk would suddenly appear, and how long would it take for proper apps to get approved?')
