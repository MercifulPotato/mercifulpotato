I am tickled that this article makes an argument about &quot;moral hazards&quot;; ignoring the fact that student loans are unlike almost any other loan in that they can not be removed with a bankruptcy. That is not a moral hazard, that is a moral abomination.<p>2) Slowly get out of the business of having the federal government guarantee loans without regard to expected payment. We need to keep the immediate expectations in play to not upset too much. However, any loan made without consideration of repayment potential is absurd. Either just provide a grant or don&#x27;t provide money.')
