Item(by='lliamander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610274029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711815, text='&gt; Bernie never incited a mob to storm the Capitol Building, while Congress ratified the votes for his political opponent.<p>His supporters most certainly include a fringe of people prepared for violence. I&#x27;ve even seen video evidence of such people working for his presidential election campaign.<p>Bernie Sanders also endorsed the (thankfully failed) Portland mayoral candidate who was an open Antifa supporter and worshiper of Stalin and Mao.<p>The question, for any political movement that has violent fringe, to what extent can the responsibility for that violent fringe be set at the feet of either the members of the movement or the politicians who lead it?<p>Bernie and his followers have never been broadly considered responsible for his radicals, despite his extreme rhetoric.<p>All summer long we had &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; BLM protests that included a significant minority of violent radicals (both BLM and Antifa) and yet no one took responsibility.  In many cases people weren&#x27;t even prosecuted.<p>Consider this: on election day, D.C. was boarded up, and it wasn&#x27;t in preparation for rioting Trump supporters.  These are people who generally speaking don&#x27;t want to over through the existing order. They just want to see the existing order <i>working</i>.')
