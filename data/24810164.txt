It&#x27;s not clear if this thing is meant for finding bugs or finding optimal strategies. There&#x27;s a bunch of funny claims too.<p>&gt; Sometimes, the Tester will juggle more than one build at the same time, apparently capable of simulating multiple hours of gameplay at once<p>What?<p>&gt; Hilariously, someone on the team was actually able to start up combat against the AI, eventually defeating it in a one-on-one battle. When it happened, the Larian chief technology officer started screaming that it was “impossible.” Except, it wasn’t. To celebrate the unexpected victory against a superhuman opponent, the dueling developer was promoted to become a principal tester at Larian’s studio in Belgium.<p>This isn&#x27;t noteworthy in the slightest for a game like divinity. And dev -&gt; principal tester sounds like a demotion?<p>Jokes aside, Larian is a super high quality studio. Divinity 2 was fantastic, and perhaps the only good local-coop (or online) RPG I&#x27;ve ever seen. High hopes for Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3.')
