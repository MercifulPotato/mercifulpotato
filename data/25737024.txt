When it comes to <i>political</i> actors, <i>forcing</i> a person or organization to support a <i>specific</i> candidate (who isn&#x27;t even on any ballot at the moment) amounts to political coercion and is antithetical to a free society;<p>2.  Which candidate do you <i>hate</i> the most?  If what you were saying was reasonable, then <i>you</i> could be <i>forced</i> to provide material support for that candidate.  How would you feel about that?<p>3. Stripe is <i>not</i> a utility like electricity or the phone company.  Nor are they anywhere close to a monopoly.  In fact, Stripe is just one of many players in that market[0];<p>4.  Not only does the <i>Donald Trump</i> Campaign (a specific &quot;candidate&quot;) have other options for online payment processing, online payment processing is <i>not</i> the only way to collect donations.  As such, in addition to the dozens of other payment processors on the market, Bank transfers, Western Union, Zelle, CashApp, old fashioned checks and money orders, cash etc., etc., etc. are also available.<p>You&#x27;ve got this all backwards.  Political activity&#x2F;speech is strongly protected in the US -- no just positive activity&#x2F;speech, but negative activity&#x2F;speech as well.<p>And if the government can force Stripe (or you or me) to provide support to a political actor, then all of our rights are being impinged.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_online_payment_service_providers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_online_payment_service...</a>')
