With their &quot;Version 2.0&quot; they flushed their software down the toilet: Horrible implementation. Horrible performance. Horrible bugs.<p>Switch to Cryptomator as this is more &quot;future proof&quot; from my pov. I saddens me to see that Secomba just didn&#x27;t got it any right after the &quot;update&quot;. Even after so many years.<p>Shoutout to the OpenLab and the rest of the Auxburg guys &lt;3')
