Item(by='gtyras2mrs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603134367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824631, text='&gt; I think if someone makes such party, people will vote for it as taxes affect them directly or indirectly.<p>2 issues.<p>As stated in another comment, most of the income taxes &#x2F; import taxes etc affect a tiny fraction of the population. Not really a huge voter base there. Influential and disproportionately powerful - but not enough to swing elections I think.<p>Also these taxes fund a huge number of programs that will need to be cut down or cancelled which will affect a lot of people (who don&#x27;t necessarily make enough to pay income taxes). Not really something that any government can do in good conscience if they want to hold power.')
