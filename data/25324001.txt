I have also turned down the power of any transmitters that are close to where I sit. But I&#x27;m also a nerd so am surrounded by equipment, with at least eight pieces of wireless equipment in my office.<p>A part of me wonders if by denying this sensitivity, I&#x27;m shutting that sense out, regardless it still has a background effect. If it exists at all, which is the other problem (I can at least claim to be a critical neurotic).')
