Brownouts just don&#x27;t happen (see this 0.5% frequency dip making headlines), and a blackout is a once-a-decade event for any given house (probably even less frequent than that).<p>So your answer is probably that demand for that feature is far from universal, and a coffee machine is much lower stakes than for example an alarm clock.')
