The easiest way to conform is to ensure that you don&#x27;t have any function names longer than that. I believe this is why there are so many names like &quot;strcpy&quot; and &quot;tmpnam&quot; in the C standard library. Later additions are often not quite so laconic - e.g. it&#x27;s &quot;tmpfile&quot;, not &quot;tmpfil&quot;.<p>And then many Unix shell utilities are themselves counterparts of the corresponding C APIs - e.g. &quot;chown&quot;. It stands to reason that they&#x27;d have identical names; but in doing so, they would also set a precedent for that kind of shortening in general. So if you already have &quot;chown&quot;, then why not &quot;chgrp&quot;? And if you have &quot;chgrp&quot;, then you&#x27;d probably want &quot;newgrp&quot; rather than &quot;newgroup&quot;.')
