Item(by='mbirth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604568321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969183, text='&gt; Does anyone have a suggestion of an email provider I can use with custom domain?<p>I’ve set it up the other way around. All mail gets sent to a cheap VPS that has qmail rules to accept all aliases from a text file. This way, whenever I sign up for a new service, I just add the service’s name to the text file and suddenly have “servicename@mydomain” as an email address. Same for compromised mail - just remove the entry from the file and add another one, change email address with the compromised service (or cancel the account) and you won’t be bothered by spam anymore. All addresses not in that text file go to some local CatchAll folder I only check occasionally.<p>All mail that’s passing this filter is getting a DKIM and&#x2F;or DMARC signature and forwarded to my GMail account. But I can easily have it sent to a completely different account in a matter of minutes. And the email provider doesn’t have to support custom domains.')
