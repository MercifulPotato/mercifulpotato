(I&#x27;m not trying to explain this to you, an experienced lifter, but to others reading this post with less experience)<p>The program typically tells you how to structure and progression of the main lifts, e.g. when, how many sets, the rules of increasing&#x2F;decreasing the weight etc..\nHowever, many of those programs give the user freedom in choosing their accessory exercises according to some rules. Example: Do your main lifts, then perform x sets, y reps of an accessory lift targeting $muscle_group. The plan will typically make some recommendations for accessory exercises to choose from, of course, but the emphasis most often lies on the fact that they can be changed. The modification and individualisation is built into the routine.\nPopular examples for this style of programming in beginner&#x2F;intermediate plans are 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1 variants or Greg Nuckols&#x27; programs.<p>So in short, I don&#x27;t agree with a site like this in general lacking a target audience, I would consider myself advanced (~7 years of continuous strength training) and I still look up exercises from time to time nonetheless for multiple reasons, and I don&#x27;t hold encyclopedic knowledge of every exercise for every muscle group.\nI agree that it is bad advice for a beginner to go to such a site and just pick exercises &quot;at random&quot;, but as far as I can see that isn&#x27;t how the site advertises itself.')
