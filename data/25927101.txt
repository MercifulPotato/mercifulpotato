I&#x27;ve tried btrfs as root filesystem  (because I wanted checksummed root and btrfs is easily available out of the box) a few times every now and then, last time probably 1-2 years ago - invariably it always somehow f*cked itself up sooner or later.<p>In contrast, I never had a single non-hardware-related problem with ZFS in maybe decade of using it for NAS. It&#x27;s totally rock solid! I&#x27;ve recently figured out how to do unattended root on ZFS setup to provision my PCs and never going back to btrfs no more.')
