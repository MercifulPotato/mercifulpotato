Anything that can get rid of jet is a godsend for better figures.<p>My only minor quibble is the use of &quot;scientifically&quot; in phrases like &quot;scientifically derived color maps.&quot;  Since there&#x27;s no general &quot;scienctific&quot; concept, and it&#x27;s actually about the color values perceptual consistency, using a term that reflects that specific &quot;scientific&quot; aspect would be a lot clearer. The terms &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;unscientific&quot; are highly subjective and do not convey much useful meaning, IMHO. And when an article is read by non-scientists, which I hope this article will be, using terms like &quot;unscientific&quot; reinforces the false popular perception that scientists are commonly dividing the world into &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;unscientific&quot; like a 1950s Time magazine article.  But again, very minor quibble in what is a very important message.')
