It&#x27;s simple enough that you can easily pick it up after 15 mins of reading the docs. There is also a schema proved by every server that tells you exactly what can be queried. This is much nicer than having to refer to documentation of unknown quality before you know what a REST api can provide.<p>Now actually implementing a server on the other hand is much more difficult.')
