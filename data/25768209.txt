Telegram for example has a &quot;secret chat&quot; function, which won&#x27;t save the messages, meaning someone scanning your phone later, won&#x27;t find them.<p>(which I head is also a main reason for many people to join telegram, because so they can chat with their affairs and not have their wifes read it)<p>Then there are simply private tabs of chrome or ff, from where you can use chat-services without trace. (if the chat services are not cooperating with the police, or are decentralised by default, I think in that scenario I would use matrix)<p>Anyway, you live in kashmir?<p>I know mainly of the conflict by reading Shalimar the Clown, from Rushdie. Just curious about your opinion, if you know the book. I heard it was not well received in Kashmir itself?\nI think it was very well written, but I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is.')
