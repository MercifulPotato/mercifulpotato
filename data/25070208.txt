I had done some C++ coding small adventure games but programming then still felt really cold and academic.<p>When I found Why’s book, I loved it. I thought it was funny, dark and moving. It wasn’t about programming, Ruby was a sidecar to this person expressing themself in an incredibly vibrant way. I felt like: wow, there are people like me in programming, too!<p>Now I run a 30 person product shop in NYC. I may have never learnt to code if not for Why.')
