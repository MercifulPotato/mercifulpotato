The way they hit back was by getting them more media attention, coincidentally just after WSB themselves started a Twitter to promote themselves and had just appeared in the financial news for one particularly wild success at adjusting the price of a stock?<p>Kind of would have expected HN to look for a higher barrier of proof than that. Sounds more like WSB got a bit too big, started to draw some degree of actual scrutiny (partially through their own actions in tweeting out egotistical statements from their Twitter) and now are blaming it on some vague conspiracy?<p>I&#x27;ve no doubt that lots of institutional investors would be happy to keep things like WSB out. But it would be a strange and convenient coincidence that there happens to be an international conspiracy involving investors, media and financial regulators that just so happens to fit perfectly with the &#x27;underdog&#x27; PR story WSB is trying to build itself on.')
