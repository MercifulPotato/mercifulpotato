Such as:<p>1. Information gathering - If you generally know where you might find the info or is low priority, try to find it on your own first before asking someone to find it for you. If you have no clue if the information exists or know that someone can take a minute to give you information that you would take 30 minutes to find otherwise, then go ahead and ask right away.<p>2. Blockers - If you are stuck from progressing then don&#x27;t hesitate to ask. Even if the person can&#x27;t help you right away, they at least know that someone is waiting on them.<p>3. Decisions - Think on these questions a bit and try to determine the path forward before going to the person to make a decision. The more junior you are, the more you should present the details of all sides, where for a more senior person they can just give a quick justification why they want to go a certain route.<p>Overall, it is better to err on the side of asking too many questions, you can always turn away a person that is bugging you too much. If I think someone is asking questions they should figure out on their own I have no issues giving a friendly, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you take a stab at it and let me know how it goes.&quot; The person that doesn&#x27;t ask enough questions is far worse, as they could end up days down a wrong path or wasting time spinning their wheels.')
