With GraphQL, you&#x27;ve got to worry about the possibility that some client figures out how to craft a query that slips between all your indexes and causes the database engine to resort to doing things the hard way. So, worrying about that stuff is hard, where it tends to be easier to manage with REST or gRPC because you can just force your worldview onto consumers and get on with your life.<p>In theory, though, a well-crafted GraphQL API can be more performant over a wider variety of use cases than a well-crafted REST API, for all the oft-cited reasons. So it does make the impossible possible. But not (necessarily) easy.')
