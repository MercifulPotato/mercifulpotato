Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610317741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720601, text='&gt; To save others the time, as I understand it, their disagreement is about the meaning of the equals sign.<p>I think it&#x27;s more general than that. The meaning of symbols is not fixed, but a matter of intersubjective agreement and context. &quot;2+2=4&quot; if we intend that &quot;2&quot; represents the natural number subsequent to one and preceding three; and we intend that &quot;+&quot; refers to infix addition; and we intend that &quot;=&quot; refers to quantitative equality; and we intend that &quot;4&quot; represents the natural number subsequent to three and preceding five. This is actually not an &quot;iff&quot; statement because there are an infinite amount of other meanings we could reassign to the symbols contained within the proposition in order to result in a true statement.<p>But intent is a property of the speaker, not the phoneme. Intent does not inhere in the message. Intent must be inferred from context and previous usage of the terms.<p>&gt; without a good definition all sides agree to, people can find themselves talking past one another.<p>I think this happens a lot and its why people think other people deny things like &quot;2+2=4.&quot; Then there is a whole class of people who take advantage of ambiguity to instrumentally employ fallacies of equivocation.')
