They commonly let folks get their startup to an MVP and become investable.<p>The other factor is that they come in waves: there could be many grants for your startup for a few years, then government focus shifts and they dry up, then 5 years later they might come again<p>Aquiring the grants and completing the required paperwork feels a lot like doing schoolwork - it&#x27;s tedious, but certainly doable, I have won 2 grants a few years back for my startup, its not like you have to be a big corp to stand a chance.')
