Windows works for me so does Linux but both have their issues. I still useful work on both of them. I have very little experience with macos but from what I read and hear from friends it&#x27;s not all perfect either. We are a point where OSs do so many things which means there&#x27;s a huge surface of bugs can appear on. What&#x27;s probably more important is, how much those bugs affect your work and how quickly the &quot;vendor&quot; is fixing them once discovered.')
