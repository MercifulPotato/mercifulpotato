You&#x27;re claiming the sitting President tried to mobilize the military to prevent a transfer of power. Do you have any evidence of that?<p>Claiming there was fraud in the past election, that the election was stolen, or that the results should not have been certified is not mobilizing the military. It&#x27;s not even illegal, it&#x27;s part of the constitutional process.<p>Hell, some Democrats did exactly that to Trump in 2017. Even the Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi herself disputed the results in 2005 yet she now claims that anyone else repeating her own words is an insurrectionist.')
