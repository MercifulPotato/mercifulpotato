Item(by='DonHopkins', descendants=None, kids=[25446463], score=None, time=1608142599, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25445813, text='&quot;Constructive Separation&quot; is completely voluntary with both parties. Of course he had an option: the board ASKED HIM TO STAY! Not anything like being fired or asked to leave -- just the opposite.<p>The irony is that Brendan wanted to &quot;Destructively Separate&quot; his victims who were legally joined together in same sex marriages, so it&#x27;s especially hurtful that Brendan would throw that term around about his voluntary separation with Mozilla, after he maliciously wanted to DESTRUCTIVELY SEPARATE many other human beings in marriage from their loved ones, against their will.<p>Brendan and the Mozilla board both explicitly denied that he was fired or asked to leave. And the Mozilla Board actually tried to get Brendan to stay. According to your theory, they are both liars in collusion.<p>Is that what you really believe or just magically &quot;feel&quot;? Do you have any evidence for your feelings? What more proof of fact do you need than their own widely published words? A long form birth certificate?<p>Are Brendan and the Mozilla board conspiring to both publish a false narrative in lockstep that he was not fired or asked to leave? Then why is he still cooperating with the conspiracy if he was fired or asked to resign? Do you theorize that Mozilla gave him millions of dollars of Google ad blood money that should have gone to open source software development, just to keep his mouth shut?<p>That was the GamerGate conspiracy narrative. Do you believe it too, in spite of all the hard proof to the contrary?')
