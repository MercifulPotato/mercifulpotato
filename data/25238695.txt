But you get these accusations constantly against companies. &quot;I felt ignored in meetings therefore the firm is sexist and racist&quot;. No, that happens to people all the time, including white men. A better explanation is maybe you weren&#x27;t saying anything worth listening to in meetings, or you feel you were but your manager disagreed.<p><i>when most of your black employees leave because of what they feel is racism in the workplace thatâ€™s harder to ignore</i><p>They weren&#x27;t ignoring it. Some of these people weren&#x27;t even saying they felt that way to Coinbase - one of the people who claims she was bullied also claims nobody told her how to make an official complaint and that&#x27;s why Coinbase have no record of her views. Complaining to HR has to be the easiest task in any modern corporation; if she couldn&#x27;t figure out how to do even that then we probably found the explanation for why she felt unappreciated: maybe she just sucked. Or <i>maybe</i> she&#x27;s made up this supposed racism after she left, as part of achieving other ends (like getting in the NYT).')
