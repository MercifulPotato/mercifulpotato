Everybody knows this since the release notes annoyingly are being displayed after each updates. If you, like me, have code installed on multiple computers that use infrequently the release notes are always the first thing you see at some point everyday. Luckily it can easily be turned off in the settings but oh boy i am tired of logging on to some server and having those release note displayed. Should be an installation option if they should be displayed or no. Default off. A small notification badge somewhere to alert you the latest release notes, better. Rant over.')
