Foreign exchange markets, that I am aware of, do not have closing auctions.<p>I have heard of some quants trading foreign exchange markets, agreeing to trade at the fix with their counter-party, and not realising that traders often manipulate the fix resulting in the quant&#x27;s strategy appearing not to work. It is almost comical (I worked in finance but not in FX, everyone knew this was going on for decades before the SEC starting fining people) that someone who managed money was making this error.<p>You are 100% correct about all the other stuff. Lots of issues with &quot;production&quot;...that is why financial firms employ traders&#x2F;risk people&#x2F;etc. Most people who trade themselves tend to go for lower-frequency strategies that they can implement personally. I actually don&#x27;t think there are huge barriers, smaller investors have a huge advantage (when you trade at scale, the market moves against you) but you have to work with what you have and realise that you will get crushed if you try to replicate what someone with more money is doing.<p>Also, data. Data is expensive, and a huge fixed cost.')
