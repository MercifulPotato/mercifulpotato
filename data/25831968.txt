Shows in Austria&#x2F;CH only value-add are a &quot;local dialect&quot; of actors, or setting the plot&#x2F;story within Austria&#x2F;CH. Other than that it&#x27;s either a poor local copy of German shows (which are often copies of international shows).<p>Having been spoiled by British quality TV for a couple of decades I&#x27;d say the BBC is an incredible high yardstick, impossible to reach not just for Austria, but there is nothing like it in DACH.<p>One of my biggest annoyance by far is the dubbing of OC into German. They have only a handful of voice-over actors who they rotate for these jobs so the lead-act of every other movie has the same voice[0].<p>As a child I thought one of the reasons Eddie Murphy was so funny was because of his incredibly high-pitched voice[1]. Once people sit through the dubbed content most of the meaning and jokes are lost.<p>While other Europeans grow up watching things like Father Ted, Only Fools and Horses and such classics in their __original__ language, I have not 1 German-native friend who is able to follow English language on TV (even there are subs) and they will never get to appreciate other excellent shows like Norseman, Gomorrah, Suburra, because it&#x27;s <i>&quot;too difficult to read the subs&quot;</i> and they didn&#x27;t have to since they were kids.<p>[0] Dennis Schmidt-Fo√ü has given voices to Ryan Reynolds, Chris Evans, Eddie Murphy and others. In fact the situation with E Murphy was so bad&#x2F;ridiculous that they decided to give him a _new_ voice!! That&#x27;s right the same person now has a different voice and nobody thinks that&#x27;s odd.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OKGAOM0mAOo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OKGAOM0mAOo</a>')
