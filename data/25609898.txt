I personally find a regular non-convection toaster oven to be good enough (and much cheaper).<p>Here&#x27;s the technical aspects I see no one talk about:<p>(1) Air fryers have much higher air flow than a convection toaster oven and the chamber is more aerodynamic resulting in better air flow around the food.<p>(2) Air Fryers have a basket, convection toaster ovens may or may not have one and buying an aftermarket one is surprisingly not cheap.<p>(3) Air fryers have a hair-dryer design, with a fan blowing onto a heating element. The convection oven has normal top and bottom heating elements with a fan blowing the air around on the side.<p>I find that the air fryer does do a better job at reheating (refrigerated or frozen) fried foods such as tots, fries, fish sticks and chicken tenders. But the trade off is that it&#x27;s not as good at toasting and roasting things like waffles, bread, quesadilla, pizza or vegetables.')
