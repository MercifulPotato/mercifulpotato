Unfortunately, as others experienced, the resolution is severely limited in certain applications (I used Zoom). Zoom compresses the stream as if it’s video, when it’s in fact a slide.<p>I discovered this when I was setting up for a very important presentation and had about 5 minutes to go to a fallback plan. I was pretty upset that there was no warning about this, since they were totally aware of it, and it completely undermined the value of using it in a live presentation.<p>Later, I had to record a presentation to submit for a conference. I used it there and it worked fine in terms of quality. But even though I had bought a green screen, there were difficulties that resulted in subpar edge detection. I had to change my shirt multiple times to create enough contrast, and I had to use a background image that was ‘busy’ enough to mask the static that was visible.<p>Maybe things have improved in the last couple months, but I was pretty let down when I tried this out.')
