Once the information is out there, a copyright infringement suit is usually an irrelevant or losing move for managing the politician&#x27;s image. I would rate this story <i>worse</i> for Biden if he filed a copyright infringement suit against the computer repair guy or the Post, for example. Using copyright could prevail legally yet lose in the more politically important court of public opinion.')
