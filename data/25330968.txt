And mind you I&#x27;m from Europe. That said <i>once</i> he became president it quickly became apparent what a danger he presented not only to the US but also to the rest of the world. I&#x27;m seeing political echoes all around Europe. Not looking forward to seeing claims of election fraud here in a year or two... and this is just the <i>most recent</i> outrageous thing he&#x27;s done.<p>His whole political career has been full of facepalming moments. He is not fit to be a businessman (he&#x27;s failed at it miserably) and definitely not to lead a country and I&#x27;m shocked to see anyone who doesn&#x27;t realize that. I don&#x27;t care if the US is run by a republican or a democrat, just let it not be an illiterate moron.')
