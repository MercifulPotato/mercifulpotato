The information in kWh already exists and is at the fingertips of almost every electricity consumer, there&#x27;s just currently not a lot of incentive to study it (given low energy costs). The information is even getting richer as meter technology has improved since the big classic mechanical meters of my grandparents&#x27; generation and energy companies are often more than happy to provide as much information as the collect if you ask for it.')
