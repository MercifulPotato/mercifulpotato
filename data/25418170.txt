Good information, too. Education greatly benefits from more options; best of luck! Now for things that I think need work (I know little about Lambda school, so this is definitely an armchair strategist opinion):<p>First and foremost, as others pointed, is the growth plans. Education is hard to scale -- good educators deliver fantastic results; a very smart person droning on along a prewritten material adds no value. I doubt there is a way to <i>quickly</i> figure out how good a teacher a new hire is -- it will be clear after a semester or two, but not before. Thus good education needs long-term staff and careful hiring; both hard to scale.<p>&gt; changes that a subset of students did not like are unquestionably for their benefit<p>Ouch. OUCH! Anytime someone is claiming that they do something for your benefit against your will, look for other motives. It is perfectly OK to limit options -- it is your business and you do not have infinite flexibility. But claiming it is good for the students rings hollow.
