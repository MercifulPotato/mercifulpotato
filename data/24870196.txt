Item(by='fuoqi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603465376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867213, text='&gt;give you an x amount of money and force you to spend it. This will erode all incentive to save. If forces consumption instead of preservation.<p>Arguably money should not be used for savings in the first place. Some problems of the modern monetary system arise from the fact that money conflate two functions: medium for trade and tool for savings. After doing something useful for economy and acquiring money for it, you have two options: either you buy someone else&#x27;s work or you invest somewhere (effectively you lend your useful contribution to someone). The first option is a relatively short-lived, think of money as a reputation system, you are more likely to care about a favor done days ago, not decades ago. Another way of looking on it  is that it is easier to compare merit of deeds which were done close in time. But the second option has all the risks and difficulties associated with investments.<p>If you are interested in this topic, I recommend works of Silvio Gesell, it&#x27;s somewhat outdated, but still quite interesting even in modern times.')
