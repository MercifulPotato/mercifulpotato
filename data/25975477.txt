I actually find watching game trailers on YouTube pretty pointless, as everything turns into mush and it totally loses the &quot;precision&quot; of the graphics. I found these cloud streaming services similar, though not quite as extreme.<p>I think bitrates need to be considerably higher. 4K Blu-ray uses close to 100mbit&#x2F;sec, but movies have the advantage of not requiring really low latency encoding which means it is far more efficient with bitrate. I think probably looking at well over 100mbit&#x2F;sec to get good PQ on these services.')
