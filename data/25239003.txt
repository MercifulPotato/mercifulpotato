Not exactly an &quot;architecture&quot; to open like OP said but just pointing out the CPU isn&#x27;t some standard design with nothing to open up simply because it licenses the ARM ISA. That&#x27;s like saying your book is off the shelf because it used an English dictionary for the words.<p>The vertical software integration creates many small wins that aren&#x27;t insignificant overall but it&#x27;s not why they are nearly 2x ahead of Qualcomm using the same ISA at the same power level in 3rd party userspace computation only benchmarks. There isn&#x27;t any vertical integration in those, the raw performance is just better.<p>For another take on this Chrome vs Safari benchmarks put Chrome at ~90% the speed in web benchmarks and this is Chrome&#x27;s 1st stable release of an M1 native version. At the same that&#x27;s 45% faster than Chrome on my AMD 3950X. I remember when Apple added the Javascript rounding instruction to their chips people speculated that&#x27;s why Safari was now so fast, turns out a Safari dev chimed it they hadn&#x27;t started making use of it yet the new chips were just faster than before.')
