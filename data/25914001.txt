I don&#x27;t know the degree to which this is true but if you&#x27;re going to watch something anyway, doing it outside instead of inside seems like not a bad plan. I don&#x27;t think they intended anything by specifying tv and you could replace it with reading, board games, drawing, any activity commonly done inside.')
