Then there&#x27;s more state rather than federal, if you care about the difference, money from school systems hooked onto Apple II, which made it so that it was produced up to early 1990s.<p>Similarly a non-trivial point in financial history of Sun was contracts that indirectly depended on NSA.<p>Then you have third-order money flows, where lots of govt money flew into various projects, which enriched people enough that they could buy Apple products.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the biggest difference is that the government money was very free flowing, and often goal-oriented and who actually got it was a detail that wasn&#x27;t even taken into account unless you failed to deliver. Meanwhile a lot of EU funding grants, depending on country, involves a lot of paperwork instead of just govt buying from you.')
