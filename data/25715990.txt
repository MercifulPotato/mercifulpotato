Within the last couple of weeks I read Berdyaev&#x27;s <i>The Fate of Man in the Modern World</i>, less for any special insight into theology than because the book was lying around, I had heard his name, and thought I might as well read it. On the other hand, I did read a fair bit of Plato and some Aristotle in 2020.<p>The one thing the modern synopsists will give you, though, is context. Jaroslav Pelikan quotes an American theologian to the effect that the Reformation was the reaction of Augustine&#x27;s theology of grace on Augustine&#x27;s theology of the church. I moderately well understand this, not through reading Augustine; I have read <i>The Confessions</i> and a smidgen each of <i>On the Trinity</i> and <i>The City of God</i>. But it was Peter Brown&#x27;s <i>Augustine of Hippo</i> and the first volume of Pelikan&#x27;s history of Christian doctrine that told me.')
