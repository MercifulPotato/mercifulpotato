I hope you apply this understanding in all directions, to your political compatriots too, telling them they are being violent (presumably in an undesirable way) when they do things like make lists? Or wait, you just <i>presume</i> that she was going to do something? Yeah, I&quot;m curious to see the tweet. It sounds like a lot of presuming...<p>But cause if AOC isn&#x27;t the worst you have seen... why did you use her as an example?  Like, everyone is always using AOC as an example, when to me she&#x27;s like one of the smartest and <i>kindest</i> politicians I know, from her utterances. Regardless of what you think of &quot;cancel culture&quot;, she&#x27;s not even a very good example of it, she&#x27;s not the paragon of cancel culture, that&#x27;s not really what she does at all. I think it&#x27;s very unfair to AOC.<p>And yet, everyone wants to use her as an example. (Including by &#x27;presuming&#x27; extra things she hasn&#x27;t actually done!) Why? If you recognize she&#x27;s not actually a great example of what bothers you, why did you mention her name as the only specific name example you mentioned?<p>This is one of the things AOC said which impressed me which I think is literally the opposite of &quot;cancel culture&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;ne8wjg&#x2F;watch-aoc-give-a-direct-message-to-white-supremacists-we-will-love-you-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;ne8wjg&#x2F;watch-aoc-give-a-dire...</a>')
