Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604266327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962578, text='&gt; it is not apples job to work out if you really wanted to revoke a cert, or you just screwed up.<p>It is literally Apple&#x27;s job. From the Certification Practice Statement: &quot;The Subscriber may initiate a revocation request by sending an email to product-security@apple.com. The request for revocation will then be evaluated by Apple.&quot;<p>&gt; Letâ€™s put it another way, say someone requests a revocation issue to malicious actor<p>There&#x27;s no evidence that this is what happened with HP.<p>There&#x27;s one known case where a Developer ID cert may have been compromised: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;stolen-source-code&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panic.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;stolen-source-code&#x2F;</a> Apple worked very closely with the developer, they didn&#x27;t just receive an email and reflexively act without thinking. Moreover, in this case, Apple did not actually revoke the cert! Old versions of Panic apps signed with the cert still run fine. Apparently Apple has a way to use the secure timestamp of the code signature to selectively disable apps signed after a certain date.<p>Again, all non-accidental Developer ID cert revocations that I&#x27;m aware of were owned by malware developers, and revoked on Apple&#x27;s initiation. I&#x27;ve never heard of a case, until HP, where the developer requested the revocation of their own Developer ID cert. And we would know if a legitimate developer&#x27;s cert was revoked, because their software would stop working, just as it did with HP, and with the accidental Charlie Monroe revocation (which was entirely Apple&#x27;s fault).<p>Perhaps there are cases where a cert was never used, and then revoked. But Apple needs to be extremely careful about these cases, because we&#x27;ve seen the terrible consequences when a cert is mistakenly revoked. And there&#x27;s certainly no rush to revoke an unused cert.')
