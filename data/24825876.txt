It even works with RSS, ATOM, and OPML.<p>And you can even mix-and-match it with SPAs, and Vue.js with it&#x27;s &quot;hydration&quot; system. That&#x27;s an very power trick to slash data consumption, and improve cache hits for a &quot;portal&quot; style website. One showstopper: gazillion XSLT&#x2F;XML bugs in Chrome left unfixed for 10+ years.<p>Another particularly interesting application is that you can turn XML data into SVG visualisation solely with XSLT, or you can add some JS with interactivity cod into XSL to run on the client side as a finishing step.')
