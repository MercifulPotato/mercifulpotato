I disagree with your conclusions about the intelligence, reasoning ability, or basic humanity of anti-maskers.<p>If you&#x27;re someone who is flooded with reports of scientists waffling, of problematic reasons why people want you to wear masks, of health officials adjusting the rules du jour independent of defensible rationalizations, of higher-ups enforcing rules that they do not themselves follow, etc., and are NOT exposed to the (imho correct) arguments as to why mask-wearing is necessary and important... why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> you conclude that it&#x27;s a scam?<p>None of the conclusions about mask wearing can be made with 100% certainty. There really <i>is</i> a lot of bullshit going around on all sides. Even a fairly weak selection filter is enough to make <i>perfectly rational actors</i> come to opposite conclusions.<p>Our society is based on the implicit assumption that we all see more or less the same thing, so we can depend on (trust) that our sense of &quot;normal&quot; is shared, at least to some degree.<p>That assumption no longer holds. (Or rather, it holds for far fewer topics than it used to.)')
