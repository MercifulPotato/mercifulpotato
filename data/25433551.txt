Journalists used to be people who were academically educated and trained in the field with knowledge and skill in working as reporters or columnist. Reports and even columns were written with the goal of presenting a problem in an unbiased tone to educate the reader.<p>Nowadays instead of illuminating problems and educating, media companies are exclusively interested in generating revenue in the highly competitive market, hiring freelancers and accepting royalty-free submissions from anonymous people. Instead of reports and columns, we have &quot;blitz-posts&quot; and other types of submissions which seem to be written for half-literate population, judging by their length and choice of words.<p>I would say journalism as we used to know it went downhill with the rise of WWW, where anybody can be anybody. As much as that can be a positive thing, in this case I believe had negative consequences and it was a matter of time before it backfired. Yes, I am blaming these &quot;journalists&quot; hence the warning that it might be an unpopular opinion. Competing in who will provoke, scandalise and scaremonger better and faster multiple times per day in order to generate more clicks, views and ad revenue, despite being completely disgusting and revolting, seems to have pushed some people over the edge and resulted in distrust of the media.<p>Covid is the latest and perfect example of how the media can shape the opinion of the masses, especially when the masses have questionable intellectual capacity, as a result of trying to outperform the competition. I dare say majority of people only read the headlines and move on to consume more information. I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.')
