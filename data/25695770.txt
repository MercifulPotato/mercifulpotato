Item(by='csnover', descendants=None, kids=[25698937], score=None, time=1610160536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694033, text='No, but if someone is going to make a claim that repealing Section 230 will solve a given problem, they’d better actually have some reasonable evidence that it will solve that problem, and not just cause a massive amount of collateral damage.<p>FOSTA-SESTA punched a relatively small hole in the Section 230 liability shield using the pretext that web sites facilitating sex trafficking (read: Backpage) couldn’t be prosecuted otherwise. That was a lie; Backpage was eventually successfully prosecuted using legal tools which had previously existed[0]. The thing that legislators claimed they were trying to solve—sex trafficking—remains woefully unaddressed, but the collateral damage was significant and disproportionately affected marginalised groups and small web site operators (and may have actually made the sex trafficking problem worse)[1].<p>Claims that Section 230 need to be repealed to “take away power from Big Tech” or to “stop extremism” are just wrong.<p>A blanket repeal of Section 230 will only concentrate power even more with Big Tech since they’re the only entities with enough money and power to accept liability for every shitposting troll on the web. (Again, FOSTA-SESTA already illustrated this: the big dating services continued to operate, while niche&#x2F;hobbyist sites—and subsections of sites like Craigslist where dating was not their primary focus—shuttered.)<p>A blanket repeal of Section 230 will not stop extremism since there are multiple other non-internet sources peddling misinformation.<p>Section 230 is not the cause of these problems any more than paved roads are the cause of deaths from high speed car crashes. Few people would seriously argue that we should go back to driving only on dirt roads, but it feels like that’s where so many people are with this subject, and it’s really taking the focus away from why extremism exists in the first place and what we need to do to tackle that root problem.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;trump-signs-bill-to-shut-down-websites-that-facilitate-prostitution&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;trump-signs-bill...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act#Response" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_...</a>')
