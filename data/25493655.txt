After all, an Entity can be implemented as plain old class or object. For event-sourced aggregates, it depends on the implementation style. With OOP, there might the typical AggregateRoot base class. With a more functional style, there can even be less of boilerplate code.<p>About the Domain Event publishing, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t understand the question. What challenges did you face?
