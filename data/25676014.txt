I chose TSLA in January 2018 as the stock with the highest probability of going up by an order of magnitude; we were looking for the best time to buy; I said in August 2018 that I thought a low of 200 was plausible, on a time scale of months, before going up to the hoped-for $650B market cap in a decade.<p>TSLA hit 200 in May 2019, nine months after I made that prediction. I was trying to avoid looking at the stock market to cut the risk of overreacting to trivia, and didn’t see it.<p>But my brother was watching, he saw TSLA hit 200 — and he didn’t say anything about it. We’d worked on this project for most of 2018, and then in 2019 my prediction, my only low price prediction, happened: and my partner in the project simply took no action. And we missed the whole thing completely.<p>Today, three years from the inaugural discussion of this strategy in January 2018, we would have $11,500,000 and our lives would be transformed. Putting our inheritance on TSLA aiming for an order-of-magnitude increase was my exact strategy. I made an uncannily perfect call of 200 (split-adjusted 40) as the lowest price we would see. My brother did not help me at all; and now every day I feel anger over this, I feel he lied to me about his support for our joint project, he has no sensible explanation for his lack of action (“I thought you probably already knew” and even less sensible excuses).<p>Financial losses on the stock market can cause lots of hard feelings, and missed opportunities can too. How does one cope with this?')
