Even most libertarian&#x27;s believe in some kind of &quot;FORCED&quot; tax for an army.<p>I would argue most -isms are academic and the world is much less binary and they&#x27;re thrown out to create some kind of dividing line. Some extreme version of the -ism on one side and the completely rational justified version of sanity on my (groups) side.<p>so vote for my group or send my group money to fight the other group.')
