In terms of graphics, it&#x27;s going to be worse compared to having <i>high-end</i> local hardware.<p>Despite all that, the killer app that will tip the scale is cheat prevention. Cloud gaming annihilates nearly every category of cheat. Wallhacks? Impossible. Infinite health? Impossible. Flyhacks and speedhacks? Impossible. The only category that isn&#x27;t <i>completely</i> eviscerated is aimhacking, and even then it will be dramatically harder <i>and</i> less beneficial to aimhack, since you will need local realtime image analysis to do it properly and you won&#x27;t even be able to aim at targets you can&#x27;t currently see.<p>Once multiplayer gamers get a taste of that, there&#x27;s no going back.<p>Sadly, over enough time I fear this effect will start destroying the market for high-end PC hardware, which will be both sad and a detriment to general computing.')
