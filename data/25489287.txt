It appears to me that we are trying to achieve an algorithm that has better time complexity than the one that we have right now(reverse mode differentiation with gradient descent).<p>Is it possible to combine these methods in a straight forward manner with methods that try to reduce the space complexity? For example, Lottery ticket hypothesis(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.03635" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.03635</a>) seems to reduce spacial complexity(Please do correct me if I am wrong).<p>Also, based on my rather poor and limited knowledge, it appears to me that set of proposed methods that reduced space complexity and set of proposed methods that reduce time complexity are disjoint. Is that the case ?')
