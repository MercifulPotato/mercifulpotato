Never had to replace the battery or have any kind of service done on it at all.<p>I kind of <i>want</i> to buy a new model but this thing just keeps going so I have no legitimate reason to do so. Honestly, I really love the machine. The fact that I&#x27;ll get at least eight years out of it, as I did from my last MBP, means I&#x27;ll definitely buy another MacBook Pro.')
