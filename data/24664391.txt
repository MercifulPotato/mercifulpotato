Palantir grew by 24% in 2018 and yoy 45% (might come in at 60%) (Forbes).  Some say that the growth rate may be because of covid (I dont know that&#x27;s a bad thing), but it is fair if you are in that camp.  However, looking at just the current revenue and ignoring growth seems like you are ignoring the important parts of the picture')
