In Finland we have one of those for most private parking spaces for car block heaters.<p>If you want something fancier, it&#x27;s 300-1000â‚¬ for a &quot;proper&quot; charging station with a Type2 cable. If you&#x27;ve already bought an electric car, it&#x27;ll pay itself back in a few months just with fuel costs. (EU prices, American fuel prices are just bonkers-cheap).')
