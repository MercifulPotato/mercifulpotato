However 2 requests per page are recorded, no idea why that happens. One has 24 or 25 fields filled, the next 15-19 fields.<p>Anyhow that&#x27;s as far as I got.\nThe next and largest step would be analyzing those records aka creating all those beautiful graphs.\nAlso creating a management interface  for sites and generation of tracking code.\nWhile it&#x27;s open source (search for gopiwik) it still uses the mgo.v2 driver and I just yesterday added go module support and did some minor changes.<p>I thought, why reinvent the wheel, let&#x27;s just grab the piwik.js and build a receiver. Turns out it&#x27;s a bit more complicated than that.')
