Four clear vinyl walls and a ceiling. It is essentially indoor dining but in a parking lot. You&#x27;re not fooling anyone. They&#x27;re obviously designed to comply with the exact letter of the law, not its spirit or intention. When I look at them and the people in them sitting shoulder to shoulder, all I can think of is &quot;super-spreader&quot;. I&#x27;m shocked that they were allowed to operate in this way.<p>Also, the &quot;but other businesses...&quot; argument fails to recognize that dining is a special case activity: The nature of eating food requires you to be unmasked and using your mouth. It&#x27;s not the same as shopping for clothes.')
