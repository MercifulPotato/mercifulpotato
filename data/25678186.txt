Something to be outraged about when you hear it on the news, but not something that you can feel affecting you personally.  Blue collar crime, especially the kind that occurs at a personal level, is more visceral.  People really want to see those people kept away from them, more than they want to see rehabilitation.  Whether rehabilitation would lead to better long-term outcomes gets ignored.<p>The Boeing situation is a little different, of course, since it really did kill a bunch of people.')
