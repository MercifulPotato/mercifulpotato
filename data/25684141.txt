You might as well show that SpaceX rocket launches coincide with a rise in Bitcoin prices.<p>There was a successful SpaceX launch yesterday, and Bitcoin went over $40,000 for the first time.  In 2020, SpaceX had its best year ever for successful launches and returns of the first stage, perfectly coinciding with Bitcoin&#x27;s meteoric rise in value.  So Bitcoin must be tied to successful SpaceX launches.')
