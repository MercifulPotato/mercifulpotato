I think we are pretty much biologically encoded to &quot;enjoy&quot; keeping stuff, using it, not throwing things away, and enjoying the different ages like seasons.<p>This is also why i love my old computer, my old scratched up cellphone, a beautiful old car that still runs fine, - the structural integrity of things that has served more than their purpose. I love them even more than &quot;new things&quot;. It just feels good to use them on a visceral level.<p>It&#x27;s a kind of mindfulness and appreciation for things like the beauty of the stone that has been rounded by the seawater over millennia, or your old trusty body that has more wrinkles but also works like biological magic if you really think about it.<p>Another iconic &quot;older gentleman&quot; i have met was a meditation teacher in his 80&#x27;s in SF, still incredibly lucid, still thinking about science, reality dreams and meditation, experimenting pretty much everyday with &quot;being alive&quot; and sharing it with his community.<p>Cool people comes in all ages!')
