This new number matches Moderna&#x27;s reported effectiveness reported yesterday. I don&#x27;t know enough about how the reporting process works. To me, it appears that Pfizer will report whatever number sounds good, not the true number. I&#x27;m glad several states, like New York, want to review the clinical trial data independently of the FDA<p>EDIT: I am getting serious downvotes for this comment! Whoops! I do not mean to suggest people should not take the vaccine, only that the optics of news presses look bad. I say this as someone who takes the Flu vaccine every year and elected for the HPV vaccine a few years ago')
