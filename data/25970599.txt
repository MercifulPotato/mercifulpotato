If I&#x27;m expected to know the entire law, they shouldn&#x27;t be able to hide behind ignorance as an excuse either. If I&#x27;m expected to tell the truth, they should tell the truth as well. If I&#x27;m expected to deescalate tense situations, they should have the same expectations.<p>A cop should be at least as well trained and conscientious as a civilian (and hopefully <i>more</i> trained since this stuff is actually their job).')
