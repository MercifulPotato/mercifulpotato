Out in the middle of the water there must not have been many people to oppose the project! And everyone in Venice was happy not to be flooded out.<p>I&#x27;ve designed and programmed control systems for about a dozen similar inflatable dams although the largest one I worked on was miniscule in comparison at 3m tall and 25m wide. My projects used a product with kevlar bladders with stainless panels on top rather than pumping air in to enormous metal enclosures.<p>There must be one hell of a compressor station to provide the volume of air required to get the water out of the gate panels in venice. And since the use of the flood protection will probably coincide with shit weather I bet they have diesel standby generators to power the whole operation.')
