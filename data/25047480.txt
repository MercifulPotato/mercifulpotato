I recently got into a minor argument with a nurse before a minor surgery. &quot;If you won&#x27;t tell me a number, how will I know if I need to give you a painkiller?&quot; &quot;If I&#x27;m in enough pain to need a painkiller, <i>I will tell you</i>.&quot;<p>The number scale attempts to turn a subjective interpretation into an &quot;objective&quot; value. Instead of having to actually listen to people and apply training and experience to judge which treatments are needed, the number system <i>de facto</i> pushes that decision onto the patient so the doctor&#x2F;nurse&#x2F;etc only needs to follow a simple set of treatment rules. Similar to black box &quot;AI&quot; used in e.g. criminal sentencing and employee evaluations, the numeric pain scale is yet another example of a fundamentally subjective situation being laundered into a supposedly &quot;objective&quot; value.')
