Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[24862179], score=None, time=1603391509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861222, text='&gt; Why buy a stock if Biden will take 1% of it annually? May as well just buy rapidly depreciating status symbols instead<p>Because the stock will allow you to avoid paying taxes. By investing revenue in investment, as a company, you can avoid paying tax on the money. So if you&#x27;re a small or medium sized business, you have two choices:<p>1) Cash out and buy a rapidly depreciating status symbol with the money, but get taxed on it at a higher rate.<p>2) Reinvest the money in growing your business.<p>At least that&#x27;s what I understood from OPs reasoning.<p>Edit: Also spending money in depreciating status symbols is also a contributor to the economy.')
