The early geek bench results show the M1 laptops beating even the high end Intel Mac ones. And that&#x27;s with their most thermally constrained chip.<p>Apple will be releasing something like a M1X next, which will probably have way more cores and some other differences. But this M1 is incredibly impressive for this class of device. Intel has nothing near it to compete in this space.<p>The bigger question is how well does Apple keep up with AMD and Nvidia for GPUs and will they allow discrete GPUs.')
