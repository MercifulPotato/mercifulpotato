I could swear organic milk in a carton lasts at least twice as long as regular milk in a jug.<p>It <i>does</i> say ultra-pasteurized (the carton), so I guess I&#x27;ve been drinking basically-UHT organic milk along with regular.  The organic tastes way better to me, so maybe I don&#x27;t mind the UHT flavor (or lack thereof).  The milk I buy is all refrigerated fwiw, I haven&#x27;t tried room temperature UHT to compare taste.')
