I didn&#x27;t know about it at the time, so I just called 911, and they were very kind to me but their response was absolutely awful. It was pretty clear they weren&#x27;t trained for such conversations, and just send the police to pick me up. The police! Fortunately at the time I just needed <i>anybody</i> in the world to show that they didn&#x27;t want me to die, and that was just enough. But the hotline probably would have been more effective and not ended in me in a police cruiser.')
