You can only blame a small fraction of a nanosecond on the propagation delays there.  And let&#x27;s say we wanted to expand sideways, with only a 1 or 2 nanosecond budget for propagation delays.  With a relatively pessimistic assumption of signals going half the speed of light, that&#x27;s a diameter of 15cm or 30cm to fit our SRAM into.  That&#x27;s <i>enormous</i>.')
