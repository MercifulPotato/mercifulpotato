It&#x27;s a statement of the law covering protected plant varieties (a.k.a plant patents). That&#x27;s the contradiction.<p>How does this contradict me? The original text called it an agreement, _not_ me. My point is that it&#x27;s _not_ an agreement. This is what&#x27;s printed on the bag:<p>&gt; The recipient of the produce contained in this package agrees not to propagate or reproduce any portion of the produce, including &quot;but not limited to&quot; seeds, stems, tissue, and fruit.<p>In this whole thread I&#x27;d posited that this does not mean there is any agreement between the end recipient and the producer. Now you say this contradicts me, but it sounds like you actually _agree_ with me. I also wrote this a couple posts up:<p>&gt; There are of course other restrictions like patents that apply to everyone regardless of random text put on some plastic, but that&#x27;s another thing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24800561" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24800561</a><p>I honestly don&#x27;t understand your point.')
