Item(by='Someone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606210589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196694, text='<i>“And that&#x27;s useful if you have say, smart outdoor lights which could be out of your Wifi range.”</i><p>…and inside of that of you neighbor, and your WiFi can reach your neighbor’s WiFi. I have trouble imagining cases where that applies. The first part might apply if you have a large garden, your neighbor a tiny one, and you want lights all over your garden. However, that still wouldn’t help with the “your WiFi can reach your neighbor’s WiFi” part, unless that goes over the internet, via Amazon’s servers (introducing a new point of failure in the process)<p>I think the use case is more “where’s my dog&#x2F;child&#x2F;stolen laptop?”')
