Why not spell it out rather being so coy? Well we have different races of people. Why not work off that? It&#x27;s not like we lack diversity amongst human.<p>&gt; Then I remember how we treat animals in general<p>Oh I see now. It gets exhausting and boring to see everything twisted for the vegan agenda. You should see how we treat plants. Now that&#x27;s horrifying.<p>&gt; it makes me think we&#x27;d be destined to have a dominating species making all others miserable<p>99.99% of animals killed on earth aren&#x27;t killed by humans. Each day more animals are killed in nature than are killed by humans in a century. Most animals are made &quot;miserable&quot; by non-humans.
