The first doses are going to care homes which have a wildly disproportionate number of COVID cases that end up in hospitalization. I think it&#x27;s around 30%. And these people can also stay in the hospital longer, trying up beds.<p>Vaccinating these retirement homes, even with a single dose, should rapidly decrease the load on hospitals.<p>That&#x27;s why I think people aren&#x27;t being optimistic enough about recovery times. When 40% of the hospitalized cases are gone we can handle even a huge surge without overloading health systems. Since most lockdown metrics are based on hospital load, this means taking the country out of lockdown')
