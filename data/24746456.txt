Item(by='antifa-sux', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602430384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24746284, text='Seattle is dealing with a low grade left wing insurgency[0], just like Portland, which is intentionally starting fights with police, night after night, destroying private property, and occasionally killing someone, like Aaron Jay Danielson, or the two children killed by Antifa-BLM &quot;security&quot; in CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP. So the judge is right, but it has to do with the ongoing violent insurgency, not law abiding Americans peacefully exercising their rights. The only nonviolent protestors I&#x27;ve seen getting gassed are the ones giving direct cover to a Black Bloc.<p>[0] A report by Rutgers explaining the extent of the insurgency and its tactics and ideology <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncri.io&#x2F;reports&#x2F;network-enabled-anarchy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncri.io&#x2F;reports&#x2F;network-enabled-anarchy&#x2F;</a>')
