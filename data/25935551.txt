What&#x27;s the compliant about top line income? They make money from sales and from credits because governments want to incentivize the sale of electric cars.<p>My point is that the relevant thing seems to be unit economics. They seem to make a profit on most models, and the ones that aren&#x27;t profitable at the point of sale, seem to have the price of the credits factored in. What value would anyone get from looking at profitability ex-credits?')
