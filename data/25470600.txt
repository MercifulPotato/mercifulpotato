No one, except the attackers, knows the full depth or breadth of the attack. To make a positive id at this moment, and explain how investigators are attributing responsibility is reckless. Asking for evidence behind attribution at this time is essentially flamebait. If you doubt the attribution it may be better to question the record of those making these accusations and what they stand to gain by making them.')
