When first starting out I always had the thought &quot;OK, I&#x27;ll go full-time once I hit $2k MRR&quot;, or 3k MRR, or 4k, &quot;that&#x27;ll be enough&quot;, but once I&#x27;d hit that mark, I&#x27;d realized I just couldn&#x27;t do it because as my MRR grew my costs followed. I had to hit $8k MRR to be able to go full-time on my business, and even then that was taking a 60% pay-cut and a big leap of faith.')
