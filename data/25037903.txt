I preferred Android to iOS for the same reason.<p>Now that I&#x27;m working most of the time, however, I just want something that works. I don&#x27;t care about customizing all that much; I&#x27;ll leave it to the (mostly) great designers Apple pays. I really value being less concerned about the legitimacy of things I download or view, knowing that Apple&#x27;s choices to make a walled garden have protected me further.<p>Beyond myself, though, I&#x27;m immensely happy that my older, less tech-savvy parents have iPhones, and I bought my mother a MacBook which she has loved compared to her old desktop. All she wants to do are common tasks on it, and to accomplish them simply and quickly and without worrying about viruses.<p>I empathize with the jailbreaking community and honestly love how responsive you all are, and how you really make an effort to build things that bring people joy. I think there&#x27;s millions of people in the world that prefer to have jailbroken phones and more customization and freedom, but there&#x27;s also millions who prioritize as I do. There&#x27;s a pro and con to every choice.')
