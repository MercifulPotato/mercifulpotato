Cast iron is great for dishes that you want to sear, or that you want to finish in the oven or under a broiler.  Searing on most stainless pans doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well because the metal doesn&#x27;t retain its heat as zealously, and if you whack your little teflon pan in the oven you&#x27;ll ruin it.<p>Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of mythology around how to season the pans and how you need to baby them, etc.  That&#x27;s all BS.  The &quot;secret&quot; is to cook on your pan regularly, using a little more oil&#x2F;butter than you would on teflon, and don&#x27;t let your pan soak in soapy water.<p>If you scrape away the memes and the hype on blogs and on reddit from astroturfing accounts they&#x27;re dependable, versatile cookware and they&#x27;re not particularly expensive.  What&#x27;s not to like?')
