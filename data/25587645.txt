Basically it&#x27;s a leather, credit card sized holder for coins where each coin slips into a perfectly sized slot for that coin. I still use one the prototypes in my wallet today. I learned a ton about leather and manufacturing, a bit about videography, and what it takes to launch a kickstarter (much more than you think). Ultimately not enough people wanted one, though a few begged me to make them one at any price.<p>I still think a large manufacturer of wallets could easily popularize this as a standard wallet insert, but so few leather manufacturers are in the US anymore I couldn&#x27;t even contact them to give away the idea.')
