It’s weird.<p>There are lots of posts on HN I don’t care about, but I don’t think I’ve ever had the urge to make comments like yours.<p>&gt; In any case, the constant hate is (a) very tiring and (b) very uncharacteristic for HN.<p>There are people who trust their life and liberty on these apps, I don’t think the “hate” towards Telegram is inappropriate at all.<p>And actually, I think that most of the time the HN community is far too positive about Telegram. Usually I see comments criticizing it get downvoted.  Funny, no?')
