Happy to see it trending here.<p>I can tell you it isn&#x27;t intentional and you comment reads fair to me. The main thing I want to prevent is that people are teaching using this material without linking back to the source. It&#x27;s the whole &quot;people claiming it as their own&quot; that I&#x27;m keen to omit. I used a generator in this case because I&#x27;m not well versed with legalese. I&#x27;ll gladly hear any advice on this.')
