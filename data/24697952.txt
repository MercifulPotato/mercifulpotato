Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601994358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697740, text='&gt; Can someone with experience with this help me understand the point of a PR team to talk to press?<p>Simple: PR teams are some sort of equivalent to the &quot;triage&quot; at emergency rooms. Basically they scan incoming requests for stuff that could land the company in hot legal water or signalize a coming shitstorm (e.g. if journalists ask for information regarding potentially damaging stories during their research), misdirected customer service stuff (pretty common, especially in companies ... not exactly known for decent CS reps), youtubers&#x2F;other influencers looking for merch gear, shareholders inquiring about financial or other information, movie makers &#x2F; photographers interested in showing off company products, reps of athletes wanting a sponsorship deal... all of this usually goes through the PR dept who forward it to the appropriate departments or answer on their own.<p>The key role &#x2F; function of a good PR team is that the individual departments don&#x27;t get flooded by bullshit (you don&#x27;t want to waste the expensive time of the legal dept on a youtuber wanting a Tesla for a rap music video).')
