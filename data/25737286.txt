I do get feedback from friends, what is nice, but feedback that&#x27;s a lot more more in depth&#x2F; technical with knowledge from the perspective of other developers would be very helpful.<p>My main questions would be:\n- any weird stuff going on that I might not realised (technical&#x2F; graphical)\n- Are the tutorial&#x2F; early levels good to understand (and thereby the game rules it self)\n- Is the amount of ad&#x27;s alright for a 100% free game\n- any unclear in game options&#x2F; texts\n- is the amount of puzzles good like this? (total, per &quot;world&quot; and extra puzzle sets)<p>Please keep it all positive, I know not everything is perfect and the game might not be for you. But I do approach it seriously. I&#x27;m not looking to do big chances, mostly fine-tuning and polish. But still(!) bigger tips&#x2F; feedback will be very valuable for the next projects.<p>Thank you so much!\nMarc (form The Netherlands)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.AlmostABoardgame.CityBuilder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.AlmostABoa...</a><p>as a extra thank you, I can add your name&#x2F; company&#x2F; website&#x2F; ... whatever to the credit-list.
