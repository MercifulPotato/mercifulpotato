Winner-take-all. A few profit at the expense of the many.<p>This is a major problem that the project has made a sincere attempt to address.  Through scarcity certain sybil protections are afforded, which has been inherently architected into the consensus protocol [1].  Additionally, an airdrop to many internet pioneers and open source developers was built in as well, giving everyone similar resources to participate in the auction system which, in turn, affords everyone more equality in participation.  Finally, the top 100k names as per alexa were pre-reserved for the holders in the alexa list, and these sites are incentivized to properly setup DNSSEC, as that&#x27;s the only way they can claim their name on handshake.<p>This is a win for internet security and internet users.  It&#x27;s absolutely a big win for freedom of speech.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt</a>')
