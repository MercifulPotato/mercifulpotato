I have used it for about a year and I thought during that time that it was &quot;osx on linux&quot;, because of how well integrated everything was.<p>The Plasma desktop and the KDE project have been known historically to very well integrate their softwares with one another, but Neon is going a step further, by controlling the OS itself and being way less buggy that other distributions of the Plasma desktop.<p>That would probably be a good transition OS coming from Apple products, before people get a taste for chaos and pure freedom and want to go wild.')
