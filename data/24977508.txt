If you only taxed people when there is a dividend or salary payment, a savvy CEO of a private company could follow the tax advice of &quot;borrow, buy, die&quot;. Instead of taking a huge salary, the CEO would borrow money to pay for everything, using the shares of the company as collateral. Then when the CEO dies, the loans are repaid out of the estate. And the basis in the remaining shares is stepped up when passed to heirs.<p>So while you can get rid of corporate taxation, the tax treatment of natural persons at death means that folks could greatly reduce the amount of income realized during their lifetime.')
