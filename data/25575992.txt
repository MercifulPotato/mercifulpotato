Item(by='frongpik', descendants=None, kids=[25577137, 25576064], score=None, time=1609281896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573989, text='IIRC, one big problem of the strings theory was the shape of those strings: the theory allows many, but our universe uses one and we don&#x27;t know which one.<p>I think there&#x27;s a good candidate for this shape. Many books, rather old, but completely inadmissible in the court of modern science, describe the smallest particle in a way that curiously resembles a string. The string forms a coil, very similar to a wire coil in electromagnets, that revolves almost 3 times around the central axis and then returns back to the entrance. The outer shape is an oblate spheroid and the entire thing is dynamically stable. The coil itself carries electricity, and because of its shape, it produces a magnetic field that streams thru the center. The particle performs rapid gyrations around the central axis - that&#x27;s probably the same effect as the Lamour precession. There are two types of this particle: one with clockwise direction of the coil and the other with counterclockwise. The string enters and exits the area in a direction perpendicular to all 3 dimensions, so it kind of appears from nowhere. The string itself is made of a finer coil, and that of even finer coil and so on a few times. If the 10 dimensions guess is correct, then there are probably 6 or 7 such finer coils. If the entire thing is unrolled, it would form a circle of very large radius. While such a particle, that probably corresponds to the electron, has enormously complex internal structure, it&#x27;s still a fundamental particle of 3d world, because cutting the string in any place makes it recombine into numerous tiny coiled strings, but all of them freely float along the 4th dimension and barely interact with the 3d particles, so they become kind of background noise of unknown origin. The magnetic stream that flows thru the central axis of each 3d particle is made of these tiny 4d particles, and those probably replicate the entire arrangement at a smaller scale, so there probably are even smaller 5d coiled strings and so on.<p>Like I&#x27;ve said, this kind of description is inadmissible in science, but it&#x27;s ok to &quot;guess&quot; it and invent a plausible explanation that this shape minimizes some weird functional in a hilbert space of the strings theory.')
