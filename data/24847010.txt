Item(by='Tomte', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603282525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846982, text='&gt; and that is working as intended?<p>I cannot reconcile your claim with those quotations from the GitHub issue:<p>&gt; It&#x27;s frustrating, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a permanent situation. A lot of work has already been done on pre-compling Julia code, and when that&#x27;s extended to packages, things should be much better.<p>&gt; Making this stuff more convenient is definitely desirable and will happen.<p>&gt; Agreed. But do keep in mind that the procedure I outlined allows you to avoid precisely this problem, with very little effort<p>&gt; That would be nice. It will happen when someone makes it happen.')
