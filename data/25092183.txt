When I was learning it in school, TCP&#x2F;IP sure seemed complicated with frame numbers and window sizes and whatnot. It seems much more simple to me now. I suspect that everything sounds like &quot;useless, complex theory&quot; until you understand it and use it regularly, and then it mysteriously transforms into &quot;obvious, simple practical knowledge&quot;.<p>Are transactional databases useless theory or simple and pragmatic? Hash tables? Nagle&#x27;s algorithm? CRDTs? SSA compilers? Your answer probably says more about your experience than it does about the technologies themselves.<p>And thats why I don&#x27;t trust Linus&#x27;s rant. He&#x27;s familiar with the garbage fire of the current posix filesystem APIs. I suspect deep down he&#x27;s just arguing from status quo bias and doesn&#x27;t like the &quot;useless theory&quot; of transactional filesystems because he hasn&#x27;t seen the practical side of them and he hasn&#x27;t thought through how they could be implemented efficiently in the kernel. And thats fine; but it might mean if we want transactional filesystems to happen in linux, it might make sense to start by implementing them in a BSD.')
