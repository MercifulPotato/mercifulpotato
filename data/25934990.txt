One big difference is that Twitter exists, so now you get to hear directly from certain CEOs outside of highly polished and rehearsed presentations, whereas 10 years ago the public never got that chance.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started about what people said about Amazon&#x27;s profitability and fiscal stability 10-15 years ago. Amazon&#x27;s PE ratio was around 4000 whereas Tesla&#x27;s is 1500.<p>My speculation, and that&#x27;s all it is, speculation, is that for the most part people invest in companies that they want to see succeed and by investing in it, they become a kind of participant in the future growth and success of the company. It&#x27;s mostly a place for people to park their money in a venture that they want to see flourish. There is no magic formula you plug into an Excel spreadsheet and get out a perfect stock price, there is no metric that can reliably be used to press a button to invest. You see a company working in an area you are interested in and that has a chance to succeed in, you have a positive feeling about the company, its products, its people, then you invest.<p>Good luck finding a stable, fiscally responsible and reliable company that ticks off all the fundamental indicators, a CEO who is a rock who never offends anyone or anything, and has a stock that does more than barely beat the rate of inflation and maybe pays out a measly 1-2% dividend.<p>The reality is that if the degree to which you value a stock is based on its PE ratio and other na√Øve but nice sounding metrics, then to be blunt you&#x27;re no more sophisticated an investor than the people blowing their money on GME.')
