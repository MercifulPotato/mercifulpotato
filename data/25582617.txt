We&#x27;re one of the most litigious, punitive, and highly regulated nations on the planet.  The only freedoms people usually care about are speech and guns; there&#x27;s more but nobody really cares about them and just lets their lawyers figure that confusing stuff out.  If we value freedom, it&#x27;s the freedom for multinational corporations to control people.')
