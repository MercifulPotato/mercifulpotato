Down the street, hours before this Trump held a rally where Rudy Giuliani and others incited followers to subject their enemies to &quot;trial by combat.&quot;<p>One hour before the tally started Trump took the stage and riled his crowd up. Shortly after 1pm he told them to march to the Capitol building up the street to confront &quot;weak&quot; Republicans so they could make &quot;the right choice.&quot;<p>Within minutes his mob was storming the building.<p>This was cold calculated sedition. If contesting the results wasn&#x27;t going to work he intended his mob to make it work by intimidating &quot;weak&quot; Republicans. Instead it made most of the ones contesting drop out of the effort.<p>Shopify can drop Donald like a sack of bricks because -sedition- -treason-. These are not light words to throw around. But no one forced Trump, his family, and the GOP to take things this far. No one forced them to lie to their followers until they were radicalized and primed for riots and seditious behavior.<p>Please don&#x27;t defend this as-if it was just another political game. Companies don&#x27;t have a requirement to be involved in this. You are going to see a lot of people and corporations float as far away as possible from Trump and co and it has nothing to do with culture war garbage. There was sedition yesterday and it has been fostered institutionally by certain persons and entities, recognize this.')
