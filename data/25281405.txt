DNA mutation brings you closer to developing cancer. Even if these substances don&#x27;t reach your DNA, they could cause other deleterious effects to your cellular biochemistry that might have downstream impact.<p>Proteins, fats, and carbs are much less dangerous than some of the other things we ingest, inhale, and apply.<p>It helps to know some basic chemistry and biochemistry. It&#x27;s all about the chemistry. Cancer is a disease state caused by biochemical phenomena.<p>(Fun fact: Oxygen is one of the most reactive things you put in your body. But there isn&#x27;t any escaping that. The reaction is how we sustain life.)')
