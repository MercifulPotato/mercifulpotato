This lesson was learned the hard way.  Must we keep on relearning it?<p>&gt;  I think this is false simplification - again, in complex applications with lots of interaction, there is no escaping the coupling of DOM nodes, JS logic, and styles.<p>This assertion is quite wrong and misguided.  Styling is a property of a site&#x27;s visual identity.  It is not a property of a component or a specific interaction state.  Any well-designed site follows a uniform visual identity which spans over all aspects pertaining to user interactions.  Moreover, UI components are also uniform and reused.  There is no excuse.')
