I&#x27;m arguing for the state one lives in having no impact on how much one&#x27;s vote for president counts. I never said that the US should eliminate federalism and run everything directly out of DC.<p>&gt; Under a popular vote we might as well disband congress.<p>I don&#x27;t follow your logic here. Based on my reasoning, it would make sense to either make Senate representation proportional to population, or to disband the Senate altogether, but some representative legislative body obviously has to remain. The House of Representatives is just such a body.')
