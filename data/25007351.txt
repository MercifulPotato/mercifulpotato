In 1999 (thanks to a procurement mistake) I was reading my e-mail and browsing documentation on a wicked fast 64-bit computer. It would be a good couple more years before I could edit a Word document on a 64-bit computer because Microsoft didn&#x27;t have Office for them. I only got to read e-mail on that ridiculously fast Unix workstation because nobody wanted to use it and it was just sitting there running our timesheet software and magnificent screensavers.<p>Multi-processor x86 desktop machines only became popular when Windows XP became popular. Multi-processor Macs only became popular when Apple moved to OSX. IBM only added multi-processor support for their mainframes when they hit a dead end and had to move to machines with slower CMOS processors with more processors to make up for the speed they lost.<p>Software dynamics holds hardware evolution back.')
