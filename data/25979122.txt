Many people seem to make a wild leap from &quot;at a deeply microscopic scale, we have to use statistics to predict what&#x27;s going to happen because it&#x27;s not nearly as deterministic as it is in the macroscopic world&quot; to &quot;at a quantum level, all of our brains are resonating in quantum harmony and that&#x27;s why my cat is so intuitive&quot;<p>Wonderful typo with &quot;landmind&quot; by the way. It&#x27;s perfect!')
