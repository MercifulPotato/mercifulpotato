Item(by='daenz', descendants=None, kids=[25703039], score=None, time=1610212675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='A &quot;survival wiki.&quot; I built it for myself. It&#x27;s mediawiki on a raspberry pi zero, AC&#x2F;DC powered, with an e-ink display. It connects automatically to a known wifi network and displays the connection details. When the wifi network goes down however, it automatically switches to access-point mode, allowing you to connect directly to it through your phone or other wifi client device.<p>There&#x27;s still some quirks to work out, but it works well. I store personal knowledge on it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about rebooting my primary computer (and taking down the wiki), or a power outage preventing me from accessing my information.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1CTYjKq0DLYVV7LBktW-bQrxZv2FadGIx&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1CTYjKq0DLYVV7LBktW-bQrxZv2F...</a>')
