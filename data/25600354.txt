You don’t want your employees to do it because it’s requires a specially trained employee and having them around increases you workers comp insurance significantly, and they also want hazard pay as a result of their training.   Buuut you can go down the street and hire Jo from the corner to take it off your hands for $50. He doesn’t care how dangerous it is, he just needs money for heroin. You can just report that you didn’t produce the waste he’s taking and nobody will be the wiser.<p>Should you hire Jo to take care of it, or handle it yourself? You understand the danger, know how to handle the material, and have the means to dispose of it in an equitable way to everyone. Would hiring Jo be right, simply because he’d be $50 poorer if I didn’t hire him?')
