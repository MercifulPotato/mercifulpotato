I mean, <i>is</i> that your point? What is your point? Being nasty to people?<p>&gt; two example bills right in front of us that we can look at to tell us in detail what...<p>I don&#x27;t think anybody was arguing with you about that. But maybe I just can&#x27;t follow the thread of the argument anymore.<p>Both parties were behind the 2008 bailouts. Both parties screw people. Both parties would most likely support more bailouts, and&#x2F;or other corrupt things. We don&#x27;t need the two stimulus bills to confirm or deny either of those facts.
