I found I could memorize 1-3 items per minute, which very high recall hours and days later. The structure between items was readily apparent, so that I could, for instance, easily estimate that there were ~650 million years between the first terrestrial eukaryotes and first appearance of sharks.<p>The streets have acquired new meaning and the process was really quite enjoyable. With this tool, I actually want to learn the structure of many more things.')
