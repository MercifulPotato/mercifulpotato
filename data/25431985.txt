I wasn&#x27;t a member of many groups, and I realized I mostly followed organizations and entities. Well, I also followed people, but they were all reluctant social media users. They didn&#x27;t post, so I found no value in Facebook any longer. It was easy for me to leave.<p>I un-followed everyone on Twitter some-time ago and set up TweetDelete to delete all my tweets after 2 weeks. I started re-following select accounts on Twitter, and it&#x27;s not that many. In fact, I frequently find no new content on Twitter, so I am free to ignore it for a while.<p>I also found that I unfollow any accounts from humans that post too often. Anyone who&#x27;s sitting on Twitter all day... I don&#x27;t want to follow. Not very often is it valuable. Even the reasonable constant-posters, they&#x27;re just jacked into their twitter-sphere. I don&#x27;t need that. It&#x27;s a weird thing, to have a job and crank out 20-40 tweets&#x2F;day.')
