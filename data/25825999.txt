Item(by='Netcob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611000531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825244, text='Integrations for time-tracking software with issue tracking software exists, but I&#x27;ve never actually seen them used in combination before. You&#x27;d think that issue trackers would always include a very user-friendly time tracker by default, and advertise integrations with popular time trackers just to get that &quot;actual time spent&quot; data. I&#x27;ve also never looked at a burndown chart with any particular interest after knowing you can close an 8h issue after .5h and a .5h issue after 8h of work and the issue tracker will just keep pretending its charts mean anything.<p>Yet any company that does a lot of the same work could probably use that. You&#x27;d still need to do some extra work and tag your issues by things that you want to observe (and maybe predict), but then you could say things like &quot;after we switched to that fancy new API client generator, our client development times went way down but debugging times went up a bit&quot;. And the system could display some time range while you&#x27;re writing the issue. You could also look at the issues at the end of a sprint and then merge them with other items from the time tracker to see how meetings and other distractions played into the outcome.')
