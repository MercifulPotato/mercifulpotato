I think the &quot;monkeys&quot; (they&#x27;re apes of course) are just as likely to damn us for it, if it happened.<p>Who decides what is of value, that &quot;sapience&quot; is an absolute value we are required to work towards? There is no answer to this <i>we have access to</i> except we ourselves decide.<p>Therefore, there is no &quot;responsibility&quot; from outside ourselves, certainly not some kind of external responsibility to prioritize some values (creating more &quot;intelligent&quot; species) over other values (not creating frankenstein monsters with capacity for incredible suffering).<p>I think living beings that lack recognized-by-us &quot;sapience&quot; still have their own inherent value that must be respected. To suggest that becoming <i>more like us</i> is their only destiny is to disrespect them as they are, they don&#x27;t need to be more like us to be respectable.')
