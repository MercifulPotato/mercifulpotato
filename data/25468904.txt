It&#x27;s been 8 months since I&#x27;ve seen a proper N95 mask on store shelves. Hearing that someone close was going through the same thing as your partner, bringing home used masks and having to hit the black market&#x2F;eBay for respirators with cartridges so they wouldn&#x27;t become lightheaded when transporting patients all day was shocking. I think what&#x27;s even more sad is how few tech companies opened their hearts, wallets, innovations, or resources to tackling this PPE situation.')
