Even with many cases, contact tracing at the margin can reduce $R_t$. Even in the UK, until the last 2 weeks or so, there were very few cases relative to how many there are now. Especially since covid appears to spread through a disproportionate number of super-spreading incidents compared to say the flu (ie. very right-tailed distribution in the number of people you infect with covid) means that contact tracing can be particularly effective.')
