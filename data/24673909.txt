Like I said, there are gaps so it’s not an entirely intact chronology.<p>In the first two or three minutes of the trip (which felt like much longer), I had this perception of “understanding everything” about reality and consciousness. During this time, I was lookin around the room and enjoying the vivid colors that were overlaying everything. Then a very intense and pleasant vibration occurred. After this, I attempted to play Guitar Hero. This only lasted for exactly one note before I started being pulled through the time period of the trip - I felt my perception <i>forced</i> backwards along the exact path that my eyes had initially taken through the room. In this manner, I was pulled forwards and backwards in a sort of loop. I tried to stand up at one point and knocked over a Coke bottle, and I perceived that bottle falling over multiple times. Same for my friend and tripsitter breaking up a post-trip bowl of cannabis. At one point my perception had come to what seemed like the “now” moment and just kinda stopped or got extremely slow. My thoughts went to the idea of whether I was dead and the looping was the experience of death, so I asked “am I dead?” My sitter told me that “you’re more alive than you’ve ever been”. After that, my trajectory through time continued until I felt a similar vibration to the earlier one, except it felt more dreadful. After that subsided, normal “reality” started to fade back in, with me becoming able to tug back against whatever was pulling me through time. It was very surreal. Even once the afterglow faded, my mind was clear for the first time in 20 years. I could think about <i>nothing</i> if I wanted to. Anyone with ADHD will understand how difficult that normally is.')
