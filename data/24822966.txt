So what happens when the hypothetical COVID-2 comes around in a few years, which is 20x deadlier than this pandemic and kills people uniformly across age groups. What do we do?<p>Do we just have to die, because heaven forbid we infringe on people&#x27;s rights to go out to restaurants and buy their khakis? We can&#x27;t make people wear masks, and we can&#x27;t make them stay home? So everyone just gets the disease and a big proportion of the world just dies. This is what people want??<p>Honestly, I think we are lucky this one didn&#x27;t turn out to be as deadly as it could have been. COVID should be a wake-up call, and it <i>should</i> cause us to come up with an actual pandemic plan--so that when a more deadly one comes, we can shut up and save lives rather than argue about whether someone has a constitutional right to get their nails done without wearing a mask.')
