I have a 2015 Macbook Pro right here next to my Acer E5-575G with 15.6&quot; Full HD (1080p) screen.<p>Comparing them directly - I have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. Fonts, images and the UI look just as good if not better. I&#x27;ll say better since I think the Mac UI is hideous.<p>You&#x27;re right though - it&#x27;s definitely not about screen real-estate because with Retina&#x2F;2k&#x2F;4k the OS typically has to scale everything up so you basically lose any real-estate that would have been gained in the first place. That&#x27;s ridiculous IMO.<p>The only place I use Retina&#x2F;2k&#x2F;4k is for gaming and movies and I definitely am not doing either of those activities on a lowly laptop.')
