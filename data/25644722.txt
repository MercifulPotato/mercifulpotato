As soon as Earth and Mars come within 10 minutes of each other the main Blockchain (presumably on Earth) will prevail, and the consensus will be that the coins mined on Mars are worthless. Any new coins generated during this alignment may be valid depending on if the timings match up but the Mars miners will always be at a distinct disadvantage.')
