My favorite example is doorknobs - think of a round doorknob vs one with a lever. \nPeople with broken&#x2F;missing fingers&#x2F;hands or fine motor impairments will have a much easier time opening a door with a simple lever vs gripping and turning a round doorknob, <i>and so will a person with two fully intact hands who is also carrying groceries</i>.\n(edit: corrected italics)')
