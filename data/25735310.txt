On the flip side it&#x27;s been shown that all but a very small fraction of that 10% will use the data sale funded version of these services it&#x27;s all that&#x27;s offered.<p>So it ultimately comes down to &quot;do we create an alternative funding model for that 1 percent of user space&quot; which doesn&#x27;t seem like much incentive vs trying to find ways to get more more out of the 99% of users.<p>I think the only way this changes is if that userbase grows significantly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s simply been an overlooked&#x2F;forgotten internet business model.')
