That way, when you run a bad command, you are told immediately that things are being deleted<p>This gives me an idea:  Hell Linux.  In Hell Linux, the operating system does its best to pretend that nothing is wrong, so it takes you as long as possible to realize that you&#x27;ve made a mistake.  Commands ignore all unrecognized flags.  In shell scripts, if one branch exits with a nonzero exit code, the other branch is taken.  stderr is always redirected to &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null.   0 exit code is reported for all processes, no matter how they terminate.  If you try to exec a file that doesn&#x27;t exist, it runs a process that does nothing and immediately exits, unless it is part of a pipeline, in which case it consumes standard in.  If you try to read a .json file that doesn&#x27;t exist, you get the bytes &quot;{}&quot;.  When you read a log file, any lines containing &quot;ERROR&quot; or &quot;WARN&quot; are skipped.  If you try to connect to a port that nothing is listening on, it does its best to behave like the service that should be listening there.  Oh, the possibilities....')
