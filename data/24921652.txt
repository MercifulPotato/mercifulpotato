The RX580 worked lovely for VIM, but... went on a grand adventure to get their drivers working.  Oh what a pain.  Took me, with my limited knowledge most of that time to sort out the potion miscibility roles between steam, centos, and amd.<p>About January, they released a set of updates where all the planets aligned.  Went from a grand adventure to a handful of commands.  The rest of this year has continued to be a non-event for updates.  I&#x27;ll be looking at one of the ATI cards as lord knows I&#x27;ve failed to find any 3080s, of any make, in stock since launch.')
