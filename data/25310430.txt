Really?<p>It&#x27;s not ideal that algorithmic biases exist - and to the extent that it&#x27;s feasible unbiased algorithms should be used, and mitigations provided for biases that cannot be avoided completely.<p>However, it&#x27;s not always possible - and we probably shouldn&#x27;t avoid all progress just because it cannot be universally applied.<p>In image recognition (within the visible spectrum) people of dark complexion will always have an algorithmic bias against them - as will any relatively low contrast picture.<p>This isn&#x27;t the result of racial biases in researchers, or the data sets, or the ever oppressive totalitarian system - black people reflect less light so their features are harder to distinguish.<p>There&#x27;s simply no possibility for any racially unbiased facial recognition algorithms.<p>I don&#x27;t know the solution here, but it should be a considered response and not a knee jerk reaction.')
