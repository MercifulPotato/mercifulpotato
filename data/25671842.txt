When I think back far enough to my daughter&#x27;s elementary school education, teachers were trying to develop it by at least 4th grade (9-10yo). Starting the next year, she had classes in civics that continued through to high school (14-18yo) where she is now. As I write this comment, her world history class is discussing yesterday&#x27;s events in DC in a point&#x2F;counter-point fashion.<p>Despite the effort to develop critical thinking skills, a small but not insignificant number of students parrot what they watch on questionable news outlets.')
