We have never moved past the phase where the concept of &quot;zero&quot; was heretic.<p>Even in maths it&#x27;s pretty bad, because the Natural numbers still sometimes don&#x27;t include 0, so that the 0th Natural number is 1, the 1th natural number is 2 etc. (using 1th instead of 1st to avoid the confusing nature of &quot;first&quot; in this discussion).')
