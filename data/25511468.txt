Don&#x27;t participate if you wont explain your position and won&#x27;t address arguments.<p>As I said and you didn&#x27;t address - this is a powers issue. Governments don&#x27;t just get granted one singular law and nothing else. That kind of law gives them overall power to regulate. If a government can tell a private entity that they have to host user content they don&#x27;t want - then they can do the opposite as well.<p>If your not familiar with powers issues then you have a lot of education infront of you.')
