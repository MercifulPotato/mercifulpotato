Nevertheless, this still feels like splitting hairs and&#x2F;or not seeing the forest from the trees. Powerful people have always had extra influence over societal changes. Someone working 70-80hrs&#x2F;wk striving to make ends meet has far less time or ability to develop ideas or drive influence, as do people with little education or with health conditions, people shut out of certain parts of society, etc. Meanwhile someone born into privilege with time, connections, education, and wealth can participate in this game of ideas and influence and become a better wielder of those.<p>What I said before didn&#x27;t imply people without power do not also have responsibilities, just that those with power have more, because of their position in society. Part (perhaps much) of that responsibility is to work towards a better society; I used &#x27;fixing&#x27; as shorthand for this. In the US that is &#x27;a more perfect union&#x27; but there are other concepts enshrined in other countries. I don&#x27;t think this is a particularly controversial position to take.<p>Similarly the concept of &#x27;with power comes responsibility&#x27; reappears throughout human history and I don&#x27;t think is controversial.<p>Maybe we&#x27;re in agreement on this, I can&#x27;t tell from the way you&#x27;re picking things apart. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to politely bow out.')
