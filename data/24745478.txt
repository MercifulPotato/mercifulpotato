Going with index funds is no more and no less than investing in the entire market, so unless the entire stock market fails (i.e., every publicly traded company collapses, which would be akin to the economy collapsing), you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>And even if there&#x27;s a major rout, if you put in a little every month via continuous, automatic investing (sometimes mistakenly labelled &quot;dollar cost averaging&quot;), you&#x27;ll probably do well over the long term. Someone putting a little in at a time (which most of us do monthly for retirement) would have even done pretty well through the 1930s Great Depression (notwithstanding high unemployment, etc) to come out on the other end 25+ years later.<p>If you believe the economy will completely collapse and not ever recover you&#x27;re also likely to be someone who has an underground bunker.')
