I was thinking maybe something like creating Docker containers on the dedicated server, but I&#x27;m not sure how the management&#x2F;provisioning&#x2F;resource sharing would work, plus I assume it would still need extra IPs and stuff like that for each VPS.<p>It would be nice to have like a Control Panel where you can link dedicated servers, and then provision VPSs on them using an UI like the one on DigitalOcean. But I guess this would mean having a complete DO competitor (without the hardware part) :D')
