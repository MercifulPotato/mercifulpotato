You specify the rhyming scheme (ABAB CDCD etc) and it forces end-line rhymes around it.<p>It uses Markov chains instead of GPT-2, but the approach should work with prompt-based things like GPT-2 also: for lines that are &quot;free&quot; (e.g. no specific word you need to rhyme with), you can generate the line normally -- but for lines you need to rhyme with a specific word, you can just generate last-word-first and generate backwards. For a strictly LTR prompt like GPT-2, you could probably just reverse your corpus word order, generate &quot;reverse&quot; lines with GPT-2 given the previous line + word you need to rhyme with as the prompt, and then reverse it back to &quot;normal&quot; in postprocessing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;festivalpeak.com&#x2F;stylistic-rhyme-bound-poetry-generation-or-how-you-too-can-generate-sonnets-in-the-style-of-kanye-754639fc0373" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;festivalpeak.com&#x2F;stylistic-rhyme-bound-poetry-genera...</a><p>Some examples of the output of this approach:<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;words-of-mimicry&#x2F;kanye-west-ballade-1-a6fce0251697" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;words-of-mimicry&#x2F;kanye-west-ballade-1-a6f...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;words-of-mimicry&#x2F;me-you-and-slow-sip-slow-8ac731683afc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;words-of-mimicry&#x2F;me-you-and-slow-sip-slow...</a><p>I&#x27;d expect the output to be better with something like GPT-2&#x2F;3, since Markov chains are so twentieth-century, but I was pretty happy at the output quality even though it often rhymed the same word repeatedly; you could improve it by weighting previously-used words, removing them from the pool of rhyming words, and&#x2F;or backtracking to previous lines when you find yourself without other words to rhyme.')
