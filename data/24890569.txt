I never have anything of great value on my laptop or desktop, and I use them mainly to communicate with bigger machines in data centers (or websites like ycombinator and Twitter). If I haven’t got pushed recently I might lose a little work if the endpoint gets broken but I mostly push too often rather than not enough. (My commits don’t all have a Jira number). I do like a screen big enough to have two files side by side but I prefer not to have everything visible at once as it reduces my concentration on the one thing I am doing. Multiple tmux windows or an excessive number of emacs buffers will remember the state of those tasks till I need them again.  It is a shame I need 32G of ram to let all the corporate spyware run and have it be as fast as an 8G from\nten years ago, but ssh and emacs are still reasonably snappy. Basically the same setup with more pixels and slower UI as when i did the same work (different languages and less compute) over a 14.4 modem. But I also have enough spare local compute and bandwidth to have a browser tab playing music from YouTube somewhere while I work instead of from the CD player.')
