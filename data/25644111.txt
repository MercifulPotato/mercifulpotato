There&#x27;s an insurmountable skills shortage in tech and always will be. Appetite for automation, efficiency and software solutions is practically unbounded.<p>Fact is, software salaries are sky high because there&#x27;s no union.<p>No high performer would ever willingly join a union so his salary can be halved or worse with the difference given to someone who is far less good at their job and is essentially unfireable.<p>Teachers unions ruined education, and a software union would similarly ruin software by protecting the worse engineers and dragging salaries down of high performers.<p>The best teacher in the US is paid identically to the worst teacher. No wonder education is a disaster.')
