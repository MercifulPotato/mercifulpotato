I meant that a positive PCR test <i>without any symptoms</i> can&#x27;t tell you if:<p>- you&#x27;re about to have the disease (presymptomatic)<p>- you have the disease (asymptomatic)<p>- you already cleared the virus<p>You <i>might</i> be infectious, but you don&#x27;t know. And given the  time window of infectiousness, delays in testing can give you a &quot;positive, please isolate&quot; notice when it&#x27;s too late, and you potentially have spread the virus to others without knowing.<p>OTOH, antigen tests detect virus proteins (with far lower sensitivity), so it&#x27;s far more likely that you have an active infection if you are positive.')
