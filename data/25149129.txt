We are currently working on a _simple_ account management portal backed by our PostgreSQL instance. This will print out a monthly table with your bandwidth usage&#x2F;quota and provide a Web Interface + API to purchase more bandwidth, add drives, etc. Our design is API first, with a simple wrapper around the API as our Web UI. They both will be well-documented and functionally the same.<p>This Hacker News soft launch was mainly to see if we could generate enough users to purchase a second and third server and scale-out. And by the looks of it, we can!<p>---<p>As for downloading large files directly to the instance, I&#x27;m with you 100%. That&#x27;s exactly one one of the use cases. (I&#x27;m looking at you: massive linux ISOs and +30 GB Xilinx toolchains.) Personally, I like to download them first to a remote machine (takes about 5-10 minutes for 30 GB) and slowly rsync them to my local dev machine with `rsync --partial --bwlimit=10M`.<p>Think of this service as $5&#x2F;month DigitalOcean VPS, but it happens to have a hefty native storage unit passed through.<p>You can SSH into it and do whatever you want with it. In fact, you don&#x27;t even have to run ZFS. You could run any filesystem -- EXT4, XFS, BTRFS, etc. Compute-wise, it&#x27;s not going to be anything groundbreaking -- just a 16-core Ryzen 3700 with a couple of cores passed through to you. Ryzen CPUs support ECC and are still priced as consumer-CPUs which is fantastic.<p>The nice thing about KVM is that even if you don&#x27;t explicity allocate CPU resources, if the guest machine needs to burst compute, it will &quot;Steal time&quot; from the hypervisor as long as there is extra headroom. This isn&#x27;t the case with RAM. (For RAM, whatever you set, that is the hard maximum limit.)')
