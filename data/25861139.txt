They made what amounts to a shell company in Belize so they can get a bunch of IP addresses from LACNIC.<p>To the extent LACNIC handled this situation poorly, their poor handling began when they gave DDoS-Guard IPs in the first place.<p>This is how things went:<p>1.) LACNIC erroneously gave IP space to DDoS-Guard, a Russian company<p>2.) Someone did LACNIC&#x27;s research for them and said &#x27;Hey, you know that company isn&#x27;t really based in Belize.&#x27;<p>3.) LACNIC did their own investigation, concurred, and revoked the IP space.<p>The real story is how LACNIC apparently does little-to-no due dilligence before handing out IP space. And then it took an American man to do cursory research for LACNIC to actually figure out that LACNIC was being lied to by a duplicitous Russian company trying to get cheap IP space in violation of LACNIC policy.')
