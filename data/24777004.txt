This worked out to be either 1 season each year on an actual team (competing against other schools); or 2 &quot;seasons&quot; each year of non competative play (e.g. pick-up games of ultimate frisbee, or joining the cross country team for training runs). They would take attendence each day, and you get credit based on how many times you show up (with no requirement that the days you show up are even in the same year; the only time a teacher would complain about you missing a day is if you need the credit to graduate).<p>You could also get credit for sports you do outside of the school.')
