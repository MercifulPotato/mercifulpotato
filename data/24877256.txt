That&#x27;s literally how the entire world&#x27;s building codes work. You have regrettable accidents that are deemed avoidable, and thus to ensure they don&#x27;t happen again you pass building code legislation that stops people from making the same mistakes over and over again.<p>I mean, even the grenfell tower fire triggered building code changes, and that was hardly caused by racism. Every time there is a major accident regulatory bodies scramble to check if anything should be done to avoid further accidents due to the same root cause. Why should this particular case be interpreted any differently?')
