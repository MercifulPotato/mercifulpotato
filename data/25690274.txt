If you stated that you cannot send an iMessage from a non-Apple device to an Apple device, then you&#x27;d be correct. However, an iMessage is not a text. Any text capable device is able to send a text to any other text capable device. If the app one reads those texts is called WhatsApp, iMessage, or ImTooStupidToKnowTheDifference.app, it doesn&#x27;t matter.')
