The bull case was made for GME as far back as late 2019, and it gained momentum this year.<p>That argument was made last year and early this year.  The argument this <i>week</i> has been that the stock price will increase specifically because of a short squeeze, and the popular comment on WSB has been that buying and&#x2F;or holding GME stock is a rebellious act that will cause that short squeeze to happen.<p>If deliberately causing a short squeeze constitutes illegal market manipulation, then at least some of the WSB comments advocate for going over that line.  On the other hand, the SEC would probably have its hands full linking these comments to actual trades that were meaningful enough to move the stock price -- SEC rules aren&#x27;t written with a horde of enraged small-dollar investors in mind as the culprits.<p>Notice that RoaringKitty has taken profits from his GME holdings over the past few weeks, most recently about two days ago, and has <i>not</i> continued buying into the stock.<p>&gt; I lost multiple years worth of salary this morning when RobinHood decided to stop selling GME.<p>With all due respect, GME has been a highly speculative play for at least this entire week.  It&#x27;s not a good idea to speculate with money that you can&#x27;t afford to lose.')
