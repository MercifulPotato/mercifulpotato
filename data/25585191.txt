But more important is internal consistency - and adherence to the consistency rules of the eco-system. This allows to deduce naming of API-Elements after a while.\nSo the most important rule is- do not be creative.\nThink like a bureaucrat, adhere to the standards and the ecosystem around you.<p>I hate this field so much. That anyone creative chooses willingly to go into software is a miracle. Are there people out their with pre-broken spirits, that want to join this soul-less galley of horrors?\nStarvation should be preferable to this.\nBut i digress..<p>Why not make naming something that can be personalized? \nMake the variablename a sort of rule-based-building-block-lego-system, that can be adapted by the user.<p>Increment+Variable -&gt; &quot;upIndex&quot; for you\nIncrement+Variable -&gt; &quot;incVar&quot; for me.\nEveryone is happy, the frameworks and apis only specify the buildingblocks as variableNames.. autotranslated variableNames, customized to everyones flavour.<p>Hooray, i contributed.
