Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=[24956908], score=None, time=1604198760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956586, text='<i>Shit like Electron and PWAs seem to be championed by user-hostile developers that just want things to be easy for themselves, without considering what&#x27;s best for the users and their hardware resources.</i><p>There is a standard counter to that argument at this point. Developers on native platforms might be able to achieve a better experience on that platform than a web app <i>given the same time and resources</i>. However, if the time and resources have to be split N ways to build a native app on each of N platforms, compared to investing everything into polishing a single web application, the outcome might be very different. While each native developer is still worrying about whether they&#x27;re aligning and labelling a button in the platform-standard way, the web team is already refining their UI using the results of their third round of usability testing and has determined that the button shouldn&#x27;t have been there in the first place and designed and implemented a more intuitive UI. And since they launched their version 1 two months earlier than any of the native apps did, they even have the extra revenue in the bank to pay for those usability tests, too.')
