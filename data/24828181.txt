Item(by='sgdpk', descendants=None, kids=[24829591, 24829447], score=None, time=1603126315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827836, text='Sure, there is certainly a lot of jargon here which I could have explained better, but in the end one has to be familiar with some calculus and complex numbers to make sense of this topic. Depending on where you&#x27;re from, this could be either late high-school to second&#x2F;third year of university.<p>So by exponential I mean the exponential function, in the mathematician&#x27;s sense: something which takes numbers as inputs and produces other numbers as outputs in a unique way. Already a complication: these can be complex numbers.<p>Then, the derivative of a function is its &quot;instantaneous rate of change&quot;. How much does the function increase for small (infinitesimal, really) changes in input? Since this rate may be different for every point, we are defining a new function f&#x27;: for every input of f, f&#x27; gives you the local rate of change. So there you go, the derivative takes a function f and produces a function f&#x27;. We call this an operator. Because the derivative has very nice properties, we call this a &quot;linear&quot; operator.<p>Finally, the &quot;eigen&quot;-things. These are really fancy words for the simple concept of a fixed-point: when you apply an operation to a certain thing X and just get that X back. So, the function x^2 has two fixed-points: 0 and 1. These would be &quot;eigenpoints&quot;, but we don&#x27;t call them that because we reserve the term &quot;eigen&quot; for linear operations, such as the derivative operator or matrix-multiplication.<p>The point of my answer is that the exponential function is elegantly understood as the eigenfunction of the derivative. In other  words: which function is its own derivative? Which one tells you how it changes just by looking at it?')
