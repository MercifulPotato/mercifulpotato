As we know after Spectre and Meltdown, standard computing technology is buggy&#x2F;bugged all the way down to hardware.<p>To my knowledge there has never been a successful escape from the VMs offered by AWS, GCP, or Azure. That would be a pretty big story.<p>&gt; If you want really &quot;robustly secure&quot; server environment, such do exist: for example, separation kernels like the L4 family or the Green Hills INTEGRITY systems. But for web apps, almost nobody bothers.<p>What&#x27;s the reason none of the major cloud providers use seL4? Missing features? By seL4&#x27;s own account their performance is exceptional, but perhaps its performance can&#x27;t compete against a hardware-assisted system like AWS Nitro?<p>&gt; Joyent does - via SmartOS zones.<p>Thanks I&#x27;d not heard of that.')
