It’s amazing how much heat I’ve been getting for sharing the news.<p>The issue is the PA house didn’t break any laws with their voting laws. The PA Supreme Court did however change the intent of a law. Again, not arguing. Before the election the Supreme Court Requested separating the ballots so they could later reverse if necessary. They were split 4-4 on the issue last time, presumably it could be 5-4 this time. Hence betting markets are still up in the air.<p>Regarding “convincing” the Michigan data. point is it doesn’t need to be convincing to overturn an election, but should be reviewed. And it likely will.')
