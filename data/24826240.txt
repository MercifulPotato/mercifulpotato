I have never looked at Portugal from a country stability point of view. Let&#x27;s look together.<p>Unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic<p>&quot;Socialist party&quot; recently took power in the country; 47% of the seats from 36% of the vote. So they have a misrepresentative electoral system that is disenfranchising the vote.<p>2nd Quarter of 2020: GDP shrank -3.8%<p>3rd Quarter of 2020: GDP shrank -13.9%<p>Portugal is in recession.<p>2013 or so unemployment was at 18% and has been reducing consistently since down to roughly 6%.<p>Inflation since around 2013 has been very unstable. The country has been teetering on deflation for 7 years in the same period as the high unemployment.<p>Bank interest rate has been set to 0% since around 2016.<p>Balance of trade has been negative for at least the last 25 years; the wealth of the country is escaping.<p>Government debt to GDP is over 100% which is bad; currently at 117.2% reduced from peak of 131.5% in 2016.<p>The government just balanced their budget.<p>Corporate tax rate has reduced from 55% down to 21% over the last 35 years.<p>Personal income tax has increase from 40% to 48% in the last 25 years.<p>Sales tax is at 23% up from 17% in 2000.<p>Participation rate was around 60% during the 2000s but during financial crisis reduced to 49% and has increased to around 56%. Huge sign that the incumbant government tinkered with this number to reduce the unemployment figures. Bad sign that other economic numbers have been tinkered with.<p>Employment rate. 55.8% before Covid, 53.2% now. Unemployment 6.7% to 5.6% now? Confirmed government is erronenously tinkering with the numbers. I would estimate their unemployment rate is up around 10-12% right now.<p>Minimum wage has increased from 565.83$ to 740.83$. Their unemployment is very high and minimum wage is increasing? This is a very bad sign.<p>HOLY SHIT, Private debt to GDP peaked around 2012 at 320.8% reduced to around 248.2% currently. This is 148.2% too high. Portugal is in a debt crisis.<p>Credit rating of BBB. This is the last rating before it&#x27;s considered &#x27;speculative&#x27; or &#x27;junk&#x27; so basically Portugal is about to be in financial crisis akin to Greece.<p>The only good news I can find is that household debt to income has decreased below 100%. It&#x27;s most recently at 93%.<p>Portugal is about to go through a very tough decade. Legalization of drugs is the very least of their concerns.')
