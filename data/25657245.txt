Most other similar open-source software offers a &quot;hosted&quot; version to get revenue, but my goal is to promote decentralization and self-hosting in general, so me focusing on the hosted version would go against my goal and beliefs. I really want to see a feature where any non-technical person can choose a few products and have them running on their own VPS&#x2F;server in a few clicks. This would have many advantages for the clients AND for the developers:<p>* Clients pay a lot less for a products<p>* Developers must focus more on product and performance, leading to higher quality products.<p>* Hugely increased privacy for the average internet user and for the own data of the client using the product<p>* Better performance (each client has their own server so it is more likely to have more resources)<p>* Better latencies (each client can choose to use&#x2F;host their product on a local datacenter)<p>* Better data transparency, easier migrations and fewer vendor lock-ins (if you own the server and the data on it you can most likely always export it in some form)<p>I think there are many other advantages for both companies and clients. The current SaaS environment makes it really easy for companies to ask huge amounts of money for services just because they want to, as the client has no real alternative unless he is really technical and can spend days installing and maintaining a self-hosted software that rarely gets updated.')
