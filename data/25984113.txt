Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=[25985707], score=None, time=1612138901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982746, text='&gt; &quot;Public transportation&quot; is something that only a minority of college-educated elite actually think is a good thing.<p>And I would certainly argue that this is a gigantic problem that is hamstringing the competitiveness of the United States for no good reason (like Tom Brady playing with one arm tied behind his back). Paying for those trucks (or cars), new highway construction, auto insurance, healthcare for those injured in car crashes, etc. is largely an unnecessary cost. It&#x27;s clear that most countries can do just fine without.<p>With that being said, certainly I applaud anyone who is achieving the &quot;American Dream&quot; - I want people to be prosperous, but deriding public transportation and by extension things like sidewalks or bike lanes as though it might be some ivory-tower conversation is in my opinion a bit ridiculous. Everyone should be concerned with the costs and benefits of public transportation as well as buying cars and maintaining the highway infrastructure. It&#x27;s not free...<p>You might say &quot;the U.S. is so big!!&quot; but I would just say we should largely be living closer together in medium density mixed-use environments (not skyscrapers, and certainly not suburbs). That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t have a car or a yard, or a garage, but you should probably be walking to work or riding a bike - or at least some of your family members should be.')
