But bad apps can be an issue too. No matter the method there&#x27;s always the risk of not implementing it correctly.<p>&gt;  their goals may not overlap with mine.<p>That&#x27;s a matter of talking with the teacher and setting down the goals.<p>&gt; Finally, not everybody learns in the same way and not everybody has your budget.<p>My point is not &quot;I did classes and I&#x27;m good now&quot;, is &quot;I didn&#x27;t do enough classes and now I see how that wasn&#x27;t the best&quot;.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t like the way you are all over this thread proclaiming the &#x27;one true way&#x27;<p>If that&#x27;s the way I&#x27;m coming across I&#x27;m sorry. My point is that there&#x27;s more to music learning that people think (specially in HN, where I&#x27;ve seen really bad takes in some posts), and that they should be mindful that an app will not be a magic method. I&#x27;ve seen friends that had very high expectations and then got discouraged quickly. I prefer that people know what&#x27;s ahead, and align the method to use with the expectations they have.')
