It&#x27;s fun to complain about &quot;the establishment,&quot; until it isn&#x27;t there anymore. In the current case, &quot;the establishment&quot; means American democracy, which is built on people&#x27;s faith in the institution of elections. If you erode that faith, democracy no longer works. That may be fine with you, but it&#x27;s not fine with me.')
