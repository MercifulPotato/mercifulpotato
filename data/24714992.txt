Item(by='ss3000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602123757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713920, text='&gt; You can make it better by trying to restrict your entertainment material to the second language, but this usually involves seeking out kids&#x27; shows to try to find something comprehensible at your small vocabulary level, and to me it ends up feeling more like work than entertainment.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m probably not alone in this given how popular Japanese anime&#x2F;games&#x2F;manga&#x2F;lightnovels are among non-native speakers, but outside of 1 year of Japanese class in high school where I was taught some fundamentals (could probably be replicated in a 1-month online course), I managed to acquire, pretty much exclusively through media consumption, enough proficiency to consume most Japanese entertainment I&#x27;m interested in today, rarely ever feeling the need to reach for translation (watching untranslated anime, reading untranslated manga&#x2F;light novels, playing untranslated games, etc). In fact today I actually find translated material extremely frustrating and actively seek out non-localized Japanese versions of games to play so I can enjoy the original text.<p>Though of course I can&#x27;t really claim to be a fluent communicator in Japanese because consuming media passively doesn&#x27;t really exercise the brain and face muscles needed to communicate to others. When I went to Japan last year I was actually able to understand pretty much everything that was said to me, but really struggled to formulate responses (luckily I was able to eventually communicate my ideas for the most part, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was dead obvious that I wasn&#x27;t a native speaker). Writing in Japanese without some kind of IME is as you might guess a complete non-starter for me as well for similar reasons.')
