Smaller members can be Euro skeptics all they want as they&#x27;ll just talk the talk but can&#x27;t afford to walk the walk as they benefit the most from the EU.<p>Sure, the UK never did like to play ball with the rest of the EU and had to be let go but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a win for either side. A weak and divided EU only benefits China and Russia and to a lesser degree, the US.')
