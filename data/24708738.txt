It looks like anyone can leave feedback on an item, which is a little different.  RT started as (and still is) just an aggregator of movie critics, not a community review site.<p>As others have pointed out, once you gain traction, fake reviews are going to be a big problem.  It seems like the solution to that is moving towards a more &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; style system, where only the established experts give feedback.  This might start as having two ratings - &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;community&quot;, but I expect you would quickly find the &quot;expert&quot; rating to be much more useful to people.')
