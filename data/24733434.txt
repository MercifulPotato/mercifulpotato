We had destroyed our competitors factories in Asia as well as in Europe.  It took a while for them to build back and be truly competitive outside their home countries.<p>Here in Michigan we had a front row seat to this happening with manufacturing.  Everything peaked in 1973 and has been on a slow decline ever since.  Sure there have been booms but the long term trend has been down.<p>The Japanese started importing cheap motorcycles to the West coast, then cheap cars.  We didn&#x27;t see them in Michigan and if auto execs did they would have laughed.  The Big 3 saw VW and their Beetle as the big import threat.  Suddenly those Japanese cars became better in quality.  Then the Koreans went through the same cycle and Japan introduced luxury cars as well.<p>Because wages were much less in Asia even after accounting for shipping this exerted downward pressure on wages. Give America back the monopoly it had in the fifties and sixties and minimum wage would be $24 an hour.')
