Some of them behave in ways that are deeply cynical. Plenty also don&#x27;t, or at least most of the time try to avoid doing so.<p>I will say one of the reasons for more concern over employee welfare is that more employees, at all grades, are displaying signs that all is not well. It&#x27;s simply a very unusual situation so, in some sense, the greater noise around welfare is to be expected.<p>With that being said, and despite my general disdain for cynicism (I live in Cambridge: there&#x27;s a lot of people who want to play the &quot;world weary cynic&quot; role and it gets old), it does have to be acknowledged that despite the best intentions of employees and leaders at all levels, when push comes to shove a lot of &quot;core values&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; go out the window.<p>Especially when the choice is that or the company goes under, or that and a shareholder revolt, or you can see the writing on the wall and it&#x27;s this terrible course of action now or a much worse course of action later. People will also of course choose to use wider market conditions as cover for action they&#x27;ve been planning or perhaps should have taken anyway.<p>All in all it&#x27;s grim and, as such, it&#x27;s one of the reasons that if I ever run a company we will have as few &quot;values&quot; as we can get away with, and we certainly won&#x27;t be trumpeting our &quot;culture&quot; with any self-serving presentations.')
