The phones should be locked down as much as possible. But that doesn&#x27;t have to be the only option.<p>This is way GrapheneOS [1] exploits Android flexibility and customization to try to improve fundamental OS security to the most modern standards and attempts to break the closesed walls of Google WHILE still shipping a fully locked down phone at the bootloader and OS levels [2].<p>The ideal world is Apple and Android does their normal security lockdowns for standard endusers for security&#x27;s sake. Then they offer a separate hackable version where research and those crazy UI&#x2F;UX hobbyists can do their thing.<p>In all technical senses this is entirely possible for a vendor to do. So it becomes a product question. And I&#x27;m convinced they will get ancillary benefits from the hackers doing expimentation in both security and UIs and whatever,\\  from which to draw inspiration for their IRL produdcts. And possibly just as important - talent (developers, developers, ...) there are people who care about this stuff who just want to hack on their devices. These can be talented individuals and who knows some future leader within Google et al, the way the Napster guys are SV celebrities now.<p>I&#x27;m convinced there&#x27;s enough ROI (yes commercially) for every OS platform to support this niche. They shouldn&#x27;t be relegated to the ruffians and pirates on the fringes using risky circumvention techniques to achieve their goals.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attestation.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attestation.app&#x2F;</a>')
