The phones should be locked down as much as possible<p>This is way GrapheneOS [1] exploits Android flexibility and customization to try to improve fundamental OS security to the most modern standards and attempts to break the closesed walls of Google WHILE still shipping a fully locked down phone at the boot and OS levels [2].<p>The ideal world is Apple and Android does their normal security lockdowns for standard endusers for security&#x27;s sake. Then they offer a separate hackable version where research and pure crazy UI hobbyists can do their thing.<p>In all technical senses this is entirely possible for a vendor to do. And they get annicillary benefits of hackers doing experimentation in both security and UIs, from which to draw inspiration and possibly as important - talent (developers, developers,...).<p>Im convinced there&#x27;s enough ROI (yes commercially) for every OS platform to support these people. They shouldn&#x27;t be relegated to ruffians and pirates using risky circumvention to achieve their goals.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attestation.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;attestation.app&#x2F;</a>')
