You are the one making the claim, therefore the burden of proof is on you to back up your claim, no?<p>This is true regardless of how extraordinary the claim is. I find your claim that “markets cannot provide full employment” not at all obvious, regardless of phrasing, and am asking for evidence.<p>Your response suggests you don’t have any.<p>By this logic, if I say something like “there was no moon landing”, I could demand that you offer evidence to the contrary instead of offering any of my own.')
