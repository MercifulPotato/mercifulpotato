Some people enjoy teaching&#x2F;research and interacting with students. The &quot;life of the mind&quot;. It&#x27;s true that even people who <i>really</i> enjoy that life are unlikely to take a $100K+ paycut for the lifestyle, but people willing to take that paycut in exchange for security <i>do</i> exist. See also: people who leave SFBA FAANG jobs to take &quot;stable but boring&quot; engineering positions in the south&#x2F;midwest. Just because you&#x27;re not on the corporate ladder climbing route doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re incompetent.<p>2. Some people are extremely risk-averse and therefore value stability higher than the typical candidate. Often to a fault. Arguably sometimes not to a fault, though. Do you know how to perfectly price perpetuities or annuities and compare the long-term value of that investment to something more volatile? Because that&#x27;s basically what this &quot;tenure vs. industry&quot; calculation amounts to. And it&#x27;s not trivial -- undergrads and even masters students struggle with the math. Point is, most people don&#x27;t know enough about finance to make rational economic decisions, or even if they do, choose values for parameters in the calculation based on personal anxieties because there&#x27;s no perfect access to future ground truth. Do all the math and learn what you already knew -- the values of a few parameters determine what you should do. But those parameters are unknown and ultimately instantiated by your particular animal spirits.<p>3. But most importantly, consider the counter-factual. So what? What&#x27;s the alternative? Pay better? You&#x27;re a department chair at a tuition-dependent institution. Your budget is your budget. Paying better isn&#x27;t an option. The best you can do is offer tenure and do your best to recruit the right type of candidate. But without tenure on the table you&#x27;ll <i>never</i> recruit a competent candidate. Seriously, what competent person would take a less secure job for $100+K lower salary? So it&#x27;s &quot;try or die&quot; in some sense.<p>If these alternatives aren&#x27;t broadly available to every competent candidate -- so basically everything outside of CS and maybe a few other fields -- the dynamics change and you can ad junctify. And universities <i>do</i> ad junctify in those cases. See: the humanities.')
