Yes, he is a racist. The racist five year lie of birtherism he told before he was even a running for office, to delegitimize the first Black president, and the sitting president at the time of these racist and conspiratorial attacks. Trump&#x27;s racial animus in the case of the Central Park Five, before and after they were exonerated, is well documented. Trump&#x27;s racial animal in federal housing discrimination cases, is also well documented. And his dog whistles over the past six years, well documented. Yes he&#x27;s a racist.<p>I also won&#x27;t give a pass to the deeply ignorant. They are demanding a right to be treated like foolish children, somehow innocent of the decision they&#x27;re making to remain ignorant of the fact Donald Trump is a racist. I mean come on, of all the difficult things to do on planet Earth, admitting Trump is a bigot is difficult? Grow up.<p>American society continues to give racists a pass. This includes Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy as told by Lee Atwater in his 1981 interview. It&#x27;s called plausible deniability. The idea some people are so ignorant they cannot be aware Trump is a racial bigot, and thus they can support a racial bigot while simultaneously denying they are one themselves. It&#x27;s not believable. And I won&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s not my burden to take people&#x27;s word at face value. Grow up. Stop being an infant, stop demanding that people treat you like you don&#x27;t know better or can&#x27;t know better.<p>I am 100% confident there is a Republican out there you can support instead, who has all the boilerplate Republican policies you like, without the bigotry.')
