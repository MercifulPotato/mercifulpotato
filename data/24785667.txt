I really like the idea of organizing my daily&#x2F;long-term tasks in an &quot;issue&quot; fashion and possibly create &quot;epics&quot; and the like.<p>It may also be useful to dump random thoughts on an issue for later expansion and review. Like I&#x27;m starting a side project or learning a new language or whatever and so I&#x27;d dump stuff on the relevant issue&#x2F;epic.<p>Bonus points for self-hosted.<p>EDIT: also useful to track hobbies and repair stuff. I&#x27;m into woodworking, electronics and mechanical repairs so having every task organized may free some brain cycles to do better work.')
