Item(by='jjcon', descendants=None, kids=[25754299], score=None, time=1610485274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25749539, text='&gt; The idea that Trump and his supporters haven&#x27;t been heard is laughable<p>A bit of a tangent but - I know what you mean by this and I generally agree but I think their concern is not about the amount of media attention they have gotten but about how their views are represented (or misrepresented) in the media. The media tends to take the most extreme in a group and paint with a broad brush. Is being in the same camp as racists a good look? Not at all, but when someone calls all trump supporters or those who espouse beliefs in common with trump racists it ignites and incites and misrepresents.<p>I’ll admit to feeling this at times. I’m a moderate left and I once voiced support for tarriffs on Chinese goods and was called racist by multiple people because I have a belief in common with trump on that. It didn’t make me more likely to evaluate my belief on that it made me angry and sad and a bit silenced. How am I to respond to an accusation like that? I’m really not sure. If I had more beliefs in common with Trump I can imagine being a lot worse off in that respect.')
