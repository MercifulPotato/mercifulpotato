Does the same happen to you with smaller or earlier companies? I wouldn&#x27;t trust Tom from Spotify is a real person, but some companies have founders sending and replying to those emails themselves. A good practice I saw from another onboarding sequence was Apollo.io&#x27;s first email. It was from a person who told me they would be my point of contact if I needed anything from the company. I know it&#x27;s automated, but I personally though it was much better than receiving something from support@apollo or onboarding@apollo. It makes it easier for me to reach out if I have something to say')
