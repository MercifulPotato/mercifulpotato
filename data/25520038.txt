Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608745458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516591, text='&gt; misconfigured to not load unless googletagservices has finished loading.<p>Yep, this would be a website I&#x27;d just not use.  For e-commerce, there&#x27;s always another place.  Ironically, sites which do their own tracking first party (Amazon.com) are much better than sites which do not, unless they&#x27;re built on a standard platform like Shopify or BigCommerce.<p>I&#x27;d say your model for what makes an enjoyable web experience is different than mine.  I care about content, not just getting sites to load.  If a site is badly built enough and lacks so much respect for me as a user, I don&#x27;t care what they have to say anymore and I move on.  Your approach isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong, but it certainly isn&#x27;t conducive to whitelisting, because you&#x27;ll end up whitelisting most of the things I&#x27;d actively want to block.<p>It&#x27;s 2020, writing a website that works properly is easier than ever, and these businesses have no excuse for how bad their sites are.')
