It only got better after legal was educated enough to not just shoot from the hip with threats... but really they were just acting like a firewall for much of the management team who saw any such disclosure as some sort of attack.<p>And this was a tech company, everything they did was technology, located in the valley... they still didn&#x27;t get it.<p>Even just getting these researchers token recognition (many asked for almost nothing) was an uphill battle.<p>One of the challenges was that the folks on the security team were really passionate about doing the right thing and they didn&#x27;t want to break relationships they had with researchers &#x2F; the community.  They were prone to leave companies who were bad at handling those relationships ... leaving bad companies with fewer such people and accordingly things would fester.<p>The security industry is full of straight up charlatans and legit people.  The legit people are super sensitive about being associated with charlatans and thus the charlatans are often left to their own devices after the legit folks run for cover (elsewhere).<p>For the record this is my perception from working with security minded folks, and not actually working in that industry myself.')
