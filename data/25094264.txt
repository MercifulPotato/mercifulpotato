I haven&#x27;t really thought about open-sourcing the code and apps that might want to use SeeLink yet. However, I am working on an API since I&#x27;m building a Chrome extension to communicate with the product and make it easier to add links. Do you have any idea as to what kinds of apps might find communicating with SeeLink useful? The app is built in Python with Flask, and I have used Bootstrap on the frontend.')
