Artistic critiques, either in the visual arts or elsewhere, also tend to follow a &quot;shit sandwich&quot; plan.<p>The way I heard it explained once (which totally makes sense to me) is not that you&#x27;re idly flattering the person to make them feel better, because god knows that feels gross; rather, if you can deliver a thoughtful positive comment (that the person <i>knows</i> or can see is true of their own work), it shows that you&#x27;re making a good faith effort to really evaluate their work. That way, a criticism comes off less like an insult and more like a place to build from.')
