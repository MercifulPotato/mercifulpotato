Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602577502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757511, text='&gt; but no one wants to go out on a limb and make suggestions about how to improve it.<p>That&#x27;s not really true, plenty of suggestions on how to improve it. Many of those based on experience doing it for the long haul.<p>Personally I always advocate for a technical discussion of their experience. Read the resume in detail. Talk about it.  Pick some past project to go deep. Also let them pick a favorite past project to go deep in detail. It means the interviewer needs enough technical depth to follow along.  This works. I&#x27;ve never said &quot;yes&quot; to a hire and later thought that was a mistake, in ~25 years of doing interviews.<p>Just the other day here someone was saying they received over 50 resumes for a role so they had to interview over 50 people. No. Don&#x27;t do that. You can&#x27;t go deep, so it just leads to meaningless puzzles. Read the resumes, pick the top 5 or so, interview them personally. Hire the best of those. Done, move on with getting work done.')
