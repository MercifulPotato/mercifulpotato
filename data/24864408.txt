Now you&#x27;re claiming they do[1], and we want that.</i><p>We&#x27;re talking about different types of avoidance. I&#x27;m talking about real business spending, i.e., on facilities, equipment, employees, etc., as a means of tax avoidance. High taxes encourage this type of spending because (a) businesses that are growing are going to do this anyway and (b) they effectively get a discount for this anyway if they&#x27;re making enough money to actually pay taxes.<p>But most people are referring to tax avoidance strategies like IP shifting, off-shoring, etc. I&#x27;m saying, that based on my professional experience as a tax advisor for a decade, that these activities are not motivated by high tax rates, and indeed were highest during periods of lower tax rates. (In the examples I mentioned above in the earlier comment, the companies weren&#x27;t engaging in tax avoidance strategies, they were making business investments. The difference is that tax avoidance is entirely or primarily motivated by avoiding taxes and is pursued despite the lack of an actual business need; business investment may be motivated in part by avoiding taxes but is primarily driven by actual business needs and will not be pursued absent a business case for the spending.)<p><i>Which is itself dubious. I&#x27;m pretty sure &quot;we&quot; don&#x27;t want people to unilaterally exempt themselves from taxes by relabeling consumption as a business expense</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand where you&#x27;re going with this. You brought up examples that are considered legitimate business expenses by the tax code, and have been for decades. Hell, they&#x27;re the basis for all the in-office perks tech companies gave their employees pre-COVID. If you have an issue with whether they should be deductible on moral grounds, that&#x27;s a separate discussion.<p>And again, my argument is based on how my clients, and US businesses in general, have <i>actually</i> responded to tax cuts and tax increases, and not to how they were theoretically expected to behave by people who aren&#x27;t actually running successful businesses.')
