But on the ladder of OPM data and IRS tax records to <i>e.g.</i> potato registries, beneficial ownership data isn’t <i>that</i> sensitive. Many countries make it a matter of public record with few ill effects. (Counterpoint: Sweden makes tax records public record. The IRS being compromised would be a big deal.)<p>The church, charity and non-profit exemption is the hole of the bulldozer path that had to be left to protect private civic discourse. This <i>will</i> be abused by the wealthy and powerful. But as a result, there will be no comprehensive database of <i>e.g.</i> donors to prison reform or LGBT causes.')
