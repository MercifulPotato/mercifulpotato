The device was not powering and I&#x27;m not an EE, and there were no discs for it anyway. I had a brief interest in maybe making my own, and did  a little bit of research, but couldn&#x27;t find much. IIRC I found one device that supposedly could interface 8&quot; drives to a modern PC, but it seemed pretty involved. I ended up not buying the device, and kinda regret it now.')
