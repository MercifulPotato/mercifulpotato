For example, a seam carving problem might get presented as finding a horizon in an image. I would often present the same problem as finding a pass through a mountain range given a height map of the terrain.<p>Also, it&#x27;s possible for interviewers to detect candidates who study the problem beforehand. A couple questions at Dropbox were spread online for years, and it would become clear which candidates read up on those questions online. Some would propose, without prompting, solutions to older iterations of the interview question.')
