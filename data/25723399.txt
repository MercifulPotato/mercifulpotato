They just say that this particular issue has been &#x27;solved&#x27; by Windows since 1998. It&#x27;s been raised as an issue in Gnome since 2004 and still hasn&#x27;t been fixed.<p>I agree with most of what they say, and I think the point is that we&#x27;re uniquely bad at addressing these issues in the open-source world.<p>We accept a degraded UX experience (which I think this unarguably is from a normal user&#x27;s point of view) because at least it&#x27;s not proprietary lock-in. But it&#x27;s a big reason why desktop GNU&#x2F;Linux doesn&#x27;t crack 2% usage. Inversely, I think this is _the_ core value proposition of Apple&#x27;s ecosystem. They pay particular attention to consistent, unsurprising integration, and the Apple experience offsets their iron-grip over your device for most users. It&#x27;s easier to convince someone to change how they do a task if you consistently deliver pleasant UX.<p>I recently had the opportunity to help a _very_ &#x27;normal&#x27; user with their computing, and it was remarkably eye-opening watching them interact with their machine (Windows at the time, but they also use a Mac). Indeed, they hated Windows because it wasn&#x27;t as consistent as a Mac, but Windows was dealing with their ambiguous interaction remarkably well I thought. Much better than a GNU&#x2F;Linux DE would have.<p>If we want a world where normal people can use free software for their everyday computing needs this is something we need to get much better at. Forget &#x27;normal&#x27; users even, these projects (and threads on HN) are full of _developers_ arguing back and forth that they find it infuriating&#x2F;unusable. And unfortunately not many of us have the time and money to contribute code or fork projects to increase competition and spur improvements.<p>(also, hi again Jedd :) )')
