AVX&#x2F;AVX2&#x2F;AVX-512 instructions are not translated, so in those cases you&#x27;ll be using slower kernels. My machine learned models are ~10 times slower with libtorch under Rosetta. Though they are competitive when compiling libtorch natively.<p>(Source: I have used an M1 Air for a week, but decided to return it.)')
