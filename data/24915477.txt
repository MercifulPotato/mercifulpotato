There&#x27;s nothing to be inspected...which seems rather problematic, right? In criminal cases people don&#x27;t run around destroying evidence. That&#x27;s viewed rather negatively by judges.<p>So here we have Amazon destroying the inventory in question. No way to have even a partial sample of that inventory still available for checking? No laws that regulate how and when Amazon can destroy inventory, particularly in the presence of mandatory arbitration? No checks and balances on that process at all?')
