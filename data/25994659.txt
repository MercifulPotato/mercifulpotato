You have a lack of empathy <i>for</i> the conditions these people have. That doesn&#x27;t mean <i>you</i> are unempathetic. It means your behaviour to these people exhibits a lack of empathy for their condition. That is objectively true.<p>And it&#x27;s worthwhile to remember, sometimes people have debilitating conditions that make them worthless for tasks. It is sad that some people are paraplegic. Those people cannot be wildfire firefighters. It&#x27;s not an excuse or anything. I would not want to pay that person to be a wildfire firefighter because they cannot fight wildfires. If I were paying someone to be a wildfire firefighter, and then they lost all their limbs, I cannot indefinitely employ them as a wildfire firefighter anymore. If they were to say &quot;It&#x27;s not my fault I don&#x27;t have limbs&quot;, I&#x27;d have to say &quot;No, it isn&#x27;t, but also, you can&#x27;t fight fires. So I&#x27;ll fulfill my responsibilities to you, but I can&#x27;t employ you in this capacity any more&quot;.<p>If someone has ADHD and they can&#x27;t do a job, then they can&#x27;t do the job. Any general requirements you have as an employer are to make &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot;, not to sit there as your employee sits there on their fourth year of doing nothing because they &quot;have ADHD&quot;.')
