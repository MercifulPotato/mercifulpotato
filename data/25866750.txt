Item(by='__blockcipher__', descendants=None, kids=[25867078], score=None, time=1611275922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866281, text='So, let&#x27;s pretend I&#x27;m Amazon and I&#x27;m offering a SAAS Elasticsearch product. You need someone to manage your Elasticsearch for me, so you pay me. Internally, I&#x27;m running vanilla, unmodified Elasticsearch, which talks to a management layer of proprietary code that interfaces with the rest of AWS.<p>What right is being violated here? You as a user can run your own Elasticsearch software; I haven&#x27;t modified it and thus I don&#x27;t need to publish anything specific. What the SSPL says is I must publicize my entire SAAS product - but the user isn&#x27;t paying me to run their own Elasticsearch SAAS product, they&#x27;re paying me to run Elasticsearch.<p>So to call SSPL copyleft is totally absurd.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a broader discussion that you raised of whether the open source definitions are out-of-date or not. Personally, I don&#x27;t believe so. I don&#x27;t see how any of the newer developments in the space (public clouds, managed offerings, etc) materially change anything; indeed the whole point of OSS is it&#x27;s based off of deep principles.')
