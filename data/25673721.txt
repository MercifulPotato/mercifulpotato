People have a will and a right to protest against their perceived injustice at a state or federal level. A coup also usually involves the military and a taking of government by force, neither of which happened yesterday. If this were a coup then the BLM &quot;protests&quot; over the summer were also a coup, and they were causing significantly more damage to small business with destruction and looting.<p>You are being disingenuous if you label this as a &quot;coup&quot; regurgitating biased media talking points.')
