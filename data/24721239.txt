It explains the basic data model that the semantic web uses as building block for anything else.<p>The gist of it is to provide a way to model data as a graph, and make it almost trivial to exchange data between parties. A simple example is, if you and I want to share, say, user data, and you have a &quot;people&quot; table and I have &quot;Users&quot;, and my fields are &quot;first_name&quot; &quot;last_name&quot; and yours &quot;given&quot; and &quot;proper&quot;, and so on, how do we match the same user across tables? RDF provides a solution for that.<p>The &quot;pie in the sky&quot; part is that, from this basic building block, a whole host of other technologies can be built, some of them dealing with artificial intelligence, machines being able to _infer_ more information from what you have already said [2]. Inferences can work best when there&#x27;s more data, that&#x27;s were the ability to mix your data with third party databases comes handy.<p>Solid adds even more stuff to the table. In their words: derived from &quot;social linked data&quot;, is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles. I think &quot;decentralized&quot; is the keyword  here. I haven&#x27;t even started looking at it :-)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-primer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-primer&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;standards&#x2F;semanticweb&#x2F;inference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;standards&#x2F;semanticweb&#x2F;inference</a>')
