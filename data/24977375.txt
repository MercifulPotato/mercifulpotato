And kernels in some modern distributions disable vsyscall emulation. This is a problem because people use CentOS 5 or 6 images to build binaries that are compatible with many historical glibc versions.<p>If the host system does not enable vsyscall emulation, running binaries on such old distributions will lead to segfaults. (Which can be resolved by booting the host kernel with <i>vsyscall=emulate</i>.)')
