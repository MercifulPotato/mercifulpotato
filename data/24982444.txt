He was in a car accident which resulted in him being in a coma for months. Since he wasn&#x27;t making money during that time in the hospital, his bank account was emptied and the court issued an arrest warrant since the child support was not being paid. He lost his job and was never able to get a new one. He&#x27;s now living on food stamps and waiting to reach the social security age. The family court system ruined his life.')
