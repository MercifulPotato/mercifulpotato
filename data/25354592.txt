J. Bernstein) is biased in favour of LaTeX, he has elsewhere written one of the most stinging criticisms I&#x27;ve seen: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;writing&#x2F;visual.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;writing&#x2F;visual.html</a> (LaTeX haters, enjoy!)<p>The point of <i>this</i> blog post here (the OP) is just that the study by Knauff and Nejasmic is really awful, for the reasons it mentions: studies the wrong metric, etc. (<i>Of course</i> typing &quot;see [41]&quot; would be more efficient than typing &quot;see \\cite{multiplication-survey}&quot; for instance.) Far from the authors&#x27; claim of a “highly realistic working conditions”.<p>(Also this blog post is titled “part 1” so I imagine there will be future blog posts either on this specific topic, or on measuring the wrong metric, in general?)<p>Edit: Some of the comments here seemed odd to me, until I noticed that this HN submission is titled <i>“Measuring &quot;efficiency&quot; in document prepration [sic]: Microsoft Word vs. LaTex [sic]”</i>, while the actual blog post is titled <i>“Optimizing for the wrong metric, part 1: Microsoft Word”</i> and has the subtitle <i>“Review of &quot;An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development&quot; by Knauff and Nejasmic.”</i> From the HN submission title, I can imagine that before clicking one may expect the link to contain a measurement or comparison, rather than a review of some paper. Titles of articles are already (in general) a poor indicator of their contents, but please don&#x27;t editorialize titles to make them <i>less</i> representative!')
