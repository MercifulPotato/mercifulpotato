Item(by='jkarneges', descendants=None, kids=[25349780], score=None, time=1607450029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348160, text='I&#x27;d agree there is an arguable difference between sharing a server vs sharing data within the server.<p>Bottleneck issues aside, letting two microservices connect to the same Postgres cluster but access different &quot;databases&quot; (collection of tables) within that cluster could be considered an acceptable data separation. Certainly with multi-tenant DBaaS systems there may be some server sharing by unrelated microservices&#x2F;customers. Whereas letting two microservices access the same database tables would probably be frowned upon.<p>Nevertheless, sharing the same Kafka topics between microservices seems to be a common thing to do.')
