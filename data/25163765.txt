If you are in 100% control of your exposure, sure wait. But if you aren&#x27;t in control of your exposure (e.g., have to go to work, have kids in school), then there is no reason to think the risk of the vaccine is anywhere close to the risk of getting Covid. I have kids in school, and can&#x27;t wait until it is available.')
