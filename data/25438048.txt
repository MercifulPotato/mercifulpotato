I have been working with a mediocre freelancer who didn’t reply to my list of remediation items.<p>When I followed up today, I got the “this email account does not exist” error from Gmail and proceeded to dispute on PayPal.<p>I only found out through hacker news that this was a Gmail bug.<p>Google, I expect a follow up retraction of the incorrect error messages.
