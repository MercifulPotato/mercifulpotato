A supersonic propeller is not strictly impossible, but even after decades of active research remains elusive. You can&#x27;t simply handwave that you&#x27;ll use a 3 meter propeller spinning at mach 3 just because it&#x27;s technically below the limit where it would tear itself apart from centrifugal forces. It doesn&#x27;t matter what battery energy density you can achieve if the propellers you&#x27;re using to drive them don&#x27;t work.')
