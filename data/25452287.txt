Not a subject matter expert, but in my mind, a plane minus pilot is basically an extremely performant missile with vastly superior flight envelope and sensors. My Q is whether AI airforce would eventually nullify anti-air technology. Are we inching towards a future where conflicts will have mutual air superiority because fighters cannot be effectively shot down because limited magazine depth i.e. a carrier group simply will not possess enough anti-air weapons to interdict. not to mention economics - recent data on cost of some of the missile systems is pretty outrageous. Some are just conversion kit costs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;38102&#x2F;here-is-what-each-of-the-navys-ship-launched-missiles-actually-costs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;the-war-zone&#x2F;38102&#x2F;here-is-what-eac...</a><p>Also 37M per SM3 block IIA used in the recent ballistic missile shoot down O_o.')
