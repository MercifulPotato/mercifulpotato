This is almost always enough since that&#x27;s all any of these companies actually care about.<p>&quot;almost always&quot; is not a guarantee of free speech.<p>&gt; There are very rare exceptions where high-profile nazi groups have had their service contracts rescinded, but this isn&#x27;t a real problem in practice.<p>...yet. What is &quot;very rare&quot; today can become &quot;more common&quot; tomorrow if there aren&#x27;t strong legal protections.<p>&gt; No. I&#x27;m asking you how you envision people owning their own websites without any private companies involved, in an economy built around the concepts of corporate ownership.<p>IANAL, but clearly there needs to be stronger legal protections in this arena. My ISP should not be able to disconnect me from the internet on the basis of speech. They should be like a utility company. My power company can&#x27;t disconnect my electricity if I use the electricity to charge batteries for a megaphone that I then use to spread hate speech. My ISP&#x2F;server host should be the same. Charge me for the compute resources I use, do not attempt to disconnect my service on moral or ethical grounds. Leave that to a higher layer in the stack.')
