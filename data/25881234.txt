What I imagine is happening is\nthat someone has gone to a medical professional with a \nproblem, and this note documents - the person, the \nproblem and the date.   If there&#x27;s a lawsuit in the\nfuture a lawyer could refer to this note saying &quot;on\nthis date your employee had a condition that you\ndidn&#x27;t address&quot;.  So HR caves.')
