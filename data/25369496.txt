Itâ€™s not their jurisdiction or mandate. People seem to believe that the state courts can accept testimony or evidence. They cannot accept evidence or suggest prosecution, no court can.<p>Exact details depend on the state (because states are vested with the power to run elections, not the federal government, as anyone with even a cursory understanding of the Constitution ought to understand), but generally speaking, if you believe there is evidence of voter fraud, the court you submit to is the appropriate electoral board or commission for the district in question. That electoral board will decide on the verdict and issue a ruling, which may include annulling and rerunning the election--as happened two years ago for a House race in North Carolina, which is the only race in my lifetime that I&#x27;m aware of where election fraud may have affected the results of the race.<p>You seem to believe that such an entity cannot exist, yet the entity of which you speculate exists in (I believe) every single state, and, yes, there are definitely occasional partisan fights over the powers, makeup, and conduct of these boards.')
