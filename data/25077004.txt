This program runs elevated, by magic. It passes its arguments to CreateProcess(). You call WinSudo.exe Virus.exe. Virus.exe execution is blocked by SmartScreen.<p>(This scenario is itself a security flaw that existed for some combinations of Windows system utilities, so this is a real concern.)<p>Now, you could change WinSudo.exe to disable SmartScreen, sure -- but this requires you to be able to modify WinSudo.exe (which should require Administrator), and the mismatched binary would ALSO flag SmartScreen.')
