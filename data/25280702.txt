Setting aside China, authoritarian regimes are usually NOT known for being efficient or well-run.<p>well run != efficient<p>Authoritarian regimes are highly efficient at accomplishing what the people in charge want to do, long term consequences be damned.  Frequently, the people in charge are primarily focused on retaining or even acquiring more power and wealth, which is generally not well aligned with what most people would consider a well run nation.<p>&gt; I am not American, but I came back from my visits to China with a similar feeling to the grandparent comment. The West tends to stick their fingers in their ears and yell &quot;Authoritarian regime, I can&#x27;t hear you!&quot; at the mere suggestion that China does certain things better and there may be something to learn there.<p>The issue here is that there isn&#x27;t an agreement on what &quot;better&quot; means.  Social harmony at the expense of individual freedoms isn&#x27;t better.  Technological advancement that is based on IP theft isn&#x27;t better.  Infrastructure improvement that causes long term harm to the global environment isn&#x27;t better.')
