Bentley (and most others) simply won&#x27;t be able to catch up.<p>Everyone says Tesla has a head start.<p>They have a head start on batteries and the motors. Other manufacturers have a head start on building cars and other aspects of what makes a car a car.<p>A Bentley or Rolls Royce is a different class of car to a Tesla. Tesla may be able to make a battery &#x2F; motor fit for a Bentley or Rolls Royce but can Tesla make a car you can call a Bentley or Rolls Royce?<p>Likewise if you take something like a Porche 911. Tesla might be able to make an electric power train fit for a 911 but can Tesla make a car you can call a 911 with it&#x27;s handling?<p>There&#x27;s lots of different markets and no single manufacturer can corner them all.<p>With governments starting to make all new vehicles from 2030+ electric other car manufacturers have no choice but to catch up so will be investing heavily.<p>I think Tesla will grow and will certainly have a spot in the market. At some point they&#x27;ll be a crossing point where other manufacturers have Tesla&#x27;s tech and it&#x27;ll be interesting how Tesla distinguishes itself.<p>The next 5-10 years look interesting.')
