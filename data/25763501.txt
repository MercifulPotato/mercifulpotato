His response and his intent are not malicious.<p>On principle he is against proprietary software and he wants to make sure it remains as difficult as possible for proprietary software to exploit GCC for their own means.<p>He doesn’t seem to be rejecting the code or suggests its deletion because he wants to do unnecessary harm to the author here. His intentions seem rational and consistent with his past remarks.<p>As an aside and for comparison, proprietary software companies are just as defensive or more with other companies using their IP without compensation. The compensation RMS wants here is code reciprocity.')
