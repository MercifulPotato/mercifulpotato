( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Boy-Crisis-Boys-Struggling-About&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1942952716" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Boy-Crisis-Boys-Struggling-About&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1...</a> ).<p>Tl;dr ... A disproportionate share of seriously troubled boys share an alienated, minimized or absent father in common. The worthwhile and well intentioned effort to right the wrongs of past discrimination of women has traveled a bridge too far. Tragic unintended consequences plague children of divorce, working men, and stay-at-home fathers. This cause-effect is an inconvenient truth, ignored because its not politically correct or advantageous to raise the issue.<p>Speaking for myself as someone who spent 8 years and about $300,000 to have an equal role in my children&#x27;s lives... you can watch the damage this has on your children change them over time. Resignation, external locus of control, etc. are all divorce-induced impacts on kids who must endure the back and forth.<p>Brutal stuff.')
