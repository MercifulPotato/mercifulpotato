You don&#x27;t own Youtube, and you don&#x27;t really have much control over content you wish to upload, or content you wish the view. And, this content can be removed or modified (by inserting ads) at any time.<p>I think services are generally bad for consumers. (they can be quite good for businesses, though) If a consumer relies on a service, then they are beholden to any change made in that service. In other words, it&#x27;s fine to enjoy Youtube, but just know that your enjoyment could be temporary, videos could be lost, and you could be shut out from the service.')
