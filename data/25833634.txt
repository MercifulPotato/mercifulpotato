I&#x27;m not convinced on the argument of offset != index, because the reality beneath arrays and lists is that it is offset based.<p>Arrays are the obvious one: assuming no associated metadata they are an address to the first (zeroth?) element.<p>Even things like linked lists are essentially offset based: It&#x27;s an address of the first (zeroth) node. The next node is 1 node away from that.<p>In general I don&#x27;t think it is a good idea to abstract too far away from how things actually work. And in that sense, 1-based indexing in LUA does make sense since LUA is table based and &#x27;1&#x27; here is an arbitrary identifier.')
