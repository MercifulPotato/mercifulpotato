Item(by='alm1', descendants=None, kids=[25996238], score=None, time=1612223805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992664, text='I&#x27;m surprised at all the negative comments equating closure of the _game stuido_ to Stadia not doing well. Google is not known for good content production. Only example I can think of are Youtube Originals which hardly stand out.<p>I read the announcement as Google doubling down on title acquisition which probably worked out well. Cyberpunk was the largest game release last year (last 5 years?) and seemingly very popular on Stadia. Other titles they have (RDR2, Doom, Odyssey) are also among the best games of the last few years.<p>Personally, I never played any of the non-AAA titles on Stadia and would imagine most users are in a similar boat. Just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to use a streaming service for low-key games I can play on my laptop directly. This is a big difference from early Netflix model, where they went for quantity.<p>My guess is that the internal studio failed to pitch any competitive titles and was disbanded. Makes sense to focus on the plumbing, while leaving titles to external studios who know how to do it well.')
