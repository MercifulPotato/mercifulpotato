Sounds good? Until you realise that Grain Markets Officials were there kind of observers (at least in the spirit of law). Now Companies with teams of lawyers can deal directly with illiterate of private farmers. the las specifically gives only DM as highest arbiter in event of disagreement.<p>Second one is giving freedom to store produce as much as one wants. Sounds good on paper until you realise most of the produce (wheat, rice, veggies, anything) need special environment to store. Which private farmers lack &amp; only Adani  Ambani have access to those modernized silos. Guess who is going to buy it cheaply at harvesting season &amp; then store it for months&#x2F;years &amp; release the produce to market to maintain the artificial scarcity? Sounds similar to modern diamond industry.<p>Third One, removing the MSP, Minimum Support Price. Anybody can pay as high as they want to buy the produce in open market. Ambani gave free 1GB internet for two years to drive out the competition in mobile network market. Its a known business plan in SV to bleed money to drive other competitors out. Ambani&#x27;s competitors are small scale flour mills, shop owners, contartors, small scale sellers. Guess who will be out of business in 2-x years by Ambani&#x27;s unlimited money &amp; guvernment support?')
