I couldn&#x27;t tell at first whether people were so miscalibrated that they couldn&#x27;t tell that the work wasn&#x27;t impressive or whether it was just a tradition to bullshit all the time. So many of the exaggerated positive statements are about things so minor that they actually come of a bit condescending to me.')
