This type of thinking is how we end up with brittle systems.<p>A cautious implementation might see an SMTP 500 and then may just choose to try it again once or twice a little later, to see exactly how &#x27;permanent&#x27; that failure is.<p>What the &quot;but the RFC says!&quot; people seem to forget is that the spec is only meaningful when the system is working correctly. Good engineering <i>never</i> assumes that.')
