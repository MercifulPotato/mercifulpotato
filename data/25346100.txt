Item(by='stef25', descendants=None, kids=[25354359], score=None, time=1607440020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345355, text='My defence would be that Apple isn&#x27;t an audio company and although they&#x27;re great at everything they do, I doubt they can catch up with Sennheiser, Grado, Audio Technica etc when it comes to pure audio quality.<p>Where they&#x27;re better is probably connectivity, noise cancellation (which is still garbage imho), integration with their hardware.<p>Same with their Homepod - it was innovative not in absolute audio quality but in the way it was omnidirectional and could &quot;fill a room&quot; with sound (if I remember correctly, from having read a review) and connectivity. If you just want great audio for your vinyl, CD or Flac collection then you don&#x27;t get a Homepod. $300 worth of HiFi gear would be better.')
