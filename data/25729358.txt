A person not trying to find something wrong with everything he says will interpret it the way I did.<p>You made up a quote, putting words in his mouth. I quoted the man directly. Words that he uttered in a call to a Republican Secretary of State, in the middle of an audit of signatures that the Secretary of State had ordered at Trump&#x27;s request.<p>&gt;  Using your same logic, if he won by hundreds of thousands then why does 11,780 matter enough to commit a felony?<p>In an amazing coincidence, 11,780 votes just happened to be the number of he needed to win the election. I&#x27;m sure you can come up with an explanation of how he just happened to randomly choose that number out of all the other ones.<p>My assertion is that he did not win at all, certainly not by hundreds of thousands of votes and that he was lying, as evidenced by the fact that he expresses no interest in having those fraudulently discounted votes found and that indeed no evidence whatsoever that he won by hundreds of thousands of votes has been produced.<p>&gt; And many have moved on from Fox News as a result. But the same can&#x27;t be said for the left and CNN. Further, your still not tending to the divide, just jumping onto the problem and saying &quot;me too&quot;.<p>They moved on from Fox news to an even more extreme platform in OAN...<p>&gt; Quit pointing fingers. You want to blame Fox (again with Fox) and ignore the yelling and screaming the left did over the last 4 years.<p>The left did not cause Trump to reject the results of the election, whip his base into a frenzy and send them to the capitol. Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be the party of personal responsibility? &quot;You made me do this&quot; also hasn&#x27;t been considered a very good excuse since domestic abuse went out of fashion in the 60s.<p>&gt; You want to ignore the forced conversions (that have always historically failed).<p>I absolutely agree with you that gay conversion therapy is horrendous and should be outlawed.<p>&gt; You want to ignore cancel culture.<p>I think there are discussions to be had about cancel culture, but that&#x27;s not what is being screamed about. Right now Parler is the kid in the sandbox that threw sand in everyone&#x27;s eyes and then got upset that no one wanted to play with them.<p>&gt; And again, the left wants to take statements and twist them to make some outlandish point. It&#x27;s only going to divide us more.<p>Your lack of introspection is getting absurd at this point. The right made concerted attempts to portray Obama as a Muslim anti-christ who wasn&#x27;t even a US citizen. One of the people attempting to throw doubt on Obama&#x27;s citizenship was Trump himself. What you&#x27;re annoyed about is the fact you and your friends are no longer  getting away with dog-whistling in an attempt to escaping the consequences of your actions:<p>When asked to condemn white supremacists Trump instead said:<p>&gt; &quot;The Proud Boys? Stand back and stand by, but I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the Left…,&quot;<p>To the rioters who had occupied the capitol after hours of inciteful speech by Trump and his associates:\n&gt; &quot;This was a fraudulent election, but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace, so go home, we love you, you’re very special.&quot;<p>These rioters had recently been calling for Trump&#x27;s own Vice President, Mike Pence, to be hanged, they had bludgeoned an officer to death, and a woman had been killed while attempting to reach the members of congress in hiding. I&#x27;m sure that woman just wanted a nice chat with Mike Pence, or perhaps AOC. Sadly we&#x27;ll never know.')
