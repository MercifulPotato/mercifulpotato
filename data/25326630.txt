Yes, from the business perspective Docker, inc. seems to be failing badly. But from the engineering perspective they did a tremendous job splitting the monolith to separate components. Containerd was once part of Docker daemon and then abstracted away to an independent entity. And we all hugely benefit from this split.<p>Now, the next big thing is happening - buildkit.
