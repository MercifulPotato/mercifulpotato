Item(by='motohagiography', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607352467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329913, text='The pattern of using farmer&#x2F;women&#x2F;student&#x2F;x-liberation groups to approach villagers and promise redistributed land in exchange for insurgency support is basically venture banditry or chartered theft. Wrap it in an ideology and the rest is just sales. Their internsectionalist approach is what establishes a foothold in the community and the radicalism of a converted now-intolerant minority neutralizes opposition and essentially flips the population. The result around the world has predictably been a regional kleptocracy, because that&#x27;s literally what the plan was from the beginning - to take other peoples stuff instead of producing it.<p>Hard to defend the CIA, but the cold war was a response to a country that had metastasized from that initial venture bandit play of 1918 by learning the ropes of totalitarianism from Dutch colonies, and then Germany. Suppressing communism failed in China, and that played out as well as expected, with the same metastastacizing producing the dystopia they have today.')
