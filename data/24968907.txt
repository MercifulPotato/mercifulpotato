The indie bookstores are really just affiliates, and they get a profit from referrals (and the whole network shares the profit from direct sales).<p>I just looked up one local bookshop, and their Search link took me directly to the Bookshop site. If I&#x27;d bought anything they&#x27;d get 30% of the cover price, but Bookshop would fulfill it and retain the rest of the profit.<p>Prices are usually comparable to Amazon, though Amazon&#x27;s shipping is usually cheaper and faster. Still, I&#x27;m not crazy about the way Amazon achieves that, so I avoid them when I can.')
