Either they remove references to the external paid service, or they provide a way to pay for it from the app, with the usual fee. It&#x27;s misleading to characterize this as &quot;Apple forces a free app to become paid&quot;. Apple is just doing their usual thing of requiring that payments for features of an app cannot bypass Apple&#x27;s payment system.')
