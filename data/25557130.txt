I intend to upstream a patch soon with zsh that restores backwards compatibility with the Thompson Shell.<p>As for GUIs, while Cosmpolitan isn&#x27;t intended to write complex GUI apps (since I normally build web apps for that) it still <i>can</i> be used to build WIN32 GUIs. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;apelife&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;apelife&#x2F;index.html</a> as an example of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life built with Cosmopolitan, where it manages to embed a UNIX TUI and a WIN32 GUI in the same binary! Even if you turn the WIN32 off, it&#x27;ll still run the TUI inside the Windows Command Prompt.<p>As for breakages, Cosmopolitan only depends on stable kernel ABIs with long term stability promises. The binaries you build will work on all Linux distros dating back to RHEL5, Windows versions dating back to Vista, etc. There&#x27;s no reason to believe there will be any radical breaking changes to these ABIs. Why is it so stable? Alignment of self-interest. By using canonical kernel interfaces, we ensure platforms can&#x27;t break us without first breaking themselves.')
