In that case, it&#x27;s good that DoH is hard to filter and looks like all other TLS traffic.<p>But the parent is correctly describing DoH as a double-edged sword. The same properties that make it good for you and me when trying to safely access domain data make it a weapon for rogue IoT devices who want to do the same.<p>Your smart fridge could easily include software that allows it to acquire <i>its own</i> secure DNS info from a DoH network run by the smart fridge manufacturer. This would allow them to find the domains behind the chumbox ads that they want to show you in spite of your PiHole. Since the manufacturer would be doing this to get around a user&#x27;s desired network configuration, it&#x27;ll be configurable for <i>them</i>, not for <i>you</i>. You will not be the &quot;owner&quot; of this device.')
