To expert radiologists, a shadow in an x-ray is almost certainly cancer, while a non-expert can&#x27;t see any shadow at all.<p>Similarly, and more mundanely, in languages where there isn&#x27;t a strong meaningful distinction between two sounds, speakers have trouble discerning them. To a monolingual native Japanese person, &#x2F;r&#x2F; and &#x2F;l&#x2F; sound almost identical, while a native English speaker can&#x27;t understand how they don&#x27;t hear the difference. To a French person, the &quot;oo&quot; sounds in <i>au dessus</i> (on top) and <i>au dessous</i> (underneath) sound completely different, yet to an English person they are almost indistinguishable.<p>These are really the same phenomena, and why an expert bird watcher would have no trouble recognizing the &quot;sack of potatoes&quot; flight of a bird.')
