Surely backbreaking work is below somebody who manages to cite a philosopher every other sentence!<p>He&#x27;s a thinker. He&#x27;s too pretty to work.<p>I&#x27;d be willing to bet he&#x27;s over-educated, has spent large periods of his life on welfare, wears a cravat to the supermarket, and was always told how clever he is.<p>But he never really got anywhere. Now his bank account is dry, it&#x27;s 3 days until his next benefits payment, and the &#x27;idiot&#x27; who left school at 16 to get his heavy machinery licence as a teenager makes more in an honest work year than this guy has ever had the privilege of declaring in his life.<p>His counsellor (or mum) is on his back to get a real job, and this is his response.<p>Ironically, it&#x27;s never the bricklayer&#x27;s labourer arguing for the abolition of work. It&#x27;s types like the author, whose hands have never borne a callous.')
