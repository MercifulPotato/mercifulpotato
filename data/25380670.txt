It is roughly analogous to my setting up tents on the sidewalk in front of your house and renting them to my &quot;customers&quot;, or charging people to come to noisy parties right outside your front door. Maybe the AirBnB are incredible business people, but they crushed neighborhoods and competing businesses in an illegal and, to me, hideously unethical manner.')
