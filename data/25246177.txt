It&#x27;s partly a history of the American financial system, and partly a tour of some modern financial instruments and institutions. The focus is on how things work and why they&#x27;re designed as they are, and not so much on how things are priced. Deposits, bonds, commodity futures, central banks, how it all fits together, what purpose it all serves -- how it&#x27;s not just gambling or an abstract game used to extract money from the productive economy.<p>One of the stated aims of the course is to get you in a position where you can read the Financial Times without going cross-eyed, and it works really well to give a clarifying framework for understanding market concepts outside the course&#x27;s scope.<p>Another I really liked was &quot;The Modern and the Postmodern&quot; by Michael Roth. I don&#x27;t know if that course would work well &quot;at your own pace&quot; though, the reading and peer essay feedback was a big part of it.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;money-banking" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coursera.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;money-banking</a>')
