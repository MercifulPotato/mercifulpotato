So in order to justify that extra spent time a lot of times they will bring up minor stuff that happens in Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu, like this bug from 12 years ago, in order to justify running Arch, which is more of a &quot;learn Linux&quot; hobby.<p>This is the feeling I get, and it&#x27;s why I never bothered with Arch, or Gentoo before that. I started on Slackware, and while it was a great learning experience, I feel that&#x27;s not a lesson I need to repeat.<p>Same reason for my move from RedHat (after an RPM dependency breakage) to Debian: Debian <i>just works</i>. It GTFO of my way and let&#x27;s me focus on my code and my projects. Yes, there have been issues, no, Debian isn&#x27;t &quot;perfect&quot;, but like my preferred MUA &quot;it sucks less than all the alternatives.&quot;')
