It&#x27;s a nice argument, but it&#x27;s needlessly negative, almost for show.<p>Consider the claim that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a loss if the company shows poor returns. If it had good returns, the anti-auction folks would claim some small group is getting rich off what used to be a public good. Poor returns for the company means that the auction is limiting the plunder and that sounds like a win to me.<p>And why is this a loss for the government treasury? If the returns are poor, there wasn&#x27;t much more juice to squeeze from the orange, right? So it sounds like the government (and often the taxpayers, sort of) are getting as much as they can for very little work.<p>I&#x27;m much more sympathetic to the deeper arguments about structure of auctions and how they might be improved. Why not auction the spectrum off for a shorter time? Maybe use smaller chunks of spectrum? The auctions are just a competitive algorithm and they can become more accurate with finer resolution.')
