Debian still patches upstream sources including security-critical software, still does not have any dedicated security review of those patches, still leaves it up to individual maintainers to decide whether and how to clear these things with upstream, and still thinks all of this is fine.<p>It&#x27;s not fine, but when the upstream authors do not regard or consider requirements of downstream projects, what can you do? like with the example of phonehome features?<p>arch and other distros are only possible, because for a long time, debian and other distros kept nagging the upstream authors for missing features or &quot;nonfeatures&quot;. if debian wouldn&#x27;t exist, i bet, arch had to patch much more itself.')
