The example I gave last time is running calc.exe, then hitting enter and typing a formula. On Win10 you&#x27;ll lose keypresses and half the formula, but not on the older versions. It used to be a very convenient way to do some quick maths without even interrupting my workflow, now I have to wait for it.<p>It&#x27;s even in some games I&#x27;ve played recently, where I&#x27;m in a menu and hitting down twice then a button will sometimes ignore the second press because it&#x27;s still playing a &#x27;move the cursor&#x27; animation.<p>I was pleasantly surprised last time I snuck a look at the screen in my local post office where I saw an ASCII terminal UI full of text with hotkeys. There is a mistaken belief that complicated is bad, but in a job where you spend your whole day all week long it can be very beneficial because everyone can be a power user.')
