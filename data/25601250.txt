Like paypal but even worse. Sources: official WU dropoff points in HK, SG, TH, NL and ES. The exchange rates + fees are indeed 10-20% removed from what they really are. Maybe if you send online it is 1%, but most use it to bring cash (from cleaning houses etc) to families abroad.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; The pricing calculator literally says<p>Please go to a meatspace WU point and compare the conversion rates with the inter bank rates.')
