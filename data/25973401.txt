Because all the files have simple names like &quot;1.jpg&quot;, &quot;2.jpg&quot; inside a directory structure, I needed to hover over the filenames to see the full image URLs in a tooltip.<p>===<p>All of the above works with entire image files, which is good, because common file formats and APIs often won&#x27;t let you do anything other than &quot;load the entire file&quot;.<p>Some file formats allow you to load part of an image effectively. For instance, many PDFs will let you read page 53 by (a) reading enough of the header&#x2F;index in the file (b) reading page 53, without needing pages 1-52 first. If you were writing something like a desktop image viewer you&#x27;d probably want to take advantage of this, but the details are likely to be very file-format-specific. You&#x27;d likely build on top of specialized libraries for TIFF, RAW, PDF and so on, rather than generic &quot;load any image file&quot; APIs.')
