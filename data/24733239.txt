That doesn&#x27;t mean the &quot;Mafia Extortion&quot; isn&#x27;t related to the above. It&#x27;s perfectly possible for ProtonMail to be angry about more than 1 policy at a time and at varying levels accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s also possible for 2 people to read the same thing and come to different conclusions so please don&#x27;t imply others must have misread something to have disagreed with you. Not only does it not move the conversation forward any it&#x27;s needlessly insulting.')
