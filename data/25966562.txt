Item(by='burnte', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611985603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25966390, text='&gt; Google reads your e-mails to develop its ads.<p>Why do I care? That&#x27;s the implicit bargain, I get a free service in exchange for ads. I don&#x27;t care about the ads, they don&#x27;t show up in my actual mail feed, just on the side so they&#x27;re easy to ignore&#x2F;block.<p>&gt; Psychological profiles are collated from every click you take on each of these platforms and pulled into ad brokerships.<p>Why do I care? We build profiles of every person we meet in our heads. I&#x27;m a very open person.<p>&gt; The people that are hired to do this profiling often have crossovers into government sectors, as this is just another form of surveillance.<p>Again, why do I care? I&#x27;m not trying to be argumentative, but I truly do not care if people know I looked at new Kias, or I use Old Spice deodorant. I don&#x27;t find any of that information being out there harmful to me.<p>&gt; I am personally shocked (not necessarily appalled) at anyone feeling OK with this level of scrutiny being applied to themselves at all the times by government bureaucrats, or companies just looking to make a buck off of your behavior without you even knowing. We&#x27;re past the point where anyone can claim ignorance of these facts.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m ok with it, I simply don&#x27;t CARE. It doesn&#x27;t impact me in a negative way. There is no human out there looking at my buying&#x2F;watching habits and taking notes, passing them on to men in trees with binoculars plotting to abduct me. There are machine learning algorithms using them to suggest things I might buy, or might want to watch on TV. They&#x27;re right sometimes, so I actually get some value out of it.<p>I don&#x27;t make it easy, I opt out of everything I can, but I also don&#x27;t really care as long as I can not hook my TV to the network to avoid Samsung&#x27;s built-in ads which is offensive bullshit and SHOULD be regulated, then I&#x27;m ok. When I go out into the world, I don&#x27;t have any rights to who can see me who what they can learn about me, it&#x27;s the same online. As long as I have the power to control what comes into my home, that&#x27;s what matters. Outside, or out on the internet at large, I&#x27;m on someone else&#x27;s property, and if I don&#x27;t like their rules, I can leave.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between watching me in public and forcing me to do things. One is your right which doesn&#x27;t harm me, and the other is NOT your right because it CAN harm me.')
