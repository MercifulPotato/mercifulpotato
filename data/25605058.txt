A clock called GrimAge [0] is already capable of predicting lifespan, time-to-cancer etc. better than normal chronological age. It even seems to work for other mammal species [1]. The big question is: is methylation of DNA only a marker, or does it play some functional role in aging.<p>This video contains a new bit of information: when they fixed methylation patterns in experimental mice, the therapy failed. That would hint on a functional role of DNA methylation in the process of aging.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;30669119&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;30669119&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=paiw4QSOtzg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=paiw4QSOtzg</a>')
