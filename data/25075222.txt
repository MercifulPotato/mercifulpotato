Sure, there are some products which work to work around that (like repl.it), but the core problem remains - a student can&#x27;t easily get their Python program to run on an arbitrary computer. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very tempted to move to JS for teaching, despite all of the dragons lurking there.')
