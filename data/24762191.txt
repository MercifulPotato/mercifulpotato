Although I&#x27;m not drinking beer (if you are, cheers), and we&#x27;re not really arguing.<p>I am curious what the mechanism is from the free-market side to prevent increasing income inequality, and regulatory capture by corporations and the wealthy? If we de-regulate, what stops Bezos and Exxon, EvilCorp, and whoever from doing whatever they want (assume for a second that&#x27;s not already happening to some extent under the current setup)? I guess that there&#x27;s a market-based mechanism that is supposed to prevent that, but I don&#x27;t know enough libertarians to have heard the argument.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced we should legislate our way out of anything either, but I can&#x27;t get over the idea that deregulation = noone looking over the shoulders of those with absurd amounts of money and the wolf eats the whole damn henhouse.')
