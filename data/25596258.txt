Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25596484], score=None, time=1609443504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594953, text='I get your point, but I don&#x27;t think this answers the question. The first part of the question is defining what it means to be &#x27;worthwhile.&#x27;<p>Information itself does not have inherent value. If you send a colony information on how to create an advance polymer, but the colony lacks a use for it, the requisite knowledge, the requisite tools, the requisite knowledge to craft the tools, or the requisite materials, your transmission isn&#x27;t &#x27;worth it&#x27;. You&#x27;d be better off <i>not</i> sending the information (possibly in favor of sending the requisite information).<p>The second part of the question is &#x27;How do we know what will be worthwhile <i>in advance</i>?&#x27; It&#x27;s easy to look back X years and say &quot;Yes, this information was worth carrying forward into the future.&quot; (On Earth, it&#x27;s even easier, because carrying that information forward is dirt cheap.) It&#x27;s a much harder problem to figure out what information is worth carrying forward at the time you have to make the decision and when the costs are much higher.')
