They&#x27;re there to audit the portion of the process which can never ever be re-audited: the provenance of secret ballots. Of course if you re-count the same ballots over again you&#x27;ll come up with something roughly the same. This &quot;hand recount had identical* results&quot; mantra to reinforce the core idea &quot;the election has been independently verified&quot; may work on the general public but it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> work on HN.<p>There&#x27;s no need to believe the suitcases were smuggled in, although you yourself appear to have doubts in that direction. For example, they could be perfectly <i>authentic</i> ballots with some flawed provenance. A priori this seems the most plausible explanation.<p>&gt; rather than simply having left.<p>Leaving a semi-public place such as an arena or an office building for the night has the result of not being permitted back in until the next public opening. Your arguments have turned to disingenuity and open trolling.')
