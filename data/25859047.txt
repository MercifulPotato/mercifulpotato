That&#x27;s good enough for <i>one</i> working person. People in cities have gotten the privilege and luxury of routinely getting network upgrades while rural communities are basically left in the dust. I&#x27;ve been stuck out in the country because I got COVID out here and Zoom calls degrade frustratingly fast.<p>One reason is because the only method of delivery that they have is point to point connections, which have a good amount of variability in them despite advancements. When I used to live out here I lived in a different area served by CenturyLink. These lines were incredibly old and in disrepair. So, speed isn&#x27;t the only problem but slow <i>and</i> unstable is not okay in a day when most things require a consistent connection.<p>So, is it fast enough? I don&#x27;t think so. I think a policy which stops upgrading cities until a baseline is met in the rest of the country is also appropriate.')
