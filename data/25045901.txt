We&#x27;d been moving at a slow pace for years, and suddenly, we&#x27;re jumping in strides.<p>I&#x27;m likewise fascinated about how terrible Steam&#x27;s CLIENT works on Linux. Like, no hidpi support, (it&#x27;s just blurry), notifications don&#x27;t work, and lots of other stuff is broken. Sometimes closing a popup closes the main window, but only for _some_ kinds of popups. It also only works via X11 &#x2F; XWayland.<p>Fortunately, they keep getting all the really hard stuff done.')
