Speaking as both a bug bounty vet, and a consulting vet (I run includesecurity.com), here&#x27;s my .02 on some things you may not have considered given your comment.<p>1) Sam and the other hackers did not do this as a full time gig, they primarily do this as moonlighting from their full time jobs (you can verify this on LinkedIn)<p>2) Consultants are often given tight scopes, and these artificial client-driven constraints often prevent consultants from identifying similar findings as Sam and crew found.<p>3) Bug bounties provide no defined level of assurance. They found an SSRF, but it is a very real possibility that somebody in their crew (or an individual bug hunter) doesn&#x27;t have experience in that particular topic and Apple would have never been the wiser. In a bug bounty you&#x27;re at the whim of the crowd&#x27;s varying skills and interests. You can game this by offering larger bounties, but you can&#x27;t pre-define a scope or level of assurance.<p>4) They&#x27;ve gotten paid ~$50k thus far for four bugs, if you read the article they mention they&#x27;ll very likely be getting paid more. I&#x27;d be surprised if their total payout isn&#x27;t six figures when all is said and done.<p>5) Your stated rate for consulting firms charge for a particular role is correct for the US market, but the level of &quot;seniority&quot; in a senior consultant varies wildly. Many large firms will undeservedly give somebody with two years experience the title &quot;senior&quot;, regardless of actual skillset.<p>6) You state &quot;a group of amateurs will do better work&quot;, first point is to note these five are not amateurs in any way! They&#x27;re in the top 1% of global bug bounty hackers. Second it seems like you&#x27;re defining &quot;better&quot; as &quot;finds more vulnerabilities from a blackbox bug bounty perspective&quot;. I find that client&#x27;s IRL don&#x27;t define things in the same way you&#x27;ve done here.<p>7) &quot;but over the years I&#x27;ve found that the difference in the security world is that you hire a small shop to discover the truth about risks, but you pay a big firm to lie about them.&quot; This I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more on, it is MIND BOGGLING to me that firms with no ethics, actual standards, or transparency are the top firms in the security assessment&#x2F;pentesting space. For an industry that proports to hate snake oil security, we sure are comfortable with a ton of snake oil security assessments.<p>8) This industry needs standards, for-profit old boys clubs are not the way\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;ncc_group_crest_cheat_sheets&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;11&#x2F;ncc_group_crest_cheat...</a>\nAnd the grass roots&#x2F;non-profit approach also failed due to lack of advocacy, adoption, and persistent leadership. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentest-standard.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentest-standard.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Main_Page</a><p>I&#x27;d love to see a world where Bug Bounties and full security assessments can live harmoniously and people do flip out declaring one or the other service totally useless all the damn time.')
