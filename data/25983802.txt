I think the distinction is important, as both lawsuits and potential investigations into market manipulation and fraud will hinge on this point. Especially since it seems certain hedge funds &quot;in the know&quot; seemed to reload shorts before the action that was taken, so while Robinhood might have queued up for this action expecting the they might run into legal requirements, they however decided to instead pull the trigger themselve, potentially because acting in good faith they would not run into  a legal requirement, which would have left people holding a huge bag on top of their existing losses, potentially bankrupting a couple of major players and likely killing robinhood as well.')
