They consider not just whether the player is playing the excellent moves (something common at any level and very common at high levels), but also how a deep search is needed to evaluate that move, whether other obvious moves were available, how long was taken to play the move, if the position is common, etc. When these serial cheaters are banned, the sites even refund rating points to everyone who lost to them.<p>However, the issue of isolated cheating incidents is still a big deal, even if the serial obvious cheaters can be detected.')
