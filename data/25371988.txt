Brexit did not change that regulation in any way; it would take a unanimous vote of the Council of the European Union to amend it, and it is very unlikely that Ireland would vote to remove as an official language the first language of the vast majority of its citizens.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;eli&#x2F;reg&#x2F;1958&#x2F;1(1)&#x2F;2013-07-01" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;eli&#x2F;reg&#x2F;1958&#x2F;1(1)&#x2F;2013-07-01</a>')
