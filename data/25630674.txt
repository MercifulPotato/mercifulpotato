It is a baseline expectation of a modern chat solution to be able to ping others by name.<p>However, the minimally viable form of the @mention feature is where you stop. Skip all things that are not “the @mentioned user received a notification when I send the message”<p>If you disagree with me, please explain why. I don’t at all believe that a Slack MVP that is nothing more than a WebRTC chat demo would be a sellable MVP in 2020. MVP and prototyping seems to be very conflated.')
