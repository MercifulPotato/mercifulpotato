That doesn&#x27;t mean anyone stole this election. That certainly doesn&#x27;t mean Democrats stole this election. But it does mean we should secure them.<p>Of course, physical security is a cheap and easy step. The harder part is gaming our media. If attackers can help direct where voters vote with $$$, that&#x27;s a cheap attack too.<p>As a footnote, if I were an attacker, of any type, I wouldn&#x27;t even bother with the November election. The easiest place to attack is primaries. Both 2020 and 2016, we had among the weakest candidates among the crop win.<p>We&#x27;re going from a con artist to a senile mildly corrupt lifetime politician of limited accomplishment. UPGRADE! I&#x27;ll expect we&#x27;ll move from major corruption to minor corruption, without an attempted coup.<p>What I think we deserve, though, is a politician with intelligence, vision, and integrity.<p>That requires fixing systems, rather than GOP pointing to DNC, and vice-versa.')
