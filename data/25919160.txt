There&#x27;s also now the RP3 Model T that was released a few months after I got the regular RP3. I&#x27;m in the PNW, so I was able to save on shipping by picking up the RP3 in person from the US distributor.<p>I&#x27;m really quite happy with it and far prefer it to a C2. The software is pretty decent too and the force curve in particular is quite useful to help you figure out how to connect all three motions smoothly for mostly consistent even power.<p>Family and friends that have used it have struggled with getting started with it but mainly because they&#x27;ve learned such bad form from static machines like the C2. But near as I can tell that will happen with anyone used to a static rower that&#x27;s never been on the water or coached on proper form.')
