Imagine how inexpensive and reliable cars could be they could be if that was the prime buyer consideration? But instead, car manufacturers keep adding complexity (and take less risks) to stay competitive. On top of that, regulatory bodies are also demanding higher complexity (sensors and cameras, more airbags). This is not bad onto itself, however it means that the question of cheaper and environmentally friendly car vs luxurious, safe, and roomy car has already been made for us.<p>That&#x27;s a part of why I love 90&#x27;s cars so much. Reliability was paramount (especially in the Japanese brands) and luxury was just for the luxury cars. I will be upset when these cars start to die out.<p>I really hope that US&#x2F;Canada&#x27;s regulations change to allow microcars. We are still allowed motorcycles, so we are left with a fairly large gap between complete death machine and car-sized SUVs. Why not introduce the quadricycles legislation? Japan has KEI cars, Europe has microcars, yet the US and Canada have nothing of the sort. It is unfortunate.')
