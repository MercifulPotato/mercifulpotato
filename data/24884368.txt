I&#x27;m not sure why media keeps characterising the Swedish strategy as &quot;herd immunity&quot;. I would rather characterize it as <i>sustainable</i>: i.e., find <i>minimum</i> and <i>stable</i> restrictions that keep the spread below 1. It balances fatality reduction and disturbance avoidance, because the population has time to adjust and internalise the restrictions.<p>Contrast that to countries having mass lockdown protests or our neighbors who add and remove restrictions on a weekly basis.<p>Another &quot;inconvenient truth&quot;, thanks to good welfare, there is not &quot;come to work sick&quot; heroism in Sweden. You are basically paid to keep your kids and yourself at home, for as little as a running nose.')
