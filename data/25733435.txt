But I am having a little hard time with this, some part of my brain just wont&#x27; accept it.<p>I completely understand, we need to &quot;unlearn&quot; what we know about policing and criminal justice. It&#x27;s a hard process that takes generations, but at the end of the day it will lead to less offensive behaviour overall. As a society we&#x27;re too &quot;reactive&quot; to problems.
