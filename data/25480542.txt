You should be able to target ads without using ubiquitous tracking, by looking for forums, newsletters, podcasts, shows, meetups, etc. related to your target audience or product area. But if everybody uses Facebook for everything, you can&#x27;t do any targeting, you have to just describe your audience to Facebook and ask them to please find people for you.<p>The internet should have made targeted marketing easier, because people would effectively target themselves by visiting sites devoted to topics and communities they care about, instead of everyone watching the same four TV channels. But Facebook wants to become the only &quot;internet channel&quot;, monopolizing the ability to target and forcing you to go through them.')
