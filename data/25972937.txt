I have a Brother  MFCJ6535DW inkjet printer that&#x27;s rated at 35 ppm black and white and 22 ppm color. I haven&#x27;t measured it precisely, but it&#x27;s doing at least 20 pages per minute.<p>I think when it was new it cost around $500, but I got this one as a refurb for $180.<p>(my wife works in a state regulated industry and prints a <i>lot</i> of paper - 500 - 1500 pages&#x2F;month, so the printer gets a workout, and consumables are cheap - a 3000 page black ink cartridge costs around $25, about half the price as toner for our old laser printer and has no other consumables to replace like a fuser drum)')
