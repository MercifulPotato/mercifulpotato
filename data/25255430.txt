Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=[25257009], score=None, time=1606753447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25255026, text='&gt; I think this misses the parent’s point.<p>Just because you disagree with me, it doesn’t mean that I misunderstood the viewpoint I’m responding to.<p>&gt; The point is to not let the algorithm make decisions.<p>And my response is—that’s not enough. It sounds like the algorithm, because it is biased, has the effect of increasing the bias in the whole system. If your response is that humans should work harder to counteract biases in machine systems, well, I think that’s just a way to CYA and assign blame but not a way to solve the problem—humans will remain biased, and they will trust automated systems even when that trust is misplaced.<p>As an analogy, it’s like a driver in a partially autonomous car. As soon as the automation takes over, the driver stops paying attention to the road. We can make a big fuss and production and talk about how it’s the driver’s fault, and the driver should pay attention, but we’ve placed them in a system where they are discouraged from paying attention, and the system is more dangerous as a consequence.<p>&gt; Also guns don’t kill people, people do. Otherwise explain to me why it would be okay for certain institutions to be armed but not individuals. If guns are the problem, then no one should have them (including the military&#x2F;police).<p>This is a false dilemma &#x2F; false dichotomy. This argument assumes that EITHER access to guns is to blame OR people are to blame, but not both, but there are obviously other ways to think about the problem.<p>Any rational way to look at problems will look at multiple contributing factors.')
