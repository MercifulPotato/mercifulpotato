Well, unless you&#x27;re <i>the</i> furthest to the right (in some combination of talents), then there&#x27;s someone further out there than you.  You can beat yourself up about not being as smart as they are, but you&#x27;d have to be <i>the smartest</i> to avoid it.  So, maybe you should stop expecting that you <i>should</i> be able to keep up.<p>What&#x27;s more, for some of these people, it wasn&#x27;t easy for them, either.  General relativity wasn&#x27;t easy for Einstein.  He literally asked someone to &quot;come help me with the mathematics before I go mad&quot;.  That is, Einstein thought he wasn&#x27;t smart enough to understand it!<p>Comparing yourself to others on smarts is a game you can only lose, because someone else is always smarter.  Even if you&#x27;re the smartest (Einstein, maybe), there&#x27;s some related area or different combination where you&#x27;re not.  Someone else is better at math... or has more background in algebraic topology... or Hilbert spaces... or...<p>So don&#x27;t be so hard on yourself.  Stop playing the comparison game, because you can only lose.  Instead, be who you are, and make the most you can of who that is.')
