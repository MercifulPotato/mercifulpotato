That might seem odd. How can there be more energy as output than input? But that’s exactly what heat pumps and air conditioners do. They use electricity to shift heat from the outside to inside, or vice-versa, and typically provide three units of energy service for one unit of energy input, meaning an efficiency of 300%.&quot;<p>Article seems to arguing against basic thermodynamic laws. Air conditioners and heat pumps do not output more energy than they consume. You can&#x27;t move heat around without expending lots of energy. I&#x27;m suspicious this is just uptalk trying convince people renewables can replace fossil fuels without any new data, just confusing lines of arguments.')
