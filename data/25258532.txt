Mainly, it&#x27;s the better out-of-order execution that is possible with a large ROB, and how this wouldn&#x27;t work as well on X86.<p>Your points don&#x27;t explain why at 3Ghz this chip can outperform 5Ghz chips in single-threaded workloads. Using a 5nm process can give you more cores and less power usage, but it won&#x27;t improve IPC. The DDR4 is faster than average, but you can get those kinds of speeds on enthusiast PCs and it doesn&#x27;t make a big difference there.')
