These companies have every right to legally censor those they disagree with.<p>2. By exercising that right they put themselves at risk of being regulated more stringently (as utilities for example) when they demonstrate inelasticity in consumer choice.<p>3. I&#x27;d rather them not be treated as utilities because that hampers competition and thus impedes efficiency.<p>4. Your statement above is a farcical caricature of conservative ideology. Every product&#x2F;service deserves a debate on what regulation is appropriate but as a society regulation only exists because bad actors necessitated its creation. No one wants car seats for their 8 year olds - we&#x27;d much rather be trusted to do the right thing.')
