Dying when struck by a bus is natural. That doesn&#x27;t mean that busses are a natural feature of the world, or that you shouldn&#x27;t look before crossing, or that an ER shouldn&#x27;t make an effort to save the bus-stricken.<p>What do you make of the fact that connecting aged organs to young mice restores the organs? I think we should pursue drugs and treatments that improve function in aged populations, do you? Maybe ageing bodies just need to be occasionally cleaned out to restore healthy function.<p>Maybe it is &quot;natural&quot; to die, but unnecessary to suffer collapse along the way?
