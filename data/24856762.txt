He never suggested it - I researched the options myself and found that patients who did the nerve block recovered faster and better, and yet right up until I rolled into surgery, the doctor was trying to convince me to do anesthesia. Sadly, I think the reason is that anesthesia makes patients  easier to manage during surgery, which makes the docâ€™s job easier even if it is ultimately worse for the patient.')
