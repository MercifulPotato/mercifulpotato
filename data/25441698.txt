In other words, Brazil needs to be compensated for not utilizing its natural resources. The majority of Western countries exhausted their natural resources (including forests) for economic gain and have no right to point fingers at Brazil, especially when they buy meat and soya from Brazil. It&#x27;s important to note that Brazil has more preserved nature and a smaller carbon footprint than most - all? - countries that criticize it. I&#x27;m all for preserving the Amazon but the entitlement and double standards that surface in discussions about this subject are ridiculous.')
