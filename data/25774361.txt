I&#x27;ve met plenty of people who are brilliant at a few things but absolutely terrible at most other things. Are they then smart or dumb? You tell me.<p>What does matter is that he started an illegal war and lied to other nations to get them to join in on it, including the one where I live. That&#x27;s why W. is still a worse president than Trump.<p>Edit: people seem to think this is an endorsement of Trump, it is absolutely not. Trump is a dangerous madman who will do anything to stay in power, but so far the damage has been limited. W. caused the death of millions with his illegal war, in that he is the worse president.')
