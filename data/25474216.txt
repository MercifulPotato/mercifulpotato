PCR works to produce DNA because the DNA polymerase enzyme creates DNA copies from DNA templates, and those copies become templates themselves, feeding back into the chain reaction.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of similar enzymes capable of making RNA copies from RNA templates (RNA polymerases use DNA templates AFAIK).<p>I was imagining the RNA vaccines would have used a fully synthetic oligo production method, to get the extreme purity required. But it might be that some sort of PCR-like amplification process is used. Would love to read more if someone has details.')
