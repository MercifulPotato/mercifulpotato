And that may be his experience of politicians, but it doesn&#x27;t define the field any more than Mulligans define golf.  Champion golfers don&#x27;t take Mulligans, don&#x27;t kick their ball closer to the hole, and don&#x27;t miscount strokes.  They are all far too earnest, and have been since they started in the sport.<p>Likewise with politics.  MLK did what he did because he cared for the rights of people.  So did Thomas Jefferson,  They&#x27;re not the only ones, though it is difficult to come up with examples that are universally admired because when it comes to politics, we all have different opinions, because we all have different interests.<p>But what is politics?  When I studied it at university, we learned on the first day that politics is just who gets what, where, when, and how, in a society.<p>Anyone who fights for the rights of other people in society, whether for left or right, for rich or for poor, may be earnest, and virtuous in the eyes of their peers.')
