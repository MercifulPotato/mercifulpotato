I&#x27;m reminded of the fact that most binary search algorithms are badly broken:<p>&gt; When Jon Bentley assigned binary search as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, mainly because the incorrect implementations failed to run or returned a wrong answer in rare edge cases. A study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks. Furthermore, Bentley&#x27;s own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book Programming Pearls, <i></i>contained an overflow error that remained undetected for over twenty years<i></i>. The Java programming language library implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.<p>Knuth had this to say:<p>&gt; Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Binary_search_algorithm#Implementation_issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Binary_search_algorithm#Implem...</a><p>If the experts can&#x27;t get it right, no developer in an interview setting has a chance. It&#x27;s a game of &quot;gotcha.&quot; The interviewer has some trick that they are privy to and are waiting for the interviewee to mess up and... GOTCHA! You got it wrong, it&#x27;s this clever trick that you would have to know ahead of time! Silly person thinking they can get a job here without knowing the secret handshake.')
