AI ethics papers are not exactly the kind of material that gets a lot of conversation at the best of times, outside that world, but Google firing a black woman for speaking up is the kind of thing that definitely does get talked about (as we can see here).<p>But that aside, Google should <i>want</i> this kind of paper published. They absolutely should want to know and discuss every possible weakness in the ethics of their approach to AI - Google has a scale of influence so large that how they act in areas like AI, trickles down to many other organisations. To me, that gives them a responsibility to make it as ethical as is reasonably possible, and that will only happen if experts are allowed to speak freely.<p>One can make short-term arguments about how that hurts them, but the long-term damage of getting massive AI systems wrong, will be far, far worse.')
