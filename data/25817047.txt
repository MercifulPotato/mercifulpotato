The reason it has <i>so many</i> is because I run two different jails from it - my unbound jail and my nsd jail share the same directory&#x2F;mountpoint.<p>Which is to say, I run two different jail commands, that start two different jails with different IPs and startup commands, but they both point to the same directory&#x2F;mountpoint.<p>Updates consist of replacing a few binary executables.<p>Not everything will fit into that model, but when it does, it is fantastic.')
