The only piece of code that has mutual exclusion is an attempt to commit the transaction. The kind of thinking required to implement such algorithms is quite different than when you can rely on mutual exclusion.<p>(Also, not all architecture use hardware mechanisms to enforce actual mutual exclusion. For example, Power does not, as it uses load-linked, stored-conditional: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Load-link&#x2F;store-conditional" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Load-link&#x2F;store-conditional</a>. On Power, even things like atomic increments are implemented with LL&#x2F;SC. Architectures basically have to decide: will they implement atomics through some kind of a lock mechanism, or some kind of LL&#x2F;SC mechanism.)')
