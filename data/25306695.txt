Too big to judge from a short summary.\nCan you back this up with some references? and some explanatory readings?<p>Ideally, and since the audience is at a varying levels, a number of complementary sources, along with a few words, would be best.<p>Not sure if what you talk about is related to quantum decoherence, so I&#x27;ll take that as an example.<p><pre><code>    * Some formal peer-reviewed scientific paper? (Probably too dry for 99,99% of people including me, but I&#x27;ll try to at least read the abstract, introduction and conclusion.)\n    * Some Wikipedia article, like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_decoherence ?\n    * Some blog or &quot;popular&quot; science magazine?\n    * Some video, like from PBS Space Time https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vSnq5Hs3_wI\n    * Some different video, like Sabine&#x27;s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=igsuIuI_HAQ or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Be3HlA_9968\n    * Some simpler video like, I don&#x27;t know, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LsxJmHS0cc8 if it even make sense?\n</code></pre>\nI hope there are some that explain your actual, precise point, precisely.
