And if it were clear as day and night, those vendors probably would have fixed their problems and we wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation in the first lace.<p>But if you&#x27;ll allow your question to be answered with pure rumortown and supposition:<p>Intel has engrained management issues that don&#x27;t allow for reorganizing to systemically address their 10nm and under process issues as the little fiefdoms that control different parts of the process are spending more time throwing each other under the bus rather than collaborating.<p>Samsung isn&#x27;t far off from TSMC (about a single node).  They fell a little behind as TSMC grabbed a bunch of their contracts (most notably Apple) which left them with not as much to capital to invest in their newer process nodes at a rather critical point.  At a bare minimum they&#x27;ll be kept alive by TSMC&#x27;s customers as a viable second source (if you squint hard enough) as a negotiating tactic (see Nvidia&#x27;s 30 series on Samsung as a shot across TSMC&#x27;s bow).<p>GloFlo canceled 7nm and under R&amp;D.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they bounce back at some point when all of the EUV gotcha workarounds are more or less public knowledge and the equipment doesn&#x27;t have prices on the order of a small country&#x27;s GDP.  If we hit fundamental limits at ~1nm and Moore&#x27;s law really dies, then they should be able to jump back in with relatively less work than a newcomer and be the budget option once leading edge chips become a commodity.')
