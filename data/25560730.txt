Amazon still hasn&#x27;t been able to solve the fake and paid&#x2F;biased reviews.<p>I strongly believe the &quot;review &amp; rating&quot; model itself, for influencing purchasing impulses, is the broken part!<p>I&#x27;ve bought a few things with AMAZING reviews only to be super disappointed and had to escalate the issue to credit card company to get my money back.
