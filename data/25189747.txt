The double standards involved make it <i>worse</i>, but the only reason it&#x27;s a problem to begin with is that instead of letting you meaningfully preserve content game and movie studios (here in the US at least), movie and game studios instead can opt to keep repeatedly dipping into our collective wallets for the same content, all because now it&#x27;s wrapped in a new emulator and&#x2F;or DRM scheme.<p>&quot;Slippi requires illegal mods&quot; is only an argument to begin with because, despite backups and format shifting generally being fair use, bypassing the requisite copy-protection to do these things violates the DMCA anyway, as does trafficking in anything that can even if your use is explicitly exempted (accessibility, for instance).<p>It&#x27;s a ridiculous, visibly letter-of-the-law problem that we&#x27;ve had as long as the DMCA has existed (anyone remember RealDVD?), and ultimately it renders basic consumer protections as being subject to a publisher&#x27;s veto.')
