They are using a hybrid input [1] in combination with their software package to reconstruct higher fidelity reference genomes.<p>The big impact from that paper is really summarized by this:<p>&gt; WENGAN assembly of the haploid CHM13 sample achieved a contig NG50 of 80.64 Mb (NGA50: 59.59 Mb), which surpasses the contiguity of the current human reference genome (GRCh38 contig NG50: 57.88 Mb)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41587-020-00747-w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41587-020-00747-w</a><p>[1] Long and short reads, for example from Nanopore and Illumina, respectively')
