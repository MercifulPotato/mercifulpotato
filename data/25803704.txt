It’s still down. Their Java servers doesn’t seem to handle this scale well and aren’t reliable for this.<p>The fact that they have to “Add more servers” to handle this traffic tells you exactly why Erlang &#x2F; Elixir or BEAM VM languages are better suited for this (And also can save them money instead of provisioning more servers on AWS).<p>&gt; obviously they need a solution that works with the stack they currently have<p>It was down before even when they had less users. One user made this suggestion 3 years ago, and Signal looked at this. Plenty of time to switch.<p>&gt; proposing Erland at this time is asinine.<p>You mean 3 years ago with their $60M in funding? Plenty of time and money to hire an Erlang &#x2F; Elixir consultant.')
