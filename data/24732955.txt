Wages are dictated by supply and demand, not efficiency.<p>An oversimplified example [with lots of nuances I&#x27;m sure people will comment on instead of the original point]: The supply of heart surgeons is small, therefore they can command a larger wage and have their choice of jobs. The supply of burger-flippers is much larger and employers can usually find someone willing to do the labor for cheaper than another person.<p>The point being, the best way to increase your wage is to switch jobs to something where the supply of applicants is smaller and the demand is strong.')
