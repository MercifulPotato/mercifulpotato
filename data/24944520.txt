That&#x27;s not moderation, that&#x27;s editorial control and at that point I think it&#x27;s more than reasonable to argue you have crossed the threshold from platform to publisher.<p>Usenet survived for decades and still does without some central bureaucracy lording over it.  Have an issue with them?  Plonk!<p>Freaking snowflakes.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions and this is the slipperiest road yet.  Sunlight is the best disinfectant.  Remember when that used to be a catch phrase of the left?  What a bizzaro time we live in.')
