Very high taxes on fuel would also incentivize people to buy EV.<p>I don&#x27;t use a car much that is why I have a used one for ~2500$. I know a mechanic for cheap repairs, I need it occasionally to reach friends and family and public transport is not an option since time has become so valuable and it doesn&#x27;t work for emergencies.<p>I would not want to spend 20,000$ on a car because it would just be parked most of the time. Especially among younger people I see this very often. It will be interesting to see EVs hit used markets. My company leases cars for 50,000$ without thinking twice and some people just love cars that much, but that isn&#x27;t realistic for the vast majority of people.<p>Currently used EV can cost 25,000$. Not viable for the mass market.')
