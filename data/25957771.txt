Which means that we can&#x27;t trust blindly on markets to allocate resources efficiently, but we need to have careful discussion about in which circumstances it is prudent to restrict the market operations (including price, supply and demand).<p>What is weird, is how rare it is to find either of these approaches in public discussion. (For the record, I am in the latter camp. And no, I do not propose fullo on communism and regulated markets, but &quot;to have careful discussion about in which circumstances it is prudent to restrict the market operations&quot;)')
