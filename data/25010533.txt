Who prints documents with inkjet?<p>I have a Brother MFCL3730CDN CMYK laser for document scan&#x2F;print&#x2F;copy\nand Epson EcoTank ET-14000 for photo and art prints.<p>A-fscking-mazing devices both.<p>Both provide (to be found somewhere in the maze of modern hardware vendor websites) solid (modulo CUPS wrangling and vendor filesystem layout) Linux packages.
