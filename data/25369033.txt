If this was even 10 years ago, you wouldn&#x27;t even get a live stream of the launch and attempted landing. Perhaps Elon shouldn&#x27;t even live stream this, so negative trolls wouldn&#x27;t be able to assert and express their chair philosopher opinions.<p>The fact that there are another 8-9 SN vehicles being readied at this time for testing tells you exactly what is happening. Slow progress, until they get all the data and metrics to slowly and incrementally making improvements.<p>To all the haters, go find somewhere else to spread your negativity.')
