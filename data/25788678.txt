E.g. the EU buys X certificates from the market every year and destroys them and grants less certs each year.\nEvery company that emits &quot;significant&quot; CO2 needs to have, buy or be granted certs to do so. The setup makes those certs more expensive, so every year, there&#x27;s a tradeoff: do I buy certs, or do I invest in lowering my emission.<p>Apps such as Fairshares allow public to buy (pieces of) such certs.')
