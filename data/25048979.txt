The amount of work it takes to get a midlevel FAANG or similar job is a lot less than to start a business. I honestly think people think it’s “otherworldly” or similarly impossible for themselves because they don’t have the confidence to try, or have some extenuating restriction that makes it feel unattainable.<p>Of course the author is right that a $3.7m exit is non-trivial and that $1k MRR is not a bad place to start but it’s crazy to call people making larger amounts of money as employees “gods” and likely a disservice to oneself to use that kind of language to make them seem like some far away, impossible to reach or understand group.')
