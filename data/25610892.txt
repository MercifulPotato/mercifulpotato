In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions.&quot;<p>&gt; MOSTLY RIGHT<p>I&#x27;ll quibble with this one and call it mostly wrong. Yes, a very narrow and specific set of possible cardiac abnormalities can be detected (with significant error rates) by the Apple Watch&#x27;s optical (PPG) and electric (ECG) heart rate sensors. Other vendors have functionally equivalent capabilities.<p>But medically speaking, smartwatches are probably decades away from independently diagnosing anything, let along recommending an intervention (i.e. a drug or surgery). Kurzweil&#x27;s terms have specific meanings in medicine and current technology is nowhere close to that.<p>What exists today (or, in 2019) is a very narrow use case and far from the broad and general scenario Kurzweil envisioned. And there is no realistic roadmap to achieve any more than incremental development in this area - PPG and ECG were &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; in some sense, and medically actionable wearable sensors for pretty much any other medical signal present orders of magnitude larger engineering challenges that few people are even seriously working on.  Hence, &quot;mostly wrong.&quot;')
