I did work for the DOD, and arguably the DOD does not have access to nearly as sensitive information as the State Department or at times Congress. The most <i>basic</i> procedures for classified information require that it be stored behind locked metal cages, in bank-style vaults, with encrypted hard drives, accessed via SMART cards, and transferred via an armed escort. When I left for Afghanistan there was one person carrying Top Secret information and the case it was carried in was handcuffed to him, not only was he armed but he had an armed escort as well.<p>The notion or idea that some Congressperson has Classified+ information sitting behind a wood or glass door sounds highly suspicious.<p>Edit: changed &quot;fake news&quot; to &quot;misinformation&quot;')
