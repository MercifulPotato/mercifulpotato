And you&#x27;ll make green energy pay for itself so quickly everyone will be installing it.<p>History doesn&#x27;t agree with your view, if anything it creates a perverse market wherein people who benefit from the status quo pay people who don&#x27;t in order to skirt their supposed environmental responsibilities and commitments as they continue as they did before. Just look at the Carbon Credit model and the relationship Tesla had with the big auto manufactures [0].<p>&gt; <i>As a spokesman for Fiat Chrysler said: “Until demand catches up with regulatory requirements, and there is regulatory relief, we will use credits as appropriate.”</i><p>I worked for VW during Diesel gate, and I can tell you that this is standard operational procedure for the Industry and what made me quit in utter disgust. It will not change course unless dire, existential consequences are imminent. And it has to be more severe than what Diesel-gate cost VW.<p>You could argue this gave Tesla a lifeline that it otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have had during its early years after the original Roadster was released and they were working on the Model S, but those are tertiary effects at best and consequential more than anything.<p>In short, no, nothing seems to indicate that is what occurs when you allow the State to create such a system as it will always allow for exemptions if their is profit to be made.<p>Making individual people at these corps responsible for things like Ecocide and have the dire consequences (actual prison time) for the infractions multi national corps currently get out of with political bribes (campaign contributions and fundraising) and lobbying would be a much better start.<p>Some VW execs got thrown in jail and VAG lost ~$12 billion from diesel gate, and yet the brand gained Market share in certain emerging markets that offset those losses. Incidentally, many other manufactures (Ford, Subaru, Mazda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Nissan-Renault, Harley Davidson) were all caught cheating emissions as well and weren&#x27;t nearly as punished in the US. In fact Nissan was able to purchase Mitsubishi Motors US outright in the midst of the VW fall out with no scandal.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-greenhouse-gas-credits-dont-help-the-environme&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;jan&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-greenho...</a>')
