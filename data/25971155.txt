I would not really consider it free software in this current state (at least this is probably not GPL compatible, because this is not the &quot;source code&quot; by the GPL definition -- this is not the &quot;preferred form of the work for making modifications to it&quot;)<p>But they plan to re-release with &quot;cleaned up&quot; comments. It will be way more interesting then, and with no ambiguity about its free software compatibility status.<p>Edit: to be clear I&#x27;m not really complaining, it is more that I&#x27;m eager to see the real thing, and also wanted to remind people what &quot;source code&quot; is by the definition of an important licence for free software. Here this is specified as &quot;MIT License&quot;, which is often considered compatible with GNU GPL v2 or v3: but be warry that it is doubtful this is compatible with the GPL in this state, you&#x27;ll have to wait a little if you want to do an integration in this direction.')
