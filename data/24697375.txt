Superficially, the musical activity which looks most like typing is simply playing an instrument.  And sight-reading does feel a bit like typing.  But I wonder if he&#x27;s talking about transcription in that quote.  One can sight read complex music without learning anything about it if they happen to just be a good sight reader.  But transcription really does force you to pay attention to structural nuances you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t get just by listening to a piece of music.')
