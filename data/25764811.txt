Item(by='nickelcitymario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610557344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761506, text='&gt; I think hybrid classes are probably better.<p>Back in 2000&#x2F;2001, my high school was experimenting with Cisco classes. We did modules online, but the teacher was in the room to answer any questions and to oversee projects as we networked servers together, etc.<p>It was great! I remember thinking this was the way all education should be done, and that it was inevitable that it would become the standard.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I still consider it inevitable, but it worked  well.<p>Contrast that to my experience in university... the endless lecture halls, overpriced text books, and emphasis on memorization over understanding. Absurd.<p>Equally absurd: Online courses. I&#x27;m big on self-directed learning, but the problem with online courses is that you&#x27;re on your own. This is a problem when you run into subjects where you don&#x27;t even know what it is that you don&#x27;t know. (You can only Google for solutions if you know what to Google in the first place.)<p>So I like the idea of the hybrid model: Let the student take the lead, provide all the online tools needed, but do so in a supportive environment where problems can be troubleshot immediately with a teacher.')
