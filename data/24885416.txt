But it&#x27;s hard for me not to notice that you&#x27;re commenting on web forums, which means you probably haven&#x27;t given up on the creature comforts of modernity. If you&#x27;re not willing to do it, what gives you the right to tell half of India to?<p>Which is another way to say: &quot;How dare you criticize capitalism from your smartphone?&quot;<p>This argument is so old, overused and has been debunked so much already, but I&#x27;ll do it once again for you, even though it would take the intellectual honesty and introspection capacity of an 8 years old to realize it&#x27;s a really bad argument.<p>1) We don&#x27;t choose to be born and live in this society. It just happens, and we don&#x27;t get to learn the survival skills necessary to do without it. Therefore, one could say we&#x27;re stuck in it. Especially considering nowadays everything is property of someone, you can&#x27;t just go and take a piece of forest to have your primitive tribe there.<p>2) Technology and innovation ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE to Capitalism. Repeat it once again if you need. Soviets had a space program too you realize that? Saying that Capitalism is the only way to have innovation, because someone invented iPhone under Capitalism means having no idea of what false correlation is. I&#x27;d suggest studying the very basis of statistics before making such claims.<p>&gt;Maybe the old way of living wasn&#x27;t really that nice.<p>Maybe we can take the best from both worlds. Lose the hunger for profit, the abstract finance, the exploitation and keep the progress.')
