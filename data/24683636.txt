But when a group of Representatives come together, its a congress. When people are advising the President, its a cabinet.</i><p>Posses, congresses, and cabinets (in the US) are all legal distinctions. A group of people doesn&#x27;t suddenly become a posse because a sheriff assembled them or a cabinet because a president took their advice.<p>That&#x27;s also true for the military groups. They are defined not just by size, but by composition (which varies by country and force). If you have 30,000 troops sitting in a crowd at a USO show, they don&#x27;t suddenly become a corps.')
