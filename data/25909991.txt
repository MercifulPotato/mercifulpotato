The same is basically true for the longer range low bandwidth links that curve around the Earth.<p>Starlink is at a disadvantage because fundamentally it&#x27;s pathing across a sphere with a larger radius so even when the path is direct across the Starlink cluster it still has to traverse a longer distance than the equivalent path on the ground. Adding to that the path won&#x27;t always be directly across the surface of the constellation, depending on where you are and where the destination is you&#x27;ll find some pockets where the link has to zig zag across the constellation slightly adding to the additional link distance. This [0] isn&#x27;t necessarily a perfect representation but it does show how starlink&#x27;s linking may work and how it&#x27;s not a perfect net. It also doesn&#x27;t account for the acquisition times for new laser links which were on the order of 20 seconds in another laser sat link test.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AdKNCBrkZQ4?t=103" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AdKNCBrkZQ4?t=103</a> (it&#x27;s also comparing fiber to Starlink where the best in class now is radio links generally)')
