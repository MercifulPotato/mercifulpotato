Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609201725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563641, text='&gt; For the most simple CRUD apps, there is almost zero business logic.<p>Sure, which is why there is no reason to code them specifically at all as unique applications. Instead, the domain isn&#x27;t the business domain of a particular application but far more general, and then you code something like PostgREST in Haskell where the domain is mapping between database and API calls, and solve the problem generally, and define specific applications just with database schemas.<p>“Domain logic” is only “business logic” when you&#x27;ve decided you need a bespoke app built for a specific business problem, which makes sense when you have a complex business problem, but is simply wasteful when you have a problem for which a general solution already exists. It&#x27;s like asking who is the best designer go go to for a one-off custom car for perfectly average daily commuting use: you&#x27;ve chosen from the outset an inefficient solution to your problem.')
