Everyone was safe, everyone was happy.<p>Then in the last minute of the show, out of no where, an alien no one had ever seen before swoops in and disintegrates the main characters.<p>&quot;To be continued&quot; flashes on the screen.<p>The series was canceled before this episode aired&#x2F;was finished, and that&#x27;s how they chose to go out.
