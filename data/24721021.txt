Then you have to deal with whatever customisation the vendor of the motherboard did to firmware - their changes might have resulted in effective disabling of ECC.<p>With Intel, you either have the same game as above (with the non-Xeon ECC-capable parts), or pay through the nose for comparable performance &quot;workstation&#x2F;enterprise&quot; gear, as ECC support being used for market segmentation by intel is pretty much an open secret.')
