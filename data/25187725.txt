I wouldn&#x27;t blindly recommend my stack to everyone, one could argue it&#x27;s probably even overkill for my SaaS project right now. At this scale I could get away with a couple of $20&#x2F;mo instances, and call it a day.<p>However, it just made sense for me due to the simplified operations, and re-using most of the learnings from my full-time job. It has enabled me to move faster in shipping customer-facing features.<p>If I wanted to start a new project, I can leverage the same stack and be up and running in minutes. Which means I can take advantage of my cumulative efforts for any future project.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not for everyone as you said, but it might be a good solution for many :)')
