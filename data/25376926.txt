I look at these apps from the perspective of a reverse engineer but invariably I find places where there is bloat just for the sake of being bloat. There is code that is provably not used, entire libraries that included just so that one small part of it can be used. I see time-related assets that have existed long past the date that they could have possibly been useful. I have seen apps that bundle entire scripting runtimes, apps that have half a dozen in-house telemetry libraries, apps that have megabytes of files in them in the hopes that they may be useful someday.<p>At this point it&#x27;s really hard to believe the argument that &quot;but our app is more complex that you could possibly understand&quot; is valid. Compare your list with a Linux distribution from a handful of years ago: do you have more &quot;screens&quot; than that? Can you do more?')
