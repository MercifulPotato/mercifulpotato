Overtime has to be given as free time within a specific amount of time after the overtime occurred.<p>But for any rolling period of x timeunits (don&#x27;t want to be too specific obviously) I have a specific amount of hours of overtime that the company doesn&#x27;t need to compensate in free time. In my case this is ~20% of my regular time in ever rolling period.<p>But up to a maximum amount of overtime hours per year. This max amount is short of 10% of my yearly hours.<p>So in the end I have to accept about 10% overtime just already compensated with my contract.')
