Because if they were using Gitlab when the DMCA hits they could have easily migrated to their own Gitlab instance.<p>While Github would have to export things into another format. I&#x27;m sure people have worked on exporting data from Github to Gitlab but it seems much easier to just use Gitlab.<p>Edit: And of course besides data, you can&#x27;t migrate contributors as easy. Which is also where Gitlab is powerful because it&#x27;s open source and people are actually discussing federation in it. I doubt Github will ever get any kind of federation outside of microsoft services.')
