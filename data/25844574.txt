He has, in my opinion, fallen for the very &quot;creeping extremism&quot; that he once decried. He does not appear to think rationally any more about the level of threat he perceives, nor of the source or logical outcome of the scenarios which play through his head.<p>The whole Hunter Biden laptop situation is a great example. He decried the fact that media was not covering the allegation, despite the leaps of faith were necessary to consider these allegations in good faith. He ignored the disparity of the threats - the risk that Hunter Biden might be trading off his family name versus the risk that white supremacists might attack the national capital in an attempt to overturn democracy.<p>&gt; I fear that claims that a &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; threat exists will create an industry that at some point, will be too large and profitable to dismantle.<p>Cool. A reasonable fear on the face of things. I mean, I cannot see <i>how</i>, but it is a reasonable fear I suppose. However the problem which raises its ugly head is that Greenwald appears to not give a shit that domestic terrorism just took a large swing at the basis of US democracy, or that support for these terrorists appear to be well entrenched in the police, military and political classes. I mean, by all means avoid the profiteering that the Republicans brought to the threat of Muslim terrorism, but by no means ignore the fact that there exists a large pool of disenfranchised white men who are eager to throw another punch in the direction of their perceived enemies.')
