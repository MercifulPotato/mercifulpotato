Requires actual damages. The speech cost you money or demonstrably harmed you in some way. No, &quot;you hurt my feelings&quot; or &quot;I paid with my identity&quot; doesn&#x27;t count.<p>2. Both parties have an opportunity to plead their case to a neutral adjudicator. The proceedings are generally public record and there is a process for appeals. The rules governing the system (laws) are public record and citizens have a say in electing the representatives who write those rules.<p>3. The speech must be not only demonstrably false, but <i>intended</i> to be believed and also be something that reasonable person could possibly believe. Opinions generally do not meet the level of libel or slander.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s not bad. Compare that to Twitter&#x27;s system where an opaque set of rules are applied inconsistently by an unaccountable party with no appeal process.')
