In other words the seemingly easy pattern for the auditor&#x2F;audience could also be an easy formula for the maker—especially if it were a bot.<p>Does anyone know the state of the art for auto-editing and related auto-labeling to say that  such content would be easy for a bot to assemble. An easy—excuse the expression— ‘toy’ example?<p>Not knowing much about the domain, but I also imagine this content could also be manually edited experiment for labeling experiments?<p>Relatedly, I recall early Twitterbot  experiments. They were usually silly, strange, and all had a clearly detectable conceit.<p>I’m still subscribed to one called Archillect (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;archillect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;archillect</a>). Early days I recall most images were very dark—both monochromatic and thematically. Their &quot;art&quot; would be the subjective evaluation of a visual with it&#x27;s interpretation (&#x27;being&#x27; and &#x27;seeming&#x27; dark both visually and thematically--lots of anime or high-tech, and not much &#x27;nature&#x27;).<p>I’m not saying this isn’t the work of a @$$h@l3.<p>EDIT: edited my description of Archillect as artistic experiment.')
