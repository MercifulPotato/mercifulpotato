I recall vaguely looking into the dpkg and build commands many years ago, it felt kind of inscrutable and clunky and I didn&#x27;t find good resources that made it easy to learn so I just gave up on it and kept using the shell script to install the thing I needed with its dependencies.<p>By contrast, docker build and docker run are super simple to get started with (at least at a high level, figuring out the right order of flags and options to mount volumes and expose ports can get a little cumbersome). And the docker registry is super simple to browse. It&#x27;s so easy to get up and running with, and the model it promises of isolation and self-contained dependencies makes a lot of sense which I think is why it has taken off so much. Despite the fact, which I think is what you&#x27;re pointing out, that there often end up being a lot of pitfalls lurking just around the corner.')
