Not faking an entire scene with multiple people, that&#x27;s just called CGI&#x2F;Animation.<p>So you could easily take existing footage and change who it appears to be.  But,<p>1) doing that to frame or unframe someone will be pretty niche\n2) the original correct footage might still be findable\n3) with access to the video files(which is going to be required in any legal situation), I&#x27;m sure there will be (exists for photos) algorytms that detect the editing the deepfake did to video file.')
