When I play MS Flight Simulator, enable the Dev toolbar, and look at the framerate monitor, it tells me that it&#x27;s spending 20 ms of CPU time per frame, which causes my framerate to cap at 50 fps.  A 20% increase in IPC would theoretically bring the frame time to 16.67 ms, giving me a cap of 60 fps.')
