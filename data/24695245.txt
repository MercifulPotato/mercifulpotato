I&#x27;ve spent too much time obsessing over the tools I use (thanks the endless Linux distro-hopping for that). Nowadays, I&#x27;ve decided to keep it as simple and as boring as possible.<p>I use Todoist, track my time with Toggl, journal and write notes in Joplin. That&#x27;s it. No magical methods here. It just works for me and it doesn&#x27;t distract. I&#x27;m not going into the tool-hopping rabbit hole again just because some YouTube productivity guru said their niche todo app was better than what I was using.<p>I still remember how 2 years ago I dumped Todoist for Wunderlist, then switched to Swipe, then Habitica, then quit to-do apps all together for pen-and-paper time-blocking just for me to return to Todoist recently; dumped Evernote for OneNote, briefly switched to Notion but came back to Evernote anyways before finally finding my home in Joplin a year ago. Don&#x27;t even mention my Linux phase.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a FOSS alternative to Todoist. I don&#x27;t use their sync features so it&#x27;s not a pain to switch.')
