Item(by='natch', descendants=None, kids=[24671264], score=None, time=1601723255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669331, text='My microwave has one round dial that turns. That’s it. And zero buttons.<p>It’s fantastic. Turn the dial, and it starts. The farther around you turn it, the more time you get. The scale is clearly marked around the dial with large readable numbers and gives progressively more coarse as you turn through about 340 degrees or so (less than 360).<p>To abort and turn it off early, just turn the knob back to the zero. Otherwise it turns itself off at the chosen time.<p>There’s a digital readout that tells the time remaining. Simplest interface ever and none of those nasty washable flat panel buttons, or any others as I said.<p>It’s a Sharp brand “Medium Duty Commercial 1000 watt” model. Pretty pricey ($269) but very worth it. At the time, I found it on Amazon but I don’t see it on there now. Model R21LCFS. I see it does come up on duck duck go at some other suppliers like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usaequipmentdirect.com&#x2F;sharp-commercial-medium-duty-1000w-microwave-" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usaequipmentdirect.com&#x2F;sharp-commercial-medium-d...</a> (not a typo that the link ends in a dash apparently).<p>One caveat: it does not have any rotating mechanism inside. This has never been a problem except I do sometimes manually rotate food during a long session. But this is super easy because you don’t have to bend down or punch buttons.<p>ObTV: don’t have one either. Best TV choice imho.')
