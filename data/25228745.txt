Yet if I keep lobbying they&#x27;ll let me keep selling this poison to the masses laughing my ass off. Part of the lobbying that I do is to ensure that every single tobacco death is counted correctly so many slips on a pack of cigarettes and dies and they market tobacco as the death it&#x27;s my job to make sure that that is corrected. Imagine all of the covid deaths they&#x27;re marking just because shortage of supply. There&#x27;s no me to lobby for covid ensuring every death marked by the virus is actually by the virus. I keep seeing stories where a person dies from something completely unrelated to virus yet the doctors blamed covid.')
