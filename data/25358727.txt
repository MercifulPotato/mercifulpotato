Item(by='blandflakes', descendants=None, kids=[25360160], score=None, time=1607523790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355584, text='Absolutely.<p>For applications I built myself, I would often just roll the possible configs for us as files in the container, and you pick one with a single env var (realistically this was like &quot;dev&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;prod&quot;). Not great, but meant I could avoid the clusterfuck that is specifying all my AWS configuration in env vars on a per deploy basis.<p>ConfigMaps could sort of help with this, but I found what you found - having to base64 a config file as a field in a ConfigMap and make sure it gets mounted correctly just seems pretty baroque for configuring something with a file. And at the time, ConfigMap changes didn&#x27;t even cause a redeploy, so your pods would for their lifetime keep on using a stale config!')
