This is obviously entirely unsurprising.<p>I think the more important point, somewhat ironically made on HN, is the critical effects of sleeplessness and promoting healthy sleep as a national public health priority. It seems to me this is just another pernicious example of how lockdowns and disrupting a population’s routines directly and indirectly damages public health.')
