If you want to interface with a database, you need to know how a database works, regardless of what tools you use. I like using ORMs, and I think I write good ORM code. But I also think that I know quite a bit about how databases work, and that I’d be incapable of writing good ORM code if I didn’t.<p>If you give a novice developer an OOP assignment, they’re likely to struggle with the learning curve, and likely to ultimately create something that has a lot of unnecessary complexity. If you give a novice developer MEAN assignment, they’ll create something that “works” a lot easier. But it’ll likely be full of bugs created by not understanding the underlying problems that the framework is simply not forcing you to address.<p>Which is what I think these “simple” frameworks do. Allow you to create working features  without necessarily considering things like consistency and time complexity. I also think it’s why things like Mongo have been slowly adding more ACID consistency, and schema design features. Because people are coming to realize that those are problems that simply can’t go unaddressed. And why ORMs and things like GraphQL have become so popular, which to me look remarkably similar to the structured approach of OOP design patterns.')
