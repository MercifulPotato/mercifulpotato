Essentially, &quot;overt racism&quot; or &quot;active racism&quot; -- using slurs, joining the KKK, refusing to hire people of a certain race, etc.<p>Anything less overt than this is not &quot;racism&quot; to them. Having generally steered clear of such actions in their lives, they are dismayed to consider the possibility that there are a lot of other institutions and individual actions that are racist.<p>We could invent a new term for &quot;systemic racism.&quot; But, ultimately, it&#x27;s still racism. To the people experiencing it, it has the same net result as other forms of racism. If a white person in a predominantly white society doesn&#x27;t hire you because you&#x27;re non-white, there&#x27;s no material difference to you whether that person did it for overt, conscious reasons or otherwise. That is why is it is useful to think of systemic racism as racism, rather than inventing a new word for it.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting thought experiment. Think of the people in your life who are vehemently opposed to the use of the term &quot;racism&quot; to include systemic racism. Suppose we actually did invent a new term for systemic racism so that they could feel more comfortable. How do we think these people would respond?<p>I think a significant number of them would complain about the new term just as much. I can hear them now in my mind. &quot;First we have to worry about being &#x27;racist&#x27;, now we have to worry about $SOME_NEW_TERM!?!? What will &#x27;they&#x27; think of next?!?&quot;<p>Because it&#x27;s not really about words for them. It&#x27;s about a refusal to examine their own actions.')
