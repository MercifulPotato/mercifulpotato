But if it is, why stop at land?<p>Take Google, for instance.  Google owns some buildings on some land.  But, in proportion to how valuable Google is, they don&#x27;t own much land.  What they own is a mountain of code, and multiple mountains of data.  The single most valuable thing they own is the google.com domain.  And out of all of that, we&#x27;re going to tax... the land?  Huh?<p>If all money came from land, then LTV would make sense.  When it was devised, that was more or less true.  But it&#x27;s not the 1800s any more, and that is a <i>long</i> way from true today.')
