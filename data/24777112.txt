It&#x27;s like they forget what made them popular in the first place.<p>What was special about Netflix was this large library of on-demand content and things you may not find anywhere else. I think what early adopters liked about it was you could be deliberate about sitting down to watch something. You&#x27;d put some thought into creating your list. We were trained to do this going back to the DVD days - probably even more so during the DVD rental days. And remember that Netflix had that massive collection of quality movie reviews. I suspect that early adopters had much different viewing patterns than the people who hung around on cable for longer.<p>So what does Netflix do? Make it more like a broadcast. Maybe that&#x27;s what they discovered was necessary to attract the masses. I don&#x27;t know. All I can say is it&#x27;s much different than it used to be and, aside from some really good in-house content, I don&#x27;t like it anymore.')
