California passed a law mandating that all corporate boards appoint minority directors. Minorities are nine times more likely to be affiliated with the leftist democrat party than republican.  That is irrefutable.  Leftists have worked hard to bind social identity with party affiliation in order to control tech companies that monitor and influence the population.<p>Software engineers have almost no power at tech companies and it is leftist managers who choose the people that conduct interviews.  CPO&#x2F;CDO operatives filter all candidates at tech companies, not only engineers.  Their objective in filtering engineers is to prevent too many right wing employees.')
