Putting a lid on international travel early on seemed to make a big difference for Canada, as well as having a nationwide quarantine requirement.<p>I understand the sentiment though. When I visited Canada this year, the border agent read me sections of the Quarantine Act and I was pretty astonished at the extent of federal powers and penalties that had been created on such short notice. The maximum penalty for violating quarantine is a million dollar fine and three years in prison.')
