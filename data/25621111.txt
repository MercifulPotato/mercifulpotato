I asked my doctor about Vitamin K and they told me that it&#x27;s not really necessary so I don&#x27;t take it. I agree that taking it with Omega 3 is a good idea if that&#x27;s already part of your routine. I personally dislike taking pills so I only take Vitamin D because it&#x27;s one very tiny pill. I would also recommend getting a blood test to make sure you&#x27;re getting what you need and not taking things you don&#x27;t need.')
