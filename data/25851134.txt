You need to have political power to speak up against injustices? 98.5% of the US population has not been disenfranchised in 2020. Obviously, joining groups of like-minded people requires such groups to exist, but in the age of social media, they don&#x27;t have to be physically around you any more.<p>I mean, without a doubt every single one of your points is true and applicable in some cases, but for the vast majority of people there is absolutely no problem doing any of the examples I listed.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget our context here: the OP suggested deadly violence against &quot;rentseekers&quot;, and I countered that more civil acts should be taken. I sure hope that despite your arguments above, you&#x27;d still be on my side in that question.')
