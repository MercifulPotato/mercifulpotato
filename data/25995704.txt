It’s true that ADHD patients will likely react differently to stimulants, but the exact differences have been greatly exaggerated online. There are some studies showing that some people respond better to Ritalin than Adderall and vice versa. Prescribers should try switching medications if the patient doesn’t respond.<p>Most people will experience increased focus when first taking stimulants, ADHD or not. Many ADHD patients will experience euphoria with their first doses. The idea that ADHD people have polar opposite responses to medication is largely a myth.<p>Most long-term patients don’t identify with the euphoric or energizing comments because they’ve built a tolerance to those effects. There’s nothing wrong with that, because the therapeutic value doesn’t derive from inducing euphoria.<p>However, a drug-naive college student taking a double dose of Adderall will certainly be buzzing. For a short while. They will then suffer a rebound on the following day or days. There isn’t really a free lunch here.<p>The challenge is that non-ADHD people often try Adderall once, like the effects, and assume a positive response means they have ADHD. That’s blatantly wrong, but it has lead to many people pursuing unnecessary stimulant prescriptions in hopes of feeling that way every day. They are always disappointed when they discover that the long-term effects are very different than those first experience effects.')
