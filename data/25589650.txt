The Defold license allows much more than just seeing the source.<p>And I do think the way I&#x27;ve seen people almost &quot;warning&quot; others that Defold isn&#x27;t &quot;open source&quot; is misleading to most game developer. Unless you plan to sell a commercial game engine and editor and want it to be based of the Defold source code, then you&#x27;ve got access to all the same pros&#x2F;cons of any other true (based on OSi) open source game engine and editor.<p>At the end of the day that&#x27;s what I care about if I&#x27;m picking a game engine for my game.')
