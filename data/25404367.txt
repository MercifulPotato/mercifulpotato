It&#x27;s quite disheartening to see the lack of skill with a shell. I&#x27;m being blocked from pushing and promoting the use of something else than Visual Studio&#x27;s git pluggin because &quot;other developers are not used to the command line&quot;. I proposed Git Extensions and it was more or less the same feedback, too different. It feels like an electrician being told not to use oscilloscopes because it&#x27;s too hard for others in his team. At least they&#x27;re in the process of migrating and eventually people will see the light, CLIs are powerful because of their versatility and therefore will server you for most of your career, while &quot;learning&quot; and IDE will server you 10 years at most.')
