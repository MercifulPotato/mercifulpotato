Item(by='coldpie', descendants=None, kids=[25947881], score=None, time=1611851751, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944048, text='&gt; The hard thing here is truly free &#x2F; open source software relies on generosity.<p>(I make a living working on an open source project.) I don&#x27;t agree. The view of the value of software is just different. The software itself is valueless. This is true of all software: bits are free to copy. What is valuable is the work put into making it. In other words, you get paid for making something, not for having made something. If a company wants some feature implemented in some piece of OSS, they can go find a dev to pay to do it, and contribute it back to the world. There&#x27;s no generosity there, it&#x27;s just an accurate reflection of where value is actually generated in the software world, instead of the broken view that proprietary software tries to force.<p>Where it starts to get tricky is kind of a tragedy of the commons situation: if you wait long enough, then maybe someone else will pay to implement the feature, but if everyone does this, then the feature will never exist.')
