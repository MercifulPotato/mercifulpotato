Pop science videos don&#x27;t count. (Tyson is by no means the only one; Brian Greene is notorious for the same thing.)<p>You won&#x27;t be able to because there aren&#x27;t any. No scientist who talks about a photon &quot;experiencing zero time&quot; in informal contexts will try it in a textbook or paper. That&#x27;s because they know that if they did, other scientists would call them out on it, so they confine such claims to contexts where there are no other experts so there&#x27;s nobody to call bullshit.<p>Another point is that if this concept were actually scientifically useful, somebody <i>would</i> be using it in a textbook or peer-reviewed paper. The fact that nobody is is a huge clue that the concept is <i>not</i> scientifically useful. It&#x27;s only useful for selling pop science books or getting views of pop science videos, where, again, there are no other experts around.')
