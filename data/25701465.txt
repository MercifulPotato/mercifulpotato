There are a few factors I think you’re missing:<p>1. The virus is seasonal. Substantially less restrictions are needed over the summer. Outdoor socialization really isn’t high risk<p>2. School is out. This naturally lowers spread<p>3. A bunch of people will be vaccinated. This will surely make it easier<p>4. We’ll probably have new rapid tests by the summer. They go a long way to reducing spread without much inconvenience. Michael Mina has been banging his head against the wall for months to get people to listen: these can be as effective as lockdowns and much less burdensome.<p>5. At least some countries will figure this out, go for elimination, and require a vaccine&#x2F;negative test for entry and make travel arrangements with other covid zero areas<p>Now it might be the vaccines work perfectly, no mutant strains escape them, and we won’t have a repeat of this in fall&#x2F;winter 2021&#x2F;22.<p>But if that scenario does seem likely them elimination is overwhelmingly the best option. And society that can’t pull itself together to do that will live in a purgatory.')
