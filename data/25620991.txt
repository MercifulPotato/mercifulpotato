In Common Lisp, the difference between defvar and defparameter is a simple example. Traditional Smalltalk systems only supported image-based development. But I always preferred the moderate approach exemplified by most Lisp systems where the source code isn&#x27;t overly entangled with the image state.<p>As a long-time but now lapsed Lisper, I never understood some people&#x27;s elevation of the REPL. A command-line REPL is a poor man&#x27;s development environment. If you&#x27;re doing interactive development in Lisp, you&#x27;ll be far more productive if you use a normal buffer with eval-defun, eval-buffer and friends. When debugging, you&#x27;ll primarily want auto-updating watch expressions and object inspectors. And when you do have good use for a REPL, you&#x27;ll still want it to exist within a proper buffer with persistent history, inline object inspection, etc, instead of the low-effort rlwrap terminal experience which usually passes for a REPL.<p>All of this holds doubly true for Smalltalk environments.')
