An increase by that much might possibly wipe out the species. If it fall short of that forecast the damage will be far greater.<p>Not to mention that <i>pandemic shares the same root cause as climate change</i>. Destroying our ecosystem has increased the incident of zoonotic spillover. We&#x27;ll see more pandemics as we continue on this path. And the costs of these are not separate from the costs of climate change.')
