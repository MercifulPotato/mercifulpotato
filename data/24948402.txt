But the trick is, instead of integrating all the four-dimensional spacetimes that match on to this condition you’re looking at, you can just say, well, I’m going to integrate over all four dimensional spaces, so I’m going to forget about spacetime. I’m just going to do what we call the Euclidean path integral because Euclid just talked about space, not time. And…<p>1:19:13 NE: Oh, you went there. [laughter]<p>1:19:15 SC: I did, I did. This is where I’m going. And so it was sort of like you could justify… It’s a trick. It’s a mathematical trick. And it’s very rigorously justifiable in certain simple cases in quantum mechanics, and it certainly has the smell of being correct in certain more subtle cases in quantum field theory. In quantum gravity, what they were doing with it, it just seemed to be a trick so they could get a finite answer at the end of the day, and it was very unclear why it had anything to do with the real world, but they suggested it did. Maybe they were right. And since then, I think we’ve become a little more comfortable with the idea that we can use this trick of calculating quantum gravity wave functions by integrating over the Euclidean path integral, the set of all the spaces that end up looking like what we want, instead of all the spacetimes that look like what we want.<p>1:20:05 NE: Yes.<p>1:20:05 SC: And that’s what you’re doing, isn’t it? That’s the kind of wormholes that you’re invoking.<p>1:20:09 NE: Yes, right. That’s what I was trying to sweep under the rug.<p>1:20:11 SC: I know. [laughter] And you were right to do so, but I just like to live dangerously here.<p>[chuckle]<p>1:20:18 SC: So Lenny and Juan have wormholes that are literally good old in spacetime wormholes, and you have wormholes that are in these fake Euclidean spaces that you used to calculate the entropy.<p>1:20:29 NE: That’s exactly right. Yeah, that’s exactly right. And these fake Euclidean spacetimes have more boundaries. There are more edges than our original spacetime, which means that these wormholes are connecting these… More edges than we have in our original spacetime, and therefore, it’s difficult to make sense of them in terms of the original spacetime that we’ve started with.&quot;<p>* * <i>')
