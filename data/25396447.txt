This will cause all consumers to rerender and react will update the dom only if there is a change. But with Mobx its more granular and the updates are atomic. This isn&#x27;t a problem in apps where there is a single team working on it. But when you work in enterprise apps where different parts are worked on by different teams state updates to redux can be costly. This is not a limitation of Redux but a human problem that occurs inevitably. I&#x27;ve seen this in 3 different large scale projects. It starts well but after a year or so when people move out&#x2F;in this bites us.<p>This can be enforced with strict rules, eslint plugins and infra but they are expensive as hell.<p>EDIT: &#x27;This will cause all consumers <i>(with incorrect mapStateToProps configuration)</i> to rerender&#x27;')
