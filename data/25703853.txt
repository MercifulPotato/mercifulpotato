When this happens, my right neck flexion is fine but my left neck flexion feels like something is misaligned and stops far sooner than flexing right. I also feel pain at the base of my neck near my SC joint, but a little towards the middle of my clavicle.<p>The weirdest part is that when this happens, i spend all day stretching trying to undo the kink, and what fixes it is something that happens in my elbow - there&#x27;s a loud clunk and a snap and then my neck feels better, my range of motion returns, and I feel like I have better feeling in my left hand.<p>What gives? It literally feels like a structure(nerve or something) gets misaligned and is getting pulled in weird ways until at one point it snaps back into place.')
