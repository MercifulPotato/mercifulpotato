TikTok is a prime example, if nothing changes the USA will have to use muscles(like Trump is trying to do) to keep their internet companies relevant or have its citizens use Chinese networks. Both options are bad for the consumer in the long run.<p>TikTok is only one example but soon others will come. The quality of Gmail and Google Search is not what it used to be, Huawei are aiming for Apple-like integration on their platforms(and on Android, there&#x27;s no one else doing it) and so on. Google And Facebook are simply printing ad money, I don&#x27;t even remember what was the last &quot;Wow moment&quot; with them.')
