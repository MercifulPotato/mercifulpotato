Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=[25455270, 25452957, 25452089], score=None, time=1608175410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451394, text='Aside, Audible is pretty scummy. Consider a less scummy alternative like Libro.fm.<p>- Audible&#x27;s &quot;Cancel membership&quot; flow is multiple pages long and makes you think you&#x27;ve canceled it when you actually have to keep progressing through additional &quot;I want to cancel&quot; clicks. I thought I canceled the free trial when I hadn&#x27;t. When complaining to some friends of mine, they also made the same mistake.<p>- When you finally cancel your membership, you&#x27;ve only put in a request to cancel it. The actual cancellation will happen in 30 days. This means you&#x27;re always billed one more time after cancellation (I couldn&#x27;t believe this when I saw it).<p>- When your membership is finally canceled, you lose all of your tokens (you get one per month). So if you have 5 tokens saved up and you want to pause your membership for a couple months because your bank balance is low, too bad. (Note: I&#x27;ve since realized that Audible lets you pause your membership once per year for 1-3 months, but this is an unsatisfying solution and I only discovered it in their support forum. I didn&#x27;t even see the option while canceling twice.)<p>- Because canceling your membership has a 30-day delay that charges you once more, you&#x27;re basically buying one last token that&#x27;s going to get immediately deleted. This means that if you&#x27;re billed on the 1st of the month but you cancel (ahem, submit a cancel request) on the 2nd of the month, 29 days later you&#x27;re going to be charged one last time and receive a token that is deleted within 24 hours.<p>I haven&#x27;t used Libro.fm yet (have a sour taste in my mouth from Audible), but their tokens never expire and canceling (&quot;pausing&quot;, in their language) membership doesn&#x27;t delete tokens.<p>I want to write a blog post that makes these points more eloquently, with evidence, but I haven&#x27;t had the energy.<p>&quot;Wait, what if we charge people once more when they try to cancel our service?&quot; is one of the most ridiculous experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. Even worse than that one time I had to cancel a cam-site subscription by uncommenting-out the &lt;button&gt;Cancel&lt;&#x2F;button&gt; in the html.<p>The world is only as good as the things we choose to tolerate.')
