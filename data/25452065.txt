Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608175410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25451394, text='Aside, Audible is pretty scummy. Consider a less scummy alternative like Libro.fm.<p>- Audible&#x27;s &quot;Cancel membership&quot; flow is multiple pages long and makes you think you&#x27;ve canceled it when you actually have to keep progressing through additional &quot;I want to cancel&quot; clicks. I thought I canceled the free trial when I hadn&#x27;t. When complaining to some friends of mine, they also made the same mistake.<p>- When you finally cancel your membership, you&#x27;ve only put in a request to cancel it. The actual cancellation will happen in 30 days. This means you&#x27;re always billed one more time after cancellation (I couldn&#x27;t believe this when I saw it). The email they send you even says &quot;Your request to cancel has been received&quot; iirc.<p>- When your membership is finally canceled, you lose all of your tokens (you get one per month). So if you have 5 tokens saved up and you want to pause your membership for a couple months because your bank balance is low, too bad.<p>- Because canceling your membership has a 30-day delay that charges you once more, you&#x27;re basically buying one last token that&#x27;s going to get immediately deleted. This means that if you&#x27;re billed on the 1st of the month but you cancel (ahem, submit a cancel request) on the 2nd of the month, 29 days later you&#x27;re going to be charged one last time and receive a token that is deleted within 24 hours.<p>I haven&#x27;t used Libro.fm yet (have a sour taste in my mouth from Audible), but their tokens never expire and canceling (&quot;pausing&quot; in their language) membership doesn&#x27;t delete tokens.<p>I want to write a blog post that damns Audible, but I haven&#x27;t had the energy.')
