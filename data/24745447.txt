But in the end misinformation and outright lies will still spread, be it deepfakes or be it just the written word. QAnon is relatively successful without the need to deepfake (they will just do a few meme pictures), so is the Flat Earth movement, and Alex Jones (US not UK) has still a following too, for example.')
