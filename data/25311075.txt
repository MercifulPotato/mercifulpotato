It doesn&#x27;t work well in large, open internet forums like this one, where it basically just triggers an avalanche of tedious and ever-worse behavior. I&#x27;m not making a moral pointâ€”rather an empirical one about this particular type of internet environment. Here&#x27;s a related explanation from a few weeks ago if anyone cares: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25130956" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25130956</a><p>In a context like this, snark doesn&#x27;t encourage people to &quot;go do their own research&quot; or save &quot;impressionable &#x2F; gullibile minds&quot;, nor is that really what people care about. (If it were, they&#x27;d expend energy doing those things in a way that might actually work.) Rather, its function is to vent one&#x27;s own frustrations by translating them into concentrated language. The effect this has on community is to pollute it with fumes.<p>This is destructive of the ecosystem, unless one is happy with a single species, the snark, consuming all the others. Therefore we all need to find better ways of self-regulating and containing our frustrations. Then we can address other people in a way that has a chance of connecting with them.')
