My first project was over 10 years from start to initial release.<p>I don&#x27;t think switching jobs is that necessary if you can be challenged in your current job. Ever changing problems are exactly why I&#x27;m staying. I tried switching to do some web work in a couple of places, but found that I really hated it and that most things in the &quot;web stack&quot; are just  crud and it&#x27;s really hard to find really hard or complex problems in the space (Where the complexity isn&#x27;t in something tangential like ops&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;scaling...). I&#x27;m an engineering&#x2F;math type person so it&#x27;s a bit scarce.<p>I keep a constant lookout for new jobs, but I filter out 99% of positions simply because it looks like generic web tech jobs.')
