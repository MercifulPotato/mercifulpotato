It did not have viruses because nobody cared to seriously write them. Apple were catering for some specific professional circles, power users who were ready to pay quite a premium for the machine.<p>Since the iPhone revolution, Apple is about the mass consumer, with much more non-geek mindset, buying at much more affordable prices. They lock down their ecosystem both for users&#x27; security (because non-IT people have hard time understanding computer security), and to extract more money via App Store-only software installation in the future.<p>Againx the problem with freedom is its cost, and you have fewer chances finding pockets of it where the majority is. Fringe groups have more chances to value and protect it, like OSS movement, or early Apple &#x2F; Amiga &#x2F; all the way to Altair customer base.')
