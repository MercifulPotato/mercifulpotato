This shows that the default user interface is perhaps better suited to the novice, not to an experienced user.<p>Shameless plug: I recently wrote a ~&#x2F;.emacs guide to help beginners to Common Lisp set up Emacs in a DIY fashion rather than just installing the often recommended Portacle: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;susam&#x2F;emacs4cl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;susam&#x2F;emacs4cl</a> . Indeed the first few things this guide indulges in is to set up the user interface as follows before getting into setting up the environment for Common Lisp:<p><pre><code>  ;; Customize user interface.\n  (menu-bar-mode -1)\n  (tool-bar-mode -1)\n  (scroll-bar-mode -1)\n  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)\n  (load-theme &#x27;wombat)</code></pre>')
