Item(by='pkkm', descendants=1, kids=[24753680], score=2, time=1602503576, title='Ask HN: Is an unusual keyboard layout a problem when interviewing?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='A couple years ago I&#x27;ve switched to the Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout with an additional remapping of Caps Lock to Ctrl. This has reduced the number of awkward hand positions when programming, especially in modifier-heavy software like bash and Emacs, but now that I&#x27;m starting my job search I&#x27;m having second thoughts. On Linux (X11) the layout can be enabled easily enough with one unprivileged command, but on Windows I&#x27;d need to install it or use a program called Portable Keyboard Layout which intercepts and translates keystrokes in real time; either way involves running an .exe on someone&#x27;s computer. Should I use the time I have before on-site interviews to regain some typing speed in QWERTY, or just bring my own laptop and not worry about it?')
