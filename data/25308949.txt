If Dean&#x27;s issue was it didn&#x27;t cite papers X,Y and Z, rather than demand a withdrawal, why didn&#x27;t he just demand &quot;I want you to amend the paper to add cites to X,Y,Z&quot;. And then, if Gebru and her coauthors were willing to add those cites, that would resolve it.<p>Unless corporate tells you to kill the paper and you need something that resembles legal cover.')
