They get to deduct those as business costs exactly like R&amp;D expenditures.  The argument from the *those are subsidies&quot; camp is that they should have to capitalize them as a purchased asset (and depreciate them on the usual schedule) and not be able to deduct them in the year of expenditure, which would be like treating R&amp;D the same as purchasing a building.  As the article says, that doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all.  And allowing a deduction of intangible drilling costs much like all other business deductions is in no way a &quot;subsidy.&quot;')
