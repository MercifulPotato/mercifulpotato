Here&#x27;s just one example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;uncivengin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337536854753595399&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;uncivengin&#x2F;status&#x2F;1337536854753595399&#x2F;ph...</a><p>If mask mandates worked, they&#x27;d have a clear impact on incidence graphs. Many such graphs exist, none show any impact whatsoever - not even a small one.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalground.com&#x2F;mask-charts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rationalground.com&#x2F;mask-charts&#x2F;</a><p>Nobody wants to throw up their hands and admit defeat. But the people who don&#x27;t wear masks aren&#x27;t &quot;insane&quot; as you put it. Rather ironically, the clich√© definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over whilst expecting different results, isn&#x27;t it? Mask mandates have been implemented everywhere and there are no results to show for it, which makes continuing them the insane act. It&#x27;s certainly not immoral or unethical for people to not wear a mask, any more than it is for someone not to wear a cross around their neck.')
