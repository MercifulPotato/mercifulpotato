You&#x27;ll need another GPU to render your Linux environment if you pass through your main GPU, and most gamers are likely using NVIDIA consumer GPUs. If you have a F series Intel CPU or AMD cpu with no onboard graphics then,that means you&#x27;ll need a free PCIe slot and another gpu (but even something like a GeForce 1030&#x2F;radeon 570 will do for non-gaming Linux use)')
