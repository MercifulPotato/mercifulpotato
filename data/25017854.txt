If all you see are facts X, Y, and Z, then those facts are as real and true as someone else&#x27;s facts A, B, and C. I have family members and friends who live in seemingly totally alternate universes, dominated by <i>what I see as</i> conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, and a cultural persecution complex. But as <i>they</i> describe it: it&#x27;s I who live in a media-manufactured alternate reality characterized by trust in institutions, corruption, and a false belief in science and data.<p>What everyone is missing is: both universes might as well be correct, to the observer. It&#x27;s like measuring what speed someone is going in two different relativistic frames of reference. You can both be right and come up with different numbers. It&#x27;s a tough problem to solve. We can&#x27;t solve it by just pointing at the out-groups and saying &quot;ha-ha how stupid are they for believing in rubbish!&quot; They are just not going to be convinced by someone who believe a totally different set of facts.')
