(seriously).  Their stuff is probably better than the one here, as the EU does have tighter controls in substances and what is allowed during manufactoring of medicine, food processing, and beauty products.<p>They effectvely operate in a &#x27;white list&#x27; basis, where a product has to be shown to be safe to be allowed, while the US operates in a &#x27;black list&#x27; basis, where anything can be used until it is shown unsafe, and banned, which usually gets banned too late.<p>That&#x27;s why you have so many cancerogenic products that are banned in the EU, while they are still used here in the states.')
