That type of bug is almost never exploitable since it almost always just leads to the program immediately terminating. An exploitable bug is one that has some way for the attacker to pivot and use it to do something else. For instance, a buffer overflow might allow an attacker to write some data in memory that could change the execution flow of a program.')
