It&#x27;s the city&#x27;s responsibility to manage itself in a way that keeps residents satisfied. If the residents feel like they are getting the short end of the stick, they are right to leave and many will do so. Then you are left with those who had no choice and good luck getting them to fund your bloated, inefficient and needless projects.<p>The policy makers are in charge of just that, making policy. The residents have little control over that, but they do control where they live.')
