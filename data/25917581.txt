Every year there are movies there that receive lots of attention and praise only to completely disappear from public consciousness.  Being well liked at Sundance is not necessarily a recipe for either financial or broad critical success.<p>Here is a list from Variety of the the favorites for this year&#x27;s best documentary feature Oscar[1].  The Dissident comes in at number 22.  I can almost guarantee there are documentaries above it you haven&#x27;t heard of.  This documentary wasn&#x27;t going to be a mainstream hit and it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a serious contender for awards.  There is little incentive for a streaming company to purchase it.<p>It is also worth noting that the issue with Hasan Minhaj&#x27;s show was specifically it being viewable in Saudi Arabia.  That is a very different issue than purchasing rights to a movie in the US or other global markets.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;2021-oscars-best-documentary-feature-predictions-1234784896&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;2021-oscars-best-documentary-fea...</a>')
