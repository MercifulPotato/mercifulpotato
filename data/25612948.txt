Item(by='cipherboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609596883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612752, text='&gt; I have a feeling CNAs are bringing this kind of low effort zero regard for false positive fatigue bullshit to CVEs. Might as well just rip that bandaid off now and stop trusting anything besides the debian security mailing list.<p>Red Hat (my employer), Canonical, and SUSE are also CNAs. I can only speak to ours, but I think our prodsec team does a great job with the resources they&#x27;ve been given. Nobody is perfect, but if you take the time to explain the problem (invalid CVE, wrong severity, bad product assignment, ...) they consistently take the time to understand the issue and will work with whatever other CNA or reporter to fix it. Generally we have a public tracker for unembargoed CVEs, so if it affects us and isn&#x27;t legitimate or scoped correctly, you might get somewhere by posting there (or the equivalent on Ubuntu&#x2F;SUSE&#x27;s tracker).<p>Perhaps it is just the nature of the open source community Linux distros are a part of, though, that lets them apply it to CVEs as well.<p>Doesn&#x27;t help with personal reports though. :-)<p>Curious, did you get CVE assignments against your personal site? 0.o')
