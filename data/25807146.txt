A lot of the harmonics and stresses on rocket engines are at some of their most extremes just after ignition (within tens or hundreds of milliseconds).  That they got these stabilized enough to last even a minute is somewhat reassuring.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s a tragic waste of taxpayer money to keep throwing money at this program.  I doubt most objective observers of this effort would have expected this to go perfectly well on the first try, but the testing corners being cut due to the mismanagement incompetence&#x2F;corruption are just unjustifiable.  You can&#x27;t just keep saying &quot;sure it&#x27;ll work on the first try in the shortest time period&quot; and keep assuming optimistic timeframes from a program that has repeatedly demonstrated exactly the opposite.')
