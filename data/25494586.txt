I mean, if you&#x27;re targeting multiple Unixes, sure, but a lot of my scripts are company&#x2F;infrastructure specific and won&#x27;t really target anything but Linux and bash is always available. Even if we used a BSD for something tomorrow, it&#x27;d be trivial to add bash to those. I may be missing something, however.<p>I guess the one place I can think of is some small-container scenarios, e.g. a bash-less Alpine, where you want the smallest possible image.')
