For example, I think there&#x27;s still no implementation of native ads for major ad networks, which can be a deal-breaker if you&#x27;re working on a large consumer-facing app.<p>Regarding native C&#x2F;C++ interop (thank God I no longer have to deal with this!), Flutter has dart:ffi. I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to JNI, but it can&#x27;t be worse. In practice, you&#x27;d still end up dealing with the horrible NDK toolchain on Android, though.')
