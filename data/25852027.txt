Hell, they couldn&#x27;t even agree on a single baseline video standard. The only part of web standards that even covers DRM is EME, which just specifies a way for JavaScript to negotiate content decryption with a DRM plugin. It specifies no standard DRM, and it can&#x27;t do that, because DRM by it&#x27;s very nature is not standardizable - or, more specifically, standardized DRM is ineffective. You can totally write video DRM in JavaScript using Media Source Extensions. You&#x27;ll just have no actual technical control over where the video goes after it&#x27;s been decrypted; that&#x27;s why they want compiled binaries that have to be distributed as browser plugins.')
