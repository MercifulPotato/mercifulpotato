I hesitate to add books to a &quot;favorites of all time&quot; list until at least several months after reading, but it&#x27;s a definite contender.<p>As for the different experiences between GoW and EoE, I have to assume that the inconsistency of the reader has a lot to do with it.<p>So, +1 on the Steinbeck recommendation. And gratitude to the lost-attribution commenter who quoted him!<p>Hemingway waits patiently on my TODO list.')
