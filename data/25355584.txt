I was deploying something to ECS and while 90% of the config could be accomplished with environment variables, there are still a few cases where it was expected that I would provide files. On a local machine with Docker and some config mgmt like Chef or Ansible, no problem - template out those files and volume mount them in. In ECS? No easy to way to do it without baking your own container or using EFS, which for one config option seemed like major fuckin&#x27; overkill. Ended up bastardizing the entrypoint with some judicious base64&#x27;d bullshit and got it going without either, but christ, how fucking hard would it be to just provide a native mechanism for templating config files out?')
