As this (and other recent reporting) has shown, he was using his father&#x27;s name and <i>implied</i> access thereto for personal profit.<p><i></i> Note that there is no evidence Hunter ever actually got Joe to do anything for him. What is a matter of record is that Hunter was IMPLYING he could do so, which is scummy but probably not illegal. Johnson-Grassley investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe and I want to stress I&#x27;m not alleging otherwise.')
