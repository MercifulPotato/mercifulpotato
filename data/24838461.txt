Ie, a Wiki article will cite an expert who cites another expert who cites Wikipedia, and so ultimately the Wikipedia article is using itself as an authoritative source.<p>Or the authority is fragile. Ie, the wiki article will cite a trusted source who in turn cites some Tweets as their authoritative source.<p>Or the authority is broken. Ie, the wiki article will cite a trusted source who cites sources that are no longer present on the Internet, and so Wikipedia&#x27;s broken link discovery fails.<p>Is it possible not to rely upon Wikipedia as a primary source for your articles?')
