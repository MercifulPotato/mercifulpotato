Sure we have sleek shiny laptops and devices that are amazingly powerful but at what cost? I still haven&#x27;t found a trackpad as good as MagicTrackpad sadly otherwise I&#x27;d ditch the MacBook Pro.<p>To be fair to Apple though, it&#x27;s their OS, they can do what they want and we agree every time we update MacOS or iOS. It&#x27;s crazy to me that we basically only have 3 phone device choices, 2.15 environment choices (OS wise... Linux Desktop is crap, but getting better), and only 2 choices in GPU&#x27;s, CPU&#x27;s, etc...<p>What can we do about this?')
