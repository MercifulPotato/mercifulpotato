Item(by='darawk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611819506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938447, text='&gt; The original claim was that squeezing an ill-advised short wasn&#x27;t less moral than deliberately collapsing a currency and taking $1bn of funds from a government, or engaging in sketchy HFT practices. You said &quot;then you don&#x27;t understand this, or any of the things listed&quot;, implying that you believe that squeezing the short WAS less moral.<p>Sure. But you don&#x27;t need morality to make the point. I will make that point though: things trading at their intrinsic value is more moral than not doing so, because it means nobody loses.<p>&gt; &quot;Storage costs&quot; is a convenient and inoffensive way to say &quot;the few remaining buyers with enough spare capacity smelled blood in the water and were able to price gouge&quot;.<p>Err. No. It means the storage capacity was completely gone, and people were scrambling to find new storage capacity. It doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;re very familiar with how these things work.')
