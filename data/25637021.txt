High ceilings, well ventilated, padded running track suspended where the 2nd floor would be.  Running machines (elliptical etc) on balcony overlooking main floor. Glass-walled classroom on other end 2nd floor.<p>Even the main floor workout machines are spaced out and all have views out the glass side of the building at the woods etc. Weight wall on one end with benches and mats, plenty of room, several of each weight. Clean, doesn&#x27;t smell, well lit but not bright.<p>So it can be nice. But I don&#x27;t live in a large city. We have room for nice places.')
