Which just means that they were so spectacular in some other respect that they were able to get an offer &#x2F;despite&#x2F; poor interview performance. It tells you nothing actionable about your interview process.<p>Really you need to take an experimental approach where you randomly give offers to people who failed the interview, and see how they turn out.')
