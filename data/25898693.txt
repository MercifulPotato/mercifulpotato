Item(by='markc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611545196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895664, text='&gt;just as I fell asleep I started awake because I wasn&#x27;t breathing.<p>Uncanny. Me too. Also tried every airflow device I could find (breathe right, nose baffles, chin strap, and many more) to no avail.<p>CPAP was a total fail because if the pressure is turned up high enough to defeat my resistance, it just fills my stomach with air (called aerophagia, a common CPAP problem).  I&#x27;m starting to think the only solution is one of those implanted breathing pacemakers but that freaks me out.<p>Btw, I also had palpitations! I&#x27;d wake up with them really bad, probably from not breathing. Going off caffeine doesn&#x27;t help though. A beta-blocker (6 years now) works wonders. HOWEVER! I just saw a study yesterday that people can have insomnia from beta blockers, and that 2.5mg melatonin helps counteract it. Round and round!')
