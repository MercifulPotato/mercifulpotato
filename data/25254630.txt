Thick Bavarian accents are often considered intelligible in the rest of Germany. Even inside Bavaria dialects can range from &quot;easily understandable&quot; like a lot of Franconian, to something so thick that even other Bavarian&#x27;s might struggle with understanding, like some regional Upper Palatine dialects.<p>Somewhat related story about Swiss German, although it is more of a dialect than accent.<p>I self-studied German for two years - Duolingo, consuming a lot of German media, chatting via video with different speakers online. I thought I had a pretty good grasp on basic conversational skills.<p>When I finally went to Germany for the first time, I had a connecting flight in Zurich on Swiss Air. After boarding the flight I realized I could hardly understand anyone. Most of the staff and passengers were speaking Swiss German. I panicked a good part of the flight about my misplaced confidence in my fluency.<p>Luckily on the trip through Germany I had no problem with Hochdeutsch. However there definitely were very noticeable differences in accent and word usage as I moved from Schleswig-Holstein in the north to Bayern in the south via the east.')
