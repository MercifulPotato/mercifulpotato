Item(by='ls65536', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603467979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869726, text='There&#x27;s a good book, &quot;Show Stopper!: The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft&quot;, which documents the original development of Windows NT in the late 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s. A large amount of the focus in the book is on Cutler himself, including some of his history coming from DEC, and his personal style of running the project at the time. I found it quite an interesting read!')
