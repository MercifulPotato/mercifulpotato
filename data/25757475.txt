Plus they&#x27;d be making Google angry (competing with Stadia).<p>If Sega couldn&#x27;t manage, I don&#x27;t know how Samsung would - they&#x27;ve obviously got a lot more money to throw at the problem but I&#x27;m not entirely sure there&#x27;s enough market for a 4th player.  Nintendo has the &quot;cheap and fun&quot; market cornered, and Sony and Microsoft own the high end.  What development house could Samsung even acquire at this point to get exclusive titles?')
