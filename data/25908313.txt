The server-side engine would do the layout calculations and then pass raw vector coordinates to the browser.<p>Trying to be everything to everybody has made CSS an inconsistent bloated buggy mess. If we had the above, we could have <i>domain-specific</i> layout engines that trim features and behaviors not needed by the domain, and reduce the problems of client&#x2F;browser differences since the real work is done on the server. I&#x27;m not saying do away with existing browsers, just allow off-client layout engines when desired.<p>* (Yes, CSS does have a rough notion of absolute coordinates, but it&#x27;s too screwed up to be practical. If it worked right, we wouldn&#x27;t need the PDF standard.)')
