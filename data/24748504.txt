While some people are complaining about &quot;technically incompetent&quot; comments the political reality is that one of the primary motivations for the original Internet was a tool for avoiding government censorship.<p>The phrase used to be &quot;The Internet perceives censorship as damage and routes around it.&quot; Now it seems any censorship is fine as long as it&#x27;s nationalist enough. And if by a quirk of history the US happens to control the domains with the widest reach - well, so it goes, never mind, and let&#x27;s wave a flag.<p>The inevitable outcome will be a Balkanised Internet, with each sphere of influence monitoring and controlling its local content.<p>This has happened formally in China and Russia (and elsewhere) and has been happening informally in the US and EU.<p>Perhaps the requirements of realpolitik justify this - and perhaps they don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a simple question with a simple answer.<p>So it&#x27;s a debate worth having - not on the basis of TLD ownership, but on the basis of international civics and the ever-decreasing free movement of information which is not corporate or government-controlled, online and elsewhere, in all spheres of interest.')
