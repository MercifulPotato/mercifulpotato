Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25191746], score=None, time=1606164405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191489, text='&gt; But it&#x27;s a contract violation, not violence, so a monetary comparison is completely sociopathic.<p>Theft in general doesn&#x27;t involve violence or the threat of violence. You&#x27;re thinking of robbery.<p>One merely has to illegally deprive someone of something they legally own in order to commit theft.  A pickpocketing is a theft. A mugging is a robbery. Wage theft is an entirely appropriate name. You could also call it &quot;wage misappropriation&quot; or &quot;wage embezzlement&quot; (though &quot;embezzlement&quot; generally applies to company property) if you want to make it sound classier :-P')
