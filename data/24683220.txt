This sort of thing doesn&#x27;t exist in the UK, for example.<p>As for firing people, perhaps France, but not UK. Most jobs have a 3-6 month probation period, with a week&#x27;s notice either way, and in the first 2 years you can fire anyone for no reason (apart from reasons of race, gender, pregnancy, etc.).<p>After that, by which point it&#x27;s obvious they can do the job, generally you have to give a progression of verbal, written, last chance warnings to an employee to change their behaviour before you can fire them.')
