I&#x27;ve been working as a systems administrator &#x2F; entrepreneur &#x2F; devops engineer for about 25 years now. I&#x27;m a US citizen living in Istanbul and working remotely for star-tups and mid-sized companies in the USA.  As long as you do not have an office in Türkiye then there are no tax or immigration concerns. I&#x27;m a US resident and taxed as such.<p>Over the past 25 years my career has run the gamut from tech support at EDS to co-founding a successful managed operations &#x2F; devops company called BitPusher, and everything in-between.  I&#x27;ve worked with several YC start-ups, started two other companies (A failed music start-up in &#x27;98 and a small exit from a api-driven anycasted authoritative dns service called DNSWorks).<p>I&#x27;m seeking DevOps work focusing as much as possible on Infrastructure As Code with Terraform, CI&#x2F;CD and configuration management in the cloud (AWS primarily).   I also really enjoy building and managed internationally distributed &#x2F; offshored teams.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat of a digital nomad, and am only seeking remote work, primarily from Istanbul. I&#x27;m willing to travel up to 10-15%, but preferably in Europe &#x2F; Near-East &#x2F; Asia. I could be convinced to relocate to Barcelona or Copenhagen and possibly Amsterdam.<p>My dream position would be working for a consumer-product, gaming or music company focusing on large-scale cloud management with Terraform and AWS.')
