I&#x27;m probably more of an adherent of the worst than then best. The ideal is probably somewhere in the middle as it usually is. I bought my kid a cheap bike and it fell apart while he was riding it. So then I bought him a more expensive bike.<p>I&#x27;ve bought a lot of junk and I&#x27;ve spent more time trying to fix the junk or replace it than I&#x27;d like to admit and I&#x27;d rather spend the upfront time finding the stuff that&#x27;s not junk in the future so I can spend more time with my family and less time running to the store for a new toaster after mine blows up. just my 2 cents.')
