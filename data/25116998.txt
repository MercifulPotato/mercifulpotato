I think one of the biggest lessons that I got out of starting to get more into the competitive scene is that there&#x27;s more to games than trying to be the absolute best and that I need to set my limits and figure out where I can have fun without letting something take over my life.<p>I&#x27;ve since cut back significantly on my Hearthstone playing and been able to apply similar thinking to other games I&#x27;ve picked up (for example Magic The Gathering: Arena). Games are for having fun not for endlessly trying to get better. That was probably a mentality that I picked up from years of MMORPG (Runescape) addiction.')
