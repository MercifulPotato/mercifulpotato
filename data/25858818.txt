Developer of Twemex here.<p>Twitter is one of my favorite places for developing ideas. Writing tweet threads [1] and having conversations with people on Twitter has helped me develop many of my opinions about computing.<p>The problem is that Twitter was designed for quick status updates, not developing ideas, so the product has some gaps. I started out building this browser extension to fix my own frustrations, and eventually enough people asked me about it that I decided to share it as a product.<p>One tip&#x2F;reflection on launch strategy: I initially shared this on Twitter and had people DM me to get access. This was phenomenally successful for getting lots of early feedbackâ€”once there&#x27;s a casual private messaging channel established, a user is way more likely to send feedback. I got meaningful feedback from the majority of people who tried the app. I finally made a website this week because the DM distribution strategy couldn&#x27;t scale anymore.<p>Happy to answer questions here about the product, development, or distribution.<p>[1] more about threads: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geoffreylitt.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;twitter-and-media-for-sketching.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geoffreylitt.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;twitter-and-media-fo...</a>')
