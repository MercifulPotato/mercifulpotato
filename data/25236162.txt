But even in these cases it is possible to do a lot:<p>- write garbage-free code (reuse objects and byte buffers, allocate memory off the Java heap and store the pointers in `long`s)<p>- use a GC that doesn&#x27;t pause and carefully profile the app to ensure the GC can keep up with the rate of memory allocation<p>- turn off the GC and cross fringers if the app crashing is considered better than not responding<p>It&#x27;s just difficult because most software is written using software patterns that require a GC, which is perfectly fine for many domains.')
