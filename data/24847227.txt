A lot of real-world data just can&#x27;t be described as &quot;purely graph-like&quot; (no complex semantics or constraints) or &quot;purely relational&quot; (no recursive queries, etc.); often it&#x27;s convenient to merge both feature sets. This is exactly what modern SQL with CTE&#x27;s allows.')
