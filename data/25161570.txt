Basically a 1% failure rate each year (worse for a few bad batches of disks), so yes I think you have gotten lucky so far.  (1 - .99^(25*3)) = 52% chance of at least one failure for three drives over 25 years.<p>Out of ~30 disks over my ~30 years of hard disks I can count at least 3 5.5&quot; HDD failures and 5 or 6  2.5&quot; HDD failures.  Laptop drives seem to fail at a much higher rate especially for kids.')
