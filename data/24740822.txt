But I think &quot;understanding natural language&quot; is one of the easier ones, at least inasmuch as we can resort to referring to the intentions of the speaker, and understanding being the congruence between that and the hearer&#x27;s impression of it. And it just seems like a category error to say that any natural language processing system has anything like that, since the thing doing the understanding is so radically different to the one doing the speaking.')
