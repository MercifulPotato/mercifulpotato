Lost my debit card and needed to withdraw some cash. I looked up a Bitcoin ATM around me, used my phone to transfer some BTC and withdrew local currency (the fee was probably a bit high).<p>I did not plan on doing this, I didn&#x27;t even know how to use these BTC ATMs before this. But the ability to have access to cash in any country you are without international transfer hassle is one huge benefit.')
