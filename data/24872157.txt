People write stupid amounts of log statements in their code, so much that it’s hard to even read the code to understand what it does, in the hopes that it’ll make debugging easier. Use a damned debugger! Take a traffic dump! Use strace!<p>What’s more, it’s extremely rare that libraries provide logs themselves. So the actual complex parts of your application, like say the HTTP library or (God forbid) the TCP stack, can’t be debugged this way.<p>If you find yourself writing a bunch of statements like “DEBUG: updating balance from 1 to 2”, stop and write some tests instead.')
