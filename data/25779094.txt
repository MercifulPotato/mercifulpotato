If you are talking about BLM, free speech or bitcoin and you think that will solve the Real Problem, you are ignoring a clear and present danger.<p>Last week, the president of the United States participated in an invasion of the US Capitol in order to disrupt the orderly transfer of power. It was not a spontaneous riot and it was not mere incitement of a mob. It was sedition and violence. The people who invaded the Capitol carried weapons and wore merchandise that announced their plans; e.g. sweatshirts emblazoned with the words &quot;Civil War.&quot; They discussed those plans openly and stupidly on Parler. Some of them appear to have coordinate with Republican members of Congress, such as Gosar and Brooks, who were giving &quot;reconnaissance tours&quot; in the days immediately before the invasion.<p>Dem lawmaker says panic buttons were removed from office\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bostonglobe.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;nation&#x2F;it-was-like-looking-evil-capitol-attack-through-eyes-massachusetts-delegation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bostonglobe.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;nation&#x2F;it-was-like-lo...</a><p>Mikie Sherrill says unidentified lawmakers led ‘reconnaissance’ tours ahead of Capitol attack\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;12&#x2F;mikie-sherrill-capitol-hill-attack-458655" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;12&#x2F;mikie-sherrill-capi...</a><p>Kapernik is not the issue. China is not the issue.<p>The issue is whether we want a democratically elected president to take office in the US, or whether we should tolerate speech that incites people to violently oppose that transition.<p>Free speech has never been absolute. It is one right among others. We have always drawn lines around it, including on the platforms that are banning Q and Trump now. What are some other forms of speech we banned? Various kinds of gun and drug sales, as well as speech and images related to human trafficking and abuse. Those lines were always there. The people who wanted to discuss those things did not have a right to do so under the US system, or on social media. The social media platforms are currently drawing a line to exclude the incitement of violence, the enabling and activating lies that led to the insurrection last week. They are fully within their rights to do so. Trump does not owe it to them to change his speech and behavior, and they do not owe him a platform. That&#x27;s called freedom and it works both ways.<p>The good news is, most of the people dumb enough to believe Trump and Q are not smart enough to navigate the Dark Web, and encryption apps will weaken their performative feedback loop. ISIS was undermined in a similar way by deplatforming.')
