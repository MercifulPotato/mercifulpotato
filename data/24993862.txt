Go to polling place, scan, verify selections on voting machine, press big red button and walk out of there.<p>If each vote took 1 minute instead of 10, would there still be a line?<p>edit: Or if not shorter lines, maybe 5 voting machines instead of 20? or 4 poll workers instead of 10? Seems more efficient all around.')
