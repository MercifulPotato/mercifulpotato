You want a Linux&#x2F;BSD&#x2F;Windows on M1, and you&#x27;re not hurting any of their possible revenue streams, so why the hell not let you buy their hardware and throw whatever OS on it.<p>Somebody wants to copy the hardware over and sell it for half price? Yeah, good luck reproducing the M1.<p>Opening the boot loader to allow for Linux is quite an opposite of a middle finger, tbh. I don&#x27;t know if they will divert some guys from working on MacOS towards Linux support, but this is already looking much better than before.')
