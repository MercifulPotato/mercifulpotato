For us it seems like the biggest challenge is getting feedback from the right people. Mostly due to the sheer number of pitches (RFCs, project proposals). And we&#x27;re a small team. Also it&#x27;s a bit difficult to decide what goes first and how to make sure we don&#x27;t bite more than we can chew.<p>Overall I agree with the article that the biggest benefit is from writing things and thinking about them in a structured way. Some ideas sound great, but once you start digging, problems emerge. Being able to pull the brakes even before starting, or refining the idea to a much smaller core is perhaps the most valuable and non-intuitive  benefit.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basecamp.com&#x2F;shapeup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basecamp.com&#x2F;shapeup</a>')
