I definitely believe that for me a very regular sleep schedule helps my mood. But as you say, it&#x27;s not a straightforward relationship. Bad sleep triggers bad mood when triggers bad coping behaviors that can disrupt my sleep, making it worse. Same thing for what I&#x27;m eating, exercise levels, amount of time invested in rewarding activities, how clean the house is, and I&#x27;m sure other things. It&#x27;s a big causal snarl.<p>That said, I do think focusing on good sleep is one of the most effective things I can do to manage my mood, so if people are going to have a too-simple understanding of things, &quot;more sleep critical for preventing depression&quot; is probably a pretty good one.')
