So, it doesn’t have to work that way behind the scenes, just at the end of the block, it has to appear it worked that way. So, x86 does reordering, store combining etc a lot. IMHO, performance difference between arm vs x86 barely related with ISA, in M1 case, it’s definitely not, a lot more going on than just taking advantage of weaker memory model.')
