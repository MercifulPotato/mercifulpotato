The integration is very good, the compiler recognizes the new intrinsics and the designer has control over how the instruction is pipelined into the main processor.<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s very proprietary, and as far as I know there isn&#x27;t an at-home version you can play with on FPGAs. But this kind of thing does exist if you can afford it - you don&#x27;t have to roll your own RTL.')
