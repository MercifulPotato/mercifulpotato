I&#x27;ve no idea why that&#x27;s desirable. It&#x27;s difficult to type up. It only adds complexity. Is it to be able to use variable names like they&#x27;re used in mathematics? That&#x27;s optimized for easy handwriting, through terseness, but because of just how terse it is it&#x27;s incompatible with autocomplete, so it actually offers a much worse writability&#x2F;readability ratio in an editor. Why use a miniature vocabulary of symbols when you can use English? I&#x27;d always choose `delta` over `Î”`. Actually, why use greek at all?<p>I realise my insight is a bit condescending. My background is plain programming. I&#x27;ve had to implement some algorithms from papers. I guess I&#x27;m venting having to interpret those symbols, where terseness was favored over readability.')
