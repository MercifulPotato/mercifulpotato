They did not had twitter yet.  It is stupid term to use in relation to 1954 Russia.<p>That is not what instability of regime means. It does not refer to individual being forced to retire. The regime itself was more stable then before. Khruschev retirement did not weakened nor endangered regime.<p>Stalin did changed people on top too. Some changes and power struggles after his death are not more instability or &quot;touched&quot; communism.<p>Khruschev was the first one retired.
