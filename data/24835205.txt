My dad replaced the rubber rolls on the printer a few times, and I think he had to refill the old cartridges with 3rd party ink, but other than that it still worked perfectly.<p>No idea what happened to it though... I suspect finding replacement parts for the things that wear out has become close to impossible, but I doubt that thing was broken in any other way.')
