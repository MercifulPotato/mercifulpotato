Item(by='idolaspecus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604692386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009234, text='I in general agree with most of your points in this thread and disagree with the claim that you&#x27;ve been disrespectful (to GP and to the Aztecs :)), but I do think there&#x27;s an interesting and important space between your idea re. Aztec rituals and those who&#x27;d say your view is &quot;disrespectful&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s plausible, in my opinion, that evaluating the Aztecs&#x27; ritual sacrifice practice in terms of the modern scientific POV leads to a categorically incorrect analysis. I.e. the questions--whether the Aztec gods exist, whether unfalsifiable claims &quot;make sense&quot; or can be operative, etc--might not be relevant or interesting.<p>I.e. the function describing the relationship between how closely our actions align with true facts <i>as we understand them intellectually</i> and broad outcomes in quality of life (defined however you want) is almost certainly not monotonic.<p>I guess in short all I&#x27;m saying is that our conscious, intellectual understanding of the world is not the only useful motivator. And I don&#x27;t mean this in some sort of supernatural, metaphysical, spiritual way: I mean that <i>objectively rational behavior sometimes results from subjectively irrational behavior</i>.')
