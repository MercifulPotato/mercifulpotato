For a while, I was considering staying around and trying to lock in a lower rent on a larger space, but rents really didn&#x27;t budge.<p>Your effective rent _did_ drop, but landlords did it by offering 2-3 months of free rent on a one-year lease (with old rates applying.)  It doesn&#x27;t take Nostradamus to see what happens in 12 months: maximum allowed rent increase and no more sweetheart deals, meaning an effective increase of like 35% (or move again to try and get another deal somewhere else.)<p>It wasn&#x27;t worth it to me, so now I&#x27;m paying less than half my previous rent for around 2x as much space in SLC.')
