I challenge, you go there RIGHT NOW. COUNT the % of stories about FAANG companies.<p>As the markets go into a &quot;winner takes all&quot; mode, these publications only cover the big winners. So people only hear about them, which amplifies the whole &quot;winner takes all&quot; thing, and the vicious circle continues.<p>Some of these big publications have made &quot;attempts&quot; to be &quot;indie-friendly&quot;, but that&#x27;s one big BS. I won&#x27;t name the company I contacted (it&#x27;s a biger publication). I basically told them: Hey guys, got an interesting article that was featured on HN front page 3 days ago, can I do a deeper piece for your publication?<p>Their answer: &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s great, go to our sister website X.com, we feature non-FAANG there&quot;. X.com was a website that wasn&#x27;t even in the Alexa top 1M list.<p>I also have some doubts that the OP has removed some bigger publication names (maybe afraid of getting sued? No idea).<p>My point is: As publications get more &quot;closed&quot;, the incentive for getting there via other means is going to get bigger.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstpayingusers.com</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com</a>')
