It can open quite big files, you can WIMP around a bit, but README is just wishful thinking, it can&#x27;t even save files. Written in C with cairo and fontconfig. Currently for a few years I&#x27;m in process of rewriting text buffer, I have something nice, but did not test it enough and did not integrate it. Now I&#x27;m thinking of a rewrite in Zig to learn it and also make it easier to test. But that&#x27;s my wishful thinking again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;tomatoaster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;tomatoaster</a> a ChromeOS like Linux distribution based on Void Linux build system, AB partition scheme, building squashfs image without root privileges. Currently I did a nice and almost proper script to handle it and do not need to patch as match to build an image, that runs, but is not entirely useful. Need to clean-up the script and commit. Mostly bash, bunch of patches and config files and a bit of C.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;abracabra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;abracabra</a> a search engine, that will not index pages with ads (all results would be uBlock-Origin clean), that is not yet even a proper pipeline to check whether a page does contain ads or not, no crawler yet at all. I want to go through Common Crawl archives first. I did something in Go first (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;abracabra-legacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hadrianw&#x2F;abracabra-legacy</a>), but now I&#x27;m rewriting it in Rust, because of awesome lol_html crate, that will make filtering fast and easy. Currently writing code to filter URLs with Rabin-Karp and a bit of loops. It created an e-mail thread years ago with people wanting to help, but I&#x27;ve been too slow.<p>I don&#x27;t want much help to code things, I would appreciate however a bit of pointers on a couple of things regarding Rust and watchdogs (to recognize a partition as unbootable and reset the system to the previous partition).')
