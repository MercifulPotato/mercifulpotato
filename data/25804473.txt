Is it that folks just ignore prior art? or they just gravitate to the latest more sexy software? (honest question).<p>I&#x27;ve been using TiddlyWiki on and off for many years, but 2-3 years ago I moved heavily into it (the Drift [1] distribution), and I haven&#x27;t looked back. To me, it has become less about the tool and more about the information, and ensuring I have complete access to it, even 20 years from now. That includes data, metadata and even the software itself, regardless of the platform or OS.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akhater.github.io&#x2F;drift&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akhater.github.io&#x2F;drift&#x2F;</a>')
