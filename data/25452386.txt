Only the most trivial applications without any custom drawing&#x2F;widgets would have hidpi working without any changes. Rule of thumb, if the app&#x27;s code uses raw pixel units anywhere, that would need to be modified to account for scale. You would probably need to modify all the GTK2 theme engines too.')
