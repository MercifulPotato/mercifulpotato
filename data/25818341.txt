And even then, only insofar as the company values that help. I&#x27;ve never seen HR go to bat for an employee, against either a manager or against the company. The implication that they&#x27;re not mall cops (but there to make sure workplace law is followed, i.e., they are cops of a sort) is actually quite apropos; they are there to protect the establishment and the status quo. They are not there to help you.')
