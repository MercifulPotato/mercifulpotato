We don’t believe in collaborative UX&#x2F;UI design workflow outside the office. We use our own code based workflow for prototyping. I am in design field 18 years, there is a way to deliver quality in pure form without using trending tools, cloud based plugins and direct collaboration. Convenience is not always the king. But this is strictly my decision and I don’t imply thats is for everyone.')
