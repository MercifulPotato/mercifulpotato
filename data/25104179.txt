Even if a problematic app has been launched one or more times, it is still worth preventing subsequent launches if you can.<p>It doesn’t matter what mechanism is used to prevent the subsequent launch.  This applies to any mechanism including OCSP.  The Zoom example is a refutation of the particular point you made, a point which dismisses a real security concern.')
