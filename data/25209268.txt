Obviously the understanding that allowed us to create semiconductors and lasers has been put to good use, but, outside of biology, have there been many discoveries from science in the past 50 years, say?<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the only research worth doing is that which leads to an institution or company making a profit from the discoveries, but understanding the economic factors behind scientific research is helpful if we want to think about its future trajectory.<p>To go some way towards answering my question above, though, I will give the examples of graphene (isolated and characterized in 2004) and arguably the understanding from climate science about how the Earth&#x27;s climate can vary with specific changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration (which has important policy implications).<p>Others can probably think of a few more, although there is much scope for debate about what counts as a &quot;discovery&quot; and &quot;science&quot;.  For example, public-key cryptography was invented in 1970s, but this could be said to be &quot;merely doing engineering&quot; or &quot;merely inventing mathematical processes&quot; rather than learning about the natural world.')
