They kind of bubble up once enough preparation has been put in place I suppose. If we experience a Eureka moment, it&#x27;s because we have learned some things, perhaps separate things, and then they somehow got connected and.. epiphany!<p>Perhaps AI, GPT3 or something else, could produce these epiphanies by connecting concepts or bits of data .. but it would also have to realise that some conclusion it has reached is indeed important. How would it do that? I think this the part that currently(?) still requires humans with a history of being human. Of being interested in a subject and being frustrated by certain limitation. Or being curious of why things are a certain way. There&#x27;s a drive to explore that may lead to some new insights and answers.<p>Writing is about exploration. And then about discovering these interesting bits that come up unexpectedly, and working with them and developing them.<p>I believe this is, for now, still a task for humans. And no interesting fiction or non fiction will come from GPT-3 except by accident perhaps. If we get enough monkeys with typewriters..<p>And if the monkeys are only allowed to read good literature before they start typing...<p>who knows')
