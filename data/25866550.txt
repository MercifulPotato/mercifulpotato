Although python actually comes with a fair amount of functional data structures out of the box (str, bytes, tuple, frozenset, namedtuple, ...) none of them can be &quot;updated&quot; efficiently.<p>There are some other things (exception as opposed to sum-type based error handling), but fixing the above would be enough to write functional code pretty unhampered, I think.')
