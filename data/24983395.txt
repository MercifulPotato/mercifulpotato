Part of that lie included indoctrinating people with the belief that landfills were bad. They&#x27;re not. The US has unlimited space to create landfills and they can now be made so they don&#x27;t leach chemicals into the water table or erode into the sea. The problem with plastic is it getting into the ocean. It gets into the ocean (from the US) because of failed attempts to recycle it. So put it in landfills where it&#x27;s harmless.')
