I mean look at any economic study or forecasting from any of the major firms and the one thing that they&#x27;re consistent on is being wrong.<p>I swear Economists are just like modern day shamans&#x2F;seers, filling the role that was once held by court wizards. While modern economists may not cut the heads off chickens or consult the stars they do have bogus &quot;models&quot; and secretive proprietary forecasting tools they use to fool idiots into thinking they have special insights. And this is very dangerous too since Economists tend to be very dogmatic, stubborn and seem to double down even when their theories fail, it&#x27;s like a religion, and they refuse to ever admit their world view is wrong.')
