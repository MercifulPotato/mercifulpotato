I use i48, the HP-48 simulator for iOS. The only thing it lacks is that keyboard feel.<p>When I was in high school virtually everyone had a TI calculator but I couldn&#x27;t afford one. At college we were required to own an HP-48. I don&#x27;t recall paying $500 for it, but maybe I did and I just forgot. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the kind of money I would have had at that time. I still have it and it still works perfectly, which puts it in league with my Tektronix analog oscilloscopes in terms of legendary durability.')
