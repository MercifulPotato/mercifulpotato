In fact I actually went back to an Acorn RiscPC 600 for a bit once instead of a modern windows machine. It was what I considered to peak productivity for me. Built in assembler and programming language, decent quality desktop applications and no distractions.<p>After about 5-6 days it was back on eBay because quite frankly I realised what a pain in the ass it really was. 99% of the stuff I was actually doing was collaboration and it&#x27;s really difficult doing that on vintage computing platforms. On top of that the hardware is almost always like a hand grenade with the pin out. It&#x27;s going to die, but you just don&#x27;t know when.<p>I cite this as an example for the comedy timing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TU55-7dWMi0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TU55-7dWMi0</a><p>Now emulation I can get behind because when you are completely fed up of the idea you had it&#x27;s easier to dispose of it than getting rid of it on ebay :)')
