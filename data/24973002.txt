I feel lucky to still have a job and one that is remote-first, but working alone in my studio apartment is really getting to me. My family is in another state and a lot of my friends don&#x27;t live in a bike-able distance or have temporarily moved out of SF. My productivity has really been shot into the toilet.<p>One thing I&#x27;d really recommend is making sure that you exercise regularly. There are great apps like Zombies Run or Peloton (there are normal workouts - bike not required) that can give you a great workout. They also have hooks to keep you engaged (storyline, Peloton&#x27;s community) and help you maintain momentum. Strava has also been a great way to see what my friends are up to in a way that&#x27;s toxic like Facebook.')
