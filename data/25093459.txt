Until my first vacation in Canada where I discovered I couldn&#x27;t watch my movies. I called them and they said that my movies were region-locked to the United States. To their credit, they did refunded all of my digital purchases. I haven&#x27;t bought anything digital from them since.<p>So, not an Amazon account ban, but you quickly learn you are not &quot;buying&quot; a movie, but renting it, sometimes with silly restrictions like &quot;only from these IPs&quot;.')
