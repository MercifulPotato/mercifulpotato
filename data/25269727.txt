Overall I think it&#x27;s awesome and I love having a real linux machine in such a nice package. The build quality is much better than expected.<p>That said, Firefox is extremely slow and crashes a lot. Getting a fast stable browser seems like priority #1 to me. If these things are ever going to take off they need apps, and I think web apps (for better or for worse) are the quickest way to get a decent number of apps.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s simply a hardware issue (can&#x27;t expect too much for 150USD), or a software optimization problem. I don&#x27;t have a cheap Android phone to compare to.')
