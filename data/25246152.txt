Because that is, unlike your objective science, based on &quot;extremely ideologically biased humanities and social sciences&quot;. Good for you.<p>&gt; I think the end of Jim Crow laws was the end of most institutional racism, with some remnants of it existing in the social contract that was quickly dismantled in the 1970s, as society took a severe stance against anti-black discrimination.<p>This is just staring oneself blind on the letter of law, ignoring everything else. That&#x27;s not how societies work.<p>It&#x27;s pointless to discuss subjects with someone who will just redefine them entirely and then <i>refuse</i> to even recognize anything else - everything else is now false, no matter how established. If this is not trolling it&#x27;s at least dragging the level of discussion into never ending discussion of definitions and revisionism.')
