You just raised a huge strawman.<p>Websites are not receiving your biometrics in this context, and your biometrics would be meaningless to the website if captured and somehow provided.<p>Your biometric signature is stored solely inside the Secure Enclave in the Apple device.<p>If and only if the Secure Enclave recognizes you via your biometrics will the Enclave uses a non-transferrable key stored only in the Enclave to attest to the website that you are the user &quot;JoeAltmaier&quot;.<p>- The key is secret.<p>- The key is kept in only one place.<p>- The key can easily be discarded and a new one made.<p>- The key is never given to anything outside of the Enclave, so... I&#x27;m not sure how it could be traced to you, besides the whole fact that it is being used to authenticate you, which is necessary.<p>Sounds pretty acceptable to me as a password. The usability issue here is that a website needs to be able to accept a different password from each device you own, since the password is non-transferrable, and you might accidentally drop your iPhone to the bottom of the ocean.<p>Good news: FIDO2 is an entire standard built around this concept, originally intended for use on YubiKeys and similar FIDO2-compliant USB sticks.<p>Apple is building an implementation of FIDO2 that uses the iPhone that&#x27;s already in the person&#x27;s hand.<p>If the Secure Enclave is compromised (which does happen sometimes), then Bad Things could happen... but that&#x27;s also what happens when a password manager tool is compromised.')
