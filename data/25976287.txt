Has date rape decreased in the West now? All I hear is that it&#x27;s just as bad now as then.<p>The 90s like every time in history had unique problems. HIV&#x2F;AIDS for example (still a huge problem, STIs are actually on the rise in the US). This time has its own unique problems the 90s did not (the rise of conspiracy theories, the rise of nationalism, the rise of the far-right, etc.) and those affect everyone.<p>Life isn&#x27;t continual progress. Just because some things have changed for the better doesn&#x27;t mean others haven&#x27;t changed for the worse')
