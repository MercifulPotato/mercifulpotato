Standups are annoying but I have learned they are necessary, even as a very experienced developer. Sometimes things just cone up you wouldn’t otherwise know about and it encourages helpful, meaningful communication amongst the team.<p>What’s not helpful is when standups are treated like status reports. That’s not the purpose - even uber green newbies are responsible enough to do their work. The best kind of standups are those where you can feel\nfree to discuss your blockers and simply state what you’re doing so the team has a general awareness if what’s going on and how&#x2F;if it impacts them.')
