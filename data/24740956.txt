In both cases, the codebase&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;client part is open source; while the asset data that creates the experience everyone is familiar with, is proprietary. In both cases, you’re free to create your <i>own</i> asset data to use with <i>their</i> codebase&#x2F;runtime&#x2F;client.<p>In both cases, I find it helpful to imagine an alternative world where the “engine” and the “assets” were created by separate companies.<p>In such a world, you could imagine Id.A publishing a standalone open-source “Doom engine”; and then Id.B making a proprietary game called “Doom” using that engine.<p>Similarly, in such a world, you could imagine OpenAI.A publishing a standalone open-source “GPT-3 architecture”; and then OpenAI.B training a proprietary model called “GPT-3” using that architecture.<p>In both cases, that’s exactly what happened; only Id.A and Id.B were both just Id; and OpenAI.A and OpenAI.B were both just OpenAI. And because of that, each company decided to refer to the whole thing they were doing—both the open engine, and the proprietary assets—as a single project with a single name (where if they had been two separate companies, the necessity of securing trademarks would have pushed them to have two separate names for those two things.)<p>People’s moral paranoia in cases like this, comes down to the fact that there’s a name collision that they aren’t noticing. The engine of the original <i>software</i> Doom, and the assets of the original <i>game</i> Doom, are both just called “Doom”; and likewise, the architecture of GPT-3, and one trained model built on that architecture, are both just called “GPT-3.” If you separate them, it’s clear that one <i>is</i> intended to be open-source, while the other is not. But, for whatever reason, the companies involved didn’t separate the concepts, leading to this illegibility of whether “GPT-3” is open-source or not. It’s a meaningless question, because the label “GPT-3” isn’t cleanly pointing to a single concept.')
