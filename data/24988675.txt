You get a lot of freedom to experiment and think creatively about problems, whether it&#x27;s in design studio or a structures class. I recommend the education to anyone who will listen.<p>I appreciate autodidacts and there are many things I&#x27;ve taught myself (software engineering being one of those things). But, I am glad this article does not disavow education. Too often, articles like these try to highlight anomalies where people are successful despite no formal higher education and I think that sends the wrong message.')
