COVID-related measures aside, I find I add about 20min&#x2F;day of walking <i>easily</i>, and more if I need to do something (e.g. buying groceries). Now, in the US I own a car and here I do not -- but in my Midwestern town I am totally obligated to own and operate a car. Here in Europe I get along fine with walking, riding a bike, and using public transport.')
