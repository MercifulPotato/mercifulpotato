The jet engine hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed since the 50s or so, but we&#x27;re still making incremental improvements to it (single crystal casting, various high temperature alloys, probably ceramic turbine blades in the future), and those changes add up to substantial improvements over time. Software is the same.<p>Edit: Just compare how much easier it is to make something substantial today than it would&#x27;ve been 15 years ago. You could make a fairly sophisticated SaaS today from scratch using Django, Postgres, Redis, Stripe, Mailgun, and AWS in about a month. That&#x27;s progress, even if it is boring and obvious.')
