I&#x27;m a little taken aback by the tone:<p>&gt; I am an unfortunate user of Notion. I have to use it in my day to day job because it is the tool of my company choice. I suffer every time I&#x27;m doing anything in it.<p>I put a good bit of time looking at alternatives to paper that allowed for concurrent editing by multiple people, rich support for technical documentation&#x2F;code snipits, good tables, fast, etc.<p>Notion isn&#x27;t perfect, but after going through a dozen offerings it came out far and ahead of all others, especially when you factored in its price. Over the last year they&#x27;ve also really moved ahead with new features, etc.  We&#x27;ve moved all our docs and project tracking over to it and now we&#x27;re fortunately off next-gen Jira.<p>We&#x27;re a very technical team, and we share our docs rw to the whole company.  Out of all the tools we use, I found this one pretty pleasurable to use to be honest.')
