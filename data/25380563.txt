CentOS remained on tried and tested releases for multiple years, backporting security fixes - though not features - for software. It kept the number of bugs you&#x27;d find in the software low and well known.<p>Let&#x27;s say, Nginx. On Debian, you might be running &quot;buster&quot;, their stable release, and running nginx 1.18-1.19. On CentOS, you&#x27;d be running on nginx 1.14. This means that you&#x27;re missing features, but the versions you&#x27;re running are about as bulletproof as software gets, and (were) still receiving security updates.<p>Newer versions <i>are</i> available, but usually from the developers directly; the official repos always held much older, stable versions.<p>When they offered &quot;Decades of Support&quot;, they meant it (well, they used to mean it).')
