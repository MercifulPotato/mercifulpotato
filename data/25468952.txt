We need accelerated testing. In the case of a pandemic, we need to make better use of volunteers. I believe that as the history of this one is reckoned with, one of the more interesting moral failures to be acknowledged will be the failure to utilize challenge testing protocols with willing volunteers (give them the vaccine and then deliberately expose them to the virus. It is a calculated risk.)<p>Earlier phases could have been accelerated as well. For mRNA vaccines, deleterious effects are unlikely, inefficacy is the likeliest problem. It might be possible to be challenge testing (highly informed) volunteers within a week of a novel virus being isolated.<p>On a similar note, national stockpiles of RT-PCR machines and reagents would allow widespread testing within the same week.<p>If Iâ€™m right, these indicate moral failures deeply embedded within our political and medical systems. Better luck next time.')
