Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608512365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487192, text='Far from London, in San Francisco I found that yellow cab drivers could often (but not always) take me to where I wanted if I gave a cross street or described an area of the city. Uber and Lyft often couldn&#x27;t because Google Maps is surprisingly unreliable when it comes to searching for cross streets. Just my house was an example, yellow cabs I could usually tell the cross street and they knew it immediately, and Uber&#x2F;Lyft I usually had to give the full address and then wait while they typed it in. Part of this is because humans can retain a lot of location-specific intuition - I lived at the intersection of a regionally important through street and a university. Cab drivers knew the through street, and knew what part of it the university streets were in... the rest was just driving down it until they saw the right university.<p>I also had a LOT of experiences with Lyft drivers that were clearly very new to the city and lacked basic awareness of unusually set up but major intersections, and near-rush-hour traffic patterns. This lead to things like going the wrong way on one-way streets and missing turn lanes.<p>Software still has a long ways to go before it can adequately capture and work with that type of region-specific organization.')
