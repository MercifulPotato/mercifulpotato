Further, much of the imagery used to persuade the population to vote for the referendum, such as the Muslim woman wearing a chador across the backdrop of a Swiss flag covered by minarets that look like missiles, was bigoted and defamatory.<p>My point in raising this incident is to provide an example that a direct referendum system has advantages and disadvantages.  One of the disadvantages seen here is that the system can be used to remove a right from minority population important to their cultural identity.  More broadly, there&#x27;s always a tension between majority rule and protection of minority rights in a democracy and both the California and Swiss referendum systems allow those lines to be redrawn by populist appeal.')
