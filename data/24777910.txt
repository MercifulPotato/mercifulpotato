What the Spain&#x2F;UK cases suggest is that lack of lockdown policies aren&#x27;t the only leading factors to the spread of the disease.<p>This is why I think the Canada case is interesting: yes the government tells travelers to quarantine under the risk of a million dollar fine, but go to a park now and 80% of people aren&#x27;t wearing masks despite reports of people breaking quarantine. So clearly, a dissonance between policy and what&#x27;s going on on the ground can have a non-negligible effect.')
