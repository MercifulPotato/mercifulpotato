You know, that bill is supposed to make America energy conscious and follow the rubric of Germany’s energy plan, but her and proponents of it (ironically) polluted it with ideology (broad ideology too):<p>(H) guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States;<p>(I) strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collec- tively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment;<p>(J) strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and safety, antidiscrimination, and wage and hour standards across all employ- ers, industries, and sectors;<p>(O) providing all people of the United States with—\n(i) high-quality health care;\n(ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing;\n(iii) economic security; and\n(iv) clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and access to nature.<p>I’m a developer, and I’m in the cult of Agile whether I like it or not, but for the love of god these people do not understand how to scope something that should be a clear fucking deliverable.<p>Like, no, don’t bring sustainable housing, living wage, or healthcare into an already contentious debate about energy ambitions of a nation.<p>So in her I sense a strong anti-compromiser, and I see the same Trumpian demagogue in a different suit.')
