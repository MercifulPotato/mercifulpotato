Back in ye olde days when GPU mining for bitcoin was still possible (basically, FPGAs were not widespread and ASICs not even on the horizon), the amount of people who bought out all usable GPUs and resold them on ebay was <i>massive</i>. It was almost impossible to get anything for <i>months</i> unless you were willing to pay many multiples the ordinary worth.<p>In concert and other event tickets it&#x27;s even worse. Some tickets have been known to sell at 20x markups, Rammstein concerts or Wacken tickets are usually outsold in a matter of hours and end up on ebay the day after.')
