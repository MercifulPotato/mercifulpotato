If you need pen testing to review the standard vulnerabilities your network has had then you know your network is wide open to anyone with a multi-million dollar budget. You are assuming the US, China, Russia, NK, UK, Canada, ... won&#x27;t decide this network has the highest value data of all networks they could attack to raise their GDP. There is no real boogie man, there is just a global excess of nationalist oriented powers with no accountability. Powder Keg 2.0.')
