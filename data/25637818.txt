Second, union members are prohibited from working on non-union productions. Additionally, most well-known actors are union members. This gives a strong incentive for a production to be a union production. Third, union productions are prohibited from hiring more than a token number of non-union actors (unless they pay a fine to the union). This gives a strong incentive for productions to only use union talent (which also gives actors another reason to want to be a union member).<p>Note that by observing important differences between the film and software industries, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> arguing that unions couldn&#x27;t work for the software industry. I suspect this is why I&#x27;ve been downvoted.')
