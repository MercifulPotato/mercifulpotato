Its goal was to improve trust in the financial system, and it achieved that goal in part by introducing regulations that help protect individual investors.<p>The fire analogy is actually a good one, since those policies also have historical roots in the razing of big portions of several large US cities (eg Chicago).<p>In a dense city, your purported distinction between fire codes that protect inhabitants and fire codes that protect cities&#x2F;blocks is a false dichotomy. The way you prevent the block from burning is by preventing individual buildings from burning. Because in a dense city blocks are comprised of... well... densely packed buildings.<p>More laissez faire strategies might work in much less dense areas like rural Kansas (not even suburbs -- have you seen a bad gas explosion?). And even then, only as long as you you&#x27;re willing to really go it on your own -- if your attitude is &quot;don&#x27;t tell me what to do&quot; rugged individualism then don&#x27;t expect the time of day from insurance companies, banks offering mortgages, or fire departments. Buy in cash, no insurance, and put out your own fires.<p>Similarly, public and secondary financial markets are not your brother&#x27;s laundromat or neighborhood bar. The best way to protect a large inter-connected financial system from collapses in investor confidence is to prevent obviously fraudulent bubbles from forming in the first place. Expecting individual investors to have confidence in valuations within completely unregulated marketplaces is like expecting the block be fine without thinking about how to prevent fires in any of the individual buildings.<p>This even extends to the &quot;maybe something else might work in rural Kansas&quot; example, where you replace actuaries and fire fighters with welfare&#x2F;social security and medicaid.')
