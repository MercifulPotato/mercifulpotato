Item(by='seppin', descendants=None, kids=[25579374], score=None, time=1609303642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578477, text='&gt; Publishing reliable information that is politically relevant<p>Trying desperately to turn emails (that amounted mostly to dirty laundry) stolen by a government into manufactured scandals and conspiracies the day after the worst revelations about Russia&#x27;s preferred candidate dropped was not, and is not, journalism. How on earth can you get something so basic wrong?<p>&gt; We already know that all of his communication in the Ecuadorian embassy were tapped for years, what are they protecting?<p>Nice little straw man there. We are talking about Assange&#x27;s official relationship with Russian military intelligence years before he hid in the Ecuadorian embassy. The proof of said relationship, if made public, reveals how Russia was monitored&#x2F;caught and helps them conceal their future efforts at recruiting assets.<p>Which is why the &quot;if you have proof why not make it public?&quot; argument in relation to espionage is and always will be a bad faith argument. Snowden did it too. He knows damn well everything he says will go unchallenged, and he uses that silence to his rhetorical advantage.<p>But you knew all that already.')
