This means if you run two commit-based triggered actions in quick succession, you can have tests pass that should not. (They run against the wrong checked out code!)<p>I had this happen in front of the client, where it appeared a unit test of assertTrue(False) passed! It was so undermining of GA I had to chase down the exact status and prove ability to avoid (using Turnstyle) to the client. I wrote an email to the GA team specifically telling this story and expressing my concern.<p>Another is scheduled actions, where even if you specify a cron, the action has a window of several minutes when a GitHub runner will execute it, and there are cases where the window is missed and the action is not run!<p>This isn’t documented, though GitHub recently made the docs community-editable, possibly realizing there is too much to do.<p>All that said, the product is still relatively new, and even with these rough edges it is __really__ good.<p>Having CI definition alongside code, with free-ish VMs available at all times, (except when it goes down,) and results all inside GitHub is amazing.<p>Also, the self-hosted runners are amazing, as they allow some really simple matrix definition to run CI on custom HW and network environments.<p>If it weren’t for all the recent negative attention recently, I would have said GH was doing really well, inclusive of GitHub Actions.')
