The objective of the program is to inspire innovation in participating employees and ultimately increase company potential. The 20% Project was influenced by a comparable program, launched in 1948, by manufacturing multinational 3M which required employees to dedicate fifteen-percent of their paid hours to a personal interest.[1]</i><p>Nothing say anything about <i>company related projects</i>, it only mentions <i>personal projects</i>. If you&#x27;re talking about <i>company projects</i>, then it&#x27;s not a <i>20% project</i>. Even less so if you are talking about doing 100% of your <i>company</i> work beside.<p>I&#x27;ve got a feeling SV companies have hijacked the term 1) for PR bs, and 2) to get more work from employees.')
