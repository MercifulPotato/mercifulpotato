The AirPods (Pro or Max) know when your head is moving, but the source device needs to be location-aware too... it’s natural to want to use AirPods Max to watch a movie with the full spatial audio experience, as loud as you want, on the biggest screen in your house... But you can’t. You can only get this big room-sized audio experience with the small visual experience of an iPad or iPhone screen.</i><p>Even with the AirPods Pro, I&#x27;m so baffled by this.<p><i>Why</i> does the source device need to be location-aware?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be enough to just orient the spatial audio to something like your &quot;median&quot; head orientation? Obviously, the vast majority of the time you&#x27;re watching something, you&#x27;re looking at the screen.<p>Or for something fixed (like a TV), just click a button during setup while wearing your headphones saying &quot;I&#x27;m looking directly at the center of the screen now.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m curious what I might be missing that makes it so critical for the source device to have an accelerometer and gyroscope.<p>(As a side note, I guess I also don&#x27;t actually understand how your AirPods know how to orient themselves towards the direction of your device in the first place -- I don&#x27;t believe they have an internal compass component.)')
