Thomann is great, but a decade ago they sent me a Korg synth with the printed manual in German, I guess this has changed.<p>On the other hand, I prefer getting the package myself in the car, so as to avoid surprises when the thing arrives --I didn&#x27;t have any issues with Thomann&#x27;s courier, though.')
