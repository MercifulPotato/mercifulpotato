It was already eating most of the crypto-only exchanges volume when altcoins were almost exclusively paired with BTC and before it acquired its perpetual futures business.<p>The main reason they managed to attract so many users is flamboyant altcoin pump and dumps orchestrated with ICO teams and Chinese whales, and pioneering exchange coins with the securities&#x2F;utility token mash-up called BNB. Users came to chase the pumps, and stayed when they were invested in the platform itself.<p>Binance&#x27;s thriving in its later phase even as Coinbase ramped up its altcoin listings can certainly be attributed to Tether though.')
