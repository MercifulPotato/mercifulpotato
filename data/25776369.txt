And that&#x27;s mostly because he believed the press and every other avenue was controlled by leftists. This is far more a &quot;Donald Trump is a paranoiac&quot; problem than a social media problem per se. Nothing wrong with a politican doing an AMA on Reddit or a Facebook Q&amp;A or having a Twitter account, which they all do at this point.<p>Politicians using social media as a convenient way to communicate with people directly can be a net benefit for society, although probably more so the more local government becomes. But using social media exclusive of other, official channels is obviously a problem.')
