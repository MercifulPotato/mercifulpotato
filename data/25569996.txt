I remember when this was added to MapQuest circa 2010, and was the transition from trying to have an excellent mapping experience to just adding revenue focused features.<p>Google is still operating from an extremely strong position, by nature of having nearly infinite budget and owning their mapping and search dataset. It&#x27;s concerning that the iOS app seems to be suffering from the same issues that preceded the gradual downfall of MapQuest from a product perspective.')
