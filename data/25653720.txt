Item(by='oneplane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609896532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652914, text='While I understand what everyone is complaining about, I have no problems or failures with any of them, except a battery swap on the 2015 13&quot; when it started swelling up after 2000 cycles. The keyboards and trackpads are different but I can do my work on them just fine all the same. The 2017 has the benefit (to me) of working a bit like the Magic Keyboard 2, the 2019 is not that much different from that, and as far as the other user-facing I&#x2F;O is concerned, the screen, sound, ports and palmrests are all pretty good. The 2015 is starting to feel a bit odd (small keys, small trackpad) and without Thunderbolt 2 the I&#x2F;O would not have the bandwidth I wanted.<p>The only thing I have had break was a 2009 MagSafe charger, the insulation somewhere in the middle started getting brittle, probably some sort of chemical reaction causing it to lose its flexibility. But since I only have 1 MagSafe first revision device left it doesn&#x27;t matter that much. (and I don&#x27;t use it that much either)')
