My company locks down laptops so I use no non Windows software but the approved and centrally managed Teams and Zoom. I also have an $80 variable warmth panel light mounted to a desk stand about 8&quot; behind, above and slightly to the side of the web cam. Useful as the lighting changes throughout the day.<p>I like the mute button directly on the mic.')
