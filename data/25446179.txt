And don&#x27;t get me started on the proliferation of low quality &quot;mixed reality&quot; headsets. Honest enthusiasts have no options for high quality &quot;world scale&quot; VR. The best VR experience is STILL found this way, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9DvB07X84HM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9DvB07X84HM</a> - but it requires a shitty headset compared to the Index.<p>VR most likely would have ended up with the same experience (but better quality) if the manufacturers built better quality headsets with wireless and higher resolution (most likely attached to a high quality laptop in a backpack), priced it more highly (1500-2000$+ in kits like the youtube video), and then let VRs merits sell itself, rather than allow half-baked headsets to frustrate and dissuade people.')
