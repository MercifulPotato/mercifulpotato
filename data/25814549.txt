Item(by='ksaj', descendants=None, kids=[25818567], score=None, time=1610914891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808115, text='Interesting way of wording this, but if I paid for research and the patent process, and someone beats me to production and I have the patent protecting my investment into the idea they are now making money on, then yes, they&#x27;d owe me for my research, which I may or may not license to them.<p>If you think you&#x27;ve invented something, then you need to do your own research to see if what you invented hasn&#x27;t already been invented. Otherwise your blinders cause you to waste your own time. That&#x27;s never been new. It&#x27;s the same with product names, and just about everything else (trademarks, copyrights, etc). There&#x27;s even a saying for it: Why reinvent the wheel? Otherwise, absolutely everybody could claim they just didn&#x27;t know it was patented, and steal anybody else&#x27;s work as they wished, because &quot;Sure I invented it after you did, but I also have a faster production line than you.&quot;<p>You can&#x27;t claim <i>you</i> invented Widget-A if I already did, and can prove it. Which I would through my patent of Widget-A. If you want to invent a competing Widget-B, then <i>invent</i> it, and don&#x27;t use Widget-A without a license with me. You didn&#x27;t invent it if I already did and have a patent as proof.<p>That&#x27;s what a patent is and what it does. It doesn&#x27;t stop invention. It protects inventions from outright theft (or even accidental theft). Go ahead and invent, but if you weren&#x27;t first, you aren&#x27;t the inventor.')
