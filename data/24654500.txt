To me this sort of language is unacceptable because it sorts humanity into convenient little boxes with supposedly predictable input&#x2F;output behavior.  In the workplace or in social settings, it can have the effect of completely alienating people.<p>Unfortunately, at least in American culture, many of these stereotypes about what it &quot;means&quot; to be Japanese &#x2F; German &#x2F; Italian or what it means to have the role of &quot;girlfriend&quot; or &quot;wife&quot; or &quot;husband&quot; are reinforced in us from an early age.  Wives are supposed to be controlling and manipulative.  Men are expected to be stoic breadwinners and utterly incompetent when it comes to household duties like cooking or child-rearing.<p>For example, look at any show produced by Disney Channel in the 2000s -- it&#x27;s all about petty relationship drama and manufactured conflict where characters overreact rather than having tough conversations.  Technically the shows are trying to give examples of <i>bad behavior</i>, as there is usually a lesson learned in the last ~30s of the episode, but the characters seem to reset to their usual, horrible selves by the next week&#x27;s episode.')
