Pretty much all the mysteries of the BotNS were elucidated on the Gene Wolfe mailing list (which was archived) and a handful of fan websites. It would be much more efficient use of a reader&#x27;s time to go through these instead of podcasts or videos, which aren&#x27;t information-dense media and are duplicating effort and yet falling short of earlier commentaries.')
