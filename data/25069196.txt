Quite unique combination of features, focused mostly on gamedev (for example, it has a basic map editor). I like a lot how tasks combine in a list or a tree, based just on their relative position. There are some unconventional elements like timer and whiteboard that I find very useful for project and work organization.<p>Now for downsides. The UI is non-standard, so tab and other focusing shortcuts won&#x27;t work. The workflow needs re-thinking, right now everything is added as a task and then changed (only by mouse) into other elements. Too many interactions require dialogs, for example completing one task in &#x27;progression&#x27; requires going into property dialog and incrementing a number. Late tasks are nervously animated and too distracting. The font is not changeable and looks pixelated and quirky. Why is zoom blury when using vector fonts? Unicode support is lacking.<p>What I&#x27;m really wishing for is similar tool but with more journalling workflow. Let me make new entries every day, but with support for mind maps or simple charts, free-floating text boxes and maybe with whiteboard. The bit I&#x27;m lacking in existing software is to treat content as timestamped sketches, not as permanent documents.<p>I will check again in few months to see what becomes of this, as it shows promise.')
