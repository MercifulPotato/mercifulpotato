But when you have trillions of photons passing through, you can &quot;see&quot; the difference by the relative intensity of light.<p>Remember that at the quantum level, things don&#x27;t happen deterministically; you have to consider the <i>probability</i> that a given outcome occurs.  So the photon has a certain probability to hit the filter and get absorbed, a certain probability to pass through the entire depth of the filter, a certain probability to hit the sensor without generating an event, a certain probability to hit the sensor and initiate a chemical reaction (for film or biological eyes) or an electron cascade (for CCD sensors), a certain probability to quantum tunnel to the other side of the universe...<p>So getting back to your question, when pure orange photons hit a red filter, many of them will make it through the filter, but not as many as if they were pure red photons.  When pure orange photons hit a green filter, some of them will make it through, but not as many as if they were pure green photons.  So if your brain knows what the &quot;white point&quot; of a given environment is, relative to that white color it&#x27;ll see a specific combination of &quot;some red, some green&quot; as orange.  (Of course, if known-to-be-white objects are already orange--like when you put on amber ski googles--your brain will eventually adjust and recalibrate to perceive that color as something else... perception is tricky!)')
