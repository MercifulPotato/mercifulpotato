Just made sure he knows he can always come back and tell me he is no longer interested in the classes and we will just cut it.<p>As to creative work, I figured out already it is better if I do most of figuring out how to solve some problems (and let him solve just enough to not get bored with it) and he is spending time figuring out what kind of features we want in the games, for example.<p>We then discuss what is and what is not feasible and how things can be working and I still try to make sure he understands how the program works.<p>I know he understands at least some of it because he can take educated guesses at how to modify the program to change it to do what he wants.<p>This seems to be really fun for him so I plan for it to stay that way for some time.')
