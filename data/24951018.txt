They are paid nearly double market rates, tons of vacation, grate benefits, 0 layoffs and quite difficult to get fired. The intangible benefits are worth probably 10% extra.<p>Many of these people live in more rural area where cost of living is 30-40% lower than otherwise.<p>If that&#x27;s not enough - they are paid glorious retirement benefits for decades after retirement - it&#x27;s hard to fathom the &#x27;net present value&#x27; of those benefits.<p>With overtime, semi-skilled line workers can easily earn over $200K.<p>Counting the cost of education and overhead and retirement package - if you live in a rural area, you&#x27;re going to make more money doing &#x27;semi skilled line work&#x27; for Hyro One than you will as a Doctor or frankly anything else.<p>Have a look [1]<p>While I think you are very correct in your concerns - Public Sector Unions have an iron grip over such infrastructure and they will seek as much profit as they can from their monopoly.<p>They have no incentive to do anything other than the minimum and extract from their guild monopolization of that bit of infrastructure.<p>There&#x27;s no way we can make any significant progress with those kinds of institutional barriers so there needs to be progress there as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontariosunshinelist.com&#x2F;employers&#x2F;pnfx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ontariosunshinelist.com&#x2F;employers&#x2F;pnfx</a>')
