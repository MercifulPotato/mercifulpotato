I&#x27;m having trouble with it again as we&#x27;re having to homeschool, so I&#x27;m spending more evenings working than I would normally. I barely get any real downtime and my sleep is disturbed. It sucks. The only way I&#x27;m managing is by being disceplined with myself about making some time when I get to switch off from work. My days are very regimented right now, but it&#x27;s working. Having a clear divide between work and not-work really helps. At the small-scale, I&#x27;ve taken to using a pomodoro timer during my working hours, I have a jigsaw that I work on in the rest periods.<p>Something I&#x27;ve found as I&#x27;ve got older is that I simply can&#x27;t manage without good sleep the way I seemed to be able to when I was younger. My younger team member is in his mid 30s and we were talking about this last week. He&#x27;d been pulling all-nighters (he&#x27;s working around homeschool too), and it had been affecting his work, stuff was getting done but it wasn&#x27;t great, and he was useless the next day. He&#x27;s been operating the same way he used to do in his 20s when he was doing a PhD and didn&#x27;t have kids. I think I&#x27;ve finally convinced him that the price you pay later is almost never worth it, but it&#x27;s taken him a while to admit he just can&#x27;t maintain that level of effort.<p>Getting older sucks in a lot of ways, a lot of them are quite subtle and happen slowly. I think the ability to run at maximum effort for extended periods of time is one of the things that you lose to some extent. That isn&#x27;t to say that younger people don&#x27;t get burnt out, but I think we recover quicker when we are younger, a bit like how we physically heal faster.')
