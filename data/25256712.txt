I have a kid now, second possibly on the way, so even without covid some of this is&#x2F;will be massively scaled down. But I still want to pick up new ones - right now its precision target shooting and archery.<p>Its more about mindset - if you feel you have a great life, money is just a tool to keep it. For that you don&#x27;t need terribly much, heck some full time climbers live in camper vans for the whole time. On the other hand if you don&#x27;t enjoy your life, money won&#x27;t make it magically better, sometimes the opposite.<p>And no I don&#x27;t sell some stupid coaching :) Those are just my own experiences')
