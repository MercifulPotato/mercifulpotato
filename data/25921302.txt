Hot-standby instances can&#x27;t be used for anything serious since all queries are dropped regularly (I believe it&#x27;s not safe to use &quot;hot_standby_feedback&quot; config to overcome this issue).<p>Hot-standby instances are fine. We&#x27;ve been using these for GitLab.com for a number of years now, and never have they caused any issues. We do have some code in place that retries queries when they are cancelled by the hot-standby, but IIRC this doesn&#x27;t happen often.')
