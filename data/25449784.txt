Explicitly mentioned in this verse for example:<p>&quot;We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.”[1]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quran.com&#x2F;46&#x2F;15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quran.com&#x2F;46&#x2F;15</a>')
