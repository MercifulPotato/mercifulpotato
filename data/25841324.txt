You can&#x27;t go anywhere on these sites and see these topics without searching for them, and when you do the hashtags are either immediately taken over by the rest of the users on the site or taken off of trending deliberately by administrators, often both. Can you provide one example of these topics consistently being &#x27;amplified&#x27; or &#x27;normalized&#x27; by one of the major tech platforms? I&#x27;m talking public content, not private groups. Posts that are &#x27;amplified&#x27;, not just present. You can find posts from anyone about anything online, so I don&#x27;t really see what separates these private facebook groups from something like a mailing list. It doesn&#x27;t seem &quot;normalized&quot; at all.')
