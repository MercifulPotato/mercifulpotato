UPS made this mistake once and is not going to do it again.<p>For business customers, accepting a package and failing to deliver for the holidays is WORSE than accepting (a la USPS) with no limits and then having it get stuck.<p>UPS did this to amazon once, and that was enough for Amazon to decide to build out its own delivery network.<p>Shippers can do all sorts of things to help make things efficient if UPS communicates the limits. Ie, no sales with guaranteed 2 day shipping 2 days before xmass.')
