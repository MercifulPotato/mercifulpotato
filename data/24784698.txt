Prime day just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of really good deal.  They&#x27;ve got the usual Amazon stuff that are legit sales, and a few other items.<p>Beyond that it&#x27;s mostly second rate stuff on sale and a bunch of non sale stuff advertised as on sale.<p>2. I wonder about how crappy advertising is all the time.  I&#x27;ve git lists of things I might want and I never see adds for those things ... mostly things I already bought or stuff I don&#x27;t care about.<p>I suspect the truth is whatever AI there is or advertising that is there, it isn&#x27;t FOR us, it is pointed AT US.   It&#x27;s there to try to make us do what someone else wants... so they advertise women&#x27;s clothing ... to me ... a guy, with no interest in those things because they&#x27;re motivated to sell that, not what I want.')
