Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25090302], score=None, time=1605297432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082207, text='&gt; USA is not bad at all, number of case is high but most of it are asymptomatic or only have mild symptom. What bad is the government reaction in some state that put so many covid related restriction. how are u thinking of locking people is beyond me, it makes people suffer, its harmful.<p>The USA has the highest number of deaths from Covid of any country on Earth, by far. One of the worse numbers per capita as well. To put it in perspective, in 2018 435,000 people died of Malaria around the world; the US alone has lost 225,000 people to Covid - more than half of that.<p>Also, you have to understand that the restrictions are the only things that have kept the numbers so small. Everything we&#x27;ve seen from regions that didn&#x27;t take measures to curb the spread shows that numbers could easily be 2-5 times the current numbers. How you can look at those numbers and think &quot;yeah, but wearing a mask is, like, annoying&quot; is beyond reason.<p>And please remember that cars have a huge upside, and that they are heavily regulated exactly to reduce the number of deaths. You need to pass an exam just to get in the driver&#x27;s seat of a car. You have to pass all sorts of expensive tests to even put a car you built on the road. You&#x27;re not allowed to drink before driving. You have to wear an uncomfortable harness the whole time you&#x27;re inside a car etc. - there are many restrictions that we accept to make driving safer.<p>Similarly for Covid, there were all sorts of annoying restrictions to keep people at least somewhat safe. The equivalent of banning all cars would have been that everyone except doctors, emergency personnel and the military can&#x27;t leave their house for 2-3 weeks, and the pandemic would have been over. But just like we can&#x27;t ban cars altogether, it&#x27;s not realistic to do that, so we had to accept lesser measures that offer lesser protection.<p>But from there to &quot;any kind of lockdown is, like, really bad&quot; you have quite some way to go.')
