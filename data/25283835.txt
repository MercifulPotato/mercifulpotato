It&#x27;s used in daily workflow in projects with over 500 models.\nIt supports a quite rich feature set including:\n- Out of the box Spring MVC annotation support\n- Integrated Project Lombok support for property detection\n- Spring Meta annotation processing - create your own annotations by combining the existing ones.\n- u&#x2F;PathVariable\n support for constructing request urls\n- Full set of features for return and parameter types:\n - Inheritance - supertypes and interfaces are mirrored as TypeScript interfaces\n - Generics - generic type information is mirrored into TypeScript interfaces\n - Enums - represented as named enums in TypeScript\n - Inner classes&#x2F;enums&#x2F;interfaces - are captured as prefixed classes\n - Java 8 Time classes support\n - Enums in map keys\n - Flexible filtering for input types to prevent &quot;type number bomb&quot;\n - Configurable replacement for the default HttpClient based network layer implementation with custom client code\nNot sure if it can be of use for anyone, but in case it is - you can find samples on usage on GitHub\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tri-omega&#x2F;typescript-service-generator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tri-omega&#x2F;typescript-service-generator</a>\nLatest versions are built with OpenJDK Java 11 but if anyone needs Oracle Java 8 builds - I can publish those as well (older versions where Java 1.8)\nIt&#x27;s available in Maven Central and easy to use')
