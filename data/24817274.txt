When you cut with scissors in the correct hand with a conventional grip, you force blades closer together which helps with a cut, but put the same scissors in the other hand and your fingers will now drag the blades apart.<p>Hence there are three solutions: you can have a pair of scissors with opposite chirality, you can try to grip wrong chirality scissors such way that you don&#x27;t drag their blades apart, or you can have high quality scissors with pivot pin tight and strong enough that you will not experience that effect.<p>The scissors in swiss army knifes&#x2F;cards for example are both high quality and allow for alternative grips.')
