So, I expect, that soon as he sells it is likely that the price will collapse.<p>That said, the volume that DFV holds is not very big (I read around .2%), so it will likely go unnoticed. As long as DFV doesn&#x27;t post that he&#x27;s out, the rocket keeps going up.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that DFV&#x27;s investment is real, but he might already be out without anyone knowing.<p>edit: typo')
