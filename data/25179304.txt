There&#x27;s a lot of discussions around sustainable open source, and I wonder what&#x27;s so wrong about asking people that find the project supportable enough to become a GH sponsor (I myself am one, since leaving the company around Matestack as a co-founder due to mental health issues), asking companies that profit from it for a tiny compensation and offering premium add-ons &amp; consulting (like, e.g., the people behind Sidekick, Trailblazer or Laravel do). Tough ask when tons of OSS is free &amp; high quality, but then again not everybody has the luxury of either already being famous and&#x2F;or being employed at $bigcorp to write OSS for a living (and we as a community perhaps should embrace different paths?!).\nLooking forward to a constructive discussion if you find the time :)<p>Also, there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;I think the DSL ends up a hinderance&quot; in this threat from people that (perhaps) haven&#x27;t tried it and judge from the looks. Maybe that&#x27;s just the tough HN crowd, but every single person we&#x27;ve actually had using it was pretty happy to with it once they were fully onboarded :)')
