I just think e2e should be table stakes these days for any communications platform. The only folks not doing it for consumers are the companies that are addicted to invading our privacy, like Google and Facebook (WhatsApp is e2e but FB has been fighting that for a while).<p>The others are rolling it out.<p>Zoom is being used for schools with kids younger than my 7 year old.
