This is strictly worse than what we have now.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t trust the Rust propaganda machine. When Mozilla announced they were getting rid of Rust teams, all we heard from said Rust devs was that this doesn&#x27;t spell the end for Rust. My impression was that they were mainly motivated by advancing their language rather than, you know, implementing a browser.<p>And to this date, I haven&#x27;t really read a critical post-mortem addressing claims that Rust can actually replace C or C++ in the areas where these languages are essential. Apart from kernels and drivers (where Rust seems an outright no-go), C is traditionally used for higher-level language runtimes and compilers&#x2F;interpreters&#x2F;VMs. But Rust&#x27;s borrow checker is a bad fit for just about any text book algorithm and technique in that space. Hell, even Rust devs themselves say implementing a DOM is about the worst use case for Rust.')
