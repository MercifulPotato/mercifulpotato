The words are gendered because it’s a gendered language. When non-Spanish speakers change it to Latinx it comes across as them declaring Spanish as problematic and “fixing” someone else’s language for them. There is also a class&#x2F;education issue. It’s a term originating in academia that non-college educated people have mostly never heard of. Being called by a label that you don’t recognize is alienating. Languages are extremely sensitive things. People go to war over them. It’s one thing for academics to mess around with words, but politicians should be very careful about doings so.<p>Matt Yglesias has a good article on it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;5&#x2F;21548677&#x2F;trump-hispanic-vote-latinx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;5&#x2F;21548677&#x2F;trump-hispanic-vote-l...</a><p>More generally, Elizabeth Warren leans too much on intersectional rhetoric and it’s alienating at least to me and I suspect others. I’m a “brown person” but I don’t see America as a country where “white” people are in perpetual conflict with “black and brown” people. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;biden-latino-vote-strategy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;biden-latino-vote...</a><p>&gt; Progressives commonly categorize Latinos as people of color, no doubt partly because progressive Latinos see the group that way and encourage others to do so as well. Certainly, we both once took that perspective for granted. Yet in our survey, only one in four Hispanics saw the group as people of color.<p>&gt; In contrast, the majority rejected this designation. They preferred to see Hispanics as a group integrating into the American mainstream, one not overly bound by racial constraints but instead able to get ahead through hard work.<p>Going full critical race theory like Warren has, and talking about how we must fix the water infrastructure maintenance deficit because of how it affects “black and brown” people is otherizing. You’re putting me in a bucket and now I’m thinking about that instead of water infrastructure.<p>It would be easy for Democrats if all non-whites had a strong pattern of voting out of racial solidarity. And this premise filters into their rhetoric. But I’m not going to vote Democrat out of racial solidarity and frankly I deeply resent the implication. I also resent the idea that any discussion of immigration or Islamic terrorism is “racist.” (And it’s laughable to me as an immigrant from a country where people would freak out if the culture and language was changing due to immigration as quickly as in the US.)')
