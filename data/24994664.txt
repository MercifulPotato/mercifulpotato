Money laundering is built into the protocol, to the point where being able to determine the chain-of-custody over some funds is computationally infeasible. Cryptocurrency is designed to increase the scope of money laundering rather than just the scale, because it makes money laundering the default.<p>I would replace &#x27;money laundering&#x27; with privacy and anonymity.<p>These properties are desirable. These properties give the individual undertaking the transaction a semblance of control. These properties prevent authorities from taking that control away except by using the law, which i think is a fairly good way to enforce control.<p>So if the individual feel that the law is unfair, they have the option to _not_ obey. If enough people choose to _not_ obey, it forces the court&#x27;s hand and legislator&#x27;s hand - this serves society.<p>Under centralized control, the individual does not have the option to not obey, because their transactions require approval from authorities. This approval becomes a chilling effect for change, and it makes it easy to target them before the general society is able to transition or understand. Civil disobedience is thus impossible under centralized control.')
