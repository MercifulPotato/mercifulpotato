Item(by='teorema', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610373430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25728384, text='I think one big unspoken assumption in a lot of this discussion is that claims to something like the Dems actually rigging and stealing the election would reasonably lead to physical resistance. For instance, if the Dems <i>actually were</i> stealing the election, many people would probably sympathize with the rioters. The assumption is that this isn&#x27;t true, but it&#x27;s something that does warrant physical resistance, therefore claims to it at a certain level are the same as incitement to violence. There&#x27;s also the implicit assumption that the president needs to exercise special care because of his power.<p>Like a lot of these sorts of things, the issues are complex, and I think a lot could come to light in coming days that might change perspective on exactly what Trump did and didn&#x27;t do. But I think some care is needed in being explicit about what&#x27;s being claimed. I think political biases are bleeding into claims of violence-inciting speech more than people realize. I personally don&#x27;t think claiming election fraud is impeachable, even if it is followed by events such as happened at the capitol, but I do think, say, coercion of a public official might be, as would willfully neglecting to institute expected security protocols at an event known to be high risk.')
