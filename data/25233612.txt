However their believability has an inverse relationship to the number of accusations.  When there is a clear pattern of behavior, as their is in this instance, it gets harder and harder to argue it is anything other than discriminatory.<p>And at a certain point the motive for these decisions doesn&#x27;t even matter.  If an overwhelming majority of Black employees feel they are being discriminated against at work, that is a huge failing for a company whether there is active discrimination happening or not.')
