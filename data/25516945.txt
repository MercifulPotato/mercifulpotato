One can start watching relatively harmless “list of Pokémon with illustrations” or “evolution of super Mario characters” videos and instantly it will start recommending videos of violent games or live-streaming gamers swearing - so it goes from something age-appropriate to something totally opposite.<p>Also don’t get me started on getting bombarded and suggested only “sound variations” videos which are noisy, rude and an attack on the senses - pure garbage content. Definitely a huge leap to assume I’ll find this interesting based on my previous choices.<p>Maybe instead of complaining here I should just go ahead and delete YouTube :)')
