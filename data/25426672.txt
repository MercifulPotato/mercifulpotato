Or look at the HTTP queries its making in the inspector. Or debug the server - look at what queries its receiving and returning. Or experiment with different values in the database.<p>Last year I was trying to track down a memory leak in some wasm code. The tooling for that sort of thing in wasm was&#x2F;is quite primitive, so I did some work to compile the module natively then ran valgrind on the resulting executable. That didn&#x27;t work - the C code executed differently from the wasm and didn&#x27;t exhibit the bug! So I added print statements randomly through the program and ran it both natively and through wasm, then diffed the text output to track down when the execution traces diverged. (It wasn&#x27;t a compiler bug, fwiw.)<p>I wanted more information about the memory leak. So I wrapped all the malloc&#x2F;free calls with a replacement that stored all outstanding allocations in a list, with the stack trace when malloc was called. When the leak happened, I could ask for the stack trace of all outstanding allocated objects[1]. That was fast and effective, and I added a memory leak check in my CI.<p>At one of my first programming jobs we were using visual source safe (oh god, kill it with fire). I ended up losing some changes I&#x27;d made in a ~3000 line java class that we&#x27;d already deployed to production. I didn&#x27;t want to do my work over again (or admit the mistake to my boss!). So I ran a decompiler against the class file we deployed to production - but it was huge and unreadable. To find the changes I&#x27;d made I took the current version of the java file, then compiled it and decompiled it again. So then I had two ugly files - but I could diff them, and that highlighted immediately the dozen or so changes I&#x27;d made. Then I just manually rewrote each change back into the original source file. Importantly, I had complete confidence that I didn&#x27;t miss any of my changes.<p>[1] Its not pretty, but the code looks like this if anyone&#x27;s curious: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephg&#x2F;mime-to-jmap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;2a7429f7b805cb00a5b94272564f46ad5c3a63d7&#x2F;src&#x2F;xmalloc.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;josephg&#x2F;mime-to-jmap&#x2F;blob&#x2F;2a7429f7b805cb0...</a>')
