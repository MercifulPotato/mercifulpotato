People have better and better consumables in their lives: always-connected pocket computers, cars with amazing safety systems that last much longer than before, and bigger rental apartments with amenities like air conditioning, cable TV and WiFi. At the same time, they are more and more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, and  no hope of owning their residence. The working class is simultaneously wealthier than ever before (pocket computers !) and poorer than ever before (can&#x27;t afford to see a doctor !). What&#x27;s undoubtedly true is that income inequality has grown dramatically in the US.')
