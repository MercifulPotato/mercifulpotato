By some definition, of course. But there is still something very different about the kind of labor which goes on there. Class, opportunity, connections, <i>access to capital</i>, and access to political influence further entrenching their position. It&#x27;s almost like the nobility of yore.<p>I find pointing to the 1% labor as some kind of redeeming quality of the system, is instead a distraction from capital vs labor. For the regular labor to have a chance to enter the top 1% of labor, is just as much of a pipe dream as them falling into Big Capital.')
