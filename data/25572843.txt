Had been thinking about trying out a clay pot for slow cooking biriyani. Sounds like a fair bit of hassle though to clean it. Maybe a Kamado grill would work well, super well insulated and can cook long at low temp.<p>I recently bought a 8l Instant Pot - it cooks really fast and I’m still exploring the best dishes to cook with it. But so far I find slow cooking stews and curries on minimum heat on a gas hob for ~7hours still brings out a bit more flavour - I just use the stainless steel pot from the Instant Pot on the hob, with a glass lid mostly on. Maybe it’s because of the time the flavours can mix, or because the dish reduces a bit more this way. We cook a lot of Burmese and Indian food and European stews this way, it’s great every single time.')
