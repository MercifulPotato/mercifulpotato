The broad point is China has too many people for current development models. Unless you think my argument is something else.<p>&gt; A moot point with resources.<p>On that matter what is your argument exactly? That things will be fine because science will solve all roadblocks? You may subscribe to future tech + earth can support 100 Billion Ecumenopolis in your other comment, but I do not. At analysing hypothetical trends in the next 50 years, which itself is a shitshow, but needn&#x27;t enter scifi wank territory. If your argument is the world can technically support 1T algae eating people comfortably without an actual road map for such transition then why bother obsessing minutae of individual statistics when your hypothetical outlook is a handwave.<p>&gt;no &#x2F; no<p>Normalize robots per 10k worker metric, China has more industrial robots than Japan, US, SK, Germany combined. Most of this growth was last few years.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t give a flying, why would they?<p>They haven&#x27;t given a flying historically, these regions were neglected, only so much political focus and direction to go around. Hence &quot;pending&quot; and whether they actually deliver on interior development pivots that&#x27;s being hinted at this year. You don&#x27;t think the fact that Chinese literacy rate exceeds most in the region while 600M interior poor who are already subsisting on rock bottom prices, a pool comparable to size of entire ASEAN, is a useless potential workforce? By your own admission the sector employs less than official statistics, are all 600M and their offsprings useless dregs? Are Chinese businesses all of a sudden not beholden to CCP industrial policies? Do state run enterprises not have massively wasteful job creation components already purely for stability maintenance. All I posited is &quot;maybe&quot; CCP will actually give a shit about long neglected interior development, they don&#x27;t have to, but if it&#x27;s establishment policy, business will fall in line. And if they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s manageable too. Those 600M &#x2F; 40% of the population can be bought off perpetually with 7% GDP, a few years of slow growth. Worst case they&#x27;ll languish as underclass to support the demographic transition.')
