If you&#x27;ve experienced something better than what exists today you constantly question why the industry hasn&#x27;t come to the sam realisation. It took Apple to really say, hey this is where mobile is going, here&#x27;s the iPhone, nothing else matters. I think right now we&#x27;re in the pre iPhone era where we&#x27;re still hand crafting this stuff.<p>Certain developer experiences are drastically improving. The frontend (as fast as it moves) now has the likes of Netlify and Vercel. It&#x27;s about saying, we just need to focus on frontend so give me the solution to that. I think backend is the same but it also highlights that there&#x27;s no defacto standard for backend development in the cloud. When that&#x27;s finally realised we&#x27;ll see solutions that cut away all the non-essentials. Someone mentioned Heroku and one click spin-up of dependencies. Great, be everything to everyone, that&#x27;s why Heroku is barely successful. Anything that was ever compelling was incredibly narrowly focused, opinionated and resonated heavily with devs.<p>My take. Go based microservices written using gRPC and consumed as HTTP&#x2F;JSON APIs. A platform that offers access to underlying primitives for building those types of services and a complete lifecycle for build, run and manage. Look at Twilio, look at Stripe, look at Segment, look at Sendgrid. These are the companies of the future built in the Cloud. For the backend, its simply about building APIs and having platforms that enable that. Which means you need auth, config, storage, pubsub, etc.<p>Here&#x27;s my piece <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1166d15eff2015e32a9ed7932401f8d16eace438&#x2F;docs&#x2F;blog&#x2F;_posts&#x2F;2020-11-05-micro-v3-aka-m3o.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1166d15eff2015e32a9ed793...</a><p>Here&#x27;s my effort <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m3o.com</a>')
