Like, AMD EPYC is so, so so, SOOO very good at it. It ain&#x27;t even funny.<p>Its like AMD started with the 4-core&#x2F;8-thread VM problem, and then designed a chip around that workload. Oh, but it can&#x27;t talk to the 5th core very efficiently?<p>No problem: VMs just don&#x27;t really talk to other customer&#x27;s cores that often anyway. So that&#x27;s not really a disadvantage at all.')
