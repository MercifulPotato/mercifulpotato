It seems like commonly used webservers (eg: nginx) pretty much insist on the private certificate being available effectively unencrypted to the web server process. On a traditional server that gets protected by user permissions, but inside Docker I am not sure how to achieve this. Is there a pattern people use to deploy certificates inside docker containers, or is the pattern &quot;don&#x27;t do that&quot;?')
