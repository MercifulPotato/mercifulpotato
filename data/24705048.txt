Google used to focus on puzzles so everyone followed. Eventually google thought to look at the efficacy and realized it was poor, so google focused much less on the puzzles and it&#x27;s taking a long time for folks to catch up. If an organization claims to respect evidence (as most large tech companies do) but have lackluster or nonexistent feedback loops around interviews, that hypocrisy is a red flag.<p>Take home tests like leetcode show a lack of respect and trust in the engineers, which I consider a bad work environment.<p>The high pay is usually because the organizations have tons of cash and are rarely indicative of interesting work (or the work is interesting but the product is discarded after completion). Most large, high paying, highly respected software companies have been stagnating for over a decade and sailing through on their monopolies. Then there are ethical considerations. At least that&#x27;s how I justify avoiding that world. Maybe I&#x27;m totally out of touch with reality.')
