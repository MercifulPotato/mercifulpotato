We went to some hipster place, hoping for something a bit healthier than McDonalds. They said there was a 40 minute wait (for takeout), so we ended up getting McDonalds after all.<p>There wasn&#x27;t anyone else waiting there, but I assume they had orders queued up from delivery services. Still, it seems a bit stupid to tell someone in your restaurant to wait - even though you are probably getting more profits from them.')
