It is easy to detect when a user is spoofing certain settings. As such, randomizing fingerprint data increases entropy, making your browser <i>more</i> unique, not less. There is a reason why the Tor browser works so hard to make sure every user has the same fingerprint, rather than randomizing it.<p>More on that here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arkenfox&#x2F;user.js&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;4.1-Extensions#small_orange_diamond-%EF%B8%8F-anti-fingerprinting-extensions-fk-no" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arkenfox&#x2F;user.js&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;4.1-Extensions#smal...</a>')
