The right wing is usually the first to try to expand these laws (as with Trump, maybe Peter Thiel&#x2F;Gawker). Libel is also a civil offence if it is one, which again, is extremely hard to prove.<p>Telling someone to commit murder for you is an example of speech <i>directly</i> inciting violent action, so no, that would be a criminal act.<p>It&#x27;s iffy whether telling someone they should commit suicide is free speech or not. Given that suicide is illegal in most societies, it would probably be illegal in the same way directly inciting violent action is, though the subtleties of the case matter.<p>No, lying under oath is a violation of a contract. That is outside the realm of free speech because you <i>willingly</i> and <i>knowingly</i> restrict your freedom of speech to testify under oath.<p>Psychologically abusing your children â€” again, a very fine line, with a very high burden of proof. Psychological abuse is almost never punishable unless it crosses over into the physical world, which can also include things like curtailing access to proper nutrition, etc. But at that point, it&#x27;s not a matter of free speech, but of child neglect.')
