Sure, most of the protests were peaceful. But when they weren&#x27;t, it was was very bad.<p>I was living in Downtown Chicago during the two major BLM protests that went violent last year. From my window, I saw people shooting out windows, starting fires, and looting. Even if it were a moot point to call 911, it didn&#x27;t matter because you&#x27;d get a busy signal if you tried calling. Businesses I frequented, including the coolest camera shop I&#x27;ve ever seen, were destroyed. In the days following these riots, it took 45 minutes to an hour to enter my neighborhood because of National Guard checkpoints. The grocery stores and pharmacies were closed because their windows were smashed in, they were looted, and they were generally smashed to hell. And local BLM organizers infamously defended their actions as the &quot;cry of the unheard&quot; and the looting as &quot;reparations.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve read accounts similar to my own from people in Seattle and Minneapolis.<p>I get that some opponents of BLM want to use these riots to discredit what the movement stands for. But BLM proponents shouldn&#x27;t try to gas light me and others who were victims of these demonstrations in defense. They were horrific. People died.')
