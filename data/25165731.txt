The bootloader loads from eMMC by default (and I believe comes preloaded with a distro based on what version you bought) unless there is a bootable (micro)SD card inserted. There&#x27;s a popular bootable SD card image for the PinePhone that exposes the eMMC over USB allowing flashing using `dd` or similar, which makes the whole process rather painless compared to the mess that is raspberry pi.')
