Your examples are true but a job interview doesn&#x27;t ask you to refamiliazire yourself with a codebase or a tech stack, it asks whether you&#x27;re familiar with algorithms, data structures and basic logic in any C-style language. That&#x27;s a way more general skill than the details of your old assembly codebase.<p>The article omits what the author&#x27;s experience is and when they say &quot;I&#x27;ve spent 15 years working as a developer and a strategist at leading investment banks&quot;, I suspect that their role was much heavier on the strategist side and only now are they realising that they haven&#x27;t been a developer for the past 15 years.')
