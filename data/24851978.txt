Not to mention how drivers need to adapt based on weather conditions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think it&#x27;s a bad example of cognitive performance. Reaction time is a type of cognitive performance. I am not sure how time taken to move was incorporated as a signal used in the methods in this paper but how quickly a person is able to play an optimal move is just as much of an indicator of cognitive performance as finding the right move is. Adrenalin control is also about being able to focus and getting in &quot;the zone&quot; and that is very much a proxy to cognitive performance. And to a certain degree, it&#x27;s very much not controllable at all on a conscious level, but you get the same &quot;rush&quot; in chess when you worry whether an opponent is going to see whatever tactic or strategy you&#x27;re pursuing in a game. And I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by extreme physicality, do you mean having to keep (arguable unhealthy) weight standards or do you mean the G-forces the driver undergoes?<p>In my opinion the cognitive load of racing at those high speeds is just as taxing as chess, maybe different learned skills are empathized. Other than extreme physicality, Bullet and Blitz chess require reaction time and adrenalin control too.')
