It seems to me like an argument from authority, which is ten thousand times worse than &quot;problematic peer review&quot; you claim. Define well-credentialed without peer review without a cycle please.<p>What is &quot;backing of a large-scale professional firm or institution&quot;? They already exist, they are called journals, which perform, surprise, peer reviews. Other alternatives you mention are probably private organizations, you seriously believe it&#x27;s less problematic than already less problematic journals? Much naivety in this argument.<p>Peer review has its problems, but as you&#x27;ve been told before, it&#x27;s the best we have come up with. Your proposals are much worse than what we have.')
