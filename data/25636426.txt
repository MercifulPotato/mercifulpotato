I can&#x27;t relate at all to people who say their sleep schedule is ruined, their work and personal life blends together, etc. I wfh lately and my work day is a hard 9 to 5 unless something out of the ordinary&#x27;s going on, I get 8 hours, work out most days, stick to my diet, etc. The less external constraints I have, the more I can create a routine that&#x27;s perfectly suited to myself.')
