It was something useful to the business of the company, without <i>being</i> the business of the company.<p>So what you describe seems to fit into that model.<p>That model seems to be less and less of open source contribution though. (I am not certain why). And I think that has a lot to do with current apparent crises in open source sustainability -- it was the model that worked, for a while, to produce and maintain lots of open source. I am not sure &quot;open source companies&quot; ever really have.')
