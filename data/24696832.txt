You need to apply it to a parent class, so that it picks the base font size (I&#x27;m not actually sure how this works but in practice it seems to base it on the child &lt;p&gt; tag).<p>I also don&#x27;t like the idea of &quot;reaching in&quot; and setting widths on all children. Feels like this could cause problems, especially on replaced elements like images&#x2F;videos. Not to mention that it just feels wrong when combined with a component architecture, where I might expect a &lt;Heading&gt; component to control its own destiny. In fairness, my solution also reaches in to apply a grid-column, but grid-column is a property that only makes sense when combined with a parent&#x27;s `display: grid`. So it bothers me less.<p>Enough people have brought this up that I wonder if I should have addressed it in the article... but then I realize, it&#x27;s not my job to argue against or &quot;disprove&quot; all alternative ideas. I&#x27;m not claiming that my way is the best way, I&#x27;m just sharing a cool trick I found :)')
