Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=[24956206], score=None, time=1604187597, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955904, text='&gt; <i>No, HP requested that Apple revoke the cert. Inexplicably, Apple complied with this unusual request.</i><p>Inexplicable!? Not at all.<p>Unusual? Nope.<p>While I certainly can&#x27;t claim to be familiar with Apple&#x27;s code signing program (it&#x27;s not relevant to me at all), pretty much any CA will revoke a certificate upon a request by the entity that possesses the private key.<p>In fact, in the &quot;Web PKI&quot;, a CA <i>MUST</i> do so (per the Baseline Requirements) -- within 24 hours! -- and, although I haven&#x27;t read them, I suspect the &quot;Code Signing&quot; BR&#x27;s have the same or a very similar requirement.<p>Now, you might say &quot;the Web PKI BR&#x27;s don&#x27;t apply here&quot; and you&#x27;d be correct, obviously. I&#x27;m not even sure if the &quot;Code Signing&quot; BR&#x27;s are relevant in this instance -- I don&#x27;t know whether this is some private, Apple-only program or something broader.<p>However, either way, I&#x27;ll bet you a beer that the &quot;rules&quot; -- whichever <i>are</i> in effect -- explicitly state that the issuer <i>will</i> revoke a certificate upon request by the subject.<p>By the way, this doesn&#x27;t even consider the case where a private key becomes compromised. In those instances, you&#x27;re pretty much always obligated to notify the issuer ASAP. That&#x27;s besides the point, though, as that&#x27;s not what happened here.<p>(Note: The generally accepted way to request revocation is to send to the CA a &quot;revocation request&quot; signed with the private key.)')
