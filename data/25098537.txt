A ghost kitchen that offers delivery could be undercut by a ghost kitchen offering pickup, but in general they&#x27;ll have a price advantage versus a retail restaurant with a more expensive location and more square footage.<p>The calculus is especially favorable toward ghost kitchens during pandemic-induced lockdowns, when people aren&#x27;t otherwise out and about. If I&#x27;m driving home from work and can easily stop by a restaurant for takeout, that doesn&#x27;t cost me much time. But if I&#x27;m at home 24&#x2F;7, then I factor in the time spent going to get food. That makes ghost kitchens with delivery somewhat more attractive.')
