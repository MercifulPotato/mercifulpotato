Just write a few lines of code and deploy from your laptop or your favourite CI&#x2F;CD solution. Best of all, you can run it on a 5USD VM or even a Raspberry Pi.<p>This is what a couple of people have said that tried it already:<p>&quot;Only been playing with it for a day now, but really amazing bit of kit...makes me wonder why not everyone is talking about it. It is to faas, as sqlite is to MySQL . You get 90% of the power, at 0.5% of the overhead&quot; - Nic Grobler<p>&quot;Once you have deployed faasd, it&#x27;s one command to push your function into production. From there it&#x27;s up to you what you like to build. It builds the container, publishes, and deploys your function code ready-to-use in seconds.&quot; - Peter Thaleikis<p>Hope you like it and happy to answer questions on Twitter&#x2F;Slack for folk who are working through the labs and examples.')
