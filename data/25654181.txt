Item(by='nemothekid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609901174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652843, text='&gt;<i>Investors should be blocked from recovering losses and victims should be compensated.</i><p>I think Levine&#x27;s take is a bit more nuanced. It&#x27;s not like shareholders are taking up the case for some altruistic reasons, it&#x27;s just that for <i>lawyers</i> it&#x27;s an easier case to litigate. To paraphrase Matt, if you had to sue the CEO, on behalf of victims, for sexual harassment, as a lawyer you would have to prove  the damages by showing that maybe the CEO had a pattern, that the victim was actually traumatized and not just &quot;regretting it&quot; and any other of mountain of historically charged counter claims of sexual harassment. But securities fraud, all the lawyer has to do is point to a newspaper article about how the news came out and the stock went down.<p>In other words, investors being blocked from being compensated wouldn&#x27;t solve the issue - it would just remove a possible disincentive for actors to act improperly.')
