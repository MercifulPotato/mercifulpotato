We&#x27;ve seen what happens when a minority fringe extremist group is able to take control of a country, on many occasions now. I in good conscience can&#x27;t see a world where if we failed to stop it earlier I would be able to sleep with the consequences because we let them talk it out in protection of freedom of speech purism. Would it be right to let that happen and then spend years and lives having to re capture our government?<p>Obviously these are all hypothetical scenarios and questions, but if the mob a few days ago had any aim and organization they would have clearly seized our government and they&#x27;re being whipped into a frenzy by things like Parler to try it again on the 17th so I&#x27;m told.')
