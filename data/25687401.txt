For example, when we read that something happened around 11 AM, we know that it&#x27;s probably daylight time, but if we allow for drift, then we can&#x27;t make that assumption anymore for certain timescales. If the error is small, we can probably deal with it the same way most people understand that dollars in 1950 don&#x27;t have the same value as dollars today.')
