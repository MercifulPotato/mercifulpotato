He decided to give a $15 amazon one a try and he said it works &quot;just as good&quot; as the Elgato one. So I then bought my own $15 one (having never used Elgato before) and I can also say that it does the job.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to further qualify it, you expect it to convert HDMI into USB and it does it.
