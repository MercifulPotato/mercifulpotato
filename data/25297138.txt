However I can&#x27;t help but note that people who study the effects of race and gender tend to bring race&#x2F;gender into anything and everything, because well, that&#x27;s their job. If your response is that race and gender should be brought into only the areas where race and gender are relevant, I&#x27;d respond that the prevailing opinion among gender and race scholars is that gender&#x2F;race is relevant everywhere.')
