Instead they cower behind technically accurate phrases like &quot;there&#x27;s no evidence 5G can cause Covid&quot;.<p>We would have to throw out vast amounts of science to make that true. It&#x27;s basically magic, but scientists and the media tend to be so cautious that to some people it may seem that there is genuine doubt.<p>I understand that we don&#x27;t want scientists and the media being overconfident - saying &quot;there&#x27;s no evidence the covid vaccines have any significant side-effects&quot; is fine, you couldn&#x27;t say &quot;there is no conceivable way this vaccine could cause a problem&quot;. But I do think the distinction between science and fantasy should be made clearer.')
