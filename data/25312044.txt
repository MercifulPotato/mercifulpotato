Bad abstractions are tabula rasa models that don&#x27;t acknowledge the nature of the operations that the hardware is doing.<p>- &quot;var id: type&quot; syntax is both ugly and impractical.<p>- &quot;inconsequential syntax details&quot; like my last opinion are actually important aspects of a programming language and not just bike-shedding.<p>- If a programming language includes a package manager that points to a repository by default, then it&#x27;s a not a serious programming language.<p>- Drivers don&#x27;t belong in the kernel.
