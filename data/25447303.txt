Facebook continues to lower the bar on ethical behavior, it is built on a foundation of mass surveillance for profit, and it continues to deny, deflect, and obfuscate whenever it is caught again doing something immoral.  Most users stayed due to lack of a good alternative, not because they felt any affinity for Facebook.  The continued decline of Facebook the brand and the fact that legal and legislative corrections to their behavior are gaining traction is a reasonably good indicator that users are, in fact, not happy with it.')
