I doubt many Apple users have the foresight of a Stallman to see where their environment is headed.<p>There is money in creating apps for Apple systems, but you are giving up a lot in exchange.<p>Some developers use it for convenience but I would not say it is widespread and most are fundamentally opposed to use a mac.<p>Our advertising department is the only one with macs. Sadly, we still support Apple because every sales rep gets the whole suite. iPhones and iPad Pros (because the others are too small and you cannot work with them... what a new revelation...), that is a few thousand bucks for every employee that Apple gets.
