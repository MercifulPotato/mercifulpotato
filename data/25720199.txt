More pointedly, the simple act of existing in a space as a minority invites what you&#x27;d call &quot;politics&quot;.<p>If your existence has never felt &quot;political&quot; to you, cherish that. I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of many slurs and the occasional attempted assault, and I&#x27;ve watched politicians and pundits debate on cable TV whether I deserve to have the same rights afforded anyone else. I didn&#x27;t choose to exist &quot;politically&quot;, but I sure do notice when folks don&#x27;t speak up against challenges to my existence because they view it as &quot;politics&quot; and therefore not worth their attention.')
