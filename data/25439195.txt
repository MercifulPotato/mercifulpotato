Was, this, though, because they used fairly simple snippets of Python, a programming language which is not very mathematical in its notation? Would a different result have been obtained had they asked the subjects to reason about a multithreaded C++ program which copiously used autoincrementing pointers and polymorphism?<p>And, can personal preferences in programming languages be partly down to which parts of their brains people like to use?<p>And, as the problems were simple, the study doesn&#x27;t say anything about <i>expert</i> programmers. Is the often-quoted 10Ã— difference between the best and worst programmers associated with the best ones <i>also</i> involving the mathematical and linguistic parts of their brains?<p>It&#x27;s probably not practical to measure programming at a high level (or indeed violin playing at a high level) inside an MRI machine, given the cramped and noisy conditions, so we may not have answers to the interesting questions raised any time soon.')
