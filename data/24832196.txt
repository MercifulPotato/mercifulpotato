By having the source code, a lot more people will be able to make sense of it and figure out how to change (or even fork) the original software. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty much a corollary.<p>On the other hand, I think free software probably tend to break backward compatibility less mainly because it moves at a slower pace (be it because it&#x27;s designed by committee or just lack resources). With software as a service in special, breaking changes is sort of the industry norm. So, there&#x27;s also that cultural component to it. But it&#x27;s difficult to measure the rate at which free software introduces breaking changes vs proprietary software.')
