This is supposed to be done in front of an observer from both parties so security checks like signature matching can be performed, which was <i>not</i> done as evidenced in the Fulton county video footage.<p>Mail-in voting creates the opportunity for mass manufacturing ballots as well as hijacking ballot adjudication processes, <i>especially</i> if you block bipartisan observation to circumvent security checks put in place specifically to mitigate these types of fraud.<p>And &quot;hand recounts&quot; would not uncover these issues. [1]<p>You don&#x27;t need &quot;widespread&quot; fraud to overturn an election. Biden only won 16% of counties. Only a few key counties need to be targeted to flip a national election.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;billmoyers.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;georgias-hand-count-of-2020-ballots-was-no-risk-limiting-audit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;billmoyers.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;georgias-hand-count-of-2020-bal...</a>')
