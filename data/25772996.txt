Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=[25773015], score=None, time=1610606778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772504, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to say that &quot;boneheaded management cutting corners&quot; by prioritizing the needs of other internal teams over the needs of the user is in some sense them &quot;wanting to own your Mac&quot;. Although that is a dramatic way to describe it.<p>It’s beyond dramatic. It’s absurd. I’ve worked on so many projects and deadlines that have had to make such decisions, even decisions that eventually fell to me. In numerous cases I could cast aspersions on some of the management motivations, but even so I couldn’t describe it as them trying to own the product they’d sold to customers. In most cases it was a balance of market pressure and resources. In the cases where I’ve had to make those calls, it’s been balancing market pressure specifically so I had more room to satisfy users.<p>I don’t think Apple engineers are immune to this. They have to ship big things on a tight deadline. When they can’t satisfy everyone they have to make choices. Sometimes they don’t make the best choices.<p>Hopefully you don’t have these weights in your job. But lots of us do.')
