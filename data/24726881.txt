It&#x27;s truly insane that regulatory bodies are using public utility laws from 1934 - before even the mass adoption of television - to create the rules that govern the internet.<p>I have no issue with updating (or even replacing) the Communications Act of 1934, since much has changed in the last 24 years (the last time the act was updated).<p>But claiming that the Communications Act of 1934[0] originally enacted in 1934, is a public utility law that&#x27;s over 80 years old isn&#x27;t accurate.<p>In fact, has been <i>repeatedly</i> modified and updated, the last time in 1996.<p>You could certainly argue that 1996 was a long time ago too (almost 25 years), but arguing that the law applied was, in its entirety, 80+ years old is uninformed at best and disingenuous at worst.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Communications_Commission#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Federal_Communications_Commiss...</a><p>Edit: Fixed typos.')
