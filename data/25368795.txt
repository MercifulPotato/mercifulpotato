Item(by='abernard1', descendants=None, kids=[25369117, 25369144], score=None, time=1607566789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368752, text='What are these &quot;huge incentives&quot; you speak of?<p>What states were swung by a small margin &quot;administered by Republicans&quot; (political parties don&#x27;t administer elections).<p>Most of the arguments revolve around mainly 4 metro areas: Detroit, Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Philadelphia (with a little Pittsburgh thrown in).  These 4 metro areas alone could decide the election via electoral math.  It is cliche that these areas have had voter fraud.  It&#x27;s been going on for a century.  People have been convicted for these crimes in these areas regularly.  For people to act like _this election_, that kind of talk is unreasonable, well, I have some not nice words to say to those people.<p>Given the extraordinary circumstances, and the narrow margins of victories, people bringing up these facts is reasonable.  Youtube allows holocaust denial, and I&#x27;m supposed to believe that people claiming inner city fraud (only when it&#x27;s claimed in the U.S. btw) is &quot;a threat to democracy&quot;.<p>Please.')
