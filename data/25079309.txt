I have a work Mac that came with it and it only kernel panics about once a week. Which is pretty good for Apple these days.<p>I still have a bunch of Macs at home running El Capitan and Sierra because they work and because I don&#x27;t have two weeks to screw around moving each one over to Catalina. When they die I&#x27;ll probably just move the whole house over to Linux because Apple has so completely lost the plot on what personal computing means.')
