And the Dark Ages wiki you link talks about how the term fell out of use amongst historians for being inaccurate.<p>To quote:<p><i>&quot;Science historian David C. Lindberg criticised the public use of &#x27;dark ages&#x27; to describe the entire Middle Ages as &quot;a time of ignorance, barbarism and superstition&quot; for which &quot;blame is most often laid at the feet of the Christian church, which is alleged to have placed religious authority over personal experience and rational activity&quot;.[52] Historian of science Edward Grant writes that &quot;If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the Age of Reason, they were made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities&quot;.[53] Furthermore, Lindberg says that, contrary to common belief, &quot;the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led&quot;.[54] Because of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire due to the Migration Period a lot of classical Greek texts were lost there, but part of these texts survived and they were studied widely in the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Caliphate. Around the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the High Middle Ages stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored after the invasions of Vikings and Magyars; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. And the rejuvenation of science and scholarship in the West was due in large part to the new availability of Latin translations of Aristotle.[55]&quot;</i><p>ETA: Also didn&#x27;t realise you&#x27;re the same person I replied to below!')
