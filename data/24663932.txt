You fight really dirty to get to the top. It fails no matter what you do, and you end up becoming a monster. Everyone around you dies, you see your grandkids OD, and you look back thinking if the entire thing was just one big sting by the police. Better to live poor. Much more fun.<p>And guys, $500,000? What is this? 1820? In the 1990s, I was told by VC, &quot;don&#x27;t call me again unless you are over a billion. That&#x27;s our minimum.&quot; And that was after a South African railroad municipal bond issue.<p>-------------------------------------------------<p>The article assumes one rate for inflation. Sure, the cost of &quot;just surviving&quot; goes down. Everyone then dies in debt. No one has children unless it&#x27;s a mistake or agrarian immigration. Everyone spends two dollars just to earn one.<p>The cost for not being told what to do all your life, or calling out others&#x27; mistakes, or having a say in what gets done and how goes to infinity. No capability as everyone just tears each other apart.<p>20% of America are retirees. 54% of children are from broken homes. The path to walk creates the quality of leadership.<p>Past generations have a cynical point. It&#x27;s easy to get hired. Just get in shape, put on a suit, be able to fog a mirror skills wise, and, oh yeah, turn your back on everyone who got you there. If the company wants you to be in Ramadi tomorrow, be in Ramadi tomorrow. The old way goes away for a reason. Materialism and celebrity only limits the violence.<p>Fools show themselves to the world, like a chained baying sheep. My job interview is to spit what I devoured at the windshield, look inside and get angry at the blinding light. Let out some horrible roar like a hurricane, and start tearing everything up. Nothing is more intimidating than the lair of some sleeping monster and its absence. I&#x27;m happy to shun the world.')
