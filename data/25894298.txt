Item(by='naniwaduni', descendants=None, kids=[25894562], score=None, time=1611512541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894075, text='&gt; To implement any of the above, while studiously avoiding anything making explicit the fact that the interpretation of the bytes as a sequence of glyphs is an intended, necessary and separable step on the way, would be bizzarre and tendentious.<p>Codepoints are not glyphs. Nor are any useful operations generally performed on glyphs in the first place. Almost all interpretable operations you might want to do are better conceived of as operating as <i>substrings of arbitrary length</i>, rather than glyphs, and byte substrings do this better than unicode codepoint sequences anyway.<p>So I contest the position that interpreting bytes as a glyph sequence is a viable step at all.')
