While that&#x27;s the obvious use-case for an &quot;FPGA in CPU&quot; concept, in the real world, IO is a pretty important part of many non-cryptocurrency FPGA applications, whether you&#x27;re just counting edges on some input like an encoder, providing a highly time-sensitive output signal, such as for an SDR, or implementing some custom serial protocol.')
