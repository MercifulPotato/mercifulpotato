It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s a complicated situation around censorship and moderation, and the national conversation turning to this area doesn&#x27;t make the lines any clearer, but Mozilla certainly doesn&#x27;t deserve the level of criticism I&#x27;ve observed in some forums for this statement. If you feel as sure as I do, and would like to support their cause, it&#x27;s more effective to donate what you can to the Mozilla Foundation than to further engage with the narratives these threads imply.')
