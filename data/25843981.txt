I&#x27;m being genuine here.<p>If those boxes are anonymous, why do they know who sent it?<p>What were the grievances? Why would they get in trouble?<p>What did the district committee enforces actually do?<p>How long ago was this?<p>&gt; If Beijing ever cared about freedom from poverty, China wouldn&#x27;t be so poor as a result of its actions.<p>&gt; Then, why it is doing it?<p>That&#x27;s a long list, let me go into a few.<p>North Korea is not an example of China exporting its governance model. If North Korea <i>actually</i> follows China&#x27;s governance model it would be far more open than it is today. What happened is that during the Vietnam war, China allied with North Korea to prevent the Americans from setting up a base at the Chinese border. That&#x27;s not &quot;exporting governance model&quot;.<p>Naxalite: where&#x27;s the evidence that this insurgency is supported by China. Just because they&#x27;re Maoist doesn&#x27;t mean China did this.<p>What do African countries have to do with this? Are you talking about this &quot;debt trap&quot; thing? China doesn&#x27;t want African countries to default. China has even provided debt relief this year, without asking for anything in return.<p>China hasn&#x27;t fired a bullet across its borders for over 30 years. That&#x27;s more than I can say about the current hegemon.')
