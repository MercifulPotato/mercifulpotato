Jesus fucking Christ, Google. If I say &quot;Play my My Likes playlist&quot; something random happens.<p>Do these guys even use their product? I&#x27;m just glad this album didn&#x27;t come out before the forced migration.<p>EDIT: Okay, I went to verify it and this has to be the best instance of massive PEBKAC plus some UX donkeyness. The auto playlist is called &quot;<i>Your</i> Likes&quot; so I can get the Assistant to do the right thing by telling her to play her likes (Ok Google, play your likes). What the fuck man. But fine. At least I got it working.<p>I&#x27;ve suffered with this for months and now I find a solution in the few minutes after posting this.')
