The question is, do you want to change keyboard cursor context from &quot;next character&quot; mid-sentence from LTR to RTL? If you do that, the cursor will get &quot;stuck&quot; at the word boundary where next and previous mean the same thing (left is both &quot;prev&quot; for LTR and &quot;next&quot; for RTL - how should the computer interpret that?)')
