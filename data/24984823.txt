Item(by='reaperducer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604442964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24984681, text='I use a printer less and less, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever not need one in my lifetime.<p><i>I haven&#x27;t printed anything in years, and don&#x27;t think I ever will again.</i><p>So between today and the end of your life, you will never sell anything online?  Or never for the rest of your life send something you already own to someone else?  You need a printer to print shipping labels, unless you take the item somewhere to be professionally packed and shipped.<p>I moved recently, and printed out the USPS form to change my address so that I didn&#x27;t have to pay the fee to do it online.<p>I also had to print and mail a form to get a ballot mailed to me for today&#x27;s election. In my state, this can only be done with a signed document, not online.<p>I don&#x27;t limit my life experience to things that are online, so about once a month I use a printer to print envelopes to send checks for things that I buy over the phone.  Sent one out today to a store in Seattle that deals in a specialty good my wife likes, but has no online presence.<p>According to the New York Times, there are top-end restaurants that only take reservations by letter.  Not via an app.  Not online.  Not even via telephone.<p>I know interesting people who live in places beyond the reach of the internet.  I write letters to them a couple of times a year.<p>Four of the last six property purchases I&#x27;ve made in the last few years involved printing and mailing forms.  Not every government office in every county in every state is online.  And very often legal forms have to be notarized.  You can&#x27;t do that online.<p>If you choose to live a simple life, you may never need a printer.  If you choose to do more, then it&#x27;s good to have one stashed away for when you need it.')
