Item(by='Aardappel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608654624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25507812, text='- You can see some of the graphics features here, under &quot;Engine&quot;: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;strlen.com&#x2F;lobster&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;strlen.com&#x2F;lobster&#x2F;</a> (and new features are being added as needed).<p>- Yes, there&#x27;s support for &quot;Dear IMGUI&quot; (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wvo&#x2F;status&#x2F;1092948776388485121" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;wvo&#x2F;status&#x2F;1092948776388485121</a>) and there&#x27;s also a simple GUI system written entirely in Lobster specifically for game menus&#x2F;UI and such.<p>- Speed is still being improved, but in its compile-to-C++ mode it should be a lot closer in performance to C than Python :) It also has a &quot;JIT&quot; mode that goes thru libtcc, but is 3x slower. It&#x27;s very fast as a game scripting language, but it does not compete with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust as an &quot;engine&quot; language just yet, you are still expected to write the absolutely most performance sensitive functions in C++ (as is the case with a lot of built-in functionality). The language has the potential to compete directly with C++ at some point, but getting there will be a lot of work.')
