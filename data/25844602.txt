Item(by='GolDDranks', descendants=None, kids=[25844947, 25844883, 25844919, 25845913, 25845742, 25845476], score=None, time=1611137367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833557, text='&gt; It really shows how conditioned an entire community can be when they find the statement “given a list x, the first item in x is x[1], the second item in x is x[2]” to be unnatural.<p>It really shows how conditioned the mankind is that they call the &quot;0th&quot; ordinal number by the name &quot;first&quot;. We have never moved past the phase where the concept of &quot;zero&quot; was heretic.<p>Here + offset makes SO much sense. I think we should move to use it in other contexts too. &quot;0 steps from the start of an ordered list&quot; &quot;1 step from the start of an ordered list&quot; etc.<p>At the moment we are using two different &quot;scales&quot; for measuring things and labeling orders. We could as well use the letters &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; for the latter, and it wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. Hindsight is 20&#x2F;20, but it&#x27;s just a confusing mishap that we are using &quot;numbers&quot; and &quot;numbers + 1&quot; for the two purposes, where the second one could be expressed just as another &quot;measurement&quot;, and we could get rid of the confusing &quot;numbers + 1&quot; scale.')
