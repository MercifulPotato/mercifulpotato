You can fill in the likely EC votes and the chances don&#x27;t really change all that much. I mean, CA going Blue is not a surprise.<p>But when you fill in PA or FL for Donny, then the whole race changes. If FL or PA go Red, then Donny has ~1&#x2F;3 chance, if one goes Blue, then it&#x27;s 1&#x2F;100 [0].<p>PA is unlikely to be called on election night. But FL is very likely to be called. So that is the one to watch. Just like every other election, really.<p>It&#x27;s a great tool and I&#x27;d totally suggest spending some time with it. Kudos to the team that built it!<p>[0] Note that these models are updated all the time by 538 as new polls roll in.')
