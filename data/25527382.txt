I am glad to finally get this off my chest.\n</code></pre>\nFar from me to defend the big G - they&#x27;re big and old enough to stand for themselves - but it&#x27;s interesting how Veni tought was convenient to share her story right now while the Timni Gebru affair is simmering.<p>Let&#x27;s just be forward here, Veni, you were too greedy, obnoxious and extremist and they didn&#x27;t want to work with someone like you. And you got angry because your demands were not met.<p><pre><code>  I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the idea of just getting credit. I either wanted to work on it or I wanted them to use what I had built already. \n\n  Anyway, I responded with my hourly rate. I never heard back. Then I forgot about it.\n</code></pre>\nAnd not even mentioning the fact that you thought it was a good idea to ask for compensation just for having a simple conversation.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t feel any shred of sympathy for <i>anyone</i> who behaves like this.')
