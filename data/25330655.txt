If populations take no action whatsoever to curb spread, somewhere between 1&#x2F;3 and 2&#x2F;3 of people will likely be infected. If we multiply that by the population of the world, we get something on the order of 15â€“50 million people dead. Not as bad as the 1918 flu, but worse than any pandemic since, roughly comparable to the entire death toll of AIDS over the past 40 years.<p>Thankfully all around the world people have taken significant steps to slow the virus down, and so hopefully the vaccine will arrive in time to save tens of millions.<p>I am happy to agree with you that humanity could do a whole lot more to prevent deaths from infectious diseases, including tuberculosis.')
