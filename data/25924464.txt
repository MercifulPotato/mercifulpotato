It seems we want YT to both provide editorial oversight so that e.g. mass murderers are not given a platform to flaunt their crimes, and to provide a platform where anyone can start livestreaming at any time, anywhere.<p>The way broadcast media handles this is they have an editorial policy that is applied by humans producing a single stream at a time. There are multiple people monitoring everything a news station puts out at all times. It&#x27;s kind of hard to see that happening with YouTube.<p>So while I think YT policies can probably be improved, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to be a great environment for content that depends on editorial staff to exist. Any moderation policy YT takes has to be applied to what must be billions of videos now. Complaining that they&#x27;re not doing what broadcast media does feels like going to McDonalds and complaining that the chicken McNuggets aren&#x27;t made of filet. It&#x27;s part of the product, not a kink that can be ironed out.')
