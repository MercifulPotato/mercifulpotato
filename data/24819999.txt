Especially individuals in education, considering we have millions of school age children.<p>Something else that annoys me in media in general is hyperfocusing on government liabilities (pensions, projects where existing bonds aren&#x27;t sufficient, etc) as unfunded, while ignoring unpaid individual liabilities (credit card debt, car loans, student loans, mortgages, etc), that are also unfunded. I think we should start referring to all future financial obligations as unfunded liabilities, unless there&#x27;s already a framework in place to ensure future funds are available for them.<p>I especially look forward to Tom Selleck saying that reverse mortgages aren&#x27;t a way for the bank to take your house, they&#x27;re just a way for the bank to make your unfunded liabilities worse. :)')
