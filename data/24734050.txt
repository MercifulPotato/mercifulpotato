Just entertaining&#x2F;fluff&#x2F;interesting&#x2F;whatever.<p>But closer to an election, they can be gamed and weaponized for harm -- Russia can activate botnets, fake accounts, etc. and lies spread like wildfire.<p>So it&#x27;s not about whether the recommendation engine is good or bad -- it <i>works</i>. The point is that close to an election, bad actors <i>weaponize</i> it 1,000x more or more often than they do the rest of the time, so they&#x27;re turning it off. When it&#x27;s not being weaponized so much, they can keep it on.<p>It&#x27;s like paying for a DDoS protection layer at times when you know your site is likely to be attacked, but not using it the rest of the time.')
