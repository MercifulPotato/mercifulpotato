But it&#x27;s not really the Russians have better science. But rocky movies are about the underdog. You can&#x27;t have 3 time world champ rocky be an underdog unless it&#x27;s one dude vs a country. AKA rocky 4. That at the constant american beef at the time w the olympics that the Russians were using unholy science like doping and roids in their state run sports programs, while the Americans were all &#x27;real scrapy amateurs&#x27;. Then of course the dream team.<p>I do find it funny you reference movies almost entirely from the 90s in you conclusion, movies over 20 years old.')
