As I recall how Micro-Soft got a contract from IBM to supply an OS for their low-spec personal computer. They didn&#x27;t have one, so Micro-Soft bought-in 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, using the IBM money to pay for it up front. Rather than buy it outright, Microsoft persuaded IBM to license a copy of DOS for each IBM PC sold. Later on with ‘Columbia Data Products’, Compaq and other, figuring-out how to clone the PC without paying IBM, Microsoft was more than happy to license DOS to them.<p>“Columbia_Data_Products”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Columbia_Data_Products" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Columbia_Data_Products</a><p>“Joint Development Agreement between International Business Machines Corporation and Microsoft Corporation”<p>“With respect to Phase I Output, to the extent such joint ownership is prevented by operation of law each party hereby grants to the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide and irrevocable license to use, execute, perform, reproduce, prepare or have prepared Derivative Works based upon display, and sell, lease or otherwize transfer of posession or ownership of copies of, the Phase I Output and&#x2F;or any Derivative Works thereof.”<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;edge-op.org&#x2F;iowa&#x2F;www.iowaconsumercase.org&#x2F;011607&#x2F;0000&#x2F;PX00004.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;edge-op.org&#x2F;iowa&#x2F;www.iowaconsumercase.org&#x2F;011607&#x2F;0000...</a>')
