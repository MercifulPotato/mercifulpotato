It is fine, IMO, to work on projects for my employer and privately, outside of work, to apply efforts to lessen and eventually remove the need for such work. But those efforts are my own business and not the business of any other person at the company. If the conflict of interest becomes too great, then I feel the company is within their right to reassign or terminate, or more likely, for me to remove myself from the conflict.<p>But, I also have a strong tendency and desire to leave my politics at home. I’m also careful to choose who I work for.')
