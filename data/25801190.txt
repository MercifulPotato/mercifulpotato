For example I tried to set a folder with several thousand pieces of media and a few other files to auto upload and it&#x27;d keep triggering &quot;nextcloud is not responding&quot; pop-ups on my phone. It&#x27;s ~6 gigs but didn&#x27;t complete for two painful days. It was almost impossible to open the app cos it&#x27;s intensely trying to sync that folder.<p>I thought I managed to cancel it yesterday and remove the folder from auto uploads but today it&#x27;s trying to upload the contents of that folder again even though I can&#x27;t find it in my auto upload setup.<p>I&#x27;ve also felt it misses instant uploads once in a while but never investigated to prove that or the circumstances so take that with a grain of salt')
