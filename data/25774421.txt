Two crossing light beams will pass right through each other without much happening while two electron beams will interact. But this is because electrons are charged and photons are not. On careful inspection and with high energy photons one would also notice an interaction between two light beams due to photon photon scattering [1]. But one could reasonably call this a kind of distraction due to different charges of different particles. Ignoring those makes photons and electrons behave identical in respect to the phenomena discussed in the article.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-photon_physics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-photon_physics</a>')
