The point of the convenience was - I thought - that you just swipe. Couldn&#x27;t a thief?<p>Also how do you do anything if your phone is gone - travel, call, let the bank know, buy a new phone, let your partner know you&#x27;re in trouble, anything?<p>Also how much is you phone worth? A quick look suggests ~£1000 for an iphone 11, although I guess that&#x27;s needlessly high, but you&#x27;re carrying a large cash equivalent, highly attractive? I&#x27;ve never had £500 or the equivalent in my pocket, ever (max ~£350 for 1&#x2F;2 hour IIRC).<p>And cash doesn&#x27;t break if you sit on it.
