Whoever commissioned&#x2F;owns the container could decide to put a tracker in, but to my knowledge (which is from &quot;hobby curiosity&quot;) it&#x27;s extremely rare.<p>Also, the GPS trackers would stop working very quickly if the containers sink.  Regular bulk shipping containers aren&#x27;t waterproof so I&#x27;d expect the majority of the lost containers to be at the bottom of the ocean by now - at that point the trackers would neither receive GPS nor be able to send anything really.
