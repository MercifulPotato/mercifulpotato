One of the things that I got tired of was having to run updates on Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. So I decided to install Debian Stable with the Nix package manager as a sort of Homebrew replacement. This way I don&#x27;t have to worry about my distro breaking, while I can get new stuff that is atomic and easy to remove when I want. I am curious if any Guix users do something similar.')
