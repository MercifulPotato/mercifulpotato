Item(by='Dagger2', descendants=None, kids=[25001771], score=None, time=1604603757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000344, text='I&#x27;ve found v6 is easier to deal with in practice.<p>When you&#x27;ve got a host whose address is 192.168.2.42, but it shows up as 203.0.113.8 to internet hosts, but you had an RFC1918 clash on a few of your acquisitions so some parts of your company access it via 192.168.202.42 and other parts need 172.16.1.42 and your VPN sometimes can&#x27;t reach it because some home users use 192.168.2.0&#x2F;24... how is that easier than &quot;the IP is 2001:db8:113:2::42&quot;?<p>&gt; I still do not have an intuitive feel for how many addresses or what address range a CIDR block contains<p>This is just lack of practice, not an issue with v6. Also, v6 subnets are basically always &#x2F;64, so the answer to the question of how many addresses are in them is always <i>who cares it&#x27;s enough</i>. I find v4 and its fiddly &#x2F;27s and &#x2F;21s much more of a pain (partly because, yes, I&#x27;m out of practice dealing with them).<p>Same deal with knowing the prefixes. &#x27;fd&#x27; is &quot;RFC1918&quot;, &#x27;fe&#x27; is link-local, &#x27;ff&#x27; is multicast. This isn&#x27;t hard stuff.<p>&gt; 192.x.x.x are common prefix to local networks<p>This is 99.6% wrong. I guess v4 isn&#x27;t _that_ simple, huh?')
