There may be at least 8 classes&#x2F;meetings at a time. It should be on my website interface and shouldn&#x27;t redirect to the zoom website for meetings. I want these integration done by PHP because whole the website is developed on PHP and there would some data stored in the database regards to meetings&#x2F;classes. I searched a lot for this on google but couldn&#x27;t find a way to do it in PHP. I think it may be something easy for JavaScript developers as mostly guidance&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;ways for JavaScript&#x2F;nodejs. But I&#x27;m unable to find a way for that in PHP.<p>Maybe there would another way rather than using zoom to achieve the goal.<p>I&#x27;m just posting here to get the idea if that is possible in PHP or someone has done it in past and provide me some information&#x2F;help regards to this project.<p>Any suggestions and help would be highly appreciatable.<p>Thanks!!!')
