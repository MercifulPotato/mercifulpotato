That form-factor has a literal thousand+ integrators building for it, and also in many segments (e.g. gaming) people build their own to save even more money. Those <i>aren&#x27;t</i> the sort of people who are easily swayed to pay an extra $200+ of pure margin in exchange for &quot;integration&quot; and Genius Bar &quot;serviceability&quot; (the latter of which they could mostly do themselves given the form-factor.)')
