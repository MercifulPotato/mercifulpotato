What I&#x27;m asking for is a feature where I set a hard limit of $100 and that&#x27;s the most I get billed - if my account accidently uses $5000 of resources before Google reconciles the usage with my budget then Google <i>automatically</i> waives the additional $4900 and <i>then</i> limits my account in some way until the problem is rectified.<p>Practically every time these blog posts come up they end with the provider refunding the costs. I just want that refund to be a feature.')
