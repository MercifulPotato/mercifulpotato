Models are trained, stored and invoked via stored procedures which call R or Python code (SQL is not the best language to do ML in).<p>The advantage of this approach is that data is never moved outside SQL Server or over the network. The downside I guess is that you need a pretty beefy machine to run the database server.<p>For uncomplicated ML applications, say a logistic regression over a few columns, this is a relatively easy approach to get results quickly. To me, the actual use cases of in-db ML are limited, but the one case in which I can imagine it being useful is performing live ML on a SQL view that has constantly evolving data -- you save ETL roundtrips to an external ML algorithm.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sql&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;sql-server-machine-learning-services?view=sql-server-ver15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;sql&#x2F;machine-learning&#x2F;sql-se...</a>')
