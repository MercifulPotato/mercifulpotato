Black-scholes, for example, applied calculus with an underlying no-arbitrage assumption to create a thriving market in option pricing, by giving traders a mechanism to reduce risk and thereby reduce bid offer spreads. Same in fixed income, mortgage, and credit market assets over the years.<p>The problem with predicting absolute levels, is that there is a game theoretic aspect which undermines any mathematical trading strategy as soon as it is public. optimal game theory trading strategies don’t produce great results, and they are relatively trivial to identify. Instead strong profits in market long&#x2F;short macro positions are mostly created by information advantages, which don’t really make for interesting Kaggle competitions. For example, big profits in macro trading have historically been consistently achieved by front running customer orders, by building timing advantages on top of trading infrastructure, by funding research analysts that inspect operations on the ground, by lobbying for regulations that change market directions and so on.<p>It’s very hard to tell if a best performing hedge funds that doesn’t have an unfair advantage, that declares its only using quantitative strategies, is in fact just a statistical anomaly with a hollow narrative.')
