It just makes the applicant look inexperienced.<p>I am a single data point, but also someone who&#x27;s interviewed 100+ developers across multiple companies, and from my perspective, after reading your article, you don&#x27;t seem to be a person to listen to, and seem to be contributing to the already large amount of bad resume-writing advice online.<p>The main thing I have a feeling you misunderstand (the article makes me think you&#x27;re not an actual industry professional) is that in most cases, to get hired, developers don&#x27;t need to impress some technically-illiterate business person. The goal isn&#x27;t to make some business guy swoon over how you managed to improve a metric a business person would typically care about. Instead, developers need to impress some very technical person, often multiple such people, to get hired. A resume should be written accordingly, and the goal is to make yourself appear to be a mature professional in the eyes of other mature professionals. You don&#x27;t need to dumb things down - you don&#x27;t need to do it for their sake, so dumbing things down just makes you look less knowledgeable or like you&#x27;re trying to bullshit your way through things.<p>If I see &quot;increased user engagement by rewriting into react&quot; on a resume that just makes the candidate look like they&#x27;re desperately digging for things to put in their resume that will make them look good.')
