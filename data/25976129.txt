At the time, some people were claiming that the rioting was the work of alt-right agents provocateurs, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have panned out. (Cf. the assertions that the Capitol rioters were antifa agents provocateurs.)<p>It&#x27;s also not a good argument given there were loud voices claiming to speak for BLM that were justifying the rioting and looting. Reparations, smashing the racist capitalist system, etc. Maybe they don&#x27;t represent the movement as a whole, but if so, the movement had lost its voice to extremists by that point.<p>An example of this kind of thing, posted by a friend who took part in BLM protests, in response to a status update I made: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EnCI4_9W4AAAxDf.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EnCI4_9W4AAAxDf.jpg</a><p>Bad actors doing embarrassing or destructive things is a real problem for ad-hoc decentralized movements. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m careful to not hold the acts of individuals against a movement unless said acts are the whole point of the movement. But at the same time, &quot;Black Lives Matter riots of 2020&quot; is the most accurate label for the events in question that I can think of.')
