And then there is Akonadi, which is the storage service for all PIM related things (so emails, contacts, calendars etc.). If you disabled Baloo in the settings it should not show up as a process anymore and certainly shouldn&#x27;t be using any system resources.<p>Akonadi is required for the usage of KMail, KOrganizer and such (because they use it to store their data, so that is rather essential). If you don&#x27;t use those applications, you can simply remove it with your package manager. Otherwise we&#x27;d appreciate a bug report with regards to the high CPU &#x2F; memory usage on bugs.kde.org. Thank you for using KDE software :)')
