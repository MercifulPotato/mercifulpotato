Second only 37% of American homeless population is unsheltered.  So, the people who moved a long distance while homeless is a small percentage of the overall population, but also a much harder population to serve.<p>Anyway, hospitality isn’t really a question of weather as Alaska for example has relatively high rate of homelessness and NYC one of the highest.  Mississippi on the other hand has the lowest rate despite mild winters and significant poverty.')
