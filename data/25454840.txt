Over twenty years ago, two college students founded a company that forever changed the way that people search the internet. Since then, Google has expanded its business far beyond search and dropped its famous “don’t be evil” motto.<p>Larry and Sergey may technically have been &quot;college students&quot; but it&#x27;s pretty rare to refer to graduate students pursuing PhDs as &quot;college students.&quot; This use of language is disrespectful IMHO and a strange way to open a lawsuit. While this isn&#x27;t exactly false, it is unnecessary.<p>The same is true of the sentence about the motto. They dropped the motto and moved it to their code of conduct when they became reorganized as Alphabet. They replaced it with &quot;do the right thing.&quot; [0] Again a twisted, if mostly true, interpretation.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Don&#x27;t_be_evil#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Don&#x27;t_be_evil#History</a>')
