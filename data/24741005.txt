In my humble opinion, there’s a surprising number of fresh grad candidates who are not very skilled with theory nor practice.<p>It has been many, many years since I was in school. I think it’s fine that your computer science education focuses on fundamental CS concepts and the mathematics so you can easily pick up areas that require that math (ML, for example). I do think universities can do better. At my school, we had mandatory “block” classes in arts and humanities, which in my opinion, offered no value.<p>To be clear, I’m not saying these subjects aren’t valuable. I am saying, however, that the quality of these courses was very poor, and they could have been substituted entirely with classes related more to my discipline.<p>I remember sitting in some political science classes that were part of this required pool. I have no idea what we learned in there. As far as I can remember, we read political science papers that were very poorly written&#x2F;extremely inaccessible. It was impossible to differentiate the authors personal opinion from objective truth of any kind. It was more or less a checkbox - I had to have so many credit hours from this pool in their curriculum to graduate. Did it force me to think critically in some manner? Not at all. It actually gave me a false sense of how “intelligent people” write.<p>Yes - all these years later I understand that it wasn’t me who just could understand those papers - it was half rambling, pretentious rambling nonsense. It was the opposite of effective communication, and it provided no value.')
