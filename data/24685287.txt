I got them from Amazon, I was able to get largely discounted shares from EADS back the day. Tax wise Amazon RSUs were treated like part of my salary, covering taxes when they vested ranged from selling all and selling parts of the RSU or covering taxes cash and keeping all of the RSUs. The discount at EADS was treated as part of my salary. No problem whatsoever. INAL, but all these instnces had in common was the legal entity being stock based (AGs in German parlance). Most companies in Germany end to be GmbHs, in that case ownership is harder to change but accounting is a lot easier.<p>That being said, Berlin start-ups have a tendency to complain a lot. If they wanted, they could make a lot of things work.')
