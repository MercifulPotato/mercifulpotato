In the private sector they’ve all been replaced with 401ks and maybe a feeble matching of a few thousand dollars from your employer.<p>The way I look at it is, public sector jobs are probably what private sector jobs in America would look like if employee compensation didn’t divorce productivity gains starting in the 1980s. Which is why they look so generous by comparison.')
