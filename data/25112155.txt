But there are animals that have overwhelmingly negative experience throughout their lives (pigs confined to a cage where they can&#x27;t turn around). As for chickens, &gt;99% of which grow up in cramped conditions, with no access to the outside, with selective breeding causing them to grow so fast they often can&#x27;t move, it is better to never have been (their lives are a net negative experience).<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate, with respect to emissions, cows are worse than chickens, but with respect to suffering on sentient creatures, chickens are worse than cows.<p>Great news! There&#x27;s a solution: eating fewer of both.')
