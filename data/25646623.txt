But the phenomenon has been around for a while - I&#x27;ve heard it called &quot;biflation&quot; - high inflation in some markets&#x2F;products (asset markets in general, as well as some services), alongside deflation in others like imported goods with not many goods&#x2F;services actually following the middle road which the official inflation statistics give as an average. It&#x27;s exaggerated to some extent but it&#x27;s definitely there.')
