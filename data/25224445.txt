Of course a type 2 hypervisor will depend on what the host OS is doing, but if it&#x27;s working at a 50% load then the guest OS should perform almost as though it had 50% available. (Yes, lots of variables will factor in here)<p>Not sure if we&#x27;ll get there on an M1 without a heck of a lot more work, but it&#x27;s early days and things show lots of promise.<p>What I really want though is not to have to own Apple hardware for this. The M1 shows such promise that it would be crazy for this sort of chip not to be pursued as the next level of commodity chips.')
