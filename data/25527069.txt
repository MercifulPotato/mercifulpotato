In Western countries this is how we are taught to think and it has many benefits, but physical happiness is seldom one. I have also found the line of thought to lead to a deadlock of &quot;But why should we always ask why?&quot;. That question can ultimately only be answered by stating that &quot;Asking why?&quot; should be considered an axiom. And the matter of stating those axioms is up to everyone. In other words, like you say, trying to find answers to <i>statements</i> instead of <i>questions</i> is nonsensical.<p>2.\nI have come to like the idea that I am merely an organism programmed to survive and reproduce and all my needs and wants branch off from that. That may sound somewhat hollow, depressing and like giving up, but it has helped me a lot. Makes me question things a lot less. At least it gives me some kind of answer with which I can justify and understand my irrational behaviour.<p>Also, the moment I am around people more often I find that 1. flies out the window and I completely forget about it â€“ only living by 2.<p>Just like point 56. says it does.')
