The range is different between different people, and we can conclude what the typical ranges are, if there’s enough data collected. But the ranges are still unknown at the moment.<p>The same reason (a need to find the ranges) is why you can’t make a vaccine candidate and be sure how it will work, unless you run big and long enough trials. And that’s why that takes time.<p>Here’s what this study figured out, quoting from the article: “The size of T cell response differed between individuals, being considerably (50%) higher in people who had experienced symptomatic disease at the time of infection six months previously. Further research will be needed to determine the significance of this finding.”<p>As you see, again some range, but also not concluding what you claim.')
