Search YouTube for high-altitude simulation chambers and hypoxia.  I seem to think Derek from Veritasium has a very good demonstration where he gets euhporic and seems unaware that he&#x27;s severely mentally compromised.<p>Also, I once helped a friend set up and tear down an art project that was a flying remote-controlled statue, held up partially by a weather balloon full of helium.  In tearing down, I didn&#x27;t want to let the helium go to waste.  My first breath of pure helium went fine.  My second full breath of pure helium in a row, I barely had enough time to sit down, say &quot;whoah&quot; and cough the helium out before falling down and twitching on the gymnasium floor.  A woke up right at the same time my artist friend realized I wasn&#x27;t joking around.  Had I died, I would have felt no pain, not even the slightest discomfort.<p>Breathing pure helium, I learned you have about 1-2 seconds of warning that you&#x27;re hypoxic before you pass out.  I figured it was more like 15-30 seconds.  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t die, partially because, as a low molecular weight gas, helium has a high rate of effusion, and on my back, it being lighter than air helped it escape my lungs.  Argon may very well have killed me because it has a much lower rate of effusion, and (also related to its higher molar mass) it&#x27;s also heavier than air.')
