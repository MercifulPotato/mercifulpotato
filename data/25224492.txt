In other words, the memory of dictatorship is still fresh in many South Koreans alive now - unlike America&#x27;s revolutionary war, this is too recent (and, not too mention, too inglorious) to be painted over by some kind of PG-13 foundational myth.<p>So the suggestion that the size of the government has something to do with dictatorship would make many Koreans politely roll their eyes.  Right or wrong, our world view is shaped by our experience - and my Korean experience says having a weak government has nothing to do with avoiding tyranny, and in fact is a pretty good predictor for an incoming shitstorm (be it a foreign aggression or a domestic coup).  What we need is a reasonably strong government, led by the right people.  (Well of course it&#x27;s not foolproof - but then again, nothing is.)')
