It&#x27;s stuff that gets baked into a product, and then is difficult (or impossible) to un-bake, and gets more difficult the more the product grows around it.<p>Aside from the initial increase in cost when you forget how the original code worked, tests are no more expensive to write in a year as they are today. Not significantly, at least. So I&#x27;d just class them as incomplete product - the effects are negative and can be expensive, but it doesn&#x27;t dig you into a hole.')
