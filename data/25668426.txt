Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610005934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667179, text='&gt; I do not believe that all things are false until proven true. I believe that Christianity, and many other religions, can be neither proven or disproven using modern science. It is neither misinformation or information. It is a belief.<p>Where we disagree is that you think that a 2000 year old text that&#x27;s been translated 7 or 8 times and by what we would consider today to be idiots (human IQ has increased dramatically over time, in 1910 alone the IQ midpoint would be today&#x27;s 70, which is a full standard deviation lower) - should be given the benefit of the doubt and be granted a reverse burden of proof. Idiots mind you who would have you burned at the stake for the laptop you&#x27;re replying on.<p>The scriptures should be approached analytically with modern techniques. Does anything in there line up with observable reality? No. Is there a plausible explanation? No. Ergo, we should assume its false unless we discover some evidence that it might be true.<p>The challenge with doing that is religions rely on indoctrinating the youth before they&#x27;re capable of making rational evaluations and play to our evolutionary weaknesses (the need for an explanation).<p>&gt; There are plenty of rare events that occur, with and without scientific explanation.<p>Indeed but I&#x27;m not going to recommend telling a 4 year old I&#x27;ve just dunked under water about them based on a book written by an idiot 2000 years ago.<p>&gt;  It is neither misinformation or information. It is a belief.<p>It&#x27;s a myth. Myths are fine, but shouldn&#x27;t be presented as fact. And they certainly shouldn&#x27;t be true until proven false.<p>By this token, until you prove otherwise, the whole world was started on a giant turtle.
