I primarily care about how good the language is at expressing and executing my intent. I&#x27;ve been around long enough to see several tooling fads come and go. I&#x27;ve also been around enough to know that the barrier for delivering quality software is becoming insurmountable, and the additional tooling and infrastructure isn&#x27;t resulting in projects being more successful, nor being delivered more quickly, nor being less costly than when I started.\nTeams are enormous now. Software projects are enormous. Deployment requires deep knowledge of multiple hosting platforms and various cloud provider apis at the enterprise level.\nAvailable libraries, increasing reliance upon testing, type safety, and better development life cycle practices have had a far larger impact than the ide&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen come and go. In my experience, a particular tool has a popularity lifecycle of about ten years. Vscode and lsp will probably be the same.\nGive me types, good compiler error output, and access to a large universe of libraries with good documentation over relying upon ide api discovery any day of the week and twice on Sundays. The rest is an ever-changing tide of requirements fashion.')
