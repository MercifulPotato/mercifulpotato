Companies (including Amazon [1]) break this law all the time, because it reduces the union&#x27;s momentum and they only have to pay back pay and rehire the person if they are found to have done so. (They usually come up with threadbare pretexts and draw things out at the NLRB.)<p>Still, this intimidation strategy works best when there are only a few workers involved. With critical mass, it becomes much harder. Additionally, the new administration will hopefully make this standard union-busting much more expensive by passing a bill to institute treble damages for unfair labor practice violations.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;amazon-fires-staten-island-c...</a>')
