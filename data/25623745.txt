(incl laptops)<p>I would have bought computers when I &quot;wanted one&quot;. Now I buy them when I <i>need</i> one. Because buying a non-ECC computer just feels like buying a defective product.<p>In the last 10 years I would have bought TWICE as many computers if they hadn&#x27;t segmented their market.<p>Fuck intel. I sense that Linus self-censored himself in this post, and like me is even angrier than the text implies.')
