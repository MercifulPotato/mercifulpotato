This technique won&#x27;t cure it but it certainly brings relief for me, to the point where I can ignore it.<p>When my Tinnitus is particularly piercing, I imagine it as a radiant bright white line in my head. I then mentally begin to reduce the radiance of the light until it is gone. This dulls the sound immensely, I&#x27;m still aware of it but it no longer hinders me.<p>For bonus points, I use a similar technique for getting rid of ear worms. In that case, I mentally put the song into a wooden box, close the lid and let it fall into the sea. Works every time.')
