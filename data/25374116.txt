I don&#x27;t know why international folks feel the need to correct this. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the folks affected (U.S. citizens and residents).<p>Note that the reasons for this are complicated, but the U.S. doesn&#x27;t historically have to deal with monarchy, titles of nobility, vestigial aspects of governance left over from feudalism, a relatively recent postwar recovery period, or government implicated into churches. For instance, there&#x27;s no American conservative impulse to support the monarchy because there&#x27;s no American monarchy. The lack of that issue means other things are discussed instead.')
