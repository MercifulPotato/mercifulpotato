Common Lisp is a language with a lot of warts where many features were tacked on but not properly integrated with everything else. It also suffers from the concerns and technology of the 1980s (a big focus on mutability, no multithreading in the spec, the pathnames library, no immutable maps, to name a few.) Scheme is minimal and that can be an advantage but Clojure has different goals to scheme')
