For example, for me Jet is just Blue - White - Green - Dark Green, with white being left of the middle. (Blue + Green is white since I don&#x27;t see red)<p>So for me reading a Jet plot is basically impossible, they just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Like, if a value is weak it is the brightest white, then if it gets even lower it gets blue. It peaks at green in the middle and then goes darker and darker as it gets stronger. Totally unintuitive.<p>Edit: Even worse is that how I see it depends strongly on what medium you use for the red and green channels. On some screens&#x2F;paints red is basically black while others are almost fully green, depending on exactly where in the spectrum it is.')
