It seems to me that part of the challenge is recognizing that the research needs to take place beyond just Western countries, or acknowledging it where such research is already occurring. Understandably many people would not be so comfortable with Google accessing patient data from around the world, so the next challenge is how diverse and global data can be protected so that important medical research can take place without any compromise of privacy.<p>The challenge is hard but surely not impossible, as this was the approach taken by the AstraZeneca-Oxford (and others) which conducted part of its covid vaccine trials in South Africa to test efficacy on non-white populations.')
