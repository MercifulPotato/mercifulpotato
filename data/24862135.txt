We have North America and South America. We typically refer to the grouping of those two continents as &#x27;The Americas&#x27;, but not America. At least not that I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>On a side note - maybe it depends on if you are taught a different number of continents? (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continent</a>)<p>In the U.S. we do 7. Maybe in Venezuela or Brasil they do 5?<p>I guess that&#x27;s one of the things that confuses me here. If you&#x27;re from Europe you can be European because that&#x27;s the continent you&#x27;re from. If you&#x27;re from Canada you can be Canadian or North American, but you can&#x27;t be American because that&#x27;s not a continent. I mean I guess you technically can, but it&#x27;s a bit of a lossy term to use. It isn&#x27;t specific enough. Do people from Bangladesh or Pakistan think of themselves as Asian, or Pakistani?<p>I guess as I see some of this discussion, it strikes me as very arbitrary and resentful, and also not very consistent.<p>&gt; USAian and find it quite amousing but I don&#x27;t think it will catch on.<p>Yea I saw it and had to do a double take because I thought it was USAsian. I think at least in English it won&#x27;t catch on because it doesn&#x27;t flow very well.')
