I can definitely see why avoiding that context switch is nice. I can also imagine it making things like metadata a lot easier if they use common and well documented headers, where in AWS every service will inevitably have its own way of putting stuff into the event. Everything in AWS feeling custom would be a pretty polite and fair way to put it IMO!<p>Do Google represent a JSON body HTTP event in a clean way? In AWS when a lambda is working as one, it receives the body as a string in the JSON representing the request, which you have to JSON decode. Again because not everything a Lambda can act on is JSON and your API doesn&#x27;t have to be, what else can it really do I guess. But it does make it a bit horrible to generate that data to test with - we actually have a small script we use locally to convert a nicely formatted JSON file with test data into their HTTP-request-as-json format because it&#x27;s so annoying to work with a large encoded JSON body. It&#x27;s a small thing, but it means when you switch to working with a plain AWS event it&#x27;s one less thing to think about. And I guess even if you&#x27;re in HTTP-Request-Land and everything is nice JSON, it&#x27;s still all going to be custom between services from there on by necessity.')
