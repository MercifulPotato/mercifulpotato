To a large extent, if AMD64 hadn&#x27;t existed it would have been necessary to create it (either that or Intel could&#x27;ve gone off in a RISC-y direction and made something along the lines of a DEC Alpha, I suppose). But in any case, it&#x27;s hard to see an alternate universe where Itanium was actually successful.')
