Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605233811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074398, text='&gt; Most companies don&#x27;t want &quot;software artists&quot; anymore than they want &quot;artistic bricklayers&quot;<p>I recently had brick laid in front of my house. When the bricks arrived, they were not cut with the precision that the landscaper had expected. They were <i>mostly</i> rectangular, but with enough variation in size that laying them naively (assuming they are interchangeable) would result in an ugly, uneven walkway.<p>The landscaper worked out what order to sort + lay them in to minimize the impact of the uneven sizes. I&#x27;m very happy he did; my walkway looks stunning for it.<p>If you are looking to get landscaping done, live in western Massachusetts, and appreciate someone who takes pride in his work and will take the time to do things right, I have a glowing recommendation for you. (Do be prepared to chase him down about the paperwork on both ends of the transaction; the business side of the business was not his forte). My email is in my profile.<p>---<p>I am not sure if that exactly contradicts your point. You said that&#x27;s not what <i>companies</i> want. As a human, though, I very much appreciate work well done, when the real world inevitably defies our abstractions.')
