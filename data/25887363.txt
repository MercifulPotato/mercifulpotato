This isn&#x27;t new by any means.<p>Lemme check.<p>Current version:\nVersion 88.0.4324.50 (Developer Build) Ubuntu 18.04 (64-bit)<p>It looks like I installed this OS in July of this year, which means Chromium would have been installed in July of this year - the 5th to be exact.<p>When started, it gives a warning about not having certain APIs and lacking functionality because of this.<p>It has done that since at least July of this year. I&#x27;m sure it did so before that, but I can only show that I&#x27;ve had this installed since July of this year.<p>This isn&#x27;t even remotely new. Whatever version it was that I installed back in July did the same thing, or should I say didn&#x27;t do the same thing? It hasn&#x27;t had sync enabled since day one.<p>I currently have Lubuntu 18.04 and Chromium is installed by way of .deb channels - not a snap.')
