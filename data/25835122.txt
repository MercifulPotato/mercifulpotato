Just wanted to share my latest venture with the HN community.<p>Backstory: the teams at my company got really tired of the usual remote &quot;Happy Hour&quot; activities and thought it would be fun to do something a little different — a little more fun! I decided to run a session of “Family Feud” for my team and everyone had a great time. Before I knew it, multiple teams throughout the company were reaching out to me to run a session!<p>After thinking about this experience and talking with numerous managers, I found it was getting harder to keep things fresh as many teams continue to work remotely and thought there was an opportunity to do something more scalable and high quality. Hence, Gamejoy was born!<p>Right now, we&#x27;re focusing on games that combine fun + universal appeal&#x2F;ease + the opportunity to get to know your teammates better (i.e. games with built-in icebreakers). We&#x27;re starting with a few games and hoping to launch more (i.e. Poker is a common request) shortly.<p>Would love any thoughts or feedback. Thanks!')
