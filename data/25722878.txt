After all, anything can be justified to save our society from destruction, correct? It seems like it&#x27;d be better to be safe than sorry, with the stakes so high as you mention.<p>Are there any conservatives&#x2F;republicans and their associated organizations that you think should maintain their equal access to services, and shouldn&#x27;t face some sort of penalty for either directly&#x2F;indirectly supporting an ideology that led to the events of January 6th?')
