Social media doesn&#x27;t function by me going to your webpage and seeing what you&#x27;ve written. Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, Youtube, every single one are primarily driven by algorithmic discovery. You go to youtube, youtube says &quot;Hey! Here&#x27;s our curated list of what we think our usres want to see&quot;. Making youtube a common carrier would be fine- they would be forced to host porn videos, spam and gore. The result of common carrier legislation on facebook is you&#x27;d have Alex Jones on facebook and not a single link, not a single trending page, would ever link to him ever. It would be functionallly undiscoverable. Which is basically where Alex Jones is today.')
