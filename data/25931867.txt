They don&#x27;t know the noscript tag or something?<p>This is often less about the developers not knowing a technique and more about the constraints they&#x27;re working under. Maybe there&#x27;s a third party auth library they&#x27;re using that requires JS. Maybe either they or or their management have other priorities than removing JS from the login screen. It&#x27;s not that hard to believe that scriptless login would fall fairly low on a team&#x27;s priority list behind features more likely to drive revenue, etc.')
