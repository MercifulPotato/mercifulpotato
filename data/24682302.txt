That was a value judgement that <i>you</i> imposed on a couple of gentlemen that I went to school with, in 1981. You did not meet them or interact with them; I did. They were insular, and I cannot call them &quot;friends.&quot; That&#x27;s fairly typical for police, but they were incredibly polite, and everyone in the class liked and respected them (it was an extremely mixed class, in a very tough town).<p>The people that engineered that scenario (and are probably still engineering it, to this day), were the state legislature. The officers that commanded that barracks were the ones that established the model for their officers.<p>These were two <i>electronic technicians.</i> They happened to be trained and uniformed officers, but were not particularly interested in the &quot;pithier&quot; aspects of their field. In fact, they had volunteered to spend their careers in a basement, fixing radios.<p>In that particular state, there is a giant world of difference between the State Police, and the various county and municipality cops. The State Police held themselves, and were held to, a <i>much</i> higher standard than regular cops. I know of at least one county in that state, where the cops were renown for rather gratuitous violence; especially against minorities. The State Police had nothing to do with that.<p>As for me, and my views...seriously, dude, you have no idea. If you thought that you learned something untoward about me, you are wrong. Dead wrong.<p>This world is missing something fundamental: basic, human respect. That goes for people in authority, that abuse that authority; whether for personal gain, animus, or to be a &quot;team player.&quot; It also goes for people that have appointed themselves &quot;Guardians of &#x27;The Truth&#x27;&quot; <i>(Whatever happens to be the flavor of the day)</i>.<p>We might want to consider that not everyone in the world is an evil person.<p>Just a thought.')
