Conservatives believe that culture is of overriding importance to the prosperity of a society, and do not embrace cultural relativism.<p>What makes the United States rich and Bangladesh poor? A liberal would immediately go to explanations involving colonialism, etc. A conservative is much more likely to go to explanations involving bribery, political corruption, etc. Liberals tend to be cultural relativists, so they perceive those cultural explanations as being &quot;chauvinist&quot; or &quot;racist.&quot; But there are plenty of Bangladeshis who would give the same explanation. Among other Bangladeshis I know (I&#x27;m from the country), especially ones back home, they&#x27;re much more likely to blame cultural&#x2F;political institutions rather than colonialism.')
