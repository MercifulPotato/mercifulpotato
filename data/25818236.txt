Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25820810, 25820349], score=None, time=1610944955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817945, text='&gt; Lol, I love that quote (&quot;your new society will end up consisting of approximately three principled civil libertarians and seven zillion witches&quot;). It&#x27;s very true, and not the least bit surprising.<p>It&#x27;s not quite true though.<p>It&#x27;s what happens when you&#x27;re the new kid on the block and the incumbents are appointing Witchfinders General to burn the heretics, because then rather than languishing in obscurity as you would otherwise, you get a huge influx of refugees and thousands of them are witches. Then if you let the witches chase off all the other refugees, you reach the undesired end state.<p>The way around this is to get big enough that most of your users are not witches. So the incumbents can do it already. Just stop having witch hunts. The witches can&#x27;t take over when all the witches in the whole world are 0.5% of your user base, and other people only leave once the witches take over. It&#x27;s a stable equilibrium.<p>But you can also get there another way, which is when the incumbents are hunting witches so hard that 95% of their refugees are innocent people. Then you just sit there and let everybody in, and your percentage of actual witches isn&#x27;t so high that you&#x27;re in trouble.<p>Unless anybody who tries to do that gets canceled before they can get a large enough user base to outnumber the witches.')
