I highly recommend using Toast for your CI jobs (with or without GitHub Actions), not just for this security fix but also because it also allows you to run your CI jobs locally. It just runs everything inside Docker containers, so it works the same in CI, on your laptop, on your coworker&#x27;s machine, etc.')
