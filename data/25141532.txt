Of course, the free tier presents more of a problem then, but I&#x27;d probably just restrict it more making it less attractive, and have a lower entry point than the $100pcm that&#x27;s a flat-fee for some but not all extra features, showing images at all (and not in free), for example.<p>As it is, I reckon loads of users cache results - not maliciously, just because they haven&#x27;t read that they&#x27;re not supposed to - and that OP has no idea (because how would they).')
