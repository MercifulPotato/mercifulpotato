Item(by='sandworm101', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603979176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929699, text='&gt;&gt; Properly laundered money should be extremely difficult to tell from legitimate business.<p>Fine point:  The goal is not to make it indistinguishable from legitimate business.  Rather it is to keep it distinguishable from <i>illegitimate</i> business long enough that police look elsewhere.<p>The money launderer isn&#x27;t trying to hid as a legitimate profit-seeking business.  The goal is to add so many layers that the burden of investigation dissuades prosecution.  So they aren&#x27;t going to setup false cash-based storefronts so as to mix the bad money with the good (ie the laundromat joke in Archer).  Such concrete actions are too dangerous.  What they will do is bounce money across as many jurisdictions as possible.  There may be no legitimate reason for doing this but they aren&#x27;t really trying to seem legitimate.  They just want to look like a very difficult target so that the cops will go after easier prey.  That burden increase is more effective and less dangerous than the lies required to hide.')
