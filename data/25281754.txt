Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606943759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25276269, text='&gt; Believe or not there are other roles besides &quot;developer&quot; within technology related jobs<p>I would assume much of AWS, at least the services I mentioned, are targetted at application developers though. So if you say running your own box is easier or better for running your application, you&#x27;d need to convince an application developer that it is.<p>And as an application developer myself, like I said, I don&#x27;t find it so. Targeting Lambda for example is much simpler. If I need a DB, using RDS or DynamoDB or S3 is much simpler than spinning and maintaining my own instance on my own box. If I need to publish notifications, well I don&#x27;t even want to think what I&#x27;d need to do to replace SNS or SQS. If I want to have application logs and have them archived for some longer period of time, and make sure they don&#x27;t fill up my box&#x27;s hard drive to the max, I can just use CloudLogs. Etc.<p>So again, you&#x27;d need to convince me it can be more convenient and less maintainance for me to use my own box instead of using those AWS services. That&#x27;s even before we talk about availability and scale.')
