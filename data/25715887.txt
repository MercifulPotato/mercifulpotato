Item(by='marcelbataille', descendants=8, kids=[25716191, 25716388], score=2, time=1610294093, title='I am gonna be fired soon, techlead does not wants me to do things', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I am sure i am going to be fired soon. Teamlead does not wants to give me any tasks to do, probably woried i will break things. \nI spend few first months mostly writing tests, but coverage plan got achieved so there is no need to do that, at least in my opinion,\nas &gt;50% coverage is causing code to be more difficult to mantain, its like you get &quot;concreted&quot; under flaky automated tests, that fails after\nevery little change. So i tried to change strategy and &quot;refactor&quot; - means rewriting old very long methods in bunch of several shorter\nmethods, changing long method signatures into parameter objects etc. Techlead is talking constantly about rewriting monolith into \nmicroservices, so i can try to do that, and i also try to learn docker, so deployment will  be easier for new workers. Anyway its all\non my own accord, techlead does not want to talk with me, and does not expect me to do anything, so i dont feel motivated. Every weekend\ni say to myself - &quot;i will learn microservices and docker so i will know what i am doing&quot; - but it always ends on procrastinating and \ni spend those 2 days just browsing internet minlessly and watching movies. I hate myself and job, i started drinking to cope. \nI am not gonna leave myself because i wont get new job any time soon. I spend few years unemployed and i was employed in this company only for\n4 months. But i just want to be fired so i have free time to write my bachelor thesis and end my study, i need some soulsearching,\nbecause i dont even know if i still enjoy programming')
