Those cities are a lot of fun. I spent time living in both in my early 20s. The segregation both is and isn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s very strange. I think that the feeling you&#x27;re describing is due to the ghost of slavery. It was always very hard for me to separate the history of the antebellum south from those two cities specifically.<p>To be fair, though, the most segregated place I&#x27;ve ever lived was easily East Los Angeles. It doesn&#x27;t have that same feeling that you describe, of course, which makes it ... different but in a slightly better way.')
