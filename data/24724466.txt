My guess is their strategy is not just to develop self-driving - they&#x27;d lose on equal ground (due to not being first) - but to develop &quot;2nd gen&quot; self-driving which has a specific competitive advantage of not requiring lidar and thus having lower total cost per unit. This allows them to enter the market late but still have a significant edge in that market.<p>They&#x27;ll be able to drive in the rain and snow.')
