I don&#x27;t know whether non-standard screws are a trade-off that Apple needed to make a better product, but it&#x27;s a trade-off consumers are willing to accept. That indicates that on the whole, Apple&#x27;s non-standard behavior is still more valuable to consumers overall than their less successful standard competitors even if it is horrible to a minority.<p>Only a competitor that consumers like as much as Apple but also has standard screws can prove Apple wrong. Or, alternatively, maybe a day will come where consumers care about standard screws&#x2F;repairability as much as you do. Until then, consumers will continue wanting Apple&#x27;s non-standard stuff over the rest of the industry&#x27;s standards, and what consumers want is pretty much the only thing that matters (with few exceptions, of course).')
