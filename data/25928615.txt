I used to use a MiniVan Rev2 as my daily driver. Then I bought a GergoPlex on a whim and couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing it was. I love the lack of weird stretches in the default key layout, and the chording engine Germ made for it is amazing and really makes it feel like I have a full-size keyboard. And being able to have the two halves exactly shoulder-width apart helps me keep a neutral position for my arms. All it&#x27;s missing is tenting, but that&#x27;s easy to do myself.<p>All in all, I highly recommend getting (or building) a split keeb.')
