But again, I think it&#x27;s a life situation thing. What is extremely revealing and useful for me could be completely redundant or harmful for you.<p>Having said that, I found the following, in no particular order, worth it to have read than not:<p>=================<p>The Richest Man in Babylon<p>=================<p>It simplified how I think about personal finance for me. I was irresponsible with my finances. This provided some basic rules of economics and personal finance that have stuck with me.<p>=========================<p>The Simple Path to Wealth<p>=========================<p>I read this one only recently but it simplified things even more for me when it comes to investing. I had been doing sort of the same thing but it gave it much more perspective on how simple things can be.<p>=====================================<p>How I found Freedom in an Unfree World<p>=====================================<p>I think this one has empowered me to look for things I can control rather than getting stuck up on things I can&#x27;t.<p>====================<p>The Sovereign Individual<p>====================<p>I have a different and richer view of politics than I did before I read this book.<p>=============================<p>A Short History of Nearly Everything<p>=============================<p>Gives a different perspective of scientists. I think I believed &quot;science&quot; much more before I got to know personal stories of scientists.<p>===============================<p>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind<p>===============================<p>Good read just because it&#x27;s popular and referenced in other places... and is interesting if you&#x27;re into &quot;history&quot; of humans. It&#x27;s fictional (in that, it&#x27;s his take on what happened) obviously but he makes it look like that is actually what happened.<p>=============================<p>All books by Nassim Nicholas Taleb<p>=============================<p>He has the same kind of hatred of the academics that I do, which I think I resonate with. And the ideas are interesting.<p>=========================================<p>Basic Economics: A Citizen&#x27;s Guide to the Economy<p>=========================================<p>Simplified (sometimes oversimplified) economics which is a good read for American conservative view on economics.<p>==========================<p>Propaganda by Edward Bernays<p>==========================<p>This was written when the meaning of propaganda was changing to something nefarious (previously, it has a positive neutral or positive meaning to it, in that it meant &quot;propagation of information&quot; - implied to be for public good). Edward Bernays is the father of what is now known as Public Relations.<p>Related to the same book:<p>* <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;submarine.html</a> (this one is among the most shared links on HN)<p>* Tim Wu&#x27;s books: The Master Switch and The Attention Merchants<p>=========================<p>The Complete Guide to Fasting<p>=========================<p>Even though I met people who were fasting, I needed to read this before I would start doing it myself so that I felt I understood what I was getting into.<p>=====================<p>High Output Management<p>=====================<p>I was a follower of &quot;management is unnecessary&quot; meme which pervades the dev community. This gives a first principle view of what&#x27;s happening in management.<p>===============================================================<p>The Confessions of an Economic Hit Man (and the newer edition of the same)<p>===============================================================<p>It&#x27;s just an insider view on international organizations. I had second hand knowledge of how corrupt these organizations are... but it is just one more confirmation. Do I think the author is biased? Yes. It&#x27;s only his view and I&#x27;m sure other people many have a more positive outlook and intentions in these organizations... but at least I&#x27;m familiar with this one.<p>===========================================================<p>Unsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat<p>===========================================================<p>Again, it&#x27;s one view of how food science works, and it confirms my personal experience with information I get from science, whether on the internet or from the doctors (who basically say the same thing that ends up in WebMD).<p>These are not all of them but it covers a lot of them that I consider have enriched me in one way or other.')
