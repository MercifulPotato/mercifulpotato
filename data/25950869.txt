I am a little disappointed with how it&#x27;s been falling apart. SSD failed early last year. Lost contact with a usb c port a few months after that. LCD has a vertical gray line. Some paint started chipping off around the trackpad.<p>I will probably replace it with another X1 because I am a masochist. But I do wish it were a bit more sturdy. Other than that, I like the size and hardware support.')
