The world is filled with average or really not-good-looking guys with great girlfriends and wives. However, these are guys with kindness, talents, and other personality traits that they&#x27;ve learned to use wisely and guys who have learned that some great women don&#x27;t always look like models. Humanity needs all of these traits, not only handsome faces.')
