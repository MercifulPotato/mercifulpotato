Item(by='burntsushi', descendants=None, kids=[24940657], score=None, time=1604048954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24940420, text='&gt; What is protected by IP is your claim to be the first person - the original author - having had the idea. Not the idea itself.<p>I think it&#x27;s just a manner of speaking. In order to create this protection, you have to elevate ideas to some kind of property by creating an artificial scarcity. Or at least, that&#x27;s the result produced by a system of intellectual property. That artificial scarcity, introduced by a coercive state, is what I&#x27;m opposed to.<p>&gt; The real problem with copyright, though, isn&#x27;t making that first claim. It&#x27;s the abstract notion that rights to claim IP can be extended and transferred. Which creates a very different can of worms.<p>Yes, removing the latter while keeping the former would be a HUGE improvement on the status quo I think. But I still see the former as problematic. :-)')
