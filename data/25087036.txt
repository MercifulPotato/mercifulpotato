That&#x27;s been 17&quot;, 15&quot;, and 16&quot;, and it&#x27;s a very comfortable size on my lap. (It sometimes gets a little cramped when a large cat wants to share my lap with it, but I can usually manage.)<p>Naturally, this is going to vary depending on your physical size. A person who&#x27;s small and slight of build isn&#x27;t going to be as easily able to use a 16&quot; laptop as me.')
