It would also enable engagement by the orders-of-magnitude more available skilled C++ programmers, who could also pick up new skills writing modern, safe C++ to apply in other migrations.<p>It is not an either&#x2F;or proposition. Certain, select modules could be recoded in Rust by particularly motivated Rust coders, leaving the huge amount of other code, for which there are too few Rust enthusiasts to work on, to be modernized in C++, and still able to call into the Rust code.')
