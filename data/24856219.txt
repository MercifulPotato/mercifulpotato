Walked into the theatre wearing a gown and a pair of shorts with a flap at the back, and hopped up onto the bed. Somewhat embarrassing with a half dozen nurses standing around various bits of kit and more monitors than NASA.<p>They asked me if I wanted to watch, then angled one of the monitors so I could see what they were doing. Laid on side, knees up and relax. Blimely is my bum really that hairy? Don&#x27;t normally get to see if from that angle.<p>It feels weird and a little uncomfortable at times, but certainly not painful - even when they found a polyp and removed it with a remote lasso tool of some kind. This later turned out to be harmless.<p>As is normal for Brits, there was a lot of humour, with the women discussing the latest TV soap opera whilest doing their thing with the &quot;dynorod&quot; tool. As they pump in a gas of some kind to keep the bowl inflated while they work, they tell me it&#x27;s okay to fart whenever I need. Boy, I think I&#x27;ve got a bad job sometimes. Whatever the nurse with the pointy end gets paid - it&#x27;s not enough.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly pleasant, but necessary and quite interesting to watch inside your own body (not as interesting as watching surgeons put stents into my heart, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>Totally agree with Graeme, nothing to fear and massive win if they find things before it&#x27;s too late. Don&#x27;t hesitate!')
