Peoples have the right to self-determine.<p>The US are “responsible” in the sense that they have played a role in causing certain eventual outcomes, but are obviously not “responsible” in the sense they should do something about those outcomes. They pursue their own foreign policy agenda, like all other nation-states do. Then the targets of that agenda have the opportunity to respond as they see fit, taking into account the relevant implications and welfare of their own citizens.<p>Even more so, causing significant disruption to Huawei and putting the Chinese govt in a tight spot very likely was the goal of the entire thing in the first place. \nAre the US evil because of this? Maybe. However that’s just how foreign policy strategies work. To think otherwise is just naif, or preposterous.')
