In sexual reproduction you&#x27;d expect the variety to be stable if and only if you breed it within itself, and any cross-breeding to result in something that&#x27;s new.<p>Apple trees are generally pollinated by a large number of other apple seedlings, so it may make sense to consider every individual plant grown from seed as a potential separate variety, so we generally don&#x27;t do that as the vast majority of these random cross-breeds are bad.<p>Only experimental breeders would even consider apples from individual grown-from-seed plants, everyone else uses genetically identical clones grafted onto rootstock that&#x27;s (AFAIK) also cloned.')
