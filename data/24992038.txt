From reading cheminformatics papers by CS authors, I see that their history section is often only incompletely understood.<p>For example, in paper I reviewed, the CS authors misread one a paper completely. They wrote something like &quot;method X has been used in cheminformatics before [cite] but the CS literature has improved on that with method Y.&quot; But the paper they cited actually used method Y.<p>Now, the paper itself didn&#x27;t need that level of detail about the history. That error, and others like it, bugged me because they came across as dilettantes, writing with more assurance than they actually had, and because their history was biased towards the CS methods they knew, which made it feel like they snubbed the cheminformatics methods and treated the previous work in this field as second-class material.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that the process you describe, where someone new to topic must write a history section just to publish, results in a lot of half-baked history, as new people just don&#x27;t have the experience to really give a good treatment of the history. Instead, they&#x27;ll see that 15 other papers covered points A-F so they follow the tradition that they need to cover points A-F but with a different slant.<p>I&#x27;m not saying my field is immune to that! There&#x27;s a well-known observation along the lines that &quot;similar structures tend to have similar properties.&quot; Many people will cite a 1990 as the source of that quote. Except that that book doesn&#x27;t contain that quote. Most people instead know about it second- or third-hand, which has resulted in the common but incorrect practice of making that citation.<p>Q: If you write multiple papers on a new topic, do you still write histories for each one? Or can you refer to your previous publications for the history?')
