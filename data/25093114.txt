Particularly if the video recorder starts when you are playing a &#x27;comment&#x27; and captures your realtime reaction&#x2F;response interaction with the content.  Then you have the option to upload or nah.<p>Then on  playback the forum synchronizes all of these clips so that it&#x27;s one continuous experience.  UX could be the active video playing while 3-4 live &#x27;replies&#x27; silently stack up to the right and you just mouse over over the one you want to unmute (now) and roll into the conversation \n(next).  Maybe your video is in there too so you can hover over it to indicate you want to reply.<p>Lastly the ability for everyone to grab clips and start threads from them would be interesting to help avoid the blab factor.')
