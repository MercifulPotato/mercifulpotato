It started as a bot for Twitch (Twitch bots usually only respond to a list of commands that start with !) and then I started to add it to other parts of my site. First, into my IRC server, then into the 1 on 1 (+1?) video&#x2F;text chat rooms I added.<p>The base commands are things like !help, !about, !coin (simulates a coin toss), and then I added a little NLP on top to translate to one of those commands. I feel like that works a lot better than a general conversational bot that most likely isn&#x27;t gonna respond in meaningful ways to most queries.')
