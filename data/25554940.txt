Item(by='rubyn00bie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609109252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551624, text='I personally think the DKE is more likely to be found in knowledge based tasks requiring some level of gatekeeping. Like programming for example...<p>It has been quite a while now ~9 years, but I had the chance to work at a pretty prominent tech company for about 8 months when it was roughly 13 people in engineering. It was my first job experience in &quot;tech&quot; proper; and I think, I was most fortunate, to have had the opportunity. Immediately, and without question, I <i>knew</i> for sure I was absolutely the most junior person there. It&#x27;s not because anyone was unkind, quite the opposite; everyone else was so unbelievably experienced it was obvious. I had, up until that point, not encountered such levels of professional experience, or expertise in a field, outside of university.<p>It gave me perspective for my (own lack of) ability I likely could not have gotten otherwise. It was humbling in a wonderful way because it meant I had, and have, a great deal to learn. I was happy to be resolutely at the bottom.<p>While undeniably good for my person, and who I want to be in life, it has also come to cause me a lot of pain.<p>Having worked pretty tirelessly since that original job, in the pursuit of learning and mastery of my craft. And if I am honest, to my chagrin, found I now underestimate my abilities. I only realized this because I generally give people the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; and it kept&#x2F;keeps (still trying) biting me. It&#x27;s very much insanity: doing the same thing again, knowing it won&#x27;t work, expecting a different result... &quot;&#x27;cuz someone else must be smarter than me.&quot; What I should learn to say instead of &quot;smarter than me&quot; is &quot;less experienced and very confident.&quot;<p>Erik Dietrich wrote an article about the Dunning-Kruger where he coined the terms &quot;Advanced Beginners&quot; or &quot;Expert Beginners.&quot;  Like Dietrich, I tend to observe these folks, have the capacity, to cause the most harm for people in the competent&#x2F;proficient areas (like I find myself). I believe they mean well, in most cases, but disregard anything not directly from an expert. The worst case being there is no expert available to help check them, and they will unrelentingly default to themselves. A close second, when they are the gatekeeper to the expert, and are unlikely or unable to explain someone else&#x27;s ideas.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see why it happens though. Unable to scope problems&#x2F;tasks correctly; the problem&#x27;s resolution becomes rooted in &quot;beliefs,&quot; and generally speakings, people view other&#x27;s beliefs as equivalent. With equivalent choices, we tend to then make decisions based on our preferences.<p>... but I digress, I&#x27;ve ranted and rambled enough.<p>[1] - Link to the referenced article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daedtech.com&#x2F;how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daedtech.com&#x2F;how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-th...</a>')
