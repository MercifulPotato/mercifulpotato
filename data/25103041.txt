The breakthrough here is price as traditional professional combi ovens are incredibly expensive. Electrolux makes a small countertop model for about $2k but it does not review very well. Gaggenau offers a consumer built-in that requires plumbing for water supply at about $8k. The gold standard are the Rational commercial combi-ovens which start at about $10k and go up sharply from there.<p>In roughly the 140° to 250°F range, the combi ovens are super precise unlike anything else. Nathan Mhyrvold in his tome &quot;Modernist Cuisine&quot; says, (roughly), that the combi oven the single most useful device in a kitchen.<p>For lower temps, sous vide is more precise but, overall, the combi is more versatile.<p>Anova, along with Sansaire, was one of the first to introduce affordable sous vide circulators to the market so I have high hopes for their $700 combi.<p>As for a microwave with a user-visible humidity sensor, I don&#x27;t know of one but I haven&#x27;t looked.')
