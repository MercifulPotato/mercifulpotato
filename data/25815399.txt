You can have the best of the best, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything without the discipline to use it, and I suppose that&#x27;s what the author is trying to convey.<p>You even touch on it in your response about developing the right habits, and that&#x27;s the author&#x27;s port -- without discipline, the Yubikey means nothing.<p>&gt;Again, this is not a Yubikey&#x27;s problem. It&#x27;s a website problem.<p>On this point I can&#x27;t really agree at all; Yubikey might have a solid solution for a problem, but if no one is implementing it, then it&#x27;s a solution looking for a problem. The mythical &quot;average user&quot; won&#x27;t be persuaded to drop any amount of money on a dongle that does nothing; if it doesn&#x27;t work for a large majority of their most common sites, then it&#x27;s just a waste of money.<p>I&#x27;d suggest it __is__ Yubikey&#x27;s problem as they&#x27;re not promoting their value to sites in a way that implementation is a no-brainer. Checking on their compatibility list fo common chat-applications, common forums, common message boards&#x2F;imageboards, and common shops world-wide, the adoption is very limited. Surely the admins of popular sites are aware of Yubikey, but at some point there was a decision not to add functionality -- Yubikey needs to make the efforts to promote adoption and figure out where there resistance comes from.<p>Of my daily sites that I might expect to be aware of&#x2F;implement some hardware security, only reddit is on the list of &quot;works with Yubikey&quot;, and I pretty rarely use reddit. Listing sites my friends and family use on a day to day basis, only Google Accounts comes up.<p>That&#x27;s what the post is talking about. Yubikey does not have the penetration to be viable to &quot;average users&quot;, and even for tech persons, the device is useless without the discipline to adjust habits in the first place, which most people just don&#x27;t have.')
