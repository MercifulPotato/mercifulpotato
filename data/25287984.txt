Made our new service practical. We were so thrilled. Boss man was unimpressed. &quot;You should have thought of that before.&quot; I&#x27;m still angry about it. Clearly.<p>Ok. Wait. That&#x27;s not entirely correct. A recent team did claim to have targets for P90, P99. So we measured. But it wasn&#x27;t systematic, nor global. None of the other web services (teams) bothered, so our effort didn&#x27;t actually matter. And even then my team wasn&#x27;t willing to sacrifice our sacred cows to consistently attain the P90, P99 targets.')
