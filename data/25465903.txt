Once they get inter-sat links working, the higher speed of light from paths through air&#x2F;vacuum would actually give them lower latency over long distances (sufficient to make up for the extra round trip to orbit). It&#x27;s also the reason high speed traders in some places have gone to the trouble and expense of setting up point-to-point wireless links over long distances; they too can actually beat a regular fiber signal. Photonic band gap fiber is another expensive but interesting tech that might someday be worth it at least for long distance backbones. It&#x27;s cool we&#x27;ve come far enough to be able to start looking for further improvements like that. For real time international communications, it might make for a real improvement in many applications.')
