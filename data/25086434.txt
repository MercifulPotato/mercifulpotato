That&#x27;s 50 times the leverage they financed through ABS, Asset Backed Securities, or in this case more accurately described as Debt Backed Security. We knew all about these &#x27;financial innovations&#x27; in 2008.<p>The new regulation limits the leverage cap from infinite to about 15, closer to bank&#x27;s 10. This limits risk, and is considered a reasonable move.<p>A truly desperate move would be to allow these bubbles to go ahead and IPO. Which almost happened, everything will be fine and dandy for a while, until it&#x27;s not. Whether it&#x27;s due to Xi&#x27;s insecurity or not, I&#x27;d say that China dodged a bullet here.')
