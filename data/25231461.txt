You buy it because you value several extra conveniences (displays, trackpads, speakers, construction, weight, baterry life, even keyboard - before and after they&#x27;ve messed theirs up for 3 years). Sure, it&#x27;s not better in all of those than a comparable in price PC laptop, but it&#x27;s usually better in most, and unaproachable in others. The SSDs it comes with are speedy as hell also (compared to the options Dell or Lenovo has on comparably priced models).<p>The CPU&#x2F;GPU you can find in PC a too. At least until the M1, which has the best performance&#x2F;power ratio of any current PC CPU. Plus there&#x27;s always macOS, which lets you have a no-fuss desktop OS than runs all your proprietary apps and a native UNIX (as opposed to WSL&#x2F;WSL2). Plus an ecosystem, drivers for your external peripherals (as opposed to the hit-and-miss Linux experience).<p>But it&#x27;s not about saving money, and &quot;I could the same work while spending less&quot;.')
