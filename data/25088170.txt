Once they actually started flying powered airplanes, they became secretive and everyone stopped believing them, considering them to be complete frauds.<p>A few people saw them fly in Kitty Hawk.  A few dozen people saw them fly in Ohio with new and refined designs, etc.  But still they were ignored.<p>It was only a few years later, in France, that they blew everyone&#x27;s mind with a completely new design and started flying around Paris.<p>They got the credit for flying in Kitty Hawk retroactively.  You don&#x27;t want your product to be compared to the Wright Brothers and the first flight!')
