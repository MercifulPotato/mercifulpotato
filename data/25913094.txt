You want to compare extremists, but the extremists are not the point - they&#x27;ll always be there. The intent of the movements that caused these actions to happen are what matters, and it&#x27;s fairly clear which side each falls on.<p>Many of those instances of violence in the summer protests were reactionary and driven by police exercising unnecessary force, which has been documented in troves of video.<p>Those who participated in the DC incident on the 6th were driven by a stream of misinformation, which has _also_ been well documented at this point.<p>One wanted to believe in conspiracy theories and support a failure of a President, going so far as to listen to him to attempt to overthrow the government. The other one just wants equality.<p>&gt;There was even an area that declared itself an Autonomous Zone.<p>Yes, I live down the street from it. Having experienced it and lived around it, I would not classify it as anything remotely close to what was seen on January 6th in DC.')
