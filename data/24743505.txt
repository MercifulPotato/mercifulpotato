This really shakes my faith in Linux, if architectures, and even individual CPUs, need to be special-cased in the codebase.<p>Just kidding. I think I know what&#x27;s going on here, and it&#x27;s actually worse than that. Big company (IBM) pushing for tighter integration with their new chips (POWER10), which results in the kernel maintainers having to drop support for their old chip. Why they let a big company bully them like that is beyond me, but I guess something something IBM RedHat Kernel maintainer salaries something. :)')
