Cultural differences too maybe.<p>My first serious jobs in IT were in consulting (Hyperion Planning in oil and gas in Russia) and this one company (aside from Accenture were I&#x27;ve had a bit of experience) where the only places that required me to use the provided notebook for the job. Same for British Petroleum. Security reasons etc.<p>Not as single soft dev company I&#x27;ve worked since around 2012 required me to use their PCs (backend dev here) even though most of the do proived their macs or Thinkpads, or something else.<p>Anyway - many devs are self employed and\\or work remotely. They don&#x27;t use corporate tech at all. Corporate VPN to access the net? Sure. But that&#x27;s it.<p>Honestly, I won&#x27;t even consider a job offer that will restrict me to employer provided PC.')
