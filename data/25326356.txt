Item(by='jstarfish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607286498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322051, text='&gt; Staff and some of their relatives complained of symptoms ranging from dizziness, loss of balance, hearing loss, anxiety and something they described as &quot;cognitive fog&quot;. It became known as &quot;Havana syndrome&quot;.<p>These symptoms are also present in everything from Lyme disease to minor&#x2F;asymptomatic COVID. They are also associated with positional vertigo.<p>Unless US intelligence knows something they have not shared, I don&#x27;t see the &quot;sonic attack&quot; angle. We don&#x27;t know what happened, we don&#x27;t know what caused it, but it&#x27;s an embassy, so it <i>must</i> be the fault of spies?<p>Suppose someone left a fork in their container while reheating their lunch in a microwave with a failing magnetron. It <i>is</i> an embassy-- suppose a bug interfered with a jammer. Suppose any other freak occurrence occurred that would emit this sort of energy.<p>Literally anything that disrupts the inner ear calcium deposits could produce these symptoms. Sound vibration or changes in air pressure could do it too. It happens to people who don&#x27;t work at the US embassy in Cuba too, but that results in a vertigo diagnosis instead of accusations of theoretical attacks by unknown adversaries for unclear purpose.<p>The Russians studied this sort of thing 50 years ago? Ok. But what is the connection to the current political relationship between the USSR and Cuba? Why apply 50-year-old research--now--in Cuba, specifically? Why not test this on a control group that would not put the attacker in-scope of US intelligence? We will look like idiots if this turns out to be an intern fooling around with a directional microphone they found while cleaning out a supply closet.<p>Sure, something happened in Cuba that produced these symptoms in a group of people. But fuck me, if anything the mass hysteria seems to be coming more from US intelligence than the actual victims.')
