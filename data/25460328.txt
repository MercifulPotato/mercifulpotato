However I&#x27;ve implemented them a really hardened way (http-only cookies, not storing anything in localStorage, short token lives, revokable refresh tokens, etc.) so I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll be fine.<p>The thing is, I looked into other auth alternatives (sessions, regular tokens) for Django DRF + React and they all seemed just as difficult to implement. That&#x27;s the sticking point in this whole discussion and what these guys are trying to solve - auth is critical and sensitive, but it&#x27;s also largely a commodity that in most cases is not relevant to the application business logic, and there&#x27;s no reason it should take so long to implement every. single. time.<p>(But if you have a tip on how to implement auth in Django + SPA&#x27;s in a super-easy way that scales horizontally and allows users to stay logged in between sessions, I&#x27;m willing to be persuaded that the developer experience for auth doesn&#x27;t suck so much)')
