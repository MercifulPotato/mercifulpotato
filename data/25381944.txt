Item(by='gilby', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1607657501, title='How do you feel about surveys?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I want to learn more about how software developers manage their finances, so I created a survey: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;v4KrPgvYn2hmT7479. Then, I thought, &quot;If someone sent me this survey, would I take it?&quot; Honestly, I doubt I would. I&#x27;m often asked to complete surveys via emails, in-product popups, YouTube videos, and even mobile ads, and I rarely complete them, even if they dangle gift cards in front of me. So, I&#x27;m wondering: what might incentivize developers to actually complete this survey? Given that it&#x27;s anonymous, my current incentive is, &quot;I&#x27;ll publish the data,&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s very compelling. Interested to hear your thoughts!')
