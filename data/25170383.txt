HOWEVER, it is possible that a company could entice me to come in to the office, and here&#x27;s how:<p>- Stop with the ridiculous open office plans<p>- If you have free snacks or a machine with Monster energy drinks, don&#x27;t get rid of those things a year after instating them<p>- Give my team a budget for tools, like if we need Parallels or Sketch, and make that budget transparent<p>- Compensate me for transportation expenses that I wouldn&#x27;t incur if I had a remote position<p>- Don&#x27;t get weird when I leave the office for a few hours to do whatever I want when there are no meetings or high priority tasks<p>- Don&#x27;t force me to change desks every 6 months because you failed the to properly organize the workspace the first time<p>- Give me actual raises and not the poppycock you call a &quot;merit increase&quot; which only keeps up with inflation<p>- Make it easy to use meeting space to host tech meetups (it&#x27;s amazing how many businesses don&#x27;t see the tremendous value in this)<p>- Get rid of Agile.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  All you need is sprints with planning and retrospective, a ticketing system, and a daily status sync through Slack.')
