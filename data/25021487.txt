With REST I have a finite set of queries to optimise. With GraphQL I have unlimited set of queries. How I supposed to optimise for what I don&#x27;t know?<p>One good example - &#x27;users&#x27; and &#x27;comments&#x27; tables with natural relationship. &#x27;Comments&#x27; grow to unreasonable size and split into different tables, fresh comments stay in &#x27;comments&#x27;, old comments moved to another database with cheaper storage. With REST it is easy, I get a query like &#x27;get user&#x27;s A comments from X till Y&#x27;. I have to deal with two dates and based on that figure out how to fetch data.<p>With GraphQL I can get query like this but also something like this &#x27;get user&#x27;s A comments from user.signup_date.year till user.signup_date.year + 1&#x27;. I suppose I would have to deal with query AST to figure out if it queries archive dates or not. This sounds like 100x more complicated compared to REST.')
