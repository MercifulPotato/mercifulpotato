Item(by='liversage', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605195670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25070666, text='I&#x27;m Danish so i only know the Danish version but I think it&#x27;s the same word as in Swedish. The Danish word is &quot;neger&quot; and the best translation to English would be &quot;negro&quot; (Pippi&#x27;s dad is the &quot;negro king&quot; or &quot;negerkonge&quot;).<p>Today it&#x27;s a controversial word because by many it&#x27;s considered racist almost like the n-word. However, especially older people don&#x27;t consider it racist and they use it to describe people that otherwise might be described as &quot;black&quot;.<p>Newer revisions of the Pippi books have been edited to no longer use the word &quot;neger&quot; and I think this applies to both the Danish and Swedish editions (it was approved by Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s daughter).')
