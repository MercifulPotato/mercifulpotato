It&#x27;s possible my memory is flawed:<p><pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; vec = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; mtx = np.eye(3)\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(vec, mtx)\n    array([1., 2., 3.])\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; np.dot(mtx, vec)\n    array([1., 2., 3.])\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s possible though that I was remembering not that it doesn&#x27;t execute, but rather that if you do mess up the multiplication order and do it in the wrong direction with anything besides trivial diagonal matrices, you won&#x27;t get a type error, you will get an incorrect but valid result, which is arguably worse than a type error, and way more frustrating, especially if start by testing eye, which is the easiest thing to do.')
