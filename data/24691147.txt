Item(by='daramasala', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1601926338, title='Ask HN: Using 3rd party API as a source of events', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi,\nMy app polls a 3rd party API for data about soccer leagues.\nThe API is a simple REST API and only gives me the current state of the resource.<p>I want to convert this data to events so I can consume them as a stream.<p>I am facing a few issues:<p>1. I can&#x27;t create meaningful events. E.g. I can&#x27;t say &#x27;Game-Finished&#x27; because in any particular request I might get several unrelated changes that all happened during the polling interval. So all my events will be &#x27;Season-Updated&#x27; which is a code-smell for DDD, event-sourcing, etc.<p>2. In every request to the API, I get the full state. This gets unwieldy very fast. So I am planning to only save the diff between the new state and the last state in the event.<p>I really need to be able to restore the state to any point in time and sometimes add corrections (due to mistakes on the API part) or just replay the log of events to re-calculate my aggregators (due to bugs in my code). This is why I thought about event sourcing.<p>Does anyone have experience with converting 3rd party APIs into events? \nAm I going in a wrong direction here (since my events are all trivial - just Season-Updated)?\nIs there another architecture&#x2F;pattern that is a better fit for my requirements?')
