I was having an idea of creating an rss reader, but gave up because rss is almost dead<p>I provide an RSS feed for my blog at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.in&#x2F;</a> . From my access.log, I see there is a decent number of subscribers to my feed. Here is the data I could pull from it:<p><pre><code>  Feedly          56 subscribers\n  Inoreader       17 subscribers\n  Feedbin          6 subscribers\n  NewsBlur         4 subscribers\n  The Old Reader   3 subscribers\n  BazQux           2 subscribers\n  WordPress        2 subscribers\n  ------------------------------\n  Total           90 subscribers\n</code></pre>\nI get about 4000-6000 hits to my website on a normal day. It increases by 5 to 10 times if a post hits the HN front page but I will talk about ordinary day traffic only here. From the HTTP referer (sic) information in the logs I can see that about 30-50 of those hits have a feed reader in the referer field, that is, at least 0.5%-0.75% of the total hits are coming from users who clicked on a blog post link in their feed reader and landed on the website. It is a very small percentage but 30-50 hits per day from users consuming the feed and 90 subscribers to the feed are reasons good enough to keep the feed alive.')
