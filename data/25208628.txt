All three have a way better interface than this.<p>Nextcloud is more oriented towards storing files but recently gained tons of social features (video chat, messaging) and has since some time already document editing with LibreOffice online and a build in document editor. There are also tons of other features like LDAP integration, calendars, ...<p>Matrix&#x2F;Element is oriented towards messaging between organizations and inside organizations. Element also support video chat and contains an Etherpad integration for document editing.<p>BigBlueButton is not great for messaging but is excellent for video chatting. It scale a lot better for big rooms than Nextcloud and Matrix because it doesn&#x27;t use Jitst and WebRTC, but it doesn&#x27;t include any document editing.<p>So yeah OpenMeetings is not really a flagship open source software and I&#x27;m wondering how it ended up in the front page of HN.')
