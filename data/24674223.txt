Apple and Google (especially) are both showing signs of ossification.<p>One: I never said this. Two: this has nothing to do with &quot;free market will solve things&quot;<p>&gt; There is no reason an alternative, either from the community as a whole, or from a competitor could not be built over the next 10 years.<p>Once again: you bemoan that free market should be able to solve the problem of the duopoly. <i>It has already solved it</i>: by creating the duopoly. A free market will <i>always</i> tend towards monopolisation for the simple reason: the best way to stay alive is by destroying and&#x2F;or buying the competition. The many regulations (from antitrust law to basic things like food and safety regulations) have arisen <i>precisely</i> because free market never arrives at good solutions.<p>And even if a competitor arises, it will, once again, be a competitor with nearly unlimited power and money creating a yet another, you guessed it, duopoly or monopoly.<p>&gt; There is no reason an alternative, either from the community as a whole<p>&quot;Community as a whole&quot; does not &quot;build an alternative&quot;. &quot;Community as a whole&quot; is a nation&#x2F;country. So now you want government intervention for some reason.<p>&gt; If that seems like too long to wait, consider that it’s less time than it took for the current situation to arise.<p>The current situation took about 10 years to arise. And Apple and Google are quite deeply entrenched now. So now you&#x27;re taking a number out of the blue, and pretend it&#x27;s a given. Try this for size: &quot;there&#x27;s no reason an alternative could not be built in the next 50 years&quot;. Just as out of the blue. Doesn&#x27;t sound too good now, does it?')
