There was not too much resources than to learn from about it. I was visiting the bookstore several times to read at least some pages. But since it was several books, each over 1000 pages long, i had to buy them to read in full.<p>I didn&#x27;t find a way to earn money for these books, and eventually lacked the knowledge to pursuit the dream of making video games.<p>Now i am over 30 years old, and regret I didn&#x27;t read these books than.<p>However, if it comes to my dev career, i wished I have read earlier books about these topics:<p>- effective communication\n- leadership\n- getting things done, the book\n- design\n- user experience\n- psychological books<p>It does not mean classical, technical and craft books are not important. I have red just a lot of these when I was young.<p>But these above would help me shape my career in a better way, enjoy it more and focus on the important stuff.')
