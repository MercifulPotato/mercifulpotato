I&#x27;m used to seeing &quot;indices&quot; in a mathematical context, referring to an object that labels a particular subobject of another object.<p>It seems a lot like the difference between &quot;vertices&quot; and &quot;nodes&quot; in a graph.  Go to the math department, and you&#x27;ll hear people talking about vertices.  Walk down the hall to the CS department, and it&#x27;s all nodes, all the time.<p>I have no idea why this is, but I suspect some kind of cultural thing.  Maybe the CS term and the math term originated independently?  Kind of like how you talk about machine learning in CS, but a good portion of ML would actually be classified as statistics by the math and stats departments.')
