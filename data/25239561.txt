They are 6 months into a 2 year plan to migrate all of their systems. I would expect the next version of M chips in 6 to 12 months with higher RAM limits and faster GPU. That would be targeted at their other laptops and the iMac. It will likely take longer for them to get to something that can be used in the Mac Pro and maybe an iMac Pro where RAM and GPU needs are even greater.')
