Some genres such as progressive metal &amp; djent find those sounds very useful!<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree with you, I find the bass frequencies on even standard-range guitars to not be all that useful. In my own music productions, that part of the spectrum belongs almost entirely to the kick drum &amp; bass guitar. However, once you cut out the low-end mud, the rest of the guitar sounds very good!')
