An app that compares prices of everything, will make it difficult for small businesses to compete. It wasn&#x27;t exactly illegal, but it could be made illegal, and violated the spirit of the Anti-Profiteering Act, especially as the nature of something being an unfair advantage is being determined by ministry that we talked to.<p>It was also somewhat illegal to display the prices of another place without the consent of that store. Stores didn&#x27;t exactly like giving out their prices either, because it&#x27;s meant to be a competitive advantage for some items to be loss leaders and some others are secretly expensive.<p>Illegal or not, it would have benefited one side and screwed another, and in the long term this would likely not go well.')
