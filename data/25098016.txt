Item(by='noisy_boy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605411386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25096840, text='I was a mediocre student in a decent university and I basically chose my course because bunch of older seniors we looked up to suggested that the course had good job &quot;prospects&quot;. The only thing I discovered from that course is that I loved writing code in Fortran while doing one of the electives (I actually wrote it on paper in my exam because we didn&#x27;t have access to computers). I call that my the most lucky and important break.<p>I never worked on anything related to what I mainly studied and am thankfully programming now (not in Fortran though) and know that this is what I wanted all along.')
