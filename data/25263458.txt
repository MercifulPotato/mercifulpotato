For example, in (asymptotic, worst-case) analysis of algorithms, the logical statements take the form &quot;there exists an algorithm to compute X with asymptotic complexity O(f(n)), and no algorithm with lower complexity exists.&quot; These are crisp notions with no room for debate.<p>In this competition, they defined &quot;solved&quot; as achieving 90% accuracy. This is somewhere in between the two definitions. It&#x27;s technically a valid problem statement, but it can become obsolete in a weird way. If someone else solves the problem of achieving 95% accuracy, then suddenly the 90% solution doesn&#x27;t look so good. Compare to e.g. sorting. If we add the requirement of a stable sort, it becomes a new problem. Stable sorting algorithms are not automatically &quot;better&quot; than unstable ones.')
