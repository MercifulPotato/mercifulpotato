If an increase in variance means that you get a +5 outlier 10x more often, then looking at a 10x longer timescale will mean that you see the +5 outlier roughly as often, making it seem &quot;less exceptional&quot;. The problem is that the exceptional thing is now happening 10x more often.<p>For example, Texas getting three &quot;500 year&quot; floods in 3 years. These were floods that were estimated to be a 0.2% probability in any given year. The fact that they are happening at much higher frequency is because the entire probability distribution has shifted (and expanded). Now if you improved your ability to peer into the past and found another &quot;500 year flood&quot; a few hundred years back, you&#x27;d be tempted to think everything is fine, when everything is decidedly <i>not</i> fine.')
