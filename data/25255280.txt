Item(by='IshKebab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606752821, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253070, text='&gt; but I will call them processes to stay close to Elixir&#x27;s naming convention.<p>That seems like an extremely confusing mistake given that there is already a very closely related concept called a &quot;process&quot;?<p>I would consider calling them &quot;workers&quot; or &quot;isolates&quot; since unless I&#x27;m mistaken, you have basically recreated WebWorkers (AKA isolates in V8&#x2F;Dart)?<p>Presumably this also means you can&#x27;t share memory? Very neat idea anyway!')
