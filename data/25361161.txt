If it’s only a handful of packages, the entire process of repackaging, testing, and deployment might be doable in a matter of days. If it’s tens or hundreds of packages that depend on each other, I think that’s a whole different story.  If those packages are maintained by different teams, it could take more than an year to complete the transition.<p>As for pinning packages, that’s only practical if you’re using Nix. As much as I prefer Nix over RPMs, not all of us have the pleasure of using Nix at work. It’s kind of a bummer because Nix packages are so much easier to work with and maintain compared to the competition.')
