Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25205306], score=None, time=1606263933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25204299, text='&gt;Not saying that Coinbase does this, but incoming wires&#x2F;ACH&#x2F;whatever continue to roll in during an outage, but they can stop the initiation of any outgoing xfers, and then be slow with them claiming a backlog.<p>That would only make sense if coinbase was down for several days at a time. If it was only down for a few hours then that&#x27;s nearly not enough time for enough money to flow in (aren&#x27;t wire transfers batched per day rather than processed in real time?). It also doesn&#x27;t answer my earlier question of &quot;why don&#x27;t they just stop pumping before they run out of money?&quot;.<p>&gt;A big Canadian exchange, quadrigacx that blew up ~2 years ago was doing all sorts of tricks like this.<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening at coinbase, but pointing to them being down when there&#x27;s high trading volume isn&#x27;t a convincing argument.')
