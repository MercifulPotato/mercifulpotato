And OP is clearly arbitrary in their reasoning. They suggested collective punishment and didn&#x27;t bother thinking through the implications of how that policy would be implemented and what unintended consequences it would have.<p>&gt;and all punishment occurs post hoc.<p>Post hoc rationalization for punishment. The actions taken were legal at the time, and OP argued that that shouldn&#x27;t stand in the way of punishing those individuals (or their descendants) today.')
