Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609264491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570611, text='&gt; But after taking into account all of my expenses, my adjusted gross income was only $19.<p>That&#x27;s not what adjusted gross income means. How much would anyone like to bet that the author&#x27;s Form 1040 line 8b or Form 1040-NR line 35 shows an adjusted gross income figure <i>substantially</i> higher than $19?')
