Then when we actually tried it we found every CRT was different on all of the platforms.  Even something as ubiquitous as printf I think I have encountered at least 8 different versions of it.  At least from compiler chain to compiler chain they are usually similar in calling conventions (but not always).  But try mixing a msvcrt with a glib one and you are in for some fun...<p>What is the nit of it is it <i>almost</i> works.  You have a good shot at getting it to compile in a short amount of time.  The rest of the work will be lots of time in ye old debugger and going over the docs for your platform.  The fun part is you <i>will</i> find bugs that were there already, or are they just part of the platform, or were you using it wrong?')
