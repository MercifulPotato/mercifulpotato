Don&#x27;t think so. Every time I take a quiz based on that it lands me near the center, yet I don&#x27;t resonate with any self-proclaimed centrist I&#x27;ve talked to.<p>&gt; FOX was created explicitly by Ailes and Murdoch to prevent a second Nixon style teardown of the GOP.<p>I don&#x27;t think the intent decades ago particularly matters compared with their actions presently, which are as aimed (at the level of the individual Fox employee) towards revenue and clicks as anyone - just going after a different market niche than MSNBC et al. The ownership is going after propaganda and narrative control, of course; the whole point of what I am saying is that both sides are doing that.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a capitalist enterprise only in the sense that it&#x27;s profitable as a side effect of their main goal.<p>The fact that you can&#x27;t see that that&#x27;s true of the other side of the media is very telling. WaPo and friends lose money every year, but will never, ever be shut down. What could the reason for that be, other than to use it as a propaganda mouthpiece?<p>Honestly. If you can turn on an MSM network right now and not hear the propaganda baked into every sentence, you need to turn off all media, read some old books, disconnect for a few months, and come back when you have a perspective wide enough to realize that both sides are being harmed, and having their animosity aimed at one another, rather than at anyone who is actually doing the harm.<p>(This may be easier for me to see as a non-American, of course. I shouldn&#x27;t blame someone who has been soaking in yank propaganda their whole lives for having difficulty taking off the blinders.)')
