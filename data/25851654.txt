I&#x27;ve finally managed to get away from Debian derivatives a few years back, but here are some specific complaints I can remember from my last job, managing about 1k Ubuntu servers.<p>- Installing a package on RH is always non-interactive.  To install packages reliably on Ubuntu, we had to set three separate &quot;Please just install the package, don&#x27;t try to ask questions&quot; options for different layers of the stack, and still occasionally ran into buggy packages that would hang the installation waiting for a nonexistent user to type something.<p>- On RH, when I try to install or upgrade an RPM that&#x27;s missing dependencies, it gives me an error and refuses to break my system unless I specify --force.  With debian, there&#x27;s no way to query &quot;Are the dependencies for this .deb satisfied&quot; that I could ever find, and &quot;dpkg -i foo.deb&quot; will instead leave it &quot;half-installed&quot;, and your package database is broken until you manually fix it.<p>- I really missed an equivalent of `rpm -V` (list files in an installed RPM that have been modified since installation).  Asking Google now, I see that there&#x27;s `debsums` which can handle some of this; I don&#x27;t recall whether I failed to find that before, or if there was some other reason I didn&#x27;t use it at the time.<p>- On RH, automated installation with kickstart is fantastic and comprehensive.  It&#x27;s well-documented, and has just worked for every configuration I&#x27;ve thrown at it.  Debian&#x27;s preseed is severely under-documented, and many combinations of features are just unimplemented and silently didn&#x27;t work.  For example, you can reserve unallocated disk space from a raw partition, but that&#x27;s ignored for LVM, so to keep space free for snapshots in my volume group, I had to configure a &quot;delete_me&quot; volume, and then later delete it.<p>- Red Hat&#x27;s SELinux support is fantastic.  Ubuntu&#x27;s choice of apparmor and deficient SELinux support has been annoying.<p>- I&#x27;ve personally found Red Hat&#x27;s packages to be higher-quality.  The biggest defect I remember finding in Ubuntu&#x27;s repos was a service whose init script was literally copied from Red Hat, which didn&#x27;t work, as it tried to source a file of init script utility functions which doesn&#x27;t exist on Ubuntu, among other issues.<p>- Red Hat&#x27;s documentation is fantastic.  Ubuntu&#x27;s documentation is, uh... sometimes present.<p>- I&#x27;ve found building RPMs to be much simpler and much-better-documented than the process of building debian packages.  I vaguely remember being repeatedly frustrated at debian packaging that felt like &quot;this magic thing just interferes and does special stuff when this case is detected&quot;, vs RPM&#x27;s &quot;it just does what the spec file says to do&quot;, but I can&#x27;t remember any details or examples.<p>- I&#x27;ve had a much easier time building yum repositories than building debian repositories.  Just dump a bunch of RPMs in a directory, run createrepo, serve over HTTP.  I failed to find something similarly-simple for apt repos.<p>- Red Hat family had systemd way earlier, and with way better support and integration, than Debian family.  While I do agree that there are some implementation issues with systemd, it&#x27;s been a huge usability and quality-of-life improvement for me professionally.<p>To me, Debian has always felt like it&#x27;s designed for someone administering a small number of long-lived pets with a variety of special circumstances, which really isn&#x27;t what I want professionally.  Red Hat has felt like it&#x27;s engineered for use-cases I care about.')
