If there was a $2&#x2F;month fee for &quot;power users&quot; instead, letting you host your own... I would most likely get a subscription for the convenience of using their better integrated software.<p>Those features may require extra engineering and support effort, not less.<p>(Even if these changes actually reduced the cost of service delivery, it&#x27;s usually a small part of the price. In consumer SaaS, you&#x27;re not paying for the cost of goods sold, you&#x27;re paying for everything else - particularly software engineering, support, and marketing AKA customer acquisition. A reasonable analogy is a restaurant, where 20-30% of the meal price goes to food costs. In consumer SaaS, the &quot;food cost&quot; is often 10%-20% of the &quot;meal price.&quot;)')
