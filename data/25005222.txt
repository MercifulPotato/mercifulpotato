Take-home pay would be in the region of 2.5-4.5k most likely.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of whining about the high taxes here, but honestly this is not a European way of thinking. You are safe here. You have a safety net if things don&#x27;t go right in your work or health.<p>Taxes are also super simple. You tell the tax office your predicted income, you get a percentage and give it to your employer. You don&#x27;t have any other dealings with them unless you need to adjust it due to change in income, or you have some expenses to lower your tax percentage before the end of the tax year. It&#x27;s highly efficient and works well.')
