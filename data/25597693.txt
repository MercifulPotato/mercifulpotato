(Not sure if OP&#x27;s job is white collar, but her Twitter bio suggests it is.)<p>The excuse I always hear is that if they don&#x27;t work that hard, they&#x27;ll get fired and replaced with someone who does.  I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true for some jobs, but a) it&#x27;s likely very few of them, and b) why would you want to work for&#x2F;with people who have so little respect for you and your health in the first place?<p>Sure, promotions might come less often and raises might be smaller, but that&#x27;s a trade off you can consciously make: more money, or better health and family&#x2F;friend relationships.  And you also set an example for your peers: if they start complaining about their health or about burnout, you can show them that it&#x27;s a problem that can be solved.  And the more that people do this, the more people will realize it&#x27;s possible and the right thing to do.<p>And yes, there are some who live paycheck to paycheck, hold multiple jobs, will take any job they can get, and don&#x27;t have much choice.  I&#x27;m not talking about people like that... though that is another conversation that should be had more often; no one should have to be stuck in a situation like that, but so many are!  And yes, there&#x27;s unfortunately sexism and racism involved; I expect women and POC will get looked upon less favorably if they set stronger boundaries than white men will.  But I don&#x27;t see that as an argument to destroy your health.')
