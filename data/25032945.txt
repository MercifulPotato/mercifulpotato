On the one hand, it requires people to have a Facebook account to use the Oculus Quest 2, on the other hand, it considers inactive Facebook accounts to be fake and bans them.<p>So everybody who buys a Quest has to create a Facebook account, which subsequently gets banned for inactivity. To be able to use a Quest, you actually need to be active on Facebook.<p>Basically only buy a Quest if you really like Facebook.')
