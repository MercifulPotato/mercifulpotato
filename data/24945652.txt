If I saw a Sierra logo on a game as a kid, I knew I wanted it and I knew it would be quality. Lots of interactions, puzzles, and outcomes especially compared to what I was playing on console. I still think about how I could have plotted my course on Codename Iceman more accurately. I miss these games, I miss the style, I miss the casual aspect of not being a button mashing or accuracy god which I am no longer.')
