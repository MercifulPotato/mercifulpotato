My strategy for interacting with any authority with disproportionate power over me is to tend towards normalcy so I was pretty rapidly complying with the mask swap.<p>A friend of mine postulated that they couldn&#x27;t hear me through my mask, but as I took it off and was swapping I said &quot;I&#x27;m complying, I&#x27;m complying, I&#x27;m not arguing&quot; in a conciliatory tone, it didn&#x27;t seem to help. I was playing the 100% doormat. Didn&#x27;t stop the attendant from saying to me as I was leaving to go to my seat: &quot;It&#x27;s not that dangerous&quot;.<p>I can only guess that they encounter people who do insist or that they are on web forums &#x2F; chat groups with other attendants who have encountered people who do argue and so they&#x27;re primed for someone like that. Puzzling interaction, to be honest. It was the first time I&#x27;ve had any sort of negative interaction with a service professional.')
