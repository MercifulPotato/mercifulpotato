Most companies have standard legal contracts for all employees. Changing them is expensive because they need to pay lawyers and convince managers. On the other hand, asking for more salary is a question that pretty much any manager deals with regularly. So I usually do that. I find that there’s a dollar value I can put on most legal clauses as long as I understand them. If I can’t put a dollar value on it, and it really makes me uncomfortable (after speaking to my lawyer) Id just walk away.')
