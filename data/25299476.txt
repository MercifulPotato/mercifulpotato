Item(by='Chris2048', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607061453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25289964, text='&gt; It&#x27;s basically a solved problem<p>It is, or isn&#x27;t solved depending on how the problem is stated.<p>The problem of food <i>policing</i> is solved, not the problem of food <i>needing</i> to be policed. In reality, places are constantly shut down for violations. The deterrent only deters people serving food unsafely, it doesn&#x27;t kill the motivation - people motivated to serve unsafe food still exist, they just choose not to (or are prevented from doing so).<p>When police arrest a criminal, we say they did their job - we don&#x27;t say they failed their job b&#x2F;c the criminal existed in the first place. Sure, good policing deters criminality, but it&#x27;s not really the only goal. the true eradication of motivation to commit crime are usually totally different social factor that has nothing to do with the police. In a similar vein, it&#x27;s not really the fire departments job to prevent fires.<p>The real question is: is bias the same kind of thing. On that basis I&#x27;d ask &quot;what kind of bias&quot; - that is, does D&amp;I cover<i>any</i> kind of human bias, or is it more specific. If you are talking about historical generation biases, for example, that <i>might</i> vary based on societal attitudes in general.')
