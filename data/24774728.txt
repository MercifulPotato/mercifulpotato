The viewer gets a satisfying arc.<p>Netflix just pulls the plug. This means you get a weird kludged together final episode to try to pull stuff together or they just leave it and there&#x27;s no resolution for a lot of stuff.<p>I do agree that many of these shows would be better if they were written in the UK style. A lot of US shows now just feel woolly as they meander through the plot.')
