Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603831998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911673, text='&gt;Facebook produces disproportionately more engagements for right-wing sites<p>Bull.<p>America is a country where any given election 50% vote Democrat and 50% vote Republican. Look at the chart. Look at the total number of left-wing vs right-wing sites. I bet if you add those up, total left-wing engagements will dwarf the number of total right-wing engagements. Looks to me that engagement is skewed towards left-wing, it&#x27;s just that there are way more left-wing outfits so individual share is lower. Which makes sense, there is one major right-wing news network, Fox News, there&#x27;s like 10 that are center-left&#x2F;left wing which have to share the audience.')
