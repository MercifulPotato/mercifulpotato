It&#x27;s also interesting that the tendency is to do the opposite: if it&#x27;s your code you may not want to trash it completely and instead work on an incremental refactor, while if the codebase is foreign it&#x27;s tempting to just get rid of it and do it your way.<p>Anecdotally I&#x27;ve been recoding from scratch one of my applications at work (converting from python to rust) and while it&#x27;s a lot of work and it put new features on hold in the meantime I&#x27;m fairly optimistic that it&#x27;s going to be a big win in the long term. Not only will the Rust code perform better and be more maintainable, the rewrite lets me address architectural flaws with the previous solution, some caused by lack of foresight and others by tacked-on features that weren&#x27;t expected when the code was originally designed.')
