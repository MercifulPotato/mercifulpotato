Maybe they&#x27;ll even taste better than regular meat, by controlling the skin&#x2F;fat&#x2F;muscle distribution. The current technology isn&#x27;t there, yet. But it looks like that it&#x27;s actually going to be feasible in the next few decades.<p>I&#x27;m no biologist or environmental scientist. To my naive understanding, it&#x27;s going to be a good thing. It means that we&#x27;ll meddle with the animals less, reduce the environmental impact, and also make high-quality, fresh meat more accessible.<p>No more Chef Ramsay proffering a piece of filet mignon and saying, &quot;Now, <i>this</i>, is the Rolls-Royce of steak&quot;.')
