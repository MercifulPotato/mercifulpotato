First two paragraphs summarize my feelings and the rest is honestly for the site author&#x27;s consideration as to the experience of a complete stranger to their site.  I wish them the best.</i><p>I was actually moved by the author&#x27;s plight.  Their current situation seems very helpless and I truly respect the effort to swim upstream with a principled approach to delivering a service in a market that is rife with shenanigans.  I personally tend to get sucked into analysis paralysis when purchasing new products and any quality signal I can get outside of what is placed in front of me is extremely valuable.  Probably to amplify the author&#x27;s point, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve <i>ever</i> heard of his site and it&#x27;s not recognizable to me.  One of my favorites for quite some time, Wirecutter, has lost all of my faith after a few buys based on their findings wound up being garbage.<p>I say all of that to try to underscore the fact that I&#x27;m only trying to be productive, but without this backstory and the author&#x27;s attestation to everything they do to maintain integrity, I wouldn&#x27;t find this site remarkable or memorable or compelling in any way.  I appreciate the design, it&#x27;s clean and fast, but in reviewing several of the product areas that I&#x27;ve actually been looking at recently I can&#x27;t find anything compelling in the content that the site brings to the table.  To be blunt, it&#x27;s not obvious to me what the author does with their time if this is their bread and butter.<p>One example.  A few months ago I decided I wanted to upgrade the microphone I use for videoconferencing.  I wanted something that was fairly directional as I didn&#x27;t want to have the microphone in the view of the camera and I was hoping for a relatively flat frequency response.  I was also on the bubble about going with a USB microphone vs getting an XLR mic and USB audio interface, and comparing them by pivoting on that feature was useful to me.<p>Here is the list of Good Cheap and Fast streaming microphones (which seems relevant) on goodcheapandfast.com:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodcheapandfast.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;best-streaming-microphones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodcheapandfast.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;best-streaming-mic...</a><p>Let&#x27;s assume I get to that URL from a Google search result and this is my first an only impression.  Right off the drop I notice a few things (i&#x27;m on a PC):<p>- Design is spartan and the site loads quickly.  I can&#x27;t actually tell that there are no ads b&#x2F;c my ad blocking game is on point.<p>- There isn&#x27;t an obvious brand, the site logo is understated and loses the battle with the headline for any attention.<p>- My eyes instead fall to the blue badge on the right &#x27;Real Customer Reviews &amp; Ratings [VERIFIED]&#x27;.  This primes my expectation that I&#x27;m going to be seeing some verified reviews.<p>Maybe this is just me, but I don&#x27;t start by reading the text.  I start scanning down the page<p>.<p>.<p>.\n<i>Omnidirectional</i>  I see this, see Cardioid is next and realize it&#x27;s just a mini tutorial on pickup patterns, not going to read it.<p>.<p>.<p>.\n<i>Dynamic v Condenser</i> more tutorial stuff (let&#x27;s be honest, in my head i&#x27;m thinking more copy&#x2F;paste)<p>.<p>.<p>.\n<i>How much does a good...cost.</i>  Not really interested in reading a paragraph on this...i have no idea what it says.<p>.<p>.<p>.\n<i>Pyle USB PC Recording Condenser Microphone (PDMIUSB50)</i> \nPyle?  Interesting pick for the top of the list.  Solid value brand in amplifiers but not really known for anything in recording...but maybe they have a sleeper in this microphone, let&#x27;s see those &#x27;verified reviews&#x27;<p>.<p>.<p>.\n<i>Fifine K669B USB Metal Condenser Recording Microphone</i><p>.<p>What?  The next microphone already?  This is where I stop scrolling.  My eyes turn up and I see the entirety of the assessment of the Pyle microphone<p><pre><code>    Good Value: $56 | Great Deal: $50\n    \n    Check Current Price on Amazon | Check Current Price on Walmart\n    \n    Pyle&#x27;s plug-and-play USB microphone is durable, sensitive and clear, \n    according to several online customers. Some reviewers warn that the mute \n    button makes an audible pop; others wish the stand was more durable.\n</code></pre>\nIn my mind i hear &#x27;what the hell?&#x27;  Where are the verified reviews?  Where is the detail?  All I see is an unsupported price range of good and great deal, affiliate links and a throwaway blurb that indicates they read a few reviews.<p>OK, I click around a bit looking for a more detailed review of this product.  Nothing.  I grab the scroll bar and drag up and down the page, more of the same.<p>And then I leave. Sorry.<p>Again, I really empathize with the authors situation and respect their philosophy, but without some reason to really really drill into what is being presented the site is a non-starter.')
