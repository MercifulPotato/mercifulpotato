Going to the moon, propulsive my landing, and propulsively taking off and returning to Earth takes more dV than just a boost to Mars. If you think about it boosting to Luna and Mars aren’t much different in dV, but then you have lunar landing and takeoff again to do. Even with a very thin atmosphere, you can still shed the vast majority of your interplanetary velocity with aero braking at Mars.<p>As a result the Lunar variant actually needs a lot more fuel delivered to it than the Mars version. Even one full refuel in LEO isn’t enough, and it needs to boost part way to an intermediate elliptical orbit and get another top up.')
