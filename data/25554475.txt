Taken in isolation it is indeed horrendous. But zeroing in on this event downplays the brutality of the other events within China, both by other Europeans and by various Chinese over the past 200 years. Its a distortion of history. \nTo give an example for a number of decades in china there have been 1000s of films about Japan&#x27;s invasion of China. How many have there been on Britians cruelty to the chinese?\nEncouraging a demonising of a nation is not something I can support.')
