It’s really easy to fragment memory, and for long running embedded systems it’s not uncommon for free() to be a nop. I had to implement malloc just last week to access psram, and after doing a little research decided all I needed was an offset and some byte alignment. Since I never needed to deallocate the memory, it was very simple code.')
