My mother owns a HP Spectre X2 convertible with an Intel WiFi card. Only the driver bundled with the Windows works. Any newer version via Windows Update or Intel breaks the card after a standby-wake cycle. Both updated drivers support the card on paper but, either the driver has a problem or the way the hardware designed on that particular computer messes some stuff up. BIOS upgrade didn&#x27;t fix anything too.<p>&gt; Are you talking about that &quot;little&quot; issue where the i915 module was randomly causing a panic?<p>No, I started to see some lines in the display like a faulty GPU draws. Sometimes a line, sometimes small corruptions were visible but, it was always fixed itself after a minute or two. The laptop in question is extremely low power so, nothing gets hot.<p>Newer kernel updates fixed these issues too.<p>Intel&#x27;s mid-range and higher-end NICs have proper offloading and processors so, they neither tax the system much or fail to reach their advertised speeds. They&#x27;re <i>real</i> cards for <i>real</i> loads, so they&#x27;re more reliable AFAICS. A Realtek card works reasonably well for most of the light loads but, load it up with sustained high load, it cannot saturate the interface as it should.')
