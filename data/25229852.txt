It seems to be worse when using a VPN or a browser like Firefox (or some privacy extension) that blocks Google tracking.<p>I understand why people use reCaptcha and that it works well for some users, but it can be a pain in the butt if you don&#x27;t use Chrome, aren&#x27;t logged in to your Google account, or if other devices in the network did something that Google doesn&#x27;t like.
