I like it but my wife hated it. So I went to return it and Amazon said I could keep it. Put it in a guest bedroom, whatever I wanted. Refunded me the $400. I’m laying on it right now and sometimes feel guilty, but my wife is sleeping on our old queen sized bed so I guess I don’t feel that guilty, since eventually I’ll still need to get a mattress she likes.')
