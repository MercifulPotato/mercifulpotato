The challenges to doing this are three fold\n1. Operating Systems like Linux, Windows, etc... aren&#x27;t designed to do this, and can&#x27;t without a design change.\n2. Applications need to be reworked a bit so that they are given file handles instead of telling the OS what files to open.  It can looks the same to the user if done correctly.\n3. The adoption curve is long on this one.... but systems like Genode are getting there... I look forward to using it sometime in the next year for experimenting.')
