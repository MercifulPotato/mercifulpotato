It&#x27;s not a codified difference and the degrees you get are the same, but it exists somewhat informally.<p>As an example, in San Diego, the two top universities are UCSD and SDSU. UCSD is much more prestigious but SDSU teaches more practical skills, for example while SDSU biology students have 3 years of laboratory experience, UCSD students will have 2&#x2F;3rds of one year of laboratory experience. Actually labs will not even consider UCSD students when hiring because they have so little practical knowledge. UCSD students are expected to go on to get professional degrees or higher academic degrees.<p>In general, in California, &quot;University of California&quot; schools are known to be academic while &quot;California State Universities&quot; are known to be practical. This was somewhat codified in the <i>California Master Plan for Higher Education</i>, where the top eighth of students would go to the UC schools and the top third would go to CSU schools[0].<p>I don&#x27;t know if other states are the same.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_Master_Plan_for_Higher_Education#Purpose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_Master_Plan_for_Hig...</a>')
