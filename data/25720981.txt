If you&#x27;re wrong, the bigger instance size or more instances isn&#x27;t that much more expensive.<p>For almost every other service, you have to estimate some other much more detailed metric: number of http requests, bytes per message, etc. When you haven&#x27;t yet written the software, those details can be very fuzzy, making the whole estimation process extremely risky - it could be cheaper than EC2, it could be 10x more, and we won&#x27;t really know until we&#x27;ve spent at least a coulple months writing code. And let&#x27;s hope we don&#x27;t pivot or have our customers do anything in a way we&#x27;re not expecting..')
