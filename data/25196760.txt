Item(by='dotancohen', descendants=None, kids=[25196857], score=None, time=1606209961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196685, text='After taking the survey, I must express two things that I&#x27;ve realized during the survey.<p>For one, my personal preference may not be the chest that is &quot;more aesthetically pleasing&quot; even though that is what the survey explicitly asks for. There are considerations other than aesthetics that should be considered. In my opinion, instead of the survey showing two cases (one perfect, one slightly afflicted), the survey should show just the afflicted chest and ask &quot;is this aesthetically pleasing or not&quot;. Of course the perfect chest is more pleasing, but that does not mean that there was any problem requiring intervention on the other chest.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that asymmetry with regards to breast size really are not a problem (for me), even in extreme cases. I&#x27;ve noticed this asymmetry in many women who have not had breast cancer or other afflictions. However, nipple asymmetry does stand out, especially vertical asymmetry. Two nipples at different heights does look terrible, and if aesthetics are an issue then I could understand performing surgery for those cases.')
