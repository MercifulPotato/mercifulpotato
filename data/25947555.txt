My understanding is that that vote is largely procedural and that the losing side voting against it as a protest is common in every election. If you take away that context it makes for a great narrative in this election (the whole histrionic overthrow theme), but context often matters.<p>My understanding could be wrong, though. I couldn&#x27;t quickly put my hands on the historical voting record. Or maybe that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re referring to.')
