Quick story: about 10 years ago I walked over to the Library of Congress with two friends from Virginia, and we walked across the street in the middle of the block. There was an officer way down on the corner and he <i>screamed</i> at us &quot;HEY! No jaywalking!&quot; and we hustled across as quickly as we could and went inside the library, looking at each other with puzzled glances. It never occurred to any of us that we simply couldn&#x27;t walk across the street, and all of us are from the northeast US corridor. I&#x27;m a US citizen and that was the first time and the last time that anyone has scolded me for jaywalking (just so the EU people reading this understand: it&#x27;s not usually enforced here <i>except</i> in the biggest cities).')
