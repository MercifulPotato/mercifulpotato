I&#x27;m no professional, but I also had difficulties with using both hands, involuntarily movements and fatigue in different parts of the body.<p>Best thing I done was just to practice, practice and more practice. Practice with one hand first until you know it without thinking, then add the other hand slowly. Same goes from drums (and other instruments I&#x27;m assuming), start slowly until you know it by heart, then speed up.<p>No strict schedule, I just play when I feel like it. If I want something intense I play drums. If I feel like melodies, I play piano. Otherwise I mostly use a Novation Circuit and Octatrack (and some other smaller gadgets for bass lines etc) for playing electronic music, mostly just improvisation.')
