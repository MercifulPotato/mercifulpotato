Conspiracy theories, FOMO and interpersonal toxicity existed long before social media, in roughly the same proportions. FB can prevent overt scammers and bad actors from using their platform, but that&#x27;s about it. Any organization with the thinnest patina of legitimacy can and should be able to participate.<p>Running a scam business tends to be low expense. They don&#x27;t have much to invest in other than advertising, which is why scams dominate low value ad inventory. I don&#x27;t blame facebook for this. It&#x27;s just part of running one of history&#x27;s largest advertising businesses.<p>I understand that many of us here aren&#x27;t fond of social media, but the majority of humans really like it. And they bring with them all of the worst (and best) aspects of social interaction. I don&#x27;t blame facebook for that, either.<p>Being angry at social media companies is like being angry at the mirror because you don&#x27;t like your appearance. Facebook isn&#x27;t the cause of humanity&#x27;s problems. It&#x27;s just the means by which we&#x27;re observing them.')
