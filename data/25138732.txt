Would there be a reasonable argument to change it at that point?<p>If you say &quot;yes&quot; then you agree there is a line somewhere.  If that&#x27;s the case then we should discuss where the line should be and why it should be there instead of saying &quot;stop [worrying] about being politically correct&quot;.<p>If you say &quot;no&quot; then your argument is that <i>no</i> words are too offensive to use or we shouldn&#x27;t care if people are offended by any term at all.  Which is an argument that you&#x27;re free to have but if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening then make that argument and advocate for why it would be ok to use the n-word as a terminology as well.<p>I think that in these discussions it&#x27;s easy to get sidetracked because people are actually arguing different points without realizing it.  You&#x27;re talking about the same scenario but you&#x27;re arguing from different premises which means there&#x27;s no hope of coming to a shared understanding because you&#x27;re not actually talking about what you disagree on.')
