Item(by='abernard1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603130888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828920, text='&gt; There are plenty of areas with much more forest per square km that are not up in flames year after year, but they&#x27;re just as impacted by the global climate.<p>And not only that, but California didn&#x27;t use to have this problem.  It used to be that as a condition for allowing loggers to harvest trees (1 out of 200), they&#x27;d have to clear the underbrush.<p>It is zero cost to fix this problem.  There would be more trees and fewer fires if CA just allowed the policies they had in the 90s.  Unbelievable incompetence.')
