It is somewhat in their interests as owners to have ineffective hearings.<p>They are fully capable of getting experts involved before hearings to ensure they ask the right questions-- even if the Congressperson isn&#x27;t all that technical themselves. And they know this. They aren&#x27;t unintelligent people.')
