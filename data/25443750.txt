I use yabai as a replacement but it really is a hack. It works great, and I much prefer it over the suboptimal window management shortcuts&#x2F;techniques that macos provides. However, it is much slower than i3wm, which is a lot more native than yabai which is a scripting layer over window management.<p>I really wish MacOS would just open up.')
