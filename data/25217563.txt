I can&#x27;t be bothered to explain how compiler optimizations work so I usually just resort to &quot;it&#x27;s magic&quot; when it comes to performance.<p>Going from a statically typed language to using python to do number crunching genuinely makes me want to vomit. I don&#x27;t understand how people convince themselves that it&#x27;s productive to write so many tests and (say) check types at runtime etc.<p>I actually love Python&#x27;s syntax but the language design seems like it was thrown together over a weekend.')
