The abuse of DMCA requests should be addressed, namely by prohibiting algorithmically generated requests and by treating repeated bogus  DMCA takedown requests in a way similar to commercial copyright infringement.<p>Just letting companies take down whatever they like in whatever way they want is not the right solution. They are basically &quot;information utilities&quot; and provide public goods of a value to society that goes beyond those company&#x27;s personal advertisement income.')
