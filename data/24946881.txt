I did not post their names in an attempt to provide &quot;ammunition in an argument or to rile up a public posse against them&quot;, I did it because they refused to sign their names and I saved people the step of having to dig into it themselves. I simply copy-pasted their (public) information, this is not &quot;personal details&quot; these are numbers and emails associated with their organization. Should all of the other comments that link to the same page (with the information I copy-pasted) be removed as well? I&#x27;m genuinely confused by this. Is tim@apple.com also considered &quot;personal details&quot; in a thread about an unpopular move by Apple? I&#x27;m trying to figure out where the line is here.')
