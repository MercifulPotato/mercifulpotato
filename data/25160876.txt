It seems like an mRNA vaccine is more akin to food you consume that produces a desired effect, rather than something permanently sticking around in your body. It doesn&#x27;t permanently modify your genetics.<p>mRNA is usually produced by DNA and is temporarily used by cells to create proteins. In this case, the mRNA is used to create proteins with a similar structure to the coronavirus. These proteins produce the desired immune response but do not harm you. Like other proteins, they don&#x27;t stick around permanently, just the immune response does. Additionally, the mRNA itself only lasts several minutes to days. [0]<p>It&#x27;s a relatively simple biological process that&#x27;s well understood. This gives me a lot of confidence in its safety profile. Unlike a regular vaccine, you also don&#x27;t have to create the protein directly, which leads to fewer errors during production from my understanding. You&#x27;re producing a simpler, more basic compound, and can be more certain about the quality of individual doses.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messenger_RNA#Degradation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Messenger_RNA#Degradation</a>')
