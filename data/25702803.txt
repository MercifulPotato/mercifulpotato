It&#x27;s quite strange reading many now-ageing compiler texts talking about 386 as a wacky ISA soon to die out.<p>Illumos and the BSDs seem to be doing okay, and ARM is huge. The x86 family didn&#x27;t die out but it <i>is</i> wacky.<p>&gt; I really want an Alpha box to play with, partly out of curiosity but partly to feel like a real man programming with next to no memory consistency.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure ARM will give you that.')
