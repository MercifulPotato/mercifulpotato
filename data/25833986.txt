The chances of getting into any of them are very low these days, some schools get thousands of apps for 100-200 spots, leaving an acceptance rate of 5-10%. I&#x27;d wager they WANT this to improve their &quot;Newsweek&quot; Ratings, shake my head, think of all the shortages of doctors are bright-eyed 23 year olds who get rejected and have to repeat the process, all to maintain exclusivity (and due to limits on how many residents&#x2F;interns we can train at once).<p>I didn&#x27;t apply to the top-tier schools. I knew my GPA would be an algorithmic non-starter, a human wouldn&#x27;t even look at a GPA under 3.5 in many schools. Also, I&#x27;m a white male biological sciences major, not exactly a rare type for medical schools applicants.<p>Keep in mind, UChicago Bio Sciences had courses I was required to take, that had graduate students and actual medical students in them, that had the median student with an 80 average. How sadistic is that? A classroom full of brilliant students, and half of them will get C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s? You can guess which half I was in...<p>In the end, it may have been a blessing, because MD school is VERY expensive and time-consuming, and I would&#x27;ve been a poor doctor like family medicine or pediatrician, so I&#x27;d be financially way worse off and probably a lot more stressed if I had succeeded down that path.')
