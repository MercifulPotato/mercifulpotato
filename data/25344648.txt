We&#x27;re preparing to roll it out to billions.  That&#x27;s not &quot;significant testing&quot;.  If there was a 1 in 500,000 side effect, you&#x27;d never see it in the trials.<p>And yes, these vaccines are doing something &quot;magical&quot;.  We&#x27;ve never had an mRNA vaccine rolled out to the general public before.<p>That said, I think the risk is manageable.  The FDA and EMA will be monitoring closely for side effects and is prepare to adjust as necessary.<p>But don&#x27;t underestimate the risks.')
