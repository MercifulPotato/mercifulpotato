The drs would then think &quot;why more pain med, they are already on some?&quot;<p>No, that&#x27;s not seeker behavior. An &#x27;extreme&#x27; example of seeker behavior would be to take the pills home, and try to come up with the best excuse possible to have &#x27;lost&#x27; them.<p>&gt; or of they didn&#x27;t accept and take home the meds from the drs?<p>This is the scenario I&#x27;m talking about more. The problem is, if the patient comes back, depending on where the patient went, they might not get the same doctor as before (Thinking scenarios like urgent Care, ER, etc). And when you are in a lot of pain, you might not always think&#x2F;act rationally. Ironically your desire to deal with immediate severe pain could in fact look from the outside as someone going through withdrawls.')
