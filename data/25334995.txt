Don&#x27;t learn it. Maybe you can learn something about common lisp from reading the sugar compiler source code.<p>I agree with TurboHaskal. I too, learned Scheme first and liked it cos it was simpler&#x2F;purer etc. than Common Lisp.<p>When I finally learned Common Lisp, my only regret was that I hadn&#x27;t learned it earlier.<p>Common Lisp is not perfect, but it has a single standard. Very important. It&#x27;s very mature and battle tested.<p>The people who you&#x27;ll meet in the Common Lisp community are very smart and capable and you will learn a lot from them. I did.<p>Learning Scheme won&#x27;t hurt but I recommend Common Lisp. Great, free compilers, lots of libraries for everything and a great community.<p>But please, do not learn sugar :)')
