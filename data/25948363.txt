The very idea that you should have to &quot;earn a living&quot; is now bogus and should be thrown out.<p>I believe computers, software and technology in general should be used to bring about a post-historical Golden Age of peace and prosperity.[1]  Programs especially are a kind of wealth that can be copied for effectively zero cost.<p>So I would say that the urge to &quot;earn a living or build a company around open source&quot; is misguided.  If you want to write software and give it away for free, that&#x27;s awesome!  My advice is either be comfortable being really poor, or be wealthy already.  If you want to go from being poor to being wealthy by giving away copies of software, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you, to me that seems like an oxymoron.  It just seems like a weird idea.<p>Instead, let&#x27;s use the technology we already have to construct a new economy that provides a good quality of life for everyone automatically.<p>[1] Otherwise, what&#x27;s the goddamned point!?')
