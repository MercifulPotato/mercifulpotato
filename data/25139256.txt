Plus I can no longer assume that the default branch is `master`. I have to check for every project whether they are using `main` or `master`.<p>Maybe not a lot more effort, but it definitely <i>is</i> more effort, and for basically no gain. Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves that black people being targeted by the police care about Git branch names. Hell apparently nobody even cares that Git is called Git, which is definitely a ruder word than &quot;master&quot;.')
