Item(by='zepto', descendants=None, kids=[24793093], score=None, time=1602788742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24791563, text='It’s worth pointing out that ‘bias’ is a fairly meaningless word to be using here.<p>It’s pretty obvious that ‘Jedimind’ is biased, isn’t it?<p>As to my comment about ‘bugs’ etc.  I don’t think it takes much to confirm that statement.  Just look around online and in the press and then investigate in detail.<p>What you will find is some kernels of truth, plus a vast amount of telephone-game like inaccuracy.<p>This isn’t unique to Apple - it’s simply a feature of our current public discourse.<p>By raising this, I’m just pointing out that Apple is operating in that real world, so to expect them to operate idealistically is unrealistic.<p>As to me defending Apple - is it possible it only seems like this because my tone is less angry than some other people here?<p>Take another look at what I’ve said.<p>I don’t think you’ll find me anywhere saying their behavior is <i>justified</i> and you will find several places where I unequivocally say it’s wrong.<p>I don’t think this is any different to your final paragraph.<p>We can simultaneously think they are wrong, and try to understand what they are dealing with when they make their decisions.  These two things don’t have to be in conflict.<p>What I often see is the desire to make simplistic declarations that reduce Apple to some kind of demon where the wrong decisions or compromises they make are evidence that this is something fundamental about them to just rage about, rather than a problem to be understood.<p>I see this as a kind of self-deception, which I would prefer not to fall into.<p>When you look around the thread, where people are comparing Apple to the Gestapo and shrilly calling for them to be “smashed”, and their money confiscated and redistributed, do you really think that my ‘bias’ is the issue here?')
