If the 15% apps become pushed less that is no fun.<p>There is some benefit to a standard price market, most stores are 30% [1].  Tencent MyApp was even 55% until 2019 [1]. Epic Games is 12% but they said they are profitable around 7%-8% [1][2]. Steam, Sony, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon all 30%[1].<p>If everyone went to 15-20% across the board it would be better.  I am concerned about tiering of the market and down the line lower take apps being less pushed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;SimonCarless&#x2F;20200903&#x2F;369516&#x2F;Are_the_store_wars_really_upon_us.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;SimonCarless&#x2F;20200903&#x2F;369516...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;news&#x2F;341249&#x2F;Heres_why_the_Epic_Games_Store_takes_a_12_percent_revenue_cut_from_devs.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamasutra.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;news&#x2F;341249&#x2F;Heres_why_the_Epi...</a>')
