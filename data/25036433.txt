If you get the root motivation that RMS had for the &quot;freedom&quot; aspect of it, then that&#x27;s the same thing,<p>That&#x27;s revisionism : Open Source split from Free Software because they wanted to give freedom to companies to profit from it. With predictable consequencesâ€¦<p>&gt; but too many people read it as &quot;for free&quot;. Like apparently the author of this article. And that&#x27;s just wrong.<p>Indeed.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;selling.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;selling.en.html</a><p>And this is why &#x27;free&#x27; is a very bad adjective to use in this context. IMHO &#x27;libre&#x27; is way better.')
