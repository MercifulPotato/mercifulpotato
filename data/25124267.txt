Afro&#x2F;Cuban might have been better, but what I really meant was &quot;rhythmic structures influenced by African and&#x2F;or Cuban musical culture&quot;, which samba definitely was. That&#x27;s redundant in a way, because Cuban forms themselves are deeply indebted (if not directly playing) African forms, but my understanding is that there was a particular development&#x2F;expansion of things in Cuba (much as in Brasil) that is perhaps best understood as a new branch of the tree.   Samba doesn&#x27;t owe anything in particular to Cuban traditions, but does draw on other African percussive structures.')
