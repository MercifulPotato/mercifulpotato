They&#x27;re fun little conversation filler, but psychology isn&#x27;t a science.[1]<p>Plus, you make assumptions about what I&#x27;m saying is obvious and what the study actually showed.  At first when I got a GPS, I even noticed the effect of not knowing where I was, so I even tried to pay attention in case I didn&#x27;t want to use the GPS later.  I noticed that even paying attention, trying to learn, you just don&#x27;t engage the full set of neurons that you do when you&#x27;re struggling to do something yourself.  I still felt lost in situations where prior to a GPS I would have felt confident in my ability to navigate.<p>How could the study show that people were trying to learn when they were being told what to do?  You can&#x27;t control for that or see into their heads to see if they&#x27;re making the same efforts in the same ways.<p>This study makes the same mistake of tons of psychological studies.  It attempts to simplify mental processes or abstract them and then pretend that the simplification or abstraction stands in for some other mental process result.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;642218377&#x2F;in-psychology-and-other-social-sciences-many-studies-fail-the-reproducibility-te" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;6422183...</a>')
