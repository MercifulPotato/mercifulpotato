They consider all of these monikers to to be in a &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; context. To interpret: not all engineers are professional engineers, but all professional engineers are engineers, and they will fight tooth and nail for the P.Eng protection. Hence my question about &quot;Professional Engineer&quot; status.')
