It has been unfortunate to see the attacks on individuality when it&#x27;s the best way to view each other. Group identity has a long history of being evil and rationalizing inhuman or even dehumanizing treatment of out-groups. Liberty being associated with the individual, not a collective, is the peaceful path I believe.<p>The grand irony of concepts like intersectionality is that when you slice a person enough ways, you end up with an individual. But that leap just hasn&#x27;t been made it seems and I assume because there is power to be gained by forming and controlling a collective through the seduction of victimhood and grievance.')
