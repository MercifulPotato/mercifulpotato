Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25432244], score=None, time=1608010528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421653, text='&gt; I know that if one really believes in evolution, there is absolutely no reason to &quot;conserve a species&quot;. It makes absolutely no sense. Species come and go. Whatever species remain will evolve to acquire characteristics suitable for whatever changes happen... or perish. So why does everyone believe in conservation and in evolution? Because they don&#x27;t. But what if they believed in Noah&#x27;s arc? It would be terrible if one of the species that Noah himself picked to be on a boat were to go extinct because humans did something, wouldn&#x27;t it? That is exactly the reaction you see from all these westerners who allegedly &quot;believe&quot; in evolution.<p>The reason to conserve a species is because a biodiverse ecology is healthier. There is more competition so any organism (such as a disease-causing bacteria) is less able to cause a pandemic. Monocultures are susceptible to all sorts of problems that diverse ecologies are not.<p>How this interplays with evolution is that humans are in the position of unintentionally changing the environment drastically so that many species are now &#x27;unfit.&#x27; This is because evolution is descriptive, not prescriptive. It doesn&#x27;t tell you anything is good or bad about &#x27;fitness.&#x27; Fitness always refers to an environment. Given another environment, something else would be more fit to survive.<p>Conservation relies on an understanding of human power over the environment and a desire to maintain an environment that doesn&#x27;t succumb to the same problems we see with monocultures.')
