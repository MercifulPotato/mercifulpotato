So let&#x27;s say 8.75w&#x2F;core. A 5950X is slightly higher per core wattage.<p>The M1 has a maximum power consumption of 15.1w (13.8w + 1.3w) so for the high powered cores that is 3.45w&#x2F;core and a miniscule amount for the low power cores. A mac mini tops out at around 20w during 8-core CPU benchmarks. While a 5950X PC will draw around 96w at the wall when idle.<p>I know a Ryzen desktop CPU probably won&#x27;t necessarily draw its entire TDP but it is not in the same league as an low powered CPU such as the M1 or the latest Ryzen mobile CPUs in terms of power consumption.')
