And the most impactful solution is also one incompatible with growth-based consumer economy: <i>buy less stuff</i>.<p>Recycling won&#x27;t be an answer even if, through some miracle, everything would became fully recyclable in practice. The reason is that most materials cannot be recycled indefinitely - they degrade. On top of that, turning trash into input material usually consumes some non-recoverable matter (e.g. chemicals to clean and process it). Then there&#x27;s production waste that isn&#x27;t recoverable too. All of this adds up into continuous churn.<p>So with recycling, instead of a Mine-&gt;Manufacture-&gt;Use-&gt;Trash pipeline, you have... Mine-&gt;Manufacture-&gt;Use-&gt;Trash pipeline where a fraction of matter makes a cycle from Trash to Manufacture. Two perhaps not immediately obvious facts: one, that fraction of matter that gets recycled becomes a fraction of a fraction on its next cycle - which is a series that converges to 0. Two, none of this matters as long the pipeline itself is going through exponential growth. You may slow it a little, but it&#x27;s still exponential.')
