It&#x27;s closer to your neighbour selling you the rights to park in their garden, then you selling those rights to someone else. Far from a criminal, arrestable offence, so their point on the broad-brush of being &quot;illegal&quot; stands.<p>Even my closer analogy is still pretty far off and it&#x27;s much more innocent. Maybe closer to charging a fee to use a very tricky to figure out parking meter.')
