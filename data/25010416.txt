And academia has a way of putting the pressure on the young workforce (until tenure at 40ish) to work long hours for not much money.<p>And while this is true, it is also worth pointing out that many parents don&#x27;t want to pause their adult&#x2F;career goals for 3-6 months because of a new baby.  I recently had my first child and while she was little (now 10 months) she would sleep&#x2F;sit on my lap while I wrote code&#x2F;ran numerical experiments.  I had paternity leave, but I needed to keep working on something because I have an active mind.  Now I only worked 4ish hours a day instead of my usual 8-10 (and on side projects instead of work), but I wanted to continue working.  My wife who does graphic&#x2F;web design consulting  continued after the birth because it feels good to do adult things.  And she didn&#x27;t stop just because the baby was born she just dropped to 5ish hours a week which has slowly crept back up.')
