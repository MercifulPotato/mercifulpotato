But rarely is there good monitoring &amp; observability built in to that.<p>On the contrary, a proper RPC library tends to have those things built in. <i>If</i> your services are homogeneous enough that you can have everyone use the same RPC library, you can hook up that library&#x27;s monitoring, discovery etc. functionality, and achieve the benefits of service mesh with much less overhead.<p>IME it&#x27;s much the same for a lot of microservice scenarios - if your environment is heterogeneous then it makes sense, but in a homogeneous environment making a library instead often gets you most of the benefits at a much smaller cost.')
