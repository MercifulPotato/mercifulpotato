They had better candidates last time, too. It&#x27;s just that the establishment wants to be in control, so they put Biden in (and Clinton last time). If that&#x27;s not obvious, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you. The GOP establishment tried that too, with Trump, but they&#x27;re less organized, so Trump tore them up pretty easily due to his unorthodox campaigning.')
