I receive unsolicited calls and texts from the same orgs even though I tell them over the phone to stop calling and remove me from your list. It is simple telemarketing. The calls and texts have to be illegal because it is only fake IRS calls and political organizations that Ive never heard of or signed up for. If it were legal I would think I would be receiving them for all kinds of products.')
