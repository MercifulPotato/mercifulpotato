I actually said yes, because I get great targeted ads in Instagram and Facebook.  I&#x27;ve clicked on multiple ads and actually even made purchases of things that I didn&#x27;t know about that looked interesting.<p>But the important part is that I do it willingly.  I&#x27;m glad they were forced to ask -- not everyone is ok with that kind of tracking, and that&#x27;s the whole point.  I&#x27;m totally with Apple on this one.  Give people choice.<p>I made my choice, and everyone else should get to make theirs too.')
