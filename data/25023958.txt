Not just that it lacks any runtime type information by default, hindering any attempts to interface with compiled code. Heck, even interfacing with C++ source is hard. It also comes with the mindset that this is somehow an advantage and with derision against other &quot;scripting&quot; languages.<p>For example C is better in this regard, it easier to call library functions without access to source code. And it&#x27;s equally as fast.')
