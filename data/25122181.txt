Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=[25132830], score=None, time=1605609658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25122025, text='&gt; Nobody&#x27;s talking about the world moving away from google. We&#x27;re talking about the world simply not having non-repudiation built into email. A sender of an email doesn&#x27;t owe you non-repudiation as a feature. Sorry if you think otherwise. Senders can add non-repudiation as a feature if they want to, which satisfies your purchase receipt scenario.<p>Please explain to me how I can make Amazon (or any other webshop) add non-repudiable contracts to their order flow? That&#x27;s right, I can&#x27;t. And no, I don&#x27;t think that Amazon &quot;owes&quot; me non-repudiable emails, but now that we have non-repudiation by accident, it&#x27;s certainly nice to have, and the world would be worse off if we removed that feature and replaced it with nothing.')
