I’m 95% confident it’ll start happening within the next couple of years.<p>There’s so much engineering knowledge that has to be built up behind how to make these things fast in hardware since the overlap with other mpeg codes is smaller. There’s also a market timing issue. AV1 will be more battery intensive so the consumer demand for AV1 has to make sense (right now the content ecosystem isn’t there). That means Google and Netflix have to transcode their entire libraries. That doesn’t happen often and I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some investigation into how to do that more cheaply as the current encoders are unusably slow at the moment (ie they may need to put video encoder hardware in their clouds which I don’t think I’ve heard of these companies ever doing, making the undertaking even more expensive)')
