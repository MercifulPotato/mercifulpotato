It&#x27;s meant to reflect on the existing body of knowledge <i>prior</i> to their study. To paraphrase, it&#x27;s essentially saying &quot;this is what we know already, and here is what we&#x27;re adding to the body of knowledge with this study&quot;<p>As always, it&#x27;s best to read the source material directly but these are relevant excerpts from the abstract :<p>&quot;Case studies have revealed neurological problems in severely affected COVID-19 patients. However, there is little information regarding the nature and broader prevalence of cognitive problems post-infection or across the full spread of severity...<p>...People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders. They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty.&quot;<p>The last part directly contradicts the idea that this study is limited in scope to severe cases.')
