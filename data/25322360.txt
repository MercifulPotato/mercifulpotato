Now I&#x27;d say the authors that are the most well known in France are Victor Hugo, Molière (we say that french is Molière&#x27;s tongue),  Voltaire and La Fontaine (every student has to learn some of his fable), maybe Baudelaire.<p>But then again, even tho most french people heard&#x2F;learned about them, few could quote one of those author.<p>As for an equivalent of Shakespeare, Pushkin, Goethe or Dante, we don&#x27;t have any author stamped &quot;best French author&quot;, it&#x27;s a matter of personal opinion I guess. I&#x27;d say maybe Proust, but not a lot of people read him. (There is a saying that half the people who say they read Proust, did not).')
