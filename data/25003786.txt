A lot of rich residents and rich companies which supply the city budget with sweet sweet tax money<p>2. A lot of programs and NGOs that draw large budgets to helping the homeless<p>3. Political climate that encourages spending money on helping the homeless without requiring anything from them, basically free money<p>4. Generous programs providing various freebies for homeless people, and no consequences for any behavior short of major robbery (yes, shoplifting is allowed too unless it&#x27;s over $900)<p>5. Mild weather that makes living on the street possible year around<p>And we&#x27;re wondering why homelessness has not disappeared? There&#x27;s nobody that is interested in it disappearing, that&#x27;s why. Well, at least nobody whose opinion matters, anyway. There&#x27;s a lot of people interested in allocating and spending budgets on fighting homelessness, these aren&#x27;t people interested in doing something that will make it stop once and for all.')
