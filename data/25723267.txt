And just as with the Bay of Pigs, the active agents that were sent off were expendable and abandoned once it didn&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; Had that been his real intent I&#x27;m fairly certain it would have had a more significant outcome beyond people stealing random envelops and podiums.<p>Murder of a law enforcement officer is a more significant thing than stealing random envelopes and podiums, as is a mob being stopped from harming Congressional staffers and members at several points by only seconds  (and in one case by application of deadly force.)<p>&gt; It was a protest that went too far.<p>The people involved said online they were going to seize and kill security officers and members of Congress to achieve their goals, they did the first and were forcibly prevented from being able to do the second. It was a violent insurrection that went less far than planned.')
