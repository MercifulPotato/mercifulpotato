Essentially 1-2 years of definition&#x2F;growth&#x2F;change, 2 years-ish of normalcy post change, 1-2 years of redefinition as things become old and others become new&#x2F;interesting.<p>A perpetual cycle of shifting identity as we change internally and externally. I think it&#x27;s a good thing to have and understand, but can be overwhelming as well.<p>I have <i>zero</i> evidence of this, it&#x27;s just kind of based on my own observations. It&#x27;s helped me to not be so hard on my self though when I find my tastes, interests, and identity changing over time.')
