Matrix does.<p>Prosody is a great project, I used to run my own Prosody server before moving on to Matrix. But people shouldn&#x27;t lose perspective of the state of the protocol.<p>XMPP is okay if you plan to chat with a few people individually that are willing to spend time choising the right client with the right plugins and if you don&#x27;t care about modern features but anything beyond than that and it becomes a huge headache.')
