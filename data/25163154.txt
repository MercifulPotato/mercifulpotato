That means any frontend dev can immediately get a &quot;hello world&quot; running with no extra tooling and immediately access the full dev environment they are used to. Aside from the json file they don&#x27;t even have to learn any of the non-HTML5 APIs (which, btw, are typically where the most nefarious bugs live in these toolkits).<p>What is more, the dev can immediately bring in any of the zillion frameworks they depend on to pad strings or whatever.<p>I&#x27;m guessing GTK has a way to hook into its own API through javascript. But if it&#x27;s anything more than a single call to create a window and fill its webview with a page (or execute a js in its context), it&#x27;s already more complicated and electron&#x2F;nw.js wins.<p>Edit: typo')
