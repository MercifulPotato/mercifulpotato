I am saying: if my tiny personal blog has a comment section I would be liable for comments posted there. If that is a burden I can&#x27;t handle then I should turn off comments. At least in my experience those comment sections are a complete waste of space anyway and the trend I&#x27;ve noticed from the large blogs that are still around (e.g. daringfireball, kottke) is that their comment sections are long gone anyway.<p>What I am pondering is: would this ruin the Internet? If I couldn&#x27;t host a public forum if it got beyond my limited means to moderate? If I couldn&#x27;t have a public comment section? It doesn&#x27;t seem clear to me the Internet breaks if I am forced to own the responsibility for those things that I allow to be made public through sites I control.')
