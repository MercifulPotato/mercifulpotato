The speed of light is not constant. :)\nThe speed of light depends on the medium, where the reference (or max speed) is the speed of light in vacuum. The speed of light in a diamond is only half of the speed in vacuum for example!\nThis is why the latency of the low orbit satellites is lower then the cable bound connection.')
