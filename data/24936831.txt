However, as an editor here are some of changed I&#x27;d implement esp. in context:<p>- no more headlines like &quot;what nobody (read power structure) will tell you ..  the real story behind...&quot; which sours information by building mistrust. People are wrong, don&#x27;t know, sometimes right but the entire msm is not people lying to you and you (readers) are not chumps. Let&#x27;s do better.<p>- the constant bitching, whining, sniveling by media group 1 about media groups 2, 3, 4... Look you gotta something to say, say it. You can argue the other side got it wrong. Say it. And leave it there. What I don&#x27;t want to read is third grader stuff: Biden wears a hair piece and. NPR and CNN know it but but wont say anything. Whining about claimed tribes and tribe favoritism isn&#x27;t a journalist&#x27;s task. It has the side effect seen in article of making the writer small, powerless, and unequal to the task.<p>The last issue I believe has its roots (maybe not chronological firs but in impact) to rush Limbaugh who successfully got am into politics by claiming mainstream media plays favorites. Fox later did the same on TV.')
