They&#x27;re easy to see in other people, and downright glaring when it comes to politics or other collective opinions. By definition, hard to spot in yourself. Objectively, they&#x27;re likely to exist.<p>In any case, I think most of us have felt what the writer here feels, about HN or some other forum. It&#x27;s hard to know how much of it is internal to us &amp; how much of it is the forum. I mean, as we hang out someplace, it becomes old to us. Cliches become trite. Insights become banal. Patterns become annoyance triggers. All stuff that tends to show up in these &quot;sick of this&quot; endpoints.<p>What made me think of it here is the first &quot;bad argument:&quot;<p><i>&quot;Arguments that reduce to a disagreement about semantics&quot;</i><p>While I agree that this is a bad argument, it&#x27;s a pretty common one anytime anything abstract is discussed. Even professional philosophers exchanging letters, debating on podcasts or publishing in journals succumb to semantics disturbingly often.<p>To me, I might get drawn into some topic&#x2F;debate and eventually conclude that it&#x27;s just boring semantics. At that point, the whole thing annoys me whenever it comes up. This was how I &quot;got sick of philosophy&quot; at Uni.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it matters to the individual, but to forum designers it might have opposite implications. If it&#x27;s the forum that changes for the worse, a cultural defence is the right approach. If it&#x27;s the person who changes, then the solution is an evolving forum. It&#x27;s also hard to get feedback on this. I can&#x27;t imagine many forums ever avoid this sort of sentiment from arising.<p>..no conclusion.')
