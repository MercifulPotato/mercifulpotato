You have to wonder, maybe what&#x27;s best for people is to pay slightly more for everything and get better jobs all around instead. Even if purchasing power goes down as a result, a slightly more enjoyable 8 hours could well be worth the tradeoff because we spend most of our waking hours working.<p>If the decreased efficiency anx higher costs were born by the company (i. e mgmt and shareholders) instead of consumers, costs wouldn&#x27;t necessarily need to go up either.')
