Gtk and QT help you when your interface is a bunch of checkboxes and text inputs and buttons, but as soon as you want to plot a curve or make a custom tooltip or a chessboard, all it gives you is a canvas and some pixel commands.<p>Web-based tools, on the other hand, have clearer ways to float divs around, or draw with svg elements, or even if you&#x27;re just using a canvas they help you lay out your data in a convenient way.<p>Am I missing something about GUI frameworks? As soon as you want to make something complex like Audacity (and audio and waveform editing tool), the frameworks stop being helpful and are just a way to get a blank window.')
