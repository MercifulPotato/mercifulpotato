They just completed the first, small, step of the migration to ARM. They only updated the very low-end models, those who were never targeted at power users anyway, and we&#x27;re seeing that their cheapest, lowest-end models are whooping the i9 MBPro&#x27;s ass.<p>Sure, the features and RAM may not be there yet, but again, these are the low-end models.
