Item(by='bloak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611223587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25856803, text='That&#x27;s a good point, but I&#x27;ve just skimmed through the fantastically detailed entries in the Oxford English Dictionary, which seem to suggest that the word &quot;orange&quot; was used in English around 1400 and was used as a colour in 1532, while the word &quot;ginger&quot; was used in English around 1200 (or earlier) and was used as a colour in 1538. Obviously &quot;earliest citation&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;first use&quot; (though it&#x27;s amazing how many people seem not to understand that) but it doesn&#x27;t look as though &quot;ginger&quot; as a colour is much older than &quot;orange&quot; as a colour.<p>On the other hand, the early 16th century is perhaps the earliest point for which we have masses of surviving texts and can therefore get a good idea of which colour names were in use. For earlier periods perhaps there&#x27;s a good chance that some fairly ordinary words are missing from the record just through bad luck.')
