There is a line somewhere and this feels like you are starting to cross it... both place-based and person-based predictive policing sound ripe for profiling &#x2F; instigating actions that police can use as a reason to arrest an otherwise harmless person.<p>&quot;Predictive policing programs are another illustrative example showing how data, surveillance technology, and a system of automated policing work together to spy on, search, and, ultimately, control Americans who have not committed or been convicted of a crime.<p>Predictive policing is premised on the idea that historical data of crime, demographics, socioeconomics, and geography can be used to forecast future incidents. Knowing where crime is likely to occur again, police try to intervene beforehand and prevent it.<p>Broadly there are two kinds of “heat maps” produced by predictive policing models: place-based, which uses less data to try to avoid systemic pitfalls of relying on crime and demographic data and surges police into specific areas, and person-based, which tracks and creates a list of “high-risk” individuals by combining a person&#x27;s criminal history with an analysis of their social network. &quot;')
