There are no perfect countries, and you could argue e.g. New Zealand is setting the standard pretty high nowadays. But it isn&#x27;t like those ideas aren&#x27;t in some way useful - not just to Europeans, but also for other countries to cherry-pick or iterate on.<p>Anyway, pretty off topic, but the argument bad things = everything is tainted doesn&#x27;t hold for me, especially since people born after the 1960s now includes 50 year-olds and below')
