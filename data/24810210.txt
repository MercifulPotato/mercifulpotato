People who live in farming communities understand plenty of things that people in cities don&#x27;t and vice-versa. Beyond that, it&#x27;s an agreement that was reached between states who were giving up their sovereignty to join together. If we discard compromises like that because people who won the popular vote by a tiny margin now think it&#x27;s outdated and that they have some democratic mandate, then collectively society has lost my trust to keep it&#x27;s word on future compromises wherein I&#x27;m asked to forfeit some of my independence and sovereignty.')
