It&#x27;s no more based in research than the inkling that nation states should tighten their belts when the economy gets rough because after all, that&#x27;s what a sensible hard-working family does. Or the notion that it&#x27;s &quot;Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.&quot;<p>Those last two are usually uttered by people who have an agenda and are not interested in doing serious, open-minded research into those topics.<p>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who does enjoy learning from research papers, you might reflect in your free time on why you&#x27;re repeating the inkling of a sci-fi writer, and perhaps even whose agenda that could be serving.')
