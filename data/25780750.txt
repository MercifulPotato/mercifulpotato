I am sure some people have used Parler for things other than far right propaganda, but can you honestly make the point that it wasnâ€™t its primary use case?<p>The truth of the matter is that, unless I was actively watching those conversations, I can&#x27;t make any point about its primary use case.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not arguing it&#x27;s not; but, I have heard a call to action to get Telegram taken down from the App Store because &quot;that&#x27;s where the alt-right is going now&quot;, but there&#x27;s plenty of other conversation types going on there.<p>Just because you and I had no interest in being a part of the communities we know are going on in Parler doesn&#x27;t mean that people of those persuasions didn&#x27;t primarily have friendly conversations about knitting much of the time.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that we can go just by volume of conversation, either. I imagine the vast majority of Twitter messages are spewing hatred, too. Maybe not the top-level comments, but there are hundreds if not thousands of people that previously responded to most every Trump tweet in a way filled with hatred for him.<p>As I was not a member of Parler, I can&#x27;t really tell what kinds of conversations that place was designed and had in a way that&#x27;s meaningfully distinct from Twitter.')
