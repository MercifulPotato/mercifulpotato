Hodge, occupied South Korea after Korea&#x27;s liberation from Japan. This also included Imperial Japanese comfort stations.[39] These events continued the government-sanctioned prostitution that was established in Korea under Japan&#x27;s rule.</i><p>Sounds like they just took over what the Japanese had put in place... which is interesting to me because a) I never had heard of it b) living in Japan, the comfort women is a recurring theme of tension with SK, but I&#x27;ve never heard about SK giving crap to the US about this.')
