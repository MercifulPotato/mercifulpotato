All you need to do is configure the appropriate location of the repository and enter the names of the appropriate scripts.<p>Even now my github actions assume that they can just run a script within the repository, for example the most basic one:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skx&#x2F;github-action-tester" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skx&#x2F;github-action-tester</a>')
