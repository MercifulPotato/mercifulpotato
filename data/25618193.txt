There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24&#x2F;7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.<p>First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.<p>It taught me a lot about automated systems management.')
