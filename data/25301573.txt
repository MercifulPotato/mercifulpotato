It shouldn&#x27;t overload paying users with ads. It shouldn&#x27;t display even one single ads for those who pay. But it&#x27;s not the case.<p>The sad truth is that the whole thing is not about storage. Lately Google just decided to start milking users much harder and basically torture users with insane amount of ads along with a forced movement of their data to monthly paid services like YouTube Music.')
