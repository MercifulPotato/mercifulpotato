First time posting in HN :)<p>I created this browser extension a while ago, while I was searching for some CSV data for a personal project:<p>When I found a file online, I wanted to be able to read through it fast and decide in seconds if this was the file I needed, without having to download the file, open it in Excel (took some time in a slow computer), delete the file, etc.<p>So with this extension I could format the data nice and fast, and see if it was what I was looking for.<p>I decided to publish it to Firefox, but quickly forgot about it as I stopped working on that project.<p>Just last month, I realized that a few users had installed the extension during this time. So I decided to spend some spare time improving it, building a few features I wanted to see if I could make, and adding a polyfill for Chrome.')
