It&#x27;s gotta be as absurdly easy to use like iMovie but at least have the basic capabilities of a Sony Vegas Home version (the $30 kind).<p>Agreed! I do hope I&#x27;ve done this, but yeah, you would need to try it and let me know :D I&#x27;m sure it can always be made easier, and I will certainly constantly improve on it!<p>&gt; Cutting, scrubbing, aligning, have multiple tracks, and for gods sake a simple and easy way to understand what I&#x27;m encoding&#x2F;rendering (see Shotcut).<p>Got it! Cutting, aligning, multiple tracks - it&#x27;s there. Scrubbing - it&#x27;s on my todo list (this is really difficult to implement! :)) I do think I have a simple way to show what you&#x27;re rendering (once you press Export), but I&#x27;ll take another look at Shotcut.<p>&gt; KDENLive and Shotcut are two OSS video editors I&#x27;ve used simply because they&#x27;re open source, but by god do they still have a long ways to go in terms of stability and ease of use.<p>Hehe, I just took a look at KDENLive - it&#x27;s decent, but the UI is pretty horrible :D So I guess I&#x27;m in good shape :D<p>&gt; For me, 99&#x2F;100 times all I want to do is trim, split, have multiple tracks, have some fades, add text (animation or not), and lastly read and output various codecs.<p>Yup, makes sense! I do have a bit to go on this front, but yeah - all that I don&#x27;t yet have, added to my todo list.<p>&gt; Update: I had a thought right after posting. Basically if you could take Shotcut, but make it look and feel more like Sony Vegas, I think you hit the nail on the casual&#x2F;semi-pro you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Got it! Not a huge fan of Sony Vegas, but I&#x27;ll take another look. My biggest inspiration so far has been Final Cut.')
