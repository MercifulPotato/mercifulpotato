Each such operation reads over a billion values from memory and writes a half billion values to memory. This requires three memory accesses per scalar multiply-add operation. The CS-1 has full bandwidth to all of its memory: it can load two values and store one value for every multiply-add performed on every data-path lane, on every core, on every machine cycle.<p>wow')
