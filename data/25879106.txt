Google is not worth billions because it just has a simple UI and is accesible.  No.  They have figured out how to make the web searchable.<p>Palantir is the same. Just because search is not romantic anymore, doesnt mean they dont have magic to them. If aggregating intelligence data was such a no brainer , google or many of the others may have taken a stab at the problem.<p>Here lies what i believe is a contradiction. If palantir does not have &quot;magic&quot;, then why do you mention one of the most valuable companies on earth to describe palantir&#x27;s function?<p>In short, just because the u2 has wings and turbines, it doesn&#x27;t mean it was just another plane when it came out.')
