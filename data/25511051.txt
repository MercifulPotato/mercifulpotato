Your 14 year old nephew does own capital: their labor<p>Their labour is a factor of production but it is _not_ capital. Here is an introduction to the factors of production: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Factors_of_production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Factors_of_production</a> . (Notice that both in classical&#x2F;liberal economics and marxist economics labour is distinct from capital)<p>&gt; Their ability, depending on labor laws in their state, allow them to offer that labor in whichever market or not.<p>That is a commodity and _not_ capital and is normally discussed as the commodification of labour: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Commodity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikiwand.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Commodity</a> (Addendum: there are many examples of regulated commodities like those containing tabacco and alcoholic beverages)<p>&gt; An option that would be deprived of them in a system that follows the prescriptions of &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.&quot;<p>How so? They would still be able to labour (according to their ability) and would receive what they need (food, housing, medical treatment, education, entretainment, etc.) according to their need.<p>Even in a capitalist mode of production you cannot &quot;choose&quot; to labour in a particular employment. The employer would gauge ability and the most effective number of employees; Lets assume that hypothetical nephew doesn&#x27;t know how to cook and wants to work as a chef in a gourmet restaurant or isn&#x27;t a nuclear engineer&#x2F;scientist and wants to work as a nuclear plant operator like a fellow named Simpson.')
