If your index starts at 1 these can become really unintuitive. Depending on what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll have to add&#x2F;subtract 1 after&#x2F;before operations a lot.<p>The only upside I&#x27;m aware of is that the &#x27;length&#x27; of your array is now a valid index, which is mostly not very useful unless you want to iterate backwards.')
