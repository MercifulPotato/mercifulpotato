Several months after leaving MedShr I left what I still felt was a very honest review. 4 weeks after submission I got an email that they had taken it down (along with previous positive reviews about earlier employers). After prodding their support they told me it was because of some undisclosed behaviour on my part.<p>Since then the page has become littered with reviews that are somewhat obviously fake. Most of them are written in a vaguely shielded corporate tone and they simply don’t have enough former employees with a positive opinion of them to have this kind of sudden influx of responses.<p>Glassdoor has thoroughly outlived its usefulness and I can’t say that I will be basing any of my decisions on who to join on it in the future.')
