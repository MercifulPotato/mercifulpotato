If it takes heat energy from the thermal bath and produces electrical energy (which is then dissipated in a load resistor), in what way is it not a Carnot engine?<p>Are you taking the quoted passage as implying it is performing 100% conversion? This would indeed be a problem, as there is no heat sink at 0K here. That quote, however, is ambiguous, as it says power <i>supplied by</i> the heat bath  and not <i>lost from</i> it, and may merely be a statement that it obeys the conservation of energy (i.e. the point being made here may be that the power being supplied to the load comes from the heat bath, as opposed to coming from another possible source, such as the bias voltage supply.)<p>I really should buy and read the paper, but I am not that motivated yet.')
