Maybe they were idealistic and starry-eyed, maybe they never thought their project would catch up, maybe they were naive victims of propaganda or maybe they had ulterior motives, who knows. I don&#x27;t blame the companies that take advantage of it, they are profit-seeking entities - if they see an opportunity for profit they&#x27;ll take it, morality be damned.<p>I blame those that justify and help propagate this behavior, justifying abusers of free labor arguing that <i>we wouldn&#x27;t have all these nice products that make our lives easier</i>. Yes we would, if there&#x27;s a market for them we would - only now people would either get paid to create them or the companies would be forced to give back to the community just like they benefited from it.<p>So, authors, if you are sick and tired of your good Samaritan efforts being abused, switch to GPL and let them rant')
