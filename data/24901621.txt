I really wonder who takes decisions and on what basis. Some rules are ridiculous. Right now, there&#x27;s a curfew in most of the country. There are exceptions though. For instance, you need to sign a document if you want to walk your dog after 9 pm (the document attests you&#x27;re indeed walking your dog). And of course, you have to wear a mask, even though the streets are empty.')
