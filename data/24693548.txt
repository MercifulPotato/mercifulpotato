If anything they would be more likely to issue an eighth dollar as they phase out the penny, the nickle and the dime. And you would see prizes such as 4 dollar and ⅜ cents (and they would probably write it as $4–¢⅜).<p>EDIT: And petrol stations would display the prices in sixteenths, but charge a sixteenth more.')
