I do everything I can to fact check myself, but I&#x27;m sure I have been wrong several times and there are people more qualified than me to answer.<p>And some of my posts that are well within my field of expertise stay at zero.<p>When I get downvoted it is usually when I post an unpopular opinion, but rarely as a result of being wrong.<p>All this to say that while HN is, I think, one of the best communities, it doesn&#x27;t mean you should leave your guard down. I&#x27;d say it is even more insidious here because you won&#x27;t find easily debunked bullshit, no flat earthers here. Falsehoods here are to be subtle enough to go unnoticed by an educated mind, and you are not guaranteed to be corrected by a real expert.')
