So long as your address is up-to-date with the Dept. of Motor Vehicles you are sent a barcoded&#x2F;secure ballot and return envelope. Multiple states have been doing this for decades with effectively zero fraud. The few errors have been from people not updating their addresses or people filing out absentee ballots sent to old addresses, which is an entire different issue. Or there was one guy in Oregon that underwent a kidney transplant around election time, moved, and accidentally voted twice because he received two ballots. He did not even remember doing so he was so haggard.<p>The only real impediment&#x2F;threat to voting is the Republican party doing any and everything they can to limit peoplesâ€™ ability to vote.')
