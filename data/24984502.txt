If you were to point the Goldstone dish (35 degree N latitude) directly at the horizon you can reach as far as ~78 degrees below the ecliptic plane if you are pointing in the direction of the tilt of the earth (I don&#x27;t actually know where Voyager is relative to the tilt of the Earth). If it were in the opposite direction, pointing the antenna at the horizon means you could only point at something ~32 degrees below the ecliptic. And Madrid has a slightly higher latitude at 40 deg N.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voyager.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;frequently-asked-questions&#x2F;fact-sheet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voyager.jpl.nasa.gov&#x2F;frequently-asked-questions&#x2F;fact...</a>')
