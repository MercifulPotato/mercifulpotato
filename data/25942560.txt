Item(by='evv555', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611845522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941620, text='&gt;This is why I put academic fields adjacent to &quot;identity politics&quot; in the same category as climate change<p>This is why academic fields involved with &quot;identity politics&quot; are in the same class as &quot;scientists&quot; involved in climate change denial and questionable nutrition&#x2F;smoking studies.  Once there were academics involved in &quot;critic theory&quot; which more or less used Marxist level of analysis.  A thorn in the side of the establishment.  A branch within this field took the language of Marxism but replaced capitalist&#x2F;working class with identities(e.g white men&#x2F;minority women).  Ofcourse those in power have supported this branch of critic theory and have gotten to the point where they even use it as a wedge issue.  At this point this is the orthodox branch of &quot;critic theory&quot; and it&#x27;s not because of intellectual merit.')
