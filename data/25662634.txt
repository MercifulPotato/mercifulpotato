Item(by='silicon2401', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609967919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655401, text='&gt; You wouldn&#x27;t ask what it looks like to master the practice of medicine today because there are dozens or hundreds of specialities and roles all of which contribute to medicine.<p>This is like saying you can&#x27;t have a favorite type of rectangle because some rectangles are squares. If you&#x27;re a master of neurosurgery, a reasonable person would also consider that to be a master of medicine. Just as I would expect a master neurosurgeon to not be a master dermatologist but be able to master dermatology much faster than I could as a non-medical person, I would similarly expect a master C++ developer to master Javascript frontend development much faster than a junior dev, let alone a non-software person.')
