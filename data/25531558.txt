But on the other hand I think we can easily compare classical chamber music with jazz&#x2F;tango&#x2F;rock. And in this field I&#x27;d rather listen something like [1] than any classical quartet&#x2F;quinter regardless whether it was written by Beethoven or by Shostakovich.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XGeLtdmviGM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XGeLtdmviGM</a>')
