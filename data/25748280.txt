When I (as an ISP) was looking into the consumer router situation 10 years ago, the protocols required to handle dynamic IPv6 assignment to end users in conjunction with PPPoE simply didn&#x27;t exist.  Specifically, without NAT, the ISP has to somehow delegate an IPv6 subnet to the customer for their local network.  The mix of IPV6CP and DHCPv6 simply \nweren&#x27;t able to do that, and if you&#x27;ve ever had to deal with this for more than a handful of customers, you know that getting $joerandomenduser to manually configure an IPv6 subnet just isn&#x27;t going to work.  Sure, if you can control what router every customer uses you can come up with a procedure for that, but going through the wholesale network of an incumbent means you don&#x27;t have that luxury.')
