Item(by='ShamelessC', descendants=None, kids=[25738686, 25738510, 25738352, 25738868], score=None, time=1610403002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737227, text='&gt; the people they interview-- like Ted Cruz-- end up looking like complete dumbasses<p>So first off, I haven&#x27;t seen a specific example of this as I&#x27;m not a frequenter of Axios interviews. Could you post the interview you&#x27;re referring to?<p>I&#x27;m having trouble saying this in a way that isn&#x27;t flame-bait-ish, so I won&#x27;t be using your word &quot;dumbasses&quot;. Not because I disagree, but because it could be off-putting to Ted Cruz supporters in a way that obviously is intended to outrage them.<p>Sorry, but I feel it&#x27;s important to be very careful with our wording here after the events at the Capitol. With that disclaimer out of the way -<p>Is it a stretch to say that Ted Cruz doesn&#x27;t really need much help from interviewers to make himself appear unrelatable to average people? From what I&#x27;ve seen of him, that&#x27;s 100% true.<p>On the other hand, I can also absolutely see the style of interviewer you&#x27;re referring to. They&#x27;re more excited about a &quot;gotcha&quot; moment than they are about an informed discussion with the interviewee. Is that what you&#x27;re referring to?<p>Thanks, and again I really hope I haven&#x27;t offended anyone. If I have feel free to downvote me, I suppose. I&#x27;d appreciate a comment explaining why you did so I can work on being less offensive in the future, but if you don&#x27;t feel like you need to explain yourself, that&#x27;s also okay.')
