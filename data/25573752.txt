No. Because what probably happened is that any time a study got an &quot;X reduces Y&quot; result the academic said, &quot;This looks wrong, let me play with the control variables a bit&quot; until the result became &quot;no significant association.&quot; Or possibly they just through the study in the rubbish.<p>The proper conclusion from the above studies is: &quot;We have not established any link between X and Y. If any link does exist, it is below the threshold of our ability to measure it using our limited tool-set in nutrition science.&quot;<p>Or in other words: any study result that cannot be distinguished from p-hacking should not be admissible as evidence.<p>AFAICT, this is the case with saturated fat -- there is no set of studies with a sound, convincing methodology that shows a clear and undeniable causal link with heart disease. If you disagree, I&#x27;d like to see what studies you find convincing.<p><i>the initial exaggeration of the role of LDL cholesterol has led to a small but vocal minority of people who claim that LDL has no connection to heart disease, which doesn&#x27;t agree with the science</i><p>What is the best evidence that dietary cholesterol <i>causes</i> heart disease? What is the best evidence that reducing LDL through either reducing saturated fat or cholesterol intake, or through pharmaceutical intervention reduces all cause mortality?')
