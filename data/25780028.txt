Maybe by weight, but I would be surprised if that were by value.<p>Weed is extremely difficult to send by mail, relative to most other drugs.  It&#x27;s large in volume, and it produces a distinct smell.  You can combat that, but it&#x27;s a pain, and I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is.<p>Compared to something like LSD, which you could easily slip into the pages of a book, and produces no recognizable smell.  At least on the human spectrum, and I severely doubt drug dogs can smell it.')
