Maximum possible compression (entropy i think?) isn’t impossible per say, but it is computationally impossible with today’s computing resources.<p>Of course, largely hypothetical now, but I envision a time in the distant future where we produce so much data that we must compress it to its principled minimum.<p>I do agree that current lossless compression is pretty pressed for further innovation given current resource constraints.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prize.hutter1.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prize.hutter1.net&#x2F;</a>')
