Some light black-hat SEOing and ad fraud and you can pay for the domain. Some other stuff that works is to generate content for a bunch of pointless sites that are trying to make it look like they&#x27;re high traffic. Also, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a huge fan of not enforcing minimum age on work globally for digital work. I did all this as a teenager and it helped me become an engineer.<p>I think it&#x27;s even better now, though KYC stuff probably makes it much harder to get paid.
