Our local TV news websites are:<p>1) absolutely terrible user experiences -- like, so many ads that the scrolling lags on my 16 inch MBP.<p>2) clearly just reposting whatever their parent networks feed them for everything except local news (so, Fox and NBC, the two mentioned in this article, are literally feeding lines to these &quot;local&quot; channels that are ostensibly totally different from their parent networks)<p>IMO: the death of local newspapers is a problem but the death of local TV news can&#x27;t happen fast enough.')
