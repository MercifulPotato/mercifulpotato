I got one (a C64) for christmas 1984, the manual had several pages of sample programs that you could program (one ever had a mistake in it).  By New Years day I had tried atleast 4 of them.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I had more fun making making ASCII art that would endlessly scroll &amp; loop thanks to a &quot;GOTO 10&quot; at the end of my creation.<p>If I&#x27;m even more honest, I find myself wishing for a GOTO command I could use in my bash scripts once in a blue moon.  (I know they are a bad&#x2F;horrible&#x2F;lame crutch, but my brain seems to blank out any other options and just says to me:  a GOTO would work perfect here.)<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for a C64 and BASIC, I wouldn&#x27;t have the career and love of technology that I still do [Checks calendar, HOLY FUCK] 36 years later.')
