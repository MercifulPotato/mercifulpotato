It&#x27;s mostly quizzing how long people have been writing that specific language and their interest in language minutia.<p>It&#x27;s been several years since I wrote JavaScript or Python on a regular basis professionally and I&#x27;d almost certainly fail your quiz. Yet I&#x27;m very confident I could be quickly productive in a Python environment.<p>Interviews should probe thought processing, not language minutia.')
