I mean, granted, it&#x27;s just a generic neighborhood library, so it wouldn&#x27;t have specialized texts, but still.<p>Leave the cameras on, lock the librarian&#x27;s office and password-protect the computers after hours, and require the tenants to return [or check out] any borrowed material by the next morning.  Realistically, you&#x27;ll probably have one or two bad tenants over the next few decades who leave their trash inside the library or try to steal the crappy old library computers and it will mostly be fine.')
