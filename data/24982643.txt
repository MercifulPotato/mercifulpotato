I would not remove the ability to use the themes my designers had created over the years.<p>- introduce a &quot;Settings&quot; app that fragments the OS configuration (especially if my operating system already had a weird second settings menu that you could only get to by running a command like, for example, `msconfig`).<p>If I did do these things, I would probably introduce them in a beta operating system and continue to support my flagship product because it would, in this hypothetical scenario, be much friendlier to the average user (whom in this scenario I target).')
