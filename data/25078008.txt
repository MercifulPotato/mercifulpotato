I suppose that the experience depends heavily on the particular MacBook model and its age.<p>For example, I have used a 13 inch MacBook Air (Early 2015) for almost 4 years now exclusively with Linux and I have had a very good experience with it so far. WiFi, Bluetooth, webcam, touchpad, card reader and sleep all work well. Battery time is very similar to OS X. The configuration took some time but it is well documented on the Arch Linux wiki.<p>This model is now quite old and relatively many people use it with Linux. That is probably the reason why there are no major outstanding issues with it. When it was new, the situation might have been different.')
