Something that massive would change the orbits of earth, mars, venus, even jupiter to a certain extent, not to mention all the asteroids and comets.  The current stable configuration of the solar system was surely a significant contributor to the evolution of life, and it probably just came about as a freak accident.  No way I would vote to allow anyone to mess with it on this scale.')
