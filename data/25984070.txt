Don&#x27;t forget Ocram&#x27;s razor. I don&#x27;t think there are many sophisticated actors here at all. I&#x27;m speaking as one who did DD on GME back in September and throw some money in (thought it was a great opportunity mainly because of Cohen + \nthe upcoming console super cycle with a tiny chance of squeeze thrown in) It was a smart discovery by WSB and got a bit more than average attention but then it kept growing.. every week more DD&#x27;s posted and more attention. Now the entire sub is so dedicated to GME its actually annoying.<p>I think it really is the simple dumb story of a really bad bet by a hedge fund getting called out online and a with more and more jumping on the wagon and with the hedge fund making more and more dumb mistakes. And everyone is underestimating the redditors who, behind the emojis and crap talk, are actually pretty smart. Collectively they can, and did, cause this.. no need to invent other actors to explain it.')
