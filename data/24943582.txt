It was an early sign of the problems of &quot;preorder culture&quot; in games (a lesson we&#x27;re still relearning&#x2F;refighting time-and-again today): KQ8 was a preorder darling with a ton of hype and anticipation. Grim Fandango was a sleeper that &quot;no one&quot; thought to preorder and the preorder shops (for their reasons) weren&#x27;t pushing. Grim Fandango was considered a &quot;flop&quot; for a bunch of years, though obviously it&#x27;s done far better in the long tail of post-preorder sales than KQ8.')
