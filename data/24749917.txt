So they failed the trial I gave their service. Perhaps you have to post some money along with your application. It&#x27;s a shame, there used to be support in mpd for Tidal but since they won&#x27;t share their API documentation it&#x27;s now &quot;defunct&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand the game these streaming companies are playing. Is it some kind of security through obscurity or have they crunched the numbers and the costs outweigh the gains. They&#x27;ve had years to take advantage of Spotify&#x27;s mis-steps so I won&#x27;t hold my breath.<p>There are some reverse engineered API packages out there for Tidal. They might work but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for as a paying customer.')
