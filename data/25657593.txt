Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609940404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652781, text='&gt;Iran&#x27;s, and North Korea&#x27;s, strategies are working out pretty well for the people making those decisions...The people of Iran and North Korea are not doing so well.<p>So your contention is that nation-states shouldn&#x27;t interact with each other at the nation-state level? That is, if a nation-state proceeds with antagonistic policies, like funding regional militant and terrorist groups against your allies, you cannot hold that nation-state to account lest it hurt their populations? This is not an easy ethical question. At the nation-state level there is no rule of law, it is anarchy. It seems like there may be &#x27;international law&#x27; in the modern world, but that&#x27;s only for those that live within the sphere of influence of the relevant superpower who can enforce it (USA plays that role in much of the globe, soon to be replaced wholly or in part by Chinese influence).<p>Policies like sanctions have many goals. In the specific case of Iran, sanctions have a goal of curbing Iranian regional antagonism and not necessarily regime change (we&#x27;re much too cynical for that).<p>&gt;But if you were an Iranian citizen hoping for a better future, would you really pin your hopes on a US-backed regime change<p>There is no easy answer. Ultimately, it is the Iranian government that is responsible for the well-being of their citizens. Their citizens could have their lives drastically improved TODAY if their governments chose to do so. I don&#x27;t know why you put that responsibility on the US because US cannot do this job. US needs to balance the well-being of their people as well as the well-being of the people of their regional allies as well, in addition to basic rights of all humans.<p>I posed a question to you in my previous message and you refused to answer it. But I&#x27;ll rephrase: Why do you bend over backwards to remove all agency from Iranian government for actions they chose to get themselves and the people they are responsible for, into the present situation. This includes their absolute refusal for making decisions that would get them to stop being a regional and global pariah.')
