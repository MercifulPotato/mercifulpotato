Writing correct code is tough for multiple reasons, for example these numerical algos are not perfect and the glitches you see may be an algorithmic problem and nothing wrong with your implementation. Compare this with the usual backend and web dev, where you&#x27;re usually writing trivial endpoints which just move data from one system to another. Of course, there are some ambitious roles in the FAANGs (the algos behind distributed databases don&#x27;t figure out themselves), but they come into the picture later, once the startup is already scaling up.')
