Sometimes I think having a family just flips a bit in our brains -- like that whole Larry Niven thing about the Pak Protectors lol. And you&#x27;re right, I was being a bit unfair about the noodles ;)<p>For myself I&#x27;ve always been a person of quiet habits. I love visiting the big city and taking in the vibrancy and life (museums! concerts!), but, boy oh boy, the older I get, the more I like to come back to my small&#x2F;medium-sized city.
