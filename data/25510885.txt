I&#x27;m working on updating a lot of my network to 10 GbE, and it&#x27;s kind of insane how you can get by with super-cheap hardware, cabling, connectors, etc. for 1 Gbps and everything works fine... but when you go to 2.5 or 5 Gbps, prices increase a bit (and the need for better cables with more shielding arises).<p>When you hit 10 Gbps, there&#x27;s a lot more expense on every layer, especially the chips&#x2F;cards that you connect to your computers.<p>The difference is something like $5-10 for 1 Gbps devices, vs $150+ for 10 Gbps devices (in many cases... there are exceptions).')
