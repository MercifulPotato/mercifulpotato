Paying your car insurance company premiums means they agree to pay up to a certain amount of money for you to cover damage, but that doesn&#x27;t remove your liability. In addition to the fact that it&#x27;s you paying the premiums, if you get a ticket, it&#x27;s still you that gets points on your license; if you injure someone because you were driving recklessly, it&#x27;s still you that gets sued (and if the damages awarded are more than your insurance covers, you&#x27;re still on the hook for the rest); if you injure someone while driving under the influence, it&#x27;s still you who gets charged with a crime.')
