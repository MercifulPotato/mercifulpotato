However, since you&#x27;re in &quot;idle&#x2F;wait&quot; status, you can as well use that to perform such a costly context switch and cleanup some. If you however e.g. had to stir something every minute or more, then the context switch would be too expensive, even tho you&#x27;re still &quot;idle&#x2F;wait&quot; most of the time.<p>I start cleaning&#x2F;tidying up myself when cooking, but only &quot;easy to clean&quot; stuff, because more than once I have been burned by focusing too long on cleaning something more difficult to clean (or rather my food was burned a little).')
