Even $300 could be 50 months (4 year) of a remote server at the prices suggested by some of the posts in this page.<p>Furthermore self hosting a backup server at home doesn&#x27;t protect against burglars and fires. You&#x27;ll probably lose both your data and their backup.<p>That&#x27;s why I prefer a local backup plus a remote one (a combination of git repositories and file storage. )')
