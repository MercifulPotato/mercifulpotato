It also let you trade buckets of stocks, not just one.<p>This is just a very basic strategy backtester, there are plenty like it, you can find them if you Google &quot;technical backtester&quot; and some of the brokers (e.g. TD Ameritrade) even let you do such backtests in their platforms (e.g. Thinkscript, though that&#x27;s a tad more Quantopian-like than this tool).<p>If you want a _real_ Quantopian alternative, look at QuantConnect [0]. Interestingly, it&#x27;s .NET based and you can write C#, F#, Python or whatever you want.<p>And the trading engine is open-source [1] and you can run it yourself.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantconnect.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantconnect.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;QuantConnect&#x2F;Lean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;QuantConnect&#x2F;Lean</a>')
