There may have been more subtle things, like an article mentioned &quot;stickers&quot; but I didn&#x27;t see anything I could identify. There was the guy with the &quot;Auschwitz&quot; shirt.<p>People did fly the Confederate flag though, so &quot;white supremacists&quot; seems beyond a reasonable doubt.')
