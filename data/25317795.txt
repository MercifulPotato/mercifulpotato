I would love to switch to Python&#x2F;Pandas but I&#x27;m comfortable with R and it does <i>everything</i> I need it to with one exception over ten years of heavy use.<p>Python is wonderful but the cognitive load for switching in industry and academia without a clear cost benefit isn&#x27;t worth it to most people I know in my shoes.  I encourage new coders to learn Python but discounting R feels a bit asinine.<p>Hadley is still actively doing work for R which has led to a graphing packages that is substantially better than anything in Python (last I check).  I have no doubt that Python will steal it and implement it eventually (as they should) but R is still doing firsts that Python hasn&#x27;t (note the native implementation of Piping, they&#x27;re late to the party on lambda functions obviously)')
