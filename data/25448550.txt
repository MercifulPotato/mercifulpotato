They are totally different. It&#x27;s totally fine for a library to have new versions, and for those new versions to be breaking.<p>You can run two applications with GTK3 and GTK4, and maybe 10 years into the future GTK10 in parallel. They will just look different, but nothing else will change. It&#x27;s not as if the old application built with GTK3 will crash or not start.<p>But if you break the Win32 API, a whole lot of desktop applications will crash.')
