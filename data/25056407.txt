Item(by='vonseel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605081653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053367, text='Toothbrushes should have tiny removable heads, containing essentially only the bristles, which slide in and you replace when you need a new one. Definitely for the Sonicare type. Maybe even for all toothbrushes. This approach would reduce their cost even further and reduce more waste in landfills, but I guess they want to make money and I&#x27;d expect the bristles only to be priced at like $1. The rest is just plastic but when it&#x27;s a &quot;toothbrush&quot; they can charge $10 for it but I want the cartridge for 10 dollars for 10 refills, or cheaper.<p>I mean, some people might like subscribing for soap and stuff, maybe they actually track how often they need to replace it. I bought some of those razors from a subscription service and they send shampoo and I realized I probably don&#x27;t run out of a bottle more than once per year. I think the large bottles have lasted me as long as 5 years.')
