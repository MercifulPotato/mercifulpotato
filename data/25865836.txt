The actual whole food workers are always there for you and go out of their way to help you, I don&#x27;t expect the online shopper order fillers to help me, but they at best DGAF about the in-store shoppers and at worst are hostile towards them.<p>They speed past people and around corners with carts, cut in line at the fruits and veggies, ask WF employees to help them find items while you&#x27;ve waited to talk to them and in return, flat out ignore actual in-store shoppers when they ask for help. If you&#x27;re out of the tech loop and don&#x27;t realize that they are incentivized to fill orders, you might think the online shopper fillers are part of the WF staff there to help you. Knowing this, it&#x27;s not too jarring to me to see a customer go up to one of them and have their many &#x27;excuse me&#x27;s just ignored, not even acknowledged.<p>They need shirts that say don&#x27;t ask me for help; I know the way they are incentivized to fill as many orders is what creates this behavior - that needs to be looked at as well in my opinion.')
