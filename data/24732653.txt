I have an L1 visa but was out of country and couldn&#x27;t return and lost my job in April. Now I am being offered the same job again in January 2021.<p>1. Can I re-enter the US in January 2021? (my visa doesn&#x27;t expire till later that year and I plan to file an extension).\n2. Can my company file a greencard application on my behalf as soon as I enter the US? (I have asked for it as a part of my compensation package and the company will likely agree).<p>Thank you again for your time.')
