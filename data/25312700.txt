Social classes are cultures</i><p>Thank you for saying that.<p>While my late father had more money at one time than I really understood as a child, my mother&#x27;s &quot;upper class expectations&quot; referenced in this piece are mostly not about money per se. They are rooted in the fact that her mother came from a low level noble family (my mother is a German immigrant).<p>They sold the title when the family fell on hard times financially, thus I&#x27;m not actually nobility myself. But I believe my grandmother was (or perhaps her parents were -- I&#x27;m not sure where the cut off is there).<p>My mother sewed a lot of my clothes when I was growing up. It was a cost effective means to dress me &quot;properly&quot; and it&#x27;s only recently that I realized that my mother&#x27;s ideas of &quot;proper&quot; attire are somewhat like the dress codes of British Royalty that you read about in gossip rags. (Not too much skin showing, no cleavage on display, don&#x27;t let your bra straps show, etc.)<p>She didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on sewing for me, but I can&#x27;t sew and I can&#x27;t afford to buy the style of clothing to which I was accustomed growing up. In fact, I mostly can&#x27;t even find it in the US at any price and I am so frustrated by that fact that I toy with the idea of creating  my own clothing line so I can dress &quot;properly.&quot;')
