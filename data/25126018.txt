It had a clean Python implementation. (Actually it was the first open-source project I contributed a patch to.)<p>Alas, like many Canonical products, it was a good idea that failed to take hold. While git is technologically superior (more features, better performance), I like to think there should have been space in the world for a more user-friendly VCS to co-exist.')
