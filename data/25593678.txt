But at significantly lower efficiencies you can just do the same thing we all did with a battery in grade school.  That&#x27;s not quite free to build out, but it&#x27;s close.  And relying on low-efficiency energy storage to fill the gaps in production is still better than firing up a gas plant to supply the power.<p>It seems not unlikely to me that a lot of wind and solar plants might see building out a local hydrogen electrolyzer and generator (or just sell the hydrogen) as a useful choice.<p>But yes: there&#x27;s no silver bullet, and there are a <i>lot</i> of very reasonable competitors in the energy storage market.')
