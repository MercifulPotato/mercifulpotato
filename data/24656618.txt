I read so many felon success stories but I&#x27;m a non-violent felon and I can&#x27;t even get an entry-level interview in IT. I&#x27;m multiskilled with a huge focus on security but despite the demand, I&#x27;ve had so much trouble.<p>In fact, in one very sad case, I showed up to my first day of work as a sys admin and was walked out after 2 hours because the HR department neglected to go over my application and see the felony checkbox until that day, despite having been hired over a month before!')
