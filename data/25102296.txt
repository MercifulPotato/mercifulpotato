I sell projects to my former classmates all the time, and if I ever find myself out of a job, I could have a half dozen interviews within a month. The network is absolutely amazing if you go to one of the top 20 or so schools and have some people skills. You can&#x27;t really make use of the network if you&#x27;re a PM.<p>&gt; And is the hours-adjusted total income of a consulting career that much better for wealth building than an extra million bucks pre-tax at age 30?<p>Lifetime income for a partner at a consulting company can easily top $30 million -- with the benefit of being able to blow the escape hatch and land in a VP role in industry if you burn out on the consulting work.')
