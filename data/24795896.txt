The FAQ item is dated September 2019. The Reddit article is 9 hours old as I write in October 2020.<p>The followup here, strongly suggests other un-related people have been called, even cold-called, and offered by people puporting to be glassdoor, to wipe the problem.<p>I agree you aren&#x27;t offering an opinion and I value that. I would also value some commentary to my note: What do people think, about what people said on reddit, and said here, regarding this, and what glassdoor said in September 2019?<p>I know what I think: I do not believe this policy is well enforced, and I believe the posters who say they were invited to pay to clear their record. You notice they do not have &quot;report breach here&quot; links on that FAQ item. They do disclaim it has legal force.<p>It may of course be unscrupulous non C* staff, or it may be intermediaries mis-representing their role, e.g. SEO leeches.')
