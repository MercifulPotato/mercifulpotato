This to me is the major problem with starlink. Each sat only has 10-20gigabit&#x2F;sec capacity, which really isnt a lot considering Netflix can use 15mbit&#x2F;sec per stream, and call of duty patches can be nearly 200GB. It&#x27;s not going to take many users to completely saturate 20gbit. It&#x27;s not far off what a single 4G+5G cell site has, capacity wise, but instead of serving a few km max we are talking 100s of km^2.<p>I think it&#x27;s highly likely there will be data caps and&#x2F;or fairly serious traffic shaping on the production version at some point.')
