I know somebody who had a good hp laptop once where the thermal paste dried up. It was a dangerous day long process to get the thing open enough to get at the cooler and involved dismantling almost every part of the laptop until they just decided to give up and get a new laptop. The person in the video tutorial they were following cut themselves in the process on some sharp metal and was super tense about shocking themselves. So if hp laptops are easy to repair now, that’s a nice change')
