It adds value, since during this kind of conversation one can offer useful suggestion or another point of view on an issue that they hadn&#x27;t addressed before (because they were working on something else, for example).<p>Different use case: incident handling with tight time constraints. In other words: prod offline and has to be brought up asap, but coordination is needed in touching the various systems. A 2+ people voice call is a godsend because now everything is &quot;in sync&quot; and usually updated in real time with what other people are doing.<p>Your opinion is not unpopular, is just the product of an HN-like echo chamber. People advocating of async-only communications are a small minority that makes a lot of noise, it&#x27;s a common situation.')
