You could probably have a 4 year specialization on various parts of web development.<p>A course on web dev in a CS degree sounds right. 4 years that&#x27;s just... what are you going to do in 4 years?<p>http, some js, some css, some html, one popular back-end and students should be pretty much comfortable reading the docs and picking up whatever framework-du-jour is trendy right now.<p>By the time you graduate this 4 year major, the frameworks will have changed twice!<p>&gt; By the way, I also went to a small midwest school, and its &quot;Computer Science&quot; program was cancelled in favor of more skill-based specializations<p>That&#x27;s a very bad signal.')
