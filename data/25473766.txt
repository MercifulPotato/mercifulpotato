Ampere put it in a socket, but it&#x27;s still &quot;ARM&#x27;s&quot; CPU core. This isn&#x27;t a custom design like Apple&#x27;s CPUs.<p>And per the article it sounds like it&#x27;s ARM&#x27;s fault this can&#x27;t exceed 3.3 ghz. That seems to be a Neoverse-N1 limitation:<p>&quot;Fundamentally, the Altraâ€™s handling of frequency and power in such a manner is simply a by-product of the Neoverse-N1 cores not being able to clock in higher than 3.3GHz&quot;')
