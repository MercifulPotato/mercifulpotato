Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606321428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203484, text='Sorry for the double-reply, but I realize I didn&#x27;t address the meat of your comment.<p>&gt; When people hold a self-perception of what they do that is wildly at odds with what you think they do, it&#x27;s often because folks who actively believe they are doing bad for the world are often so bitter that nobody wants to be around them.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with this, at least as applied to my comment. There&#x27;s a wide, wide gulf of reasonableness between &quot;what I do is unhelpfuly and unworthy&quot; and &quot;everyone in my industry is an omnibenevolent, maximally-selfless angel&quot;. I&#x27;m quite proud of the work I do without thinking this, and as I mentioned in my previous comment, if my sister had a possibly-irrational but not totally-unreasonable greater pride in her work, I wouldn&#x27;t blame her at all. But doctors who consider themselves a separate moral species from human beings aren&#x27;t just egomaniacs, they&#x27;re _dangerous_ (as I said, my sister luckily grew out of this a little bit).')
