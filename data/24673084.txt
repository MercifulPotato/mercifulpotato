This may be confusing, since it compiles-in all golang dependencies, but by default, all output is dynamic, and it&#x27;s quite difficult to get static binaries out of it at all.<p>The golang model expects all golang deps to be distributed as source code, and then it expects to dynamically link to all C dependencies.  It is technically <i>possible</i> to diverge from the latter set of expectations, but it is not easily or commonly done.<p>C++ is much like golang in that respect.  Template libraries are always &quot;static&quot; in the sense that they are distributed only as source code, but the final binary output is almost always a dynamically linked binary.')
