I don&#x27;t care how visible or not they are.  Ads are emotional manipulation designed to get us to open our wallets to spend on things we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise buy.  I refuse to subject myself to that when there is an alternative.<p>I fully admit that my opinion is not the only one.  I&#x27;m sure there are some people whose attitude matches the one you describe.  But my guess is that sentiment toward ads is declining.  At the very least, publications are deciding that they can make more money off subscriptions than ads.  Not sure if the revenue for ads is declining, or what.')
