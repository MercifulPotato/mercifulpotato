But it is dominated by rich kids to an extreme that Paul Graham is completely blind to, living in the bubble he has his whole life.<p>Depending on your definition of rich, of course. Most of the benefit is being in the upper class, that&#x27;s what &quot;rich&quot; means to people living in the lower classes. To upper class people, being &quot;rich&quot; means having a private jet.<p>Almost every major tech founder fits the profile of having had the benefit of SAT prep and tutors to game entry into an &quot;elite&quot; school and parents able to provide free food&#x2F;shelter&#x2F;funding. Many parents have connections to draw upon.<p>Steve Jobs is one of the very few exceptions. And, to my mind, it&#x27;s not a surprise that he&#x27;s the best tech founder that ever will be.<p>Airbnb founder Nathan Blecharczyk was definitely a rich kid.<p>&quot;He grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Boston, Massachusetts. He attended Boston Latin Academy.&quot;<p>&quot;He was also on the business staff of The Harvard Crimson during his time at Harvard.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nathan_Blecharczyk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nathan_Blecharczyk</a><p>The others maybe not. It&#x27;s hard to know how much money a family has. But they moved to SF and rented an expensive apartment with no jobs. This isn&#x27;t something most poor kids do. Who co-signed their lease, given that they had no income? Likely it was a parent ready to bail them out if they ran out of credit cards.')
