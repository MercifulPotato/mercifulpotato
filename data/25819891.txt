That&#x27;s how apple does it.<p>That said, I was attracted to computers since an early age because it&#x27;s fun to make them <i>do</i> things.<p>But I think apple&#x27;s ecosystem takes the MOST EFFORT of any of them to actually do anything.<p>For example, on linux there are probably 100 scripting languages that can do fine-grained automation of just about anything you want to do.<p>With apple.. ugh.  It&#x27;s either applescript, or you&#x27;re into xcode and a compiler and a license agreement and high complexity and lots of only-apple-does-it-this-way.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple one:  how do you have two icons in the dock - one to open an 80x25 terminal window, one to open a 140x50 terminal window.  This takes way too much energy to automate.<p>You can do it in applescript, but it&#x27;s such a horrible language.<p><pre><code>   tell process &quot;Terminal&quot; to click menu bar 1&#x27;s menu bar item &quot;Window&quot; menu 1&#x27;s menu item &quot;Open Window Group&quot;&#x27;s menu 1&#x27;s menu item &quot;group1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI know there are shell scripts and python, but apple treats them like the jackling mansion - no gui, cmdline is non-essential, everything is rotting.')
