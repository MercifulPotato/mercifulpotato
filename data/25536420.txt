I kept the source code for Ruby and for Rails handy, and it was sort-of possible to wrap my head around both. One of the most fun non-AI conferences that I ever went to was Merb Camp in San Diego where the Merb team announced merging with Rails.<p>I have such good memories of the four or five years when Ruby was my main driver. Great job by Matz and core team with the 3.0 release.<p>I have gone back to my 1980s roots and now once gain use Common Lisp as my main driver, except for deep learning where I need to use Python (tried Julia and Swift).<p>I think Matz has it exactly right. As programmers it is important to be happy using a language. Life should be fun most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with trying to optimize life for maximum joy we bring to ourselves and other people.<p>BTW, happy holidays!')
