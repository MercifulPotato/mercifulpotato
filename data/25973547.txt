I&#x27;ve aggregated some question responses below to try to clarify a few things.<p>Browsing the &#x2F;map directory directly isn&#x27;t intended to be informative in the way people are looking for. It&#x27;s more of a file store that just happens to be browsable for advanced users. Rather this information is intended to be from the wiki which has more detail and is searchable etc. See for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=mcmaster:raspberry-pi:rp2-b0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=mcmaster:raspber...</a><p>Similarly if you can find additional information the wiki such as image conventions (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=conventions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=conventions</a>) and additional copyright info (ex: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=tommi:start" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;siliconpr0n.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;doku.php?id=tommi:start</a>)<p>I&#x27;m looking over people&#x27;s suggestions and trying to see if there is anything I can take in to improve the site. Thanks for the feedback and feel free to reach out to me directly if you want to contribute something directly!<p>PS: yes I know there is some crufty stuff on there like search is doing weird stuff right now with the side bar. I upgraded the wiki software recently and haven&#x27;t yet been')
