But both sides are gradually radicalizing.  One probably doesn&#x27;t want to bump into extremists from either side.  Both are overhyping their respective persecution complexes.  Both are using extreme events and individuals to try to justify extreme behavior in non-extreme median cases.  When neither events nor individuals are mentioned, many of the complaints people raise can be applied to either side.<p>I do agree that the left lacks self-awareness of how much it behaves just like a religion -- I moved away from my religious home state to try to get away from dogma, and just found another breed of it.  The right lacks self-awareness of how much influence it still has.<p>Both lack mutual awareness of how to relate to one another, and that&#x27;s something we need to work at from all sides.  Neither side has 100% of the &quot;truth&quot;, whatever that might be.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what a solution looks like, but I do know that it has to start somewhere, maybe with believing that an amicable solution is even possible.  We&#x27;ve spent a lot of time airing grievances.  What do we want to happen next?  Would you (and others reading) be willing to help brainstorm some ideas to try to bridge the divide?')
