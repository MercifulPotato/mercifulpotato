How is it in other countries? Are they private enterprises?<p>It terrifies me that some private corporation is in charge of public infrastructure that cannot be controlled in capitalistic marketplace. For e.g., water utility company has no interest in the safety of water as far as there aren&#x27;t any laws preventing them from saving money, and there isn&#x27;t much of a competition for the public to choose from.<p>With government handling public utilities, it comes with other challenges such as inefficiencies and quality of service but lot of US gov departments do well - US National Park Service, US National Labs, why can&#x27;t Dept of Energy run utility companies?')
