Like OK, what?!<p>It tells me <i>nothing</i> about the urgency of the matter, let alone what it relates to. So I can put it to the side and keep working - but it&#x27;s going to be nagging at me &quot;hmm, what if it&#x27;s about x?&quot;.<p>So now I&#x27;ve got to break focus and waste time just to find out how important it is, and what it even relates to.<p>I much prefer &quot;Hi, I have a question regarding how to x, could you ping me when you get a chance pls?&quot;, or &quot;Hi, we&#x27;ve got an urgent problem with x, the customer is losing their shit, pls help ASAP!&quot;<p>The absolute worst is when the person giving you &quot;hello&quot; is someone you don&#x27;t know (I work at a megacorp). From &quot;hello&quot; I will plainly have no clue what you want, so wtf?!<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s a cultural thing. I don&#x27;t think my colleague in the UK, Norway or Europe have <i>ever</i> done this, but it seems to be just about the only way my colleagues in India start a chat?')
