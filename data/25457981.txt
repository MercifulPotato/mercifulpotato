But Grain Berry cereal is going to be grossly different from a nutritional perspective than Frosted Flakes. For both to be lumped into the same category of &quot;ultraprocessed&quot; is a bit ridiculous.<p>-----------<p>Its not like &quot;processing&quot; makes something more or less poisonous. 100% all natural fully organic death cap mushrooms will kill you.<p>Now high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, high-preservative stuff is probably bad. Those things have clear science and nutrition issues associated with them. But the nutrition in &quot;processed&quot; canned corn (picked and canned at peak ripeness) is often found to be superior to &quot;fresh&quot; ears of corn (which loses nutrition the longer it sits in the food aisle).<p>If you cook all-natural brown rice with fresh pork-belly all day every day, and you&#x27;ll have a heart attack from all that fat you&#x27;re eating. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that pork-belly is ultraprocessed bacon or freshly cut from a squealing pig in your backyard: pork-belly contains a ton of fat and is just innately unhealthy.')
