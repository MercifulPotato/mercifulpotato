Apple + TSMC having a deeper pocket than Intel.<p>AMD benefited by TSMC basically already investing in smaller nodes for Apple, combined with new manufacturing innovations caused by their innovative chiplet&#x2F;infinity fabric designs. This enabled them to glue more cores together at higher yields and therefore winning massive benefits in multicore performance.<p>Intel had to worry about constraints caused by both the architecture combo-ed with manufacturing. I&#x27;m also not sure if they were even looking at something like chiplets at the time.')
