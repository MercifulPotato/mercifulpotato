Anything that can be enforced by an auto-formatter or linter is so enforced. For anything else reviewers are expected to be able to cite the style guide to back up their requested change.<p>This practice seems to have spread into the community due to the popularity of Gofmt, and now other languages like Rust have a community-standardized formatter (rustfmt) and linter (Clippy). Many thousands of hours have probably been saved by this point by treating format akin to language syntax.')
