Looks overall cheaper than anything on the west coast to me. Loved it all the times I&#x27;ve been, but the only things putting me off are the rising water table and hurricanes. My buddy living down there has had some serious flood damage to his home a few years back. I guess you could build on the second story with parking underneath like they do here in the west and buy another century of rising sea levels or so, but I didn&#x27;t see any homes that looked like that so I guess zoning is probably some nonsense.')
