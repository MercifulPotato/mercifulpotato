One of them is the &quot;stay put in one place (usually at a FAANG) for thirty years and retire&quot;, and the other is the &quot;take lots of short contracts, with optional breaks&quot;.<p>As long as you behave in a manner consistent with the approach you&#x27;re taking, you&#x27;ll be fine. The issue comes when you try to take one approach while believing you are taking the other.<p>If you change jobs frequently while looking for long-term employment, you&#x27;ll substantially decrease your chances of being perceived as generating return on investment by potential employers. This is due to the dynamics of long-term employment which result in expensive onboarding costs that can take a while to recoup.<p>However, as a contractor, the onboarding and sourcing expenditures are typically lower (and budgeted differently): the ROI looks much different. It&#x27;s acceptable and common to accept find and make short-term roles.<p>So it just depends what you&#x27;re going for. I value the flexibility in shorter term employment which has been, in my experience, harder to find with the longer tenure track. It also seems easier to make sure you are being paid what you&#x27;re worth.')
