Which is nice. I assume a lot of people did <i>a lot</i> more work than I did back then and never saw any money for it. So I probably have no right to complain or lament about these transactions in any way. But, in a way, it is very hard to not think about dollar per time, especially with Bountysource being attached to <i>solving specific issues</i>. I believe this contributed to my mentality souring over time, because in the back of my head I never got rid of the idea that I&#x27;m sort-of at work here, but at about 2 $&#x2F;hr average wage. I stopped contributing to that project completely after about just two years or so.')
