There was a host on a podcast who admitted to venting to a company. He bought an item. It arrived and worked as advertised, but he was thoroughly underwhelmed by the product.<p>The podcaster emails the company talking about his dissatisfaction. The response was something like, &quot;We understand your frustrations. Even if there&#x27;s no issue, you can send it back for a refund.&quot; The podcaster realized that nothing was actually wrong. The product worked as advertised. It didn&#x27;t break. It didn&#x27;t arrive damaged. There were just unfulfilled expectations. I want to say that he responded by thanking them for their time but a refund wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.<p>This guy inadvertently took up support time for an issue that wasn&#x27;t really an issue. If you mix this scenario with entitled people or hobbyists who are very particular about minor details, sellers may spend lot of time on supporting very few customers.')
