If you&#x27;re working with an embedded system with an AVR, you&#x27;re choices may be C&#x2F;C++ and Assembly-- No need to get into an argument over the latest shiny framework.<p>You&#x27;ll never really be isolated from office politics or poor management though. Things like feature creep or changing specs etc. also won&#x27;t go away.')
