He is a German who is in America on an H1-B visa. He and I spoke openly about his salary once, which was $97,500. I know Felix is great at his job... but given the experience and knowledge he had, along with the insane responsibilities he was tasked with, I wouldn&#x27;t have done it for less than $125,000.')
