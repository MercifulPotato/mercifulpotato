Paul Irish, a Google Chrome Software Engineer, inspired me to create that program. His version is written in Bash [2].<p>Many people started using my program, and GitHub ended up banning many of them for misbehaving (spamming) other users. I have not updated the code because I do not want to incentivize people to spam, especially IT recruiters, who are not ashamed to use the same tactics to recruit people.<p>I would encourage @jemmaissroff and everyone else to be mindful and ethical with this type of project.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cixtor&#x2F;emailgetter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cixtor&#x2F;emailgetter</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paulirish&#x2F;github-email" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;paulirish&#x2F;github-email</a>')
