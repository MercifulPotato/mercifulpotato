Apart from that, there are some pains right now with some tools (Docker doesn&#x27;t work yet) that will be resolved soon. It still runs macOS software for x86 too, so that&#x27;ll help with the transition. When available, I&#x27;ll get a maxed out 32 or 64GB one myself.<p>On the Linux side, my advice is to avoid the &quot;fancy&quot; ones that don&#x27;t explicitly support Linux. Avoid dGPUs if you can and stick to Intel graphics. Beware some machines are coming out with soldered RAM, mostly in the ultrathin category.')
