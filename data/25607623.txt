And that remote &#x2F; async work proved that illusion to be untrue. This misalignment with reality comes with a cognitive shock and many deal with it the worst way possible -- f.ex. insisting on a very micro time tracking software.<p>I agree it was nice to chat with colleagues face to face. But all said and done -- it&#x27;s work, not your family&#x27;s house. I dealt with it quite fine back when I moved to remote work 10 years ago. I miss it sometimes still. But the perks of working from home far outweigh this drawback.<p>Plus, remote work encourages you to have an actual social life outside of work, which I view as a very good thing.')
