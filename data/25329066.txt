That&#x27;s what makes it theft.<p>There is no deprival, therefore no theft in &quot;watching something you didn&#x27;t pay for&quot;.<p>If you argue &quot;you are depriving the right of the artist to make money&quot; that makes the assumption that the right of an artist to coerce money out of the counterparty existed.  And yes, I make art, highly valuable art, with my creative brain, and I give it away without expecting any compensation for it.  Yet I still find a way to eat.  Huh.')
