When?\n&gt;\n&gt; Probably not, very small community, few resources, etc. â€¦<p>Have you used both? Not seriously, I&#x27;m going to say, or else you wouldn&#x27;t say something like that.<p>As one example - one reason you&#x27;d be looking for a C++ alternative is to interact with existing scientific computing codebase written in C. Good chance you won&#x27;t care about all the stuff that gives Rust the steep learning curve, and you don&#x27;t want to mix weird symbols all over your code. I used Rust first, then moved to D. There&#x27;s no way someone used to programming in C is going to feel more comfortable with Rust than with D. (They might still choose Rust, but there&#x27;s just no way they&#x27;d do it because of comfort.)')
