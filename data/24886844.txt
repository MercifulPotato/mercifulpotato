But IIRC they were mostly 32-bit machines with few cores running at relatively slow clock speeds. Still they were great machines for many purposes, and very inexpensive.<p>What seems to be new here is that this machine is built on the Snapdragon 7C, which is an 8-core[0] 64-bit machine running at 2.4 Ghz. And it has a touchscreen, a 180-degree hinge, and it will sell for $399&#x2F;Â£399. I&#x27;ll probably buy one if I can boot real Linux on it.<p>[0] Not sure if those are 8 actual cores or 4 hyperthreaded cores.')
