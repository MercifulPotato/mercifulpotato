Item(by='Herodotus38', descendants=None, kids=[25706868], score=None, time=1610237270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706315, text='Sure and when you have results of a RCT of zinc plus HCQ in prophylactic patients and publish it I will read it with great interest and if the data looks good I will be giving it to all my patients.<p>If, however, you want to tell me that I should be using it now, because of a proposed mechanism and theoretical benefit, by using that logic why shouldn&#x27;t I be giving my patients all other vitamins&#x2F;supplements&#x2F;medications that have been variously proposed and have their own believers?<p>Aside from HCQ+zinc, what other cheap, low risk interventions do you propose be given and studied?<p>(edit: additional thoughts)\nIf you don&#x27;t have any others, than I suggest you reevaluate why you think HCQ+zinc is unique (it&#x27;s not).  If you do, then you&#x27;ll have a list of them and probably a list of reasons for each and a ranking of which are the most promising and which are the least.  When you do this, it forces you to critically think about how best to rank these and how that ranking might change with evidence.  Then it forces you to study the evidence.<p>In an above post I mentioned that I did give HCQ to patients in the hospital back in March when it was the only thing that had ANY evidence (and the evidence was poor, but it was all they had).  It made no difference, and it may have caused some deaths due to QTc prolongation (personally I believe it is very safe and I&#x27;ve taken it for malarial prophylaxis before).<p>edit: (I removed a snarky line, apologies)')
