In the 2010s, corporate capitalism seemed eternal and unassailable. Dysfunctional, yes, but geared toward entrenchment and self-acceleration (fascism) rather than collapse.<p>COVID-19 proved corporate capitalism invalid. I would have rather seen socialism succeed than capitalism fail and certain I wish we hadn&#x27;t had to see over a million people die because of our economic system, but nevertheless, this is an opportunity for the left. Universal basic income is now a mainstream position. Trump, who would have probably be winning if COVID-19 hadn&#x27;t happened, is now the underdog.<p>I feel a lot of sympathy for people who are, for the first time in their life, experiencing mental distress, serious ill-health, and disability. I don&#x27;t mean to understate that. I&#x27;m not happy that COVID-19 happened, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is. For me, though, the uncertainty has kept me going. There&#x27;s a lot to be afraid of, but there&#x27;s also cause for hope. It is now not merely a growing sentiment but common knowledge that our economic elite must be overthrown, no matter the cost.')
