Ship the next minor version, AOO 4.2 by ApacheCon EU 2016, or kill it. As expected its apologists insisted they were now back on track and I&#x27;d be eating my words shortly and the Foundation decided to take no action.<p>You might wonder, well, when <i>did</i> they ship AOO 4.2 tialaramex? Maybe it wasn&#x27;t by ApacheCon EU but perhaps it was the week after, or the month after? Or the year after?<p>It still hasn&#x27;t shipped.')
