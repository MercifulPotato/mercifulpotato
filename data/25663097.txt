So far none has been presented. And what &quot;proof&quot; is out there are either known falsehoods, crazy theories (zombie Hugo Chavez wants Biden and not Trump to win), or nonsensical (CIA&#x2F;DOD&#x2F;NSA radioactive isotope watermarks are applied to all legitimate  ballots, any day now they&#x27;ll show that x million ballots were fakes).<p>Other than the dishonest (to themselves or others), few are claiming <i>no fraud</i>. There&#x27;s <i>always</i> fraud (either intentional or not), but usually (and so far this election seems no different) in the tens to hundreds of cases. But there&#x27;s <i>no evidence</i> of millions of faked votes.')
