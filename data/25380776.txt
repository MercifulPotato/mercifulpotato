This will overwhelm hospitals.  I mean we are almost at a complete ICU collapse right now already.  And a lot of people will die, not just of covid but of other treatable diseases.  Not to mention we will run out of PPE and medical supplies.  Care will be rationed even more than it is now.  More doctors and nurses and respiratory therapists will get sick and die.  There will be a lot of death.  So basically death, death and more death.  This will disproportionally impact the poor and poor essential workers.<p>And then everything will shutdown anyway because nobody will go out.  We might get 1-2 months maybe 3 months.')
