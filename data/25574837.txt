I was definitely not as fit as the people that played a sport competitively.  I hung out with friends, ate (a lot of) fast food, and didn&#x27;t do much outside of school.  I did have a &quot;weight training&quot; class a few times a week, where we ran a mile and then I played basketball the whole time.  A total of about five hours of exercise a week, and not being sedentary, definitely not an outlier for many teenagers.  Yet still considered overweight?<p>The problem is that the BMI probably matches fairly well to a specific slice of the population.  Maybe males 25-40.  It likely loses accuracy of meaning the farther in age either direction you go, as well as the more different you are from the optimal subgroup.  This is only barely noted in most cases (it&#x27;s alluded to here in this article that Asian people might see problems at different BMI numbers).  What about women vs men?  What about the young and elderly?  As a metric, BMI is poorly understood by the public, and this poor understanding is targeted and capitalized on by different studies.  All it does is cloud our view of what&#x27;s really going on.')
