It&#x27;s conceivable that a car from that era could continue to work well into the 2100s.  Because most of what can break on can be remanufactured by a reasonably-skilled machinist.<p>Yeah, cars need to be fixed much less often, and they are substantially less fickle vis-a-vis temperature and operating conditions.  But the moment the software to repair newer cars is gone, so too goes our ability to easily fix them.<p>This isn&#x27;t some far-flung dystopian idea either.  It&#x27;s totally possible that the hardware &amp; software used to repair today&#x27;s cars is difficult or impossible to come by in 30 years.  Some of this stuff is five- and six-figure investments.  Maybe stuff for GM or Honda vehicles will be accessible, but what about smaller companies like Mazda or Subaru?')
