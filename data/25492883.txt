Increasing the clock \nspeed for slightly more single core performance is an intentional design decision, not an engineering flaw. Clock up those Apple chips and they are going to guzzle more power than AMD&#x27;s chips. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;14892&#x2F;a12-fvcurve_575px.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;14892&#x2F;a12-fvcurve_575px.pn...</a><p>Apple&#x27;s preference for manufacturing processes that optimize for mobile low ower consumption below the 4Ghz range mean scaling up is harder than just slapping a higher TDP on the chips. Remember the TDP of the whole package already exceeds the TDP of the most power hungry Ryzen core running at 4.8Ghz. Apple has enough headroom to boost to the same frequencies but they don&#x27;t, because of the manufacturing process they have chosen which loses all of its efficiency beyond 4Ghz.')
