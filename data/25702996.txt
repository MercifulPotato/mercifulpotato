If those situations were a very real possibility in your daily job, would you perform that job unarmed? I wouldn&#x27;t. Maybe some very brave mental health professionals would, for a time, until some of them are killed as well, as indiscriminately as the police, which is inevitable.<p>What then? Stop pulling people over altogether, because it&#x27;s not worth risking anybody&#x27;s life further? Just let people speed and drive drunk, or drive with an unsafe vehicle?<p>When I get this far in discussions with people, it eventually comes down to &quot;well dangerous people shouldn&#x27;t have guns.&quot; It&#x27;s a nice thought, naive in my opinion, but regardless, how do we deal with the reality of right now until those ideals manifest in reality? The reality is that dangerous people make regular traffic stops too dangerous for normal people to behave in any other way that to exercise extreme caution.')
