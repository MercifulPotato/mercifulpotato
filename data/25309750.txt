That technical skills don&#x27;t help you much there, I&#x27;m not very surprised. Whether it gets you hired is what I&#x27;d be more interested in, even though this is already useful information. Interviewing really seems to be a skill of its own, the phone screen part if nothing else, rather than that you&#x27;re selling your technical prowess.')
