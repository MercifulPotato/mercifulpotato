Think Asana&#x2F;Trello&#x2F;Jira but end-to-end encrypted.<p>A few cool things;<p>- it&#x27;s an open startup, meaning all our interesting metrics (user sign ups, MRR, etc are public)<p>- we&#x27;re about to release our SDK which means more cool projects can integrate with it. It&#x27;s also how we built our feedback widget (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portabella.io&#x2F;feedback" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portabella.io&#x2F;feedback</a>), the widget just consumes the SDK<p>- we offer a 70% discount for non profits and students. Additionally we&#x27;ll price match based on local purchasing power if our plans are too steep.<p>Check it out!')
