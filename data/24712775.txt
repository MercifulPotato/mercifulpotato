It may or may not be any more useful. I&#x27;ve seen different people come to understand the problem from different examples.<p><pre><code>    1. Observe that 3&#x2F;3 = 1. Pedantic, yes, but good for frame of mind here.\n    2. Pick one of three doors. (1&#x2F;3 odds)\n    3. Gain information that one of the three doors is a loser.\n    4. Note your odds on choosing the original door correctly are still 1&#x2F;3.\n    5. Note that if you change doors, there are still 2&#x2F;3 doors there to choose.\n    5. Note you&#x27;re not going to switch to the known loser door, so if you change doors you know 100% which of the other 2&#x2F;3 of doors to choose.\n  \n</code></pre>\nThe intuition usually is that you&#x27;re down to two doors after the loser door is opened, but that&#x27;s not the case. There are still three doors. The host has just told you that if you trade doors, you know which door to trade for. So trade for it.<p>Note there&#x27;s a newer version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, hosted by Wayne Brady, but there is no option to switch after a losing door has been shown in that version.')
