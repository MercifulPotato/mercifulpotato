Item(by='quotz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609615763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613217, text='I dont really know any editors at all to be honest with you, but I could easily see this to be super popular on youtube or netflix or NatGeo or anything of the sorts if edited well. Maybe do an &quot;Ask HN&quot; thread and explain this? Or go to some youtube forums and try to find an editor? I think theres perfect content and I am up to 32 episode, but a bunch of times the episodes are not transitioning well and I find myself confused whether it is the right episode. Also, the beginning with the intro is too long and repeated, and you could for sure make the vids longer, probs 10-20 mins per episode. Sometimes the voice is different, sometimes the camera is too shaky, but with good editing you could definitely make this into a clear storyline, but I think you would need a great editor that knows how to make this. Maybe shoot some emails to a bunch of channels and explain this to them, they might sign a deal or something and do the editing too. I am really not familiar with this industry, but I watch loads of shows and youtube channels so I can definitely say it needs some polishing. But I really love it! Also, if anything, your show would 100% convince me to buy a Rubicon more than any car ad Ive ever seen!')
