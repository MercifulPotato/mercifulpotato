But taking out a bunker .. unless you have access to weapons specially build for that purpose, good luck.<p>That AT&amp;T still went down, may just demonstrated an apparent oversight in their emergency procedures for this site. I don&#x27;t know the details, but having backup generators that rely any public infrastructure sounds like a pretty bad choice. That said, maybe those generators first burned through a decent supply of diesel fuel, only to later rely on (in this case absent) gas.<p>I have no idea how much diesel would be required to keep that site running for a prolonged period of time. Maybe such an amount could pose regulatory&#x2F;safety issues on its own. Nonetheless, the sole purpose of emergency generators is to provide power that does not depend on any external factors (maybe aside from air&#x2F;oxygen). So to me this story does sound at least a bit weird.<p>But somebody targeting that building and totally underestimating their chances, even if they may have still succeeded partially (if only by &quot;luck&quot;) .. nah, that can not surprise me at all.')
