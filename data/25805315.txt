You enter a few details about your financial situation and location and I present your &quot;home preparedness&quot; summary. I then present a list of homes in the area for you to browse, each with a score to show how affordable it is for you. Finally, you can save homes to your account to track changes over time as we help you to prepare for your first (or subsequent) home purchase.<p>Right now it&#x27;s a Django application that I&#x27;ve been working on for a few weeks now. I hope to have a MVP ready that I could present here soon.')
