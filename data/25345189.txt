I just bought them. I love being able to switch between my iPhone and my Mac on my AirPods.<p>I have the Sony MX3&#x27;s, and they are great. I don&#x27;t like toggling between devices and having it automatically connect to my last used device, have to disconnect it from one, blah, blah.<p>This is what Apple does. They raise prices. People are stunned initially. Others follow, then those prices are the norm. iPhone was considered overpriced when it was released. I think people have always thought the same about Macs, iPad, Apple Watch, etc.')
