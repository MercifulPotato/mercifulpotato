Insurance sort of kind of theoretically works like this (maybe substitute &quot;time&quot; for &quot;people&quot; that you&#x27;re spreading the risk over), but the insurance industry are always going to be experts in making sure that no one is coming out ahead on that system. I&#x27;d rather have the entire population subsidize a small amount for everyone&#x27;s health than randomly make a subset of the population destitute for what&#x27;s often complete random bad luck.<p>Secondly, if you take a look at non-insured prices for health care in countries with universal health care (for the most part, the &quot;universal&quot; part is limited to residents and visitors still have to pay), the prices are still significantly lower than they are in the U.S. Having a single payer for insurance and strong regulations over health care enable things like price controls, which makes perfect sense in a health care context since it&#x27;s never really going to work as a free market (emergency care needs to be treated immediately without the ability to &quot;shop around&quot;, the care required isn&#x27;t always evident at intake, doctors refuse to talk or consider financial aspects, etc.)')
