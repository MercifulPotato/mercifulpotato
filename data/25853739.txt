And for old people memory is kind.<p>I live in California where almost by definition everyone came here from somewhere else.  In a very nice neighborhood I lived a former strip mall was getting developed.  Keep in mind, it wasn&#x27;t that nice when it was created in the &#x27;40 and &#x27;50s --hence strip malls-- but now it is nose bleed expensive.  What did these neighbors want?  Not housing, god forbid they build multiple unit housing!  But a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe&#x27;s would be nice.  Yes the traffic was getting worse and density was increasing.  Things were changing.  But did these people want there houses to be worth 1&#x2F;5th of what they were worth twenty years ago?  Did they want to get paid what they got paid in those days?   No, they just didn&#x27;t want new neighbors.')
