They really want to show their viewers; &quot;Ha, look how stupid other people are. It&#x27;s alright to laugh about them, because they are so dumb. Good thing we the good ones!&quot;. It is absolutely despicable.<p>South Park never does this. They just make fun of people or current trends in society, without evaluating them morally. They are more drastic, but never claim moral superiority.')
