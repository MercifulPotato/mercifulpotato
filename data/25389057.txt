In the US regulatory system there is no in-between.<p>That is why all the reactor companies go for a fully functional production design with the first try. Without such a plan and reactor built, you do not get access to fissile material. Since you have to build many of them to ever have a hope of making money fast iteration is gone be difficult.<p>In general they all want to use the same basic design with different fuel and different operations to create a different type of reactor. Uranium fast burners are the easiest, thorium breeders are much further away.<p>For Molten Salt Reactors, the most advanced in development is probably IMSR by Terrestrial Energy, after that SSR by Moltex Energy are both currently in Canadian regulatory process.<p>Flibe energy is trying in the US but that is longer term, there is not even a regulatory process in the US yet. Flibe is by Kirk Sorensen the guy who basically restarted Thorium hype.')
