Item(by='nspattak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606824981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260662, text='the word trigonometry comes from the greek word &quot;trigono&quot; (triangle) and &quot;metro&quot; (count) which quite clearly describe what trigonometry covers: counting triangles (ie sides and angles). Its history dates back to at least the ancient greeks (if not more&#x2F;other civilizations, I do not know). Linear algebra is a different field of mathematics which focuses on solving systems of linear equations which has a LOT of applications (even in other non applied mathematics). I think it is better if you do not try to think one as part of the other.<p>trigonometry provides the trigonometric functions, their relationship and a few basic equations. Linear algebra provides vectors&#x2F;matrices. You need both of them to model 3D objects and vectors interscting with them (aka rays hitting objects)')
