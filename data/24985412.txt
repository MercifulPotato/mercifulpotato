Anecdotally, they&#x27;ve been great at staving off my usual post-lunch slump. \nRight around the same time as I got it, though, I started waking up much earlier naturally, without an alarm clock (shifting from ~9AM natural wake up to more like ~6AM). I&#x27;m careful about turning the corncob off no later than 6PM, and the earlier wake up time might be unrelated, but I was wondering if others had experienced a similar phenomenon with extended, consistent exposure to super bright lights during the day.')
