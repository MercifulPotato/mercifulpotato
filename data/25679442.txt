My reading of the Federalist Papers is that one of the main reasons-to-be of the Constitution was to avoid tyranny, the men that wrote that thing down put things like respecting private property or even what form of government to use after that. I admit, maybe I&#x27;m wrong on that interpretation (I&#x27;ve read them about three years ago), but I&#x27;ve recently started reading a selection of Anti-federalist Papers and I stand by my opinion.<p>&gt; FB&#x27;s and Twitter&#x27;s constitutional rights<p>Again, there was nothing in the Federalist Papers (nor in the Constitution) about respecting the rights of private, abstract, soulless entities. Yes, I know about the relatively recent decision that gave those corporations a &quot;political soul&quot; (so to speak), but that decision had nothing to do with the original spirit of the basic law on which the USA was founded.')
