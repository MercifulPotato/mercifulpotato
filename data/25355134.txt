If you have to go to a convenient centralized location to pick up a locally available item, you might as well just go to the store and buy the item without involving a drone.<p>Maybe if you have drones with a large enough service radius, you can centralize warehouses enough to have a much better selection than convenience stores. If you&#x27;re still delivering to centralized lockers, though, it seems like packages could be batched in trucks as they currently are. I suspect sparsely filled trucks would still be cheaper to operate than drones, even with similar delivery times.<p>The value of drone based delivery really seems to me to be in getting packages exactly where they are needed faster and cheaper than sending it via direct courier.')
