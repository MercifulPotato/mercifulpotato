Hardly. As soon as one stops paying taxes and gets caught he is officially a criminal. No he can&#x27;t even emigrate because foreign countries won&#x27;t give him a visa: you usually are required to provide a certificate of having no criminal records at your home country to the embassy when you apply and they don&#x27;t take &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want to support our wicked government&quot; as an excuse.')
