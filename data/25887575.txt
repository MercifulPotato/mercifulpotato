I first saw React in production at work in 2015. That’s almost six years ago. Before React, sure, there was a lot of churn, but there has been a huge time period in which no one got fired for choosing React plus Webpack.<p>At that same job, our app team was switching to Swift for its new code, which no doubt has had considerable churn since then, since it was before ABI stability or SwiftUI or whatever (I’m not a Swift dev so just guessing from the outside on the specifics).')
