An email alias of the form you provide is\nno protection at all to them, because the troll can follow the instructions\non your landing page to send any number of messages to the same user by\nchoosing a new alias for each message. An easy solution is to allow the\noption of accepting messages only on pre-defined aliases.\nIf you do that already, it would be good to mention it in\nthe FAQ.')
