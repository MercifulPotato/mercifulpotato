Yes, that&#x27;s part of what it says. But if they can&#x27;t come to an agreement, Australia gets to set the price sharing amount. And declining to link to news content isn&#x27;t allowed, so if it costs Google more than the news is worth, well then it&#x27;s effectively just a tax that applies to only a single company.<p>This is like if I, the mayor, said, you must negotiate with this man to rent some rooms of your house. If he doesn&#x27;t like the price you give, I&#x27;ll decide what it is. No, you can&#x27;t choose not to rent rooms to him.')
