I&#x27;m the developer of GameLisp :)<p>You&#x27;re correct that I&#x27;ve chosen safety and convenience over performance. I might eventually consider integrating the Cranelift code generator to try to achieve LuaJIT-like performance, but it&#x27;s definitely not on the short-term roadmap.<p>In practice, I find that GameLisp is more than fast enough to script a busy 2D platformer, as long as you&#x27;re sensible about using Rust for the more CPU-intensive parts of your game engine.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m planning to release GameLisp 0.2 within the next few days - happy to field any other questions while I&#x27;m here!')
