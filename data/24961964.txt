What amount of hardware validation is reasonable?<p>It depends on what you&#x27;d like to accomplish, but given that powerful FPGAs are now more affordable and plenty of great FPGA friendly libraries are emerging which work with open source tools, the barrier for Soft-CPU implementations has lowered significantly. This sort of project looks great for cases where trusting blackbox chips was questionable.')
