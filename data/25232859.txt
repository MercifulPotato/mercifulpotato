Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606513674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229524, text='These “dihedrons” (which you might as well just call “2x2 matrices with real entries”) are isomorphic to the geometric algebra of the 2-dimensional Euclidean vector plane with signature (+, +), with 1 scalar component, 2 vector components, and 1 bivector component. Personally I find the basis 1, e₁, e₂, e₁e₂ and the notation of GA to be conceptually much clearer than the matrix entries and standard matrix sum&#x2F;product to work with, but sometimes using a matrix representation is convenient in a computer.<p>(2x2 real matrices are also isomorphic to the geometric algebra of the 2-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean vector plane with signature (+, -), under a different interpretation.)<p>By comparison the quaternions are the even subalgebra of the geometric algebra of 3-dimensional Euclidean vector space with signature (+,+,+), consisting of only the 1 scalar and 3 bivector components. Or under a different interpretation are isomorphic to the full geometric algebra of the 2-dimensional vector plane with signature (-, -). They can be represented as Pauli matrices.<p>For more on this see the papers and books of Garret Sobczyk, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garretstar.com&#x2F;secciones&#x2F;publications&#x2F;publications.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garretstar.com&#x2F;secciones&#x2F;publications&#x2F;publications.h...</a> ; for example the recent <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.garretstar.com&#x2F;sobczyk09-mar-2020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.garretstar.com&#x2F;sobczyk09-mar-2020.pdf</a>')
