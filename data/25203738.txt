It&#x27;s a pretty major rebuild in a whole lot of ways (new UI, new DAG API, up to TEN TIMES faster task execution, multiple schedulers at once). I&#x27;ve actually had friends prepared to pick Prefect over Airflow until they tried 2.0. We put a lot of work into it, including extensive QA time to ensure that it runs reliably.<p>Disclosure: I&#x27;m on the Airflow PMC.')
