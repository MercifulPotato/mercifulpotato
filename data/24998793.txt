Game developers are people who can have GTA5 running on a PS3, a console with 256x2 MB of RAM, while web applications displaying a chat frequently use more memory than that. I guess you call it masochist, I call it being efficient and excellent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d0KJhFMnWRI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d0KJhFMnWRI</a>')
