I&#x27;ve attempted building a global microphone mute app (for external microphones) on Catalina but never found an easy way to fully mute all mics such as external USB mics or a those connected through a USB ADC. The best I could get on Catalina was to lower the inputVolume to 0 which does not truly mute the microphone. I never found an app that &quot;solved&quot; this problem for all microphones on OSX versions prior to Big Sur.')
