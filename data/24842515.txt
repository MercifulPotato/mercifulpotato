Could someone please say whether the author explains why deep learning shouldn&#x27;t work?<p>There is a bit at the start about how people in statistical learning throw their hands up at deep learning etc, but none of that makes sense to me. Neural nets are an idea as old as AI - even older, in fact. The need for deeper networks was well understood by the 1980&#x27;s. There are well known results about feedforward neural nets with arbitrary hideen units being universal function approximators. Why shouldn&#x27;t deep learning work?')
