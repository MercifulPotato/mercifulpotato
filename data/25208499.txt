Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very realistic number.<p>I think it&#x27;s fairly realistic. The Dell Latitude 7250 is probably a good representative of what you can get used for ~$220-$300 US these days: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dell+7250&amp;_sacat=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m...</a> The dual-core processor should still be serviceable for everyday work, at ~1.3kg it&#x27;s light enough to carry around all day, a 1080p resolution should be OK on a 12&quot; screen, and it can take up to 16GiB of RAM, though holding out for one with 16GiB preinstalled will definitely tend to push the cost up to nearer $300: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dell+7250&amp;_sacat=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;sch&#x2F;i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m...</a><p>(Then any laptop with similar specs except with a 2-in-1 form factor tends to cost a fair bit more, but that&#x27;s not a must-have for most students or anyone who might have been considering a MacBook.)')
