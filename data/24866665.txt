Under the hood they&#x27;re barely anything better than Markov chains.<p>I&#x27;m almost sure autocompletion in Finnish (or Estonian or Hungarian) is borderline useless, as the chances to write a word that wasn&#x27;t ever written before are quite high.<p>But even with more &quot;sane&quot; grammars these models barely work. When I write in Spanish, often there are verb forms that are missing that I have to type fully.<p>For example, in Spanish, all forms are on conjugation lists, but it can be tough to find a set of corpuses that covers all. I know that a 2016 Spanish Wikipedia dump I played with covered about 20% of all verb forms present in rae.es.<p>Then on all those forms (I&#x27;d say about 16-18 tense&#x2F;mood&#x2F;aspect forms are in common use) you have to take into account enclitic&#x2F;affix pronouns, and the whole thing goes awry quick.<p>&quot;Comámosnoslas&quot; - If you search on Google, there are only 9 results[0], this post likely to become the 10th. But it&#x27;s a completely normal word a Spanish speaker may use and will understand.<p>comamos (&quot;let us eat&quot;) nos (emphasis &quot;for ourselves&quot;) las (&quot;them&quot;, feminine). &quot;Let&#x27;s eat them!&quot; but with emphasis lost in translation.<p>E.g. usage &quot;Hay 3 pizzas, ¡comámosnoslas!&quot; . This sentence, funnily, is properly translated by Google Translate into English, but it tries to correct it to &quot;comamosnos las&quot; which is absolutely broken Spanish.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=comamosnoslas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?hl=en&amp;q=comamosnoslas</a>')
