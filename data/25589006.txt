The only thing that a real machine is useful for now is testing that the machine works. Other than google&#x27;s recent contrived test, any quantum algorithm ever executed will run just as well (or better) on a simulator as on a real machine.<p>It&#x27;s going to be like that for a while, even after we&#x27;re well into the quantum supremacy realm. First, there&#x27;s not anything you can do with a real machine until error correction is working, which requires 10k(?) qubits. And frankly, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot you could do with even a real million qbit machine now if one were to exist. Prime factorization is the big one, but other NP complete problems have no known quantum algorithm to speed them up (and note prime factorization is <i>not</i> NP complete -- so it&#x27;s possible no quantum speedup for any NP complete problem exists (or it&#x27;s possible that P==NP in which case....)). The real work is in the math and algo theory to find solutions for these problems. Coding and running them is actually kind of incidental and &quot;cute&quot;.')
