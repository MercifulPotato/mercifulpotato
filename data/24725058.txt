You&#x27;re referring to the fact that an employer can technically terminate COBRA by ending <i>all</i> health insurance plans. But Coinbase would have to stop offering <i>any</i> health insurance to all their current employees for this to occur. If that happens (I&#x27;m virtually certain it won&#x27;t), there would be an actual employee riot&#x2F;exodus and the tech media would be all over that story.')
