As my Signal use moves from just messages with friends and family to business contacts I <i>need</i> a reliable way to backup my messages!<p>[1] I should state I mean losing the desktop copy as it starts &quot;fresh&quot; and does not import any messages from the phone.<p>Edit: I should probably clarify I am talking about the iOS&#x2F;macOS applications as these are what I use. iOS does have a migration feature but that doesn&#x27;t help if your phone is lost&#x2F;damaged. I need a <i>proper</i> backup and restore process as well as the ability to import messages from the phone to the desktop app.')
