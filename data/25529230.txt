Here&#x27;s my take on it.<p>For the most part, when looking at a monitor, chromatic adaptation is pretty good. In other words, RGB #FFFFFF looks white, not light blue, and #808080 looks gray, not bluish-gray. It does start falling apart when you mix different lighting, for example holding a white piece of paper to the screen under normal room light.<p>I think the main reason D65 is chosen for the sRGB white point is that it is fairly <i>accurate,</i> in other words it&#x27;s pretty close to the actual white point of the monitor I&#x27;m looking at now (Dell P2415Q).<p>I have yet to find a source on chromatic adaptation that I consider a really excellent tutorial. Certainly the Wikipedia page is cursory and abstract, which is a shame.')
