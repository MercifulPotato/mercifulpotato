It looks pretty good.<p>I just spotted JavaFX Script. Huh. This is <i>almost</i> directionally correct. So of course it got killed.<p>If you&#x27;re curious what The Correct Answerâ„¢ is, imagine VRML-97 reimplemented using JavaFX Script like syntax.<p>Its wiki has a link to the Curl (programming language). That syntax is also directionally correct. But is also missing most of VRML&#x27;s semantics.<p>There&#x27;s also a link to the F3 programming language, aka &quot;form fits function&quot;. Great slogan. Alas. Looks like a misunderstanding of Conal Elliot&#x27;s Fran functional reactive programming language.<p>Oh well.<p>Thanks for the tip. JavaFX&#x27;s Script w&#x2F; CSS was about 1&#x2F;2 the solution. Maybe someday someone will loop back and harvest the good bits.')
