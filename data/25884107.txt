The Pilot G2 actually has the perfect case but is too inky for my tastes (and stores usually dont carry the 0.38&#x2F;0.5 widths). The dream pen would have the Pilot G2 case with the uniball signo 207 needle cartridge.<p>EDIT: It turns out the uniball signo 207 is actually a gel pen, not a rollerball!')
