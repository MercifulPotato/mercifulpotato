I recently realized that I type with all 5 fingers on my left hand but hit 90% of the keys with my index finger on the right. I’m fast mind you - 90-100wpm blind as well. But for any prolonged stretches (10 minute+) it starts to hurt.<p>So a while back I started doing 10 minute a day typing exercises with Typing Academy to train my right hand. Whenever I did it blind it was just mistake after mistake after mistake. I felt so incapable. But when I started looking down I was able to correct myself and still use the right technique. Much better. I was slow. But slowly learning without frustration.<p>I guess my point is: crawl before you walk, walk before you run. The frustration made me quit, and that’s always worse than looking down and learning.')
