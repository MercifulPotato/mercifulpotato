I don&#x27;t think you fully understand how crucial a very detailed technical spec is for the adoption of a tool like this.<p>The first question with any P2P project is if I have any control over other people&#x27;s traffic that passes through my system. No mention of this anywhere, leave alone a detailed discussion. I saw your replies here on this subject and they are ultimately... inane if you pardon the bluntness. I realize that you mean well, but you are exceptionally naive in terms of how quickly a system like this will be abused to a very severe degree.')
