Even 5Ghz can get froggy with traffic contention. Working against a 15fps 1080p stream on 5Ghz is actually how I test streams with poor health and unpredictable behavior. Throw streaming over TCP into the mix and oof.<p>Also throwing another network component into the mix may not work for most folks.<p>---<p>PS: Before someone yells at me for saying &quot;TCP streaming&quot; because &quot;clearly UDP is the right tool for the job!&quot;: nope. TCP is the use-case.')
