If you just need a knife for regular things like cutting open fruit and boxes, then almost any cheap thing with a cutting edge will do. People who bother to hold opinions and do detailed reviews of pocket knives are coming at the subject from an essentially aesthetic perspective.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like looking for unbiased reviews of mechanical wristwatches. If you just want to tell time, a $20 quartz Timex will work fine. Once you step away from the criteria of basic functionality, you&#x27;re entering the land of opinions.<p>Edit: this comes across kind of judgmental, which is not what I meant. I just mean that the knife you like is going to come down to your own opinion, and the only way to form that is to check out lots of options and other opinions and see what you agree with.')
