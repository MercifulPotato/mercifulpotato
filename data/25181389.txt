When it arrived it had all this official government tape on it and a note that it had been opened. I forget what the tape&#x2F;note said but it was not obvious which agency did the opening. Not so long after that I had something else totally innocuous (literally a postcard sized cardboard envelope with a sticker in it) opened by Customs and Border Patrol and that was well labeled as such.<p>I guess for IED reasons they were interested but now I&#x27;m paranoid I&#x27;m on some list.<p>edit: oh and I should say I got 8 to have a variety of color options, they were a great gift and after shipping it was only like $80. Highly recommend, one of them would match any outfit. Kind of fun to watch them all drift variably over several months too.')
