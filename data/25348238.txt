I would be truly surprised if pi-hole&#x27;s don&#x27;t support DoH though so I&#x27;d just try searching for something like &quot;enabling DoH on a pihole&quot; or similar.<p>Basically sounds like you&#x27;ve already done the hardest parts. Your router is redirecting all DNS traffic to your pi-hole, this will prevent any normal unencrypted DNS traffic from leaving your local network. You pi-hole will be in turn making all the DNS requests. If you turn on DoH for the pi-hole all the DNS requests on your network will be encrypted.')
