I&#x27;m an Indian. Native American is a term invented by white people&quot;<p>So, I called people Indians until a Native American said to me: &quot;I prefer Native American. Indian is derogatory.&quot; When I asked her about what my previous friends said,  she said &quot;The people who want to be called Indian are ignorant people from the reservation who don&#x27;t know any better&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s just best policy to ask whatever term someone prefers to use, and use that.')
