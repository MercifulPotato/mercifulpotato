Cubans and Vietnamese who came here in the 1960s and 1970s as refugees are already fully converged economically with whites.<p>Economic convergence within a generation or two is not universal. Muslim immigrants to France suffer from multi-generational poverty. Asians and Hispanics have very real incentives to be wary of changing the current economic system. At least to the specific aspect of reaching economic parity with whites, it works extremely well. (There is a fair debate to be had about income inequality and social mobility writ large. Iâ€™m focused here on race.)<p>Also, unions are bad for immigrants, who tend to be excluded from the seniority system.')
