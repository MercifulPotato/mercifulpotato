This will work on any network topology, and already works on k8s.<p>If you want any better load balancing and&#x2F;or failover, you&#x27;ll have to either have something provided by your cloud provider (an LBaaS, and then tie that into Kubernetes via some controller), or have a network topology that can be exploited for this (shared L2 with a VIP or L3 with BGP, so that you can use something like MetalLB).<p>This is not a Kubernetes problem, but a networking problem.')
