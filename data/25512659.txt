When a journalist is being arrested the common top threads are about the validity of the evidence and if the person is guilty or not, and with a large portion of people saying that the individual should face the charges if they are innocent. I have also seen plenty of high upvoted comments that explicitly say how people who play the game in regard to politics should not be surprised if they get burned. I have been in those flame wars advocating for freedom of speech, but it usually doesn&#x27;t end that well.<p>The only thing I would expect is a universal opposition to journalists being killed.')
