Adsense allows anyone of any economic standing to access some of the most refined and powerful tools for gathering, using, and sharing knowledge that humanity has ever built. Google&#x27;s contribution to modern ad tech is, in that sense, an immensely laudable contribution to humankind.\n   The lack of the ability to choose where I spend my valuable attention amounts at some level to a nonconsensual interaction. I am willing to pay for both Google&#x27;s services and those of the content creator (and I am sensitive to the fairness of that relationship as well), but not being able to choose how I pay has led me to make some personal use decisions that put me in conflict with Google&#x27;s revenue model.\n      I have to use an ad blocker\n         Security concerns\n         Unhealthy child development\n   Anti-patterns showing in the development of the internet both technologically and socially\n      Google&#x27;s anticompetitive ad-tech behavior leading to \n         unhealthy browser market share leading to\n            Reduction in diversity of thought in internet technology conversations\n       Centralization of power in ad selection has the unintended side effect of dragging content along with it. Ad personalization (for the sake of maximizing profits in ad sales) led to over-personalization of the types of ads we see (echo chamber effect). \n          Automatic content curation followed the ad-tech model, increasing profits by increasing &quot;engagement.&quot; This led to a dangerous strengthening of the echo chamber effect.\n             We&#x27;re all now used to the central artery of human information being &quot;free&quot; as in beer, but costing us our ability to have a balanced, more-or-less impartial information diet or at least forcing us to work very hard for it.\n   Google, please figure out how to give us another way to pay.')
