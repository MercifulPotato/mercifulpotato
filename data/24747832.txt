If you don’t have your interface well-defined enough that switching out the hashing implementation is difficult, your code is too tightly coupled.<p>A test handing a hash collision <i>is not a test of the hashing algorithm</i> so you should be able to switch out the algorithm to something super predictable. This isn’t a discussion about mocking frameworks - you should be able to do with by just plugging in a different hash implementation when you construct the test.')
