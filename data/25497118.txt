Because this arrangement technically makes employees in a partnership, per the IRS this means they have to pay their own side of social security and isn&#x27;t entitled to e.g. health insurance. It turns out the department of labor has issued conflicting guidance: if I am, for all intents and purposes, employed by a company, then I am to be paid as a W2 employee and am entitled to benefits. My company has chosen to follow the department of labor&#x27;s guidance.')
