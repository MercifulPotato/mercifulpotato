It bans <i>the sitting president</i> from discussing his own belief in election fraud. It bans the <i>current Senate leadership</i> from discussing their belief in election fraud.<p>Some people criticize YouTube there because they are a private company refusing to carry the messages of publicly elected officials.<p>Now, I personally feel no need to defend any of these entities. They&#x27;re all powerful figures capable of their own fighting.<p>If I had to decide on the topic, I&#x27;d probably support YouTube as they&#x27;re the piddling multi-billion dollar company that employs my friends, where as their opponents are the leaders of a trillion-dollar nation with military might exceeding any other country in the world. YouTube is most definitely the underdog in this fight.')
