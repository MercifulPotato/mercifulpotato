Item(by='Bakary', descendants=None, kids=[25486640], score=None, time=1608475863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485766, text='The issue of meritocracy often turns semantic. Different realities can be justified with the same word depending on people&#x27;s conception of justice and efficiency.<p>The other aspect not mentioned is that a society can be meritocratic, but the peak performance that results does not necessarily lead to work that is useful to society in aggregate. I am reminded of Jeff Hammerbacher&#x27;s infamous quote: &quot;the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.&quot; That quote is simplistic to humorous effect of course, but it underlies an important natural run-off effect of meritocracy: that much activity is redistributive instead of creative. That&#x27;s why thinking simply in terms of atomized individuals (as articles on meritocracy written in English usually do) pitted against each other leaves aside too many important questions and outcomes.<p>edit: to add to this, the last paragraph of the article is deeply ironic since you have people fighting over scraps precisely because smart people have captured much of the pie growth, and did so in a way that would be considered meritocratic by the author.')
