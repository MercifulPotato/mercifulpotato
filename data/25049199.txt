Here&#x27;s a quote from a post of mine:<p>&gt; Version control is an underrated skill. Most software engineers use it daily, and yet, many are not willing to invest more than necessary to learn it. Thatâ€™s fine, but knowing more than commit&#x2F;push&#x2F;pull will at least make you more efficient. It will also help you solve issues you (and your colleagues) may encounter.<p>I&#x27;ve had this issue a lot in the past, but mostly at work. So yes, I will spend the time to help my colleague debugging their issue. Eventually, they will get fewer issues, but the time I have to spend for their &quot;learning by doing&quot; would have been better invested in learning Git fundamentals.<p>I&#x27;ve also had some open source contributions during Hacktoberfest, and I went with the easy way out of doing the clean-up work myself. But as you&#x27;ve stated, people might not learn from this, so that&#x27;s not optimal.')
