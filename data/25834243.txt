Bolting together      frameworks for a home page is not engineering. In the same way,  bolting a new turbo on your car is also not engineering.<p>Similarly, engineering needs processes to ensure high quality products. Having test suites with complete code coverage is much like engineering. Having code reviews is like engineering.<p>In terms of ethics, there are not codes that are followed by software “engineers”, but the world would benefit from adopting the codes from engineering, namely the principle duty of an engineer to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public. If you’ve ever programmed a dark pattern or created an addictive interaction, you’re not protecting the public.')
