If you have more than one field on the line, they can differ.<p>For example, if the input is:<p><pre><code>  3 first\n  2 second\n  3 second\n  1 second\n  2 first\n  1 first\n</code></pre>\nthen this is the &quot;sort -nu&quot; output:<p><pre><code>  1 second\n  2 second\n  3 first\n</code></pre>\nwhereas &quot;sort -n | uniq&quot; gives:<p><pre><code>  1 first\n  1 second\n  2 first\n  2 second\n  3 first\n  3 second\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m a bit confused as to how &quot;sort -nu&quot; chooses which record to print when there are more than one with the same key. I would have expected the chosen record to be the one that would have come first in &quot;sort -n&quot; output, so that &quot;sort -n | sort -nu&quot; would be equivalent to &quot;sort -nu&quot;, but that is not the case. The pipe gives:<p><pre><code>  1 first\n  2 first\n  3 first\n</code></pre>\nIt is as if -nu automatically adds -s.')
