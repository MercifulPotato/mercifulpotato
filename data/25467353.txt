It turns out it&#x27;s nothing like that, it&#x27;s more like a new Deus Ex game.<p>2) It just doesn&#x27;t run on consoles. It&#x27;s a very inferior experience, unless you&#x27;re the type who can be happy with 2020 movies in .3gp format in your old Nokia phone. Having watched a video (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C5pHpQqhmR4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C5pHpQqhmR4</a>) of how it runs on PS4, I now clearly see where all this hate comes from.<p>3) There are some bugs and quirks, depending on your platform and luck. I haven&#x27;t had any major issues, though I know for some it&#x27;s just unplayable at the moment. This will likely get much better after patches hit.<p>On a personal note, I like the game a lot. Yes it has its quirks, and I generally feel it&#x27;s a less refined&#x2F;polished game compared to what Witcher 3 was, but still it&#x27;s an extremely fun, really well-made game. Combat is great, world is enticing, story-telling swings between good enough and great. For one reason or another whenever I launch the game another 5 hours passes without me noticing. FPS camera and general art direction also helps with suspension of disbelief, and the game is as immersive as it gets.<p>It&#x27;s a shame that this game now has such a bad reputation for relatively minor &amp; mostly avoidable reasons.')
