Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603421715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859767, text='Balance chargers for small packs, like you&#x27;d have for a radio controlled aircraft, have separate wires for the positive and negative plus in between each cell.  So, a 6-series configuration would have 7 wires and the charger uses them to charge each cell separately to the correct voltage.<p>The problem with that is that each wire has to be able to handle the full charge current, but at a low voltage.  So, if you&#x27;re dealing with, say, an electric car with dozens or hundreds of cells and thick copper cables the size of garden hoses it&#x27;s no longer practical.  Instead, you charge it the simple way (by applying a large voltage to the whole series string through a positive and negative lead) and use a battery management system that measures voltages between cells and drains any high-voltage cells gradually through a resistor.  It&#x27;s kind of wasteful, but it&#x27;s fairly simple and if your batteries are well balanced the BMS shouldn&#x27;t have to do much at all.<p>Using the high cells to charge the low cells would be a nice feature; I&#x27;m not aware of any EV BMS that does that, but I&#x27;m not an expert and I&#x27;m really only aware of what&#x27;s going on with DIY conversions.  I don&#x27;t know what the state of the art is for BMSs in commercially manufactured vehicles.')
