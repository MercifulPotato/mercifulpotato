Non-system software should never have that level of access to the whole system, and a good operating system should block it for stability, security and privacy reasons, just like any other malware.<p>No doubt there will continue to be intrusive anti-cheat software in use with some games for a while because some people are disturbingly desperate to play those games and they use operating systems that are junk. Some people still pre-order games too, even though it&#x27;s illogical to extend that old physical world idea to downloads.<p>But in the long run, this kind of software is a liability. Better operating systems and more gamers moving to them will eventually kill it for that reason if nothing else does first.<p>Given that cheating only matters if it actually affects gameplay unfairly, it has always made far more sense to look for cheating through its effects on gameplay anyway, which is something you can observe server-side in an online PvP game. Trusted client-side security checks make no more sense in this context than any other. So it&#x27;s not even as if killing off the intrusive client-side anti-cheats will lose anything of value in the long run.')
