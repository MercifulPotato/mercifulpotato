You can build on them. Please share back what you find.<p>Social media platforms, more or less:<p>* Tend to blur any one sense of place<p>* Offer geographically dispersed communication<p>* May deemphasize the overall humanity of participants<p>* Tend to accentuate particular aspects of people, such as photos or messages or resumes<p>* Offer asynchronous communication<p>* Allow for nearly zero-cost message sending and replication (i.e. retweeting)<p>* Unlimited person-to-person communication channels<p>Traditional town squares, more or less:<p>* Offer a tangible sense of place<p>* Offer a tangible connection to other people<p>* Are subject to public assembly laws.<p>* Only a limited number of people can fit.<p>* Public many-to-one communication is constrained by acoustics.<p>* So audio amplification is often needed.<p>* Private communications tend to be limited to short-range communication. In other words, you can&#x27;t have N^2 two-person conversations.')
