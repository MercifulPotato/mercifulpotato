There it is possible to auto-login to their app if it is accessed via their network and not via Wi-Fi. For security reasons only a limited amount of functionality is accessible. Neither customer data can be changed nor can any actions resulting in additional cost (buying packs &#x2F; options) be performed without additional authentication mechanism of a higher security level (auto-login via SMS or use of a password).<p>The MSISDN is only added to the HTTP request internally in their secure network and never exposed externally.')
