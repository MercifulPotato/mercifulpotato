No one hid or censored it.:<p>&gt; Does that sound like the scene at the Capitol where Congresspeople were hidden behind a makeshift barricade while an officer was forced to shoot a woman dead literal steps away from them?<p>When even the <i>Secret Service</i> is referring to them as injuries at a demonstration and saying that despite the injuries (for which 11 people needed medical attention, none of them with life threatening injury) no protectees were ever in harms way... who are you to overrule them?<p>-<p>And are you seriously complaining that the movement that actually breached the Capitol was... immediately shut down?<p>Are you daft? You think if the May protestors had actually gotten into the White House they&#x27;d just be fine?<p>-<p>The irony here is delicious, one group was fought tooth and nail from even entering the grounds of the White House.<p>They were teargassed for even being on public property for a photo op! An old man was given a TBI that left him bleeding from the ears and unable to walk for trying to return a police helmet near the _stairs_ to a government building<p>The other group literally walked into the Capitol and had cops taking selfies with them.<p>And yet you want to paint the former group as having gotten off easy? It&#x27;d be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so sad.<p>Imagine trying to paint being against political violence as a partisan issue.')
