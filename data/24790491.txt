Compared to Otto there are some major simplifications we made:<p>* Waypoint does not own&#x2F;manage any infrastructure, Otto attempted to manage the infrastructure. With Waypoint, you have to bring this yourself.<p>* Waypoint has pluggable components for build&#x2F;deploy&#x2F;release. Otto focused in on our tools (mainly because we had to manage the infra, point 1). This makes it much easier to slide into existing ecosystems.<p>On your question of abstractions: this same argument can be made for Terraform so I think my answer there would be the same but for applications. The idea is that Waypoint can give you a consistent workflow to use different tools, and additional value add features such as deployment URLs, exec, logs, etc. that work across platforms.')
