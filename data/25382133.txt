Item(by='burlesona', descendants=None, kids=[25382356], score=None, time=1607659137, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381986, text='Why is it that most surburbs have no parks in walking distance, but most older “inner city” neighborhoods do? And supposing you could pick between a cul-de-sac or a park at the end of your block (holding everything else about the neighborhood the same), which would you prefer?<p>One of the reasons older neighborhoods have more amenities sprinkled throughout is that narrower streets and rectangular blocks cost a lot less to build and yield more homes (with the same average yard size) compared to wide curvilinear streets. That extra money could be used for parks, schools, shops, libraries, etc.<p>If there are people out there who would prefer more pavement in exchange for less of everything else, I think that’s fine as long as they pay the cost of it. But as for me I’d rather have a more efficient neighborhood design that leaves funding left over for other things besides asphalt.')
