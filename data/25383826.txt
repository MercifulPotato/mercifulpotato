And people like you aren&#x27;t the majority of the inhabitants of a city, when people that are born and raised in a city are pushed out by pricing due to 10+% of the stock of possible rental units being used as short-term just so landlords can make a bigger buck it&#x27;s sad and inhumane.<p>Great that from your perspective it&#x27;s helped you, it&#x27;s definitely impacted the lives of a lot of young people that were born in the cities you like to live, AirBnBs are eroding exactly what made them attractive: a good city neighbourhood.')
