It can be incredibly time consuming to solve problems. In my college days I spent days trying to get my keyboard backlight to work and my trackpad to work properly. I have a bunch of research work that needs to get done yesterday and I simply don&#x27;t have time to troll forums or hang out in IRC for someone who might help me.
