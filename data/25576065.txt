I don&#x27;t think the comparison will hold up.<p>The amount of livable land in a city like Mountain View is 12 square miles in city limits, Palo Alto is a massive 26! Austin is 271 square miles.<p>I agree the tax situation for private housing is nuts in the bay, but we should not pretend the bay and Austin face the same housing problems.')
