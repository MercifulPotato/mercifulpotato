We must make this country into a garden of children instead of a disorderly back lot overrun with human weeds.&quot;<p>Sanger, 1939: &quot;The ministerâ€™s work is also important and he should be trained, perhaps by the Federation as to our ideals and the goal that we hope to reach. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.&quot;<p>Sounds like eugenics and genocide to me.<p>&gt; Would you say the same about preventing all babies from being born with fetal alcohol syndrome by having the mothers abort?<p>Yes.')
