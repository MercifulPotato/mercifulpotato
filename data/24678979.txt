In and around London, I will personally miss Bromley Picturehouse, The Ritzy in Brixton and The Gate in Notting Hill. Cineworld Feltham for a time was the busiest cinema in the entire country, seemingly due to its schedule of Bollywood movies. A lot of customers and employees being hammered here.<p>If Odeon or anyone can muster up the cash, which they probably can&#x27;t, picking up the Picturehouse chain would be seriously marvellous.')
