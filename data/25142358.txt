He said that if you&#x27;re one of those lucky people whose jaws are big enough to facilitate four extra molars, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it; if not, cramped wisdom teeth can cause impactions, come in sideways, crowd the rest of your teeth to the point that they become crooked and &quot;tombstoned&quot; (like lopsided headstones in a very old, untended graveyard).<p>Then he proceeded to remove my molars and let my wisdoms grow in and replace them, so maybe he was just nuts, I dunno.')
