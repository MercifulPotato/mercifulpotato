No offense. They don&#x27;t see the impact of allowing user enumeration.<p>Security isn&#x27;t about one feature. It&#x27;s layered. You need to have layers because there is no such thing as guaranteed security.<p>Bank safes are my favorite analogy. Safes are given a time rating. &quot;How long can this safe resist being broken into.&quot; A bank with a 15 minute safe means that it might take an attacker 15 minutes to open the safe.<p>A 15 minute safe is not secure. Infact it is guaranteed to be compromised past 15 minutes. How do you secure an insecure 15m safe? With a 5m guard duty. Now you have a safe to buy you 15 minutes and a guard to ensure that nobody has 15m worth of access to the safe.<p>You built a safe with no guard... and by allowing enumeration you&#x27;re telling attackers where you put the safe. You are almost guaranteeing someone will compromise it eventually.<p>Security doesn&#x27;t always mean that successful attacks are impossible. Oftentimes security just means you&#x27;ve made the cost of intrusion higher than the return on investment. If you allow enumeration you&#x27;re giving the attacker an advantage.')
