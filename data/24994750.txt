The community around it is writing blogs and articles about how to do this and that with workflowy. While all they do is provide how they made their own workflow to tackle a problem in a very limited environment. It like someone inventing markdown formatting for writing using Notepad more efficiently.<p>I moved to Dynalist and the thing I use most is its API. I have setup a custom chrome extension to save notes \nand bookmarks to it with just one click. Also set it up to send links to it from my phone. Set it up with Github Actions to keep updated &#x27;List of X&#x27; articles on my blog.<p>It does what workflowy does and more. I stayed with workflowy for a long time and wasn&#x27;t very happy to move over but workflowy has stopped growing.<p>You need to take something from Dynalist just as they did from Workflowy.')
