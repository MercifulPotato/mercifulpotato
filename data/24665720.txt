I have no idea how wikipedia works, but I&#x27;ve run a lot of high volume relatively static sites. A simple thing that works very well is to do SSR, but serve it through a CDN like akamai, then configure akamai to serve a static&#x2F;cached version if the backend is down. Assuming everything is working, you get a semi dynamic SSR model, but if something goes down, the site is still served and you have no customer facing downtime.')
