I&#x27;ve never heard that term and Google isn&#x27;t helping me out much. Do you have a recommendation on where I could learn more?<p>I have noticed that things like this aren&#x27;t too far removed from other fields. When I wrote my article about reviewing code from the reviewer&#x27;s side[0], I got feedback that most of the techniques apply to giving feedback in other domains. And while I was writing my guide to hiring writers,[1] I realized that the process is 80% identical to my process for hiring developers and graphic designers.<p>The thing that&#x27;s tough about going more abstract is that it becomes hard to convince any particular group that the content is worth reading. Focusing on code review appeals to HN because a large percentage of the audience is developers, but if it was a more general guide to improving review workflows, I&#x27;d have a harder time convincing HN readers that it was relevant to them.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;human-code-reviews-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;human-code-reviews-1&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;hiring-content-writers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;hiring-content-writers&#x2F;</a>')
