My normal deep voice now sounds like Mickey Mouse&#x27;s and it hurts to swallow.  With all the advancements in medicine and especially during the current pandemic it would seem an opportune time to develop a less damaging breathing tube which I suspect currently is just a piece of vinyl or silicone. After my experience I would be more than happy to kick in a few dollars to support the development of a better tube, possibly made of a more natural material grown in a lab. I figured I would ask if anyone is working on this problem. Thanks.')
