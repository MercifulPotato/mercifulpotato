Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607984020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25422230, text='&gt; If you heat with electric (including heat pumps!), keeping the house a consistent temperature makes you use an even amount of heat all day, and so your house can be better supplied by renewable energy. If many people turn the heat up when (or just before) they get home at 5pm - the renewable power available isn&#x27;t enough and the power company will have to turn on fossil fuel plants to make up the difference.<p>It also depends on what kind of renewable.  A lot of people set their thermostat lower at night, which aligns well with solar power, which is only available during the day.  But turning it down during the day and turning it up in the evening doesn&#x27;t align as well (especially in the winter when the sun goes down early).')
