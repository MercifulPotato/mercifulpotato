They didn&#x27;t release a library, they released a full framework and methodology that they had been using them selves already for writing huge web application UIs. Releasing it in tiny chunks would have made zero sense.<p>Heck, it speaks to how well written their docs and tutorials were, and how easy it was to pick up, that it became this popular in the first place. After all: React isn&#x27;t actually a web technology, it&#x27;s a traditional OOP framework that happens to use the browser as its UI layer. Nothing it does respects how the real webstack works, and makes it impossible to debug &quot;as a web page&quot;.<p>Irrespective of how you feel about that part (because I love React as UI framework, but hate how we&#x27;ve told React devs that they&#x27;re web dev, when they&#x27;re very much not), the fact that it&#x27;s stuck around and has become as popular as it now is speaks volumes to how much their release history was just fine.')
