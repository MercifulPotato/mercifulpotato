(Sa-To-Shi).<p>---------<p>Some things are lost in translation. Calling Satoshi &quot;Ash&quot; in the American version, but keeping Pikachu&#x27;s original dub, prevents the American Audience from seeing the level of thought put into this.<p>-------<p>I think you can similarly force rhymes and&#x2F;or common syllables and&#x2F;or intonations between Pokemon. There&#x27;s over 900 of them now, surely there&#x27;s a song to make some rhymes out of. (IE: Pokerap style)')
