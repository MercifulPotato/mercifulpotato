Item(by='_Microft', descendants=None, kids=[25582649], score=None, time=1609339469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581713, text='&quot;Net positive&quot; means here that despite negative effects, the end result is still preferable to other outcomes.<p>(While not quite applicable here,) the easiest example to explain this is when the pregnancy threatens the lives of both mother-to-be and unborn child. An abortion will end the life of the child but the mother gets to live. In the other case both mother and child would die. So an abortion would be &quot;net positive&quot; because only the child dies and not both of them.')
