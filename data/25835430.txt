Have a room that is a dedicated office. When I leave this room, I leave the &quot;office&quot;.<p>2. Establish communication throughout the day. This means having slack conversations (typed and video) that are casual. It&#x27;s okay to vent on these calls.<p>3. Have a defined schedule - Awake at 6am, washed&#x2F;dressed by 6:30am, Red Bull (or if you like food) and at my desk by 7am. I do work long hours, but I enjoy it because I&#x27;m accomplishing something.<p>4. Work on something that excites you or find joy in your work somehow.<p>5. Lastly, realize most of the mental stress can be managed with a little mindfulness, learning to accept that you still can grow and find joy even when at home and cut back on social media; or if you&#x27;re like me, I cut out 99% of social media.<p>I hope everyone remains positive. Do something today, that makes you better tomorrow.')
