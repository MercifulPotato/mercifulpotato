One site may send you to another site that tricks you into stealing your data. And, a relatively recent vulnerability subverted any WebKit-based browser from stating whether the site’s URL was using the correct server, so you’d have no visible way of knowing a site using HTTPS was legitimate.<p>Using a VPN could be better, but it’s sometimes worse, because you change who is trusted more (the VPN provider), as they know one of the addresses you’re coming from and everything you’re doing, and can record and sell that data.')
