In fact, I <i>know</i> they don&#x27;t, because there are &#x27;bots out there that find text strings in proximity to an &quot;@&quot; sign and then try that text as the username against the domain that they&#x27;ve seen. I know that happens, because I&#x27;ve laid honeypots and seen it.<p>So your method is not proof against being harvested by &#x27;bots, and if it hasn&#x27;t yet, it&#x27;s because those &#x27;bots haven&#x27;t scanned your profile.  Yet.<p>This is no doubt then bolstered by having humans doing grunt work -- we know that happens too.<p>With regards real humans having problems, there&#x27;s no reliable way to estimate the rate, but I run an event every year, and every year there are a handful of people who can&#x27;t cope with an address that requires anything more than just clicking on a link.  I&#x27;m guessing around 5 to 10 out of 200 to 300.<p>I use primarily plain email addresses, and then strengthen my filtering to make sure the &#x27;bots don&#x27;t get through.  Mostly.<p>That&#x27;s the failure mode I&#x27;ve chosen.  You could decide that if someone isn&#x27;t &quot;smart enough&quot; to decode your obfuscated address then you don&#x27;t want to hear from them.  That&#x27;s a choice.  The important thing is to know you&#x27;re making it, and to evaluate the consequences.')
