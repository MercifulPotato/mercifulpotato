Basically, it would adjust the t in v=s&#x2F;t because the speed and the distance are to remain constant. And because me and my spaceship or whatever have mass, there will always be a bit of difference between my speed and the speed of light to accommodate this adjustment. That&#x27;s just so weirdly backwards to think about.<p>Now, I wonder about redshift and universe expansion deduced from it. Wavelength is a frequency, right? And frequency, by definition, is how many times something (wave period) happens per unit of time. So maybe the universe isn&#x27;t expanding after all, maybe it&#x27;s just that time runs faster in the parts of the universe where this light comes from, and the photons just keep oscillating with the frequency that was &quot;correct&quot; in whichever reference frame they were emitted? Besides, the idea that universe expands seems silly tbh. There must be a more sensible explanation. Maybe time slows down over time (?!) and it just ran faster when the universe was younger?')
