Even if the police simply leaned right, that would provide a non-racial explanation. Of course, we can&#x27;t have a politicized police force, but that&#x27;s a non-racial explanation. Similarly, BLM spent the entire summer campaigning aggressively against the police (whether or not their campaign was righteous is immaterial for this conversation) while MAGA was consistently &quot;Back The Blue&quot; right up until the Capitol Hill riots. Again, it&#x27;s not acceptable for police to act on such biases, but it&#x27;s a very different problem with a very different solution than a racial motive.<p>&gt; Some people don&#x27;t want peace, just wars.<p>Sadly, I agree. I get the distinct feeling that people want to crush their political opponents these days, and they&#x27;re happy to use any post-facto reasoning to rationalize their anger, hatred, etc. It seems like we as a society no longer value peace, mercy, forgiveness, or grace; there is only vindictiveness masquerading as &quot;justice&quot;.')
