Item(by='brabel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604779914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25009394, text='&gt; perform sexually explicit dances while in revealing dress for the enjoyment of adults<p>If you interpreted what was done in that movie using this description you&#x27;re just projecting your own sick fantasies on it. When the girls finally performed for adults, they disapproved of it... a normal movie watcher would also have been a bit shocked (which was the intention of the movie makers) and would not enjoy their dance sexually unless they have a freaking pervert mind.<p>&gt; because they are being coerced into performing a sexual act<p>You need to understand that dancing with the supervision of parents and honest adults, all the while given support and freedom to refuse to do anything they or their guardians did not approve, is NOT being coerced into a sexual act. There was no coercion. there was no sexual act. They absolutely did not perform sexual acts or anything close to it. Dancing is NOT a sexual act... if you think it is, you need to seek help.<p>&gt; I shouldn&#x27;t have to explain this!<p>When you start thinking that your own beliefs are so obvious you shouldn&#x27;t need to explain them, is when you know you&#x27;re no longer using reason in your arguments.')
