Also cook with things like GNOME Terminal&#x27;s copy-as-html you can copy&#x2F;past a command log with highlighting which is a killer feature. I also have a browser extension which lets my copy a bunch of Tabs as HTML links (&lt;a href={url}&gt;{title}&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) which is great for pasting places that support it.<p>I think the real problem is that there is no universal way to drop back to plain text. Ctrl-Shift-V usually works, but it isn&#x27;t universal.<p>This goes back to my idea that we should have Universal Semantic Shortcuts. For example instead of sending Ctrl-v to the app. My desktop environment should handle that and send a Paste event. And Ctrl-Shift-V should universally send a Paste even with just the plain text content.<p>I think there are a lot of common actions that could be handled like this, and it means that you can remap Paste across all your applications.<p>Maybe we should take inspiration from Apple and map Super-v to the Paste event and slowly transition. Since few if any Linux apps bind to the Super key (is that even possible?) it would be a good place to add these new Semantic Shortcuts.')
