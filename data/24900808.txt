I wound up in database development for my last couple jobs and now have ended up in charge of a lot of systems I built myself that interact with those databases and serve as the backend (and pseudo-frontend?) for all kinds of integrations for a small manufacturing company.<p>I&#x27;m not really well compensated for my work, but am somewhat paralyzed by the fact that I just don&#x27;t know what to look for in a job anymore. I considered looking for a devops role in a company that prioritizes ownership of their systems (i.e. implementation of their own pipelines on their own metal rather than aws or similar), but it seems like the likelihood of finding a company  like that which also values good infrastructure practices is pretty unlikely. I find that when I ask about whether finding such a role is realistic in chat rooms or forums about devops work the responses range from confused to derisive.<p>Did you find the crowd that resonated with your sentiments through contributions to open source? I&#x27;ve been thinking about looking into open source meetups in my area as a way of expanding my understanding of what I want to do.')
