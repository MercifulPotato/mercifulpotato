You are right there are shitty parents, but I think parenthood generally makes for a more mature person, on the statistical whole.<p>Either way, it would be nice if people had to think about the care and feeding of others more often, so they might be less selfish after having seen how important a job it is to take care of another human with care and respect. Maybe even if people could take care of the elderly, it&#x27;s a similar struggle to take care of a very old and enfeebled person.')
