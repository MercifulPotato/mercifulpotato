A feature is reproducible, which Netflix&#x27;s media is not, and they are the only place to get it.<p>I completely disagree. Netflix creates original content, but so do all (most?) of the other competing streaming platforms. And they all compete for licenses to third-party content. Heck, notable third-party content often makes headlines for moving from one streaming service to another when the contracts expire.')
