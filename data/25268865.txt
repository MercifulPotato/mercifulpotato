I&#x27;m Sofia<p>((looking for an internship &#x2F; working student position starting in BERLIN from January 1st))<p>Throughout university I have interned as a UX Researcher in two startups and contributed greatly to the company’s success in design and analytics. Currently, I am more focused on data analysis and modeling. I have enhanced my analytical skills and gained some knowledge of quantitative research techniques and descriptive statistics that will be valuable for analyzing large-sample quantitative surveys and usability testings. I am good at descriptive statistics, data interpretation, and data cleaning.<p>As well as that, I spent this year learning data-driven approaches and I think I could bring a lot of value to the company by transforming raw data into valuable information. I am a very easy-going and self-motivated person who acts confidently and volubly. Besides, I am a self-taught developer who completed a couple of 300-hour courses on FreeCodeCamp.<p>Linkedin:  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;sofiakur" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;sofiakur</a>\nGitHub:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kysofi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kysofi</a><p>Please drop me an email to let me know if you think I’d be a good fit.
