It was clear how hard he was trying to do the right thing, yet the harder he tried, the worse the problem seemed to get, and there was talk about dropping him from the team.<p>Much to his credit, he recognized that he was unable to solve the problem on his own. Drivers tend to have big egos, beating their chests and blaming other people and their equipment. But Grosjean took responsibility, and in interviews you could see how it was breaking his heart to realize how this problem was likely to cost him his career. So he swallowed his pride and started to work with a sports psychologist, who helped him gain better control of his actions. The turn-around in his on-track behavior was quickly evident, and his willingness to take responsibility and look outside for help made him a much better driver.')
