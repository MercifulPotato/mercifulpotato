I can definitively say that it is the only social network that has made me wealthier and better off than otherwise. That&#x27;s worth putting up with a lot.<p>That said, I talk about LI&#x27;s timeline as an example of a terrible product thinking. It definitively devalues the platform. Specifically - it seems that whenever any of my several thousand contacts Like some post, it shows up in my feed - ie Like is equivalent to Share&#x2F;Retweet. This is a huge problem because people don&#x27;t filter themselves as much when Liking vs explicitly sharing. Thus the timeline fills up with &quot;X liked some feel good fluff from an influencer&quot; - stuff that X definitely did not intend to broadcast when they engaged with it.<p>I think this has the inverse effect on engagement. I am keen on maintaining my network and I find it valuable when LinkedIn tells me who has a new job or promotion or even just an anniversary. I would log in periodically just for that. However, that stuff is now drowned out by total nonsense.<p>If I had to guess, their metrics are something like &quot;X things liked&quot; and &quot;Y things seen by an average user&quot; and I guess they are doing well on those, but if the metric was more related &quot;are we giving quality engagement to our best users - ones that recruiters are paying LinkedIn in order to be able to reach&quot; - I think the answer would be no.<p>I am not an expect in consumer web&#x2F;social media so there might be an angle to the game I am not getting (hard to accept that it actually is just that dumb) but I can&#x27;t figure it out.')
