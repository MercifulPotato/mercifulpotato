Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608474817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25484922, text='&gt; Where did you get that quote from (2nd paragraph)?<p>Those are my interpretations, I wasn&#x27;t quoting the author. Indeed, my entire point is that the author is trying to get the reader to conclude something that isn&#x27;t necessarily drawn from only the historical evidence. In <i>this</i> essay anyway.<p>&gt; He simply noted the deficiencies of GRRM<p>Indeed, up until this point we agree.<p>&gt; and the resulting consequences of such.<p>And here&#x27;s where I disagree. By calling them harmful and irresponsible, he&#x27;s assigning intent, because it gives the assumption that Martin had any responsibility other than telling a story in the first place; his overstating of his own authority are stupid, but not coming from his doing something he shouldn&#x27;t. This is not supported by anything in the article, the author just says it is because he thinks it is.<p>In short, from the evidence presented, Martin is just wrong, but the author wants you to think that Martin is irresponsible. That is far less supported.<p>&gt; I would counter to say that all three have had the same conclusion, that GRRM has been inaccurate with the portrayal of horse-bourne nomads<p>True, all have the same conclusion, but this one doesn&#x27;t stop there.<p>&gt; I would suggest you make a counter to his argument<p>... I don&#x27;t disagree with his conclusion. I disagree with his judgement of Martin as a person (that has little to do with his conclusion), and I did present an alternate judgement.<p>&gt; to lambast his conclusion<p>I did no such thing. I recommend you read the guidelines regarding steelmanning and charitable interpretation of the other person&#x27;s comment.')
