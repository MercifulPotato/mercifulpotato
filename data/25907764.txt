There&#x27;s no &quot;coup&quot; because there was no loss of power by anything other than the democratic process.<p>Now of course there have been all sorts of dirty political dealings, those just aren&#x27;t described by the word &quot;coup.&quot;  That said, if some day Bolsonaro or others forms a new junta, then I will agree with you at that later time.
