Television has been with us for about a century now, and although it was not digital until more recently, TV likewise fits the definition of “a medicine or other substance which has a physiological effect when ingested or otherwise introduced into the body.”<p>Misinformation has always been a part of television, whether knowingly or not.  Most people will fall down when shot: not because a bullet actually knocks you over, but because you’ve learned that that’s what happens from watching TV shows and movies.<p>Even without that, the parallels are clear, especially if we take “drug” to mean a recreational or illicit drug.  Terence McKenna (who had lots of wild ideas that must be individually evaluated; you can’t trust him) said decades ago that if there was a pill you could take that encouraged you to sit on your couch for 4+ hours a day and “blot out the real world,” they’d have made it illegal ages ago.<p>I am not dismissing the dramatic rise of misinformation over the past decade or so.  To me, it looks a lot more like the spiking of heroin with fentanyl than the heroin itself.  The addiction was already present; it’s just gotten a lot more dangerous to consume.')
