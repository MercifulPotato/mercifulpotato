New tabs not opened by clicking a link would appear near the others as they were opened during the same time period. I am not sure if anything of that would help but I am curious to know if anyone had explored this already.<p>Other stuff that comes to mind:\n- easy deletion of irrelevant nodes (opening a news site during a pause)\n- visualizing time spent on a website by node size\n- search (it&#x27;d be cool if the whole thing also archived or made snapshots of the visited sites, maybe just using the internet archive)\n- eventually tags or colors for further classification')
