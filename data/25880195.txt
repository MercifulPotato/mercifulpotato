Item(by='viraptor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611383912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25880078, text='&gt; unless you are not greedy and contend playing F2P or limited 5* characters<p>That honestly sounds reasonable to me. I don&#x27;t see that deal as nasty. There&#x27;s so much content, I didn&#x27;t miss the extra characters at all.
