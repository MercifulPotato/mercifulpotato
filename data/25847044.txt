In my project we have multiple physical entities which have numbers, e.g. blades, ports, channels on so on, all of them are counted from 0 because some genius decided to write that into standard. And now there are multiple points in the code where 1-based numbers are converted into 0-based and back, and incredibly - there are bugs there :) . Talking to humans gets equally weird and confusing when you are talking about second port numbered 1, it&#x27;s just never gets natural, even after years working on these devices.')
