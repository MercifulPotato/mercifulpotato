Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25555079], score=None, time=1609109996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551310, text='I&#x27;m not into drones myself so forgive me if I&#x27;m missing something obvious, but I&#x27;m a bit puzzled by all of these comments about safety. What exactly do you see as risky in that video?<p>That drone is what, half a pound? It seems like the biggest risk is it hitting a pedestrian or cyclist (of which I did not see any), and could result in perhaps a single person needing to go the hospital.<p>Meanwhile that video shows a bridge full of a hundred vehicles with one ton+ curb weights, driving at one another, piloted by what are most likely bored inattentive drivers. Due to the vehicle weights, there&#x27;s extreme danger to pedestrians (over a hundred thousand causalities per year in the US, deemed acceptable). Due to the large difference between weight classes of vehicles, there&#x27;s a significant risk to the passengers of those vehicles. And it&#x27;s kept in line mostly by voluntary adherence to visual boundaries and an expectation that drivers will hit the breaks if the vehicles they&#x27;re driving at change course.')
