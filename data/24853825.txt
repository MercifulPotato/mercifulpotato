Item(by='akiselev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603326882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851264, text='YouTube saw the writing on the wall early - Google&#x27;s capital allowed them to scale without paywalling or drowning viewers in advertisements like they are now.<p>The Android acquisition is a redherring - manufacturers started adopting Android en mass because it was royalty free(ish) and they had to compete against Apple&#x27;s new app store mostly with feature phone OSes entirely unfit for the job.<p>Neither Youtube nor Google&#x27;s selfless &quot;donation&quot; to the consumer electronics industry would have been possible without the ad business. IANAL but that looks like textbook predatory pricing (and in Android&#x27;s case, can&#x27;t be defended by pointing at Apple, since they don&#x27;t participate in the smartphone OS market).')
