A song finishes playing and it tells me it can tell me when the next release is coming out for the artist, I set a timer and it asks me if I want to set another, I ask for the weather and it says, &quot;by the way, I can do blalh blah&quot; after giving it.<p>I know there&#x27;s &quot;Brief Mode&quot; and I already have that on which isn&#x27;t helping. This to me is a completely unacceptable VX change that I&#x27;m really disappointed in. It has gotten so annoying in the last few days I&#x27;m considering selling all of my Alexa devices and exiting the ecosystem entirely.<p>If I did go that route, any more reliable&#x2F;configurable suggestions are appreciated too!')
