If you’re a VC you’re simply buying preferred shares. Shouldn’t be owing anything until you sell. And if your residence for that tax year is somewhere else I don’t know of any reason why California could claim capital gains tax simply because you invested in a pre-IPO company and selling post IPO.<p>The reason some people are surprised by tax bills when they move is because they vested their shares or options while in California as part of their compensation and then later moved.  Logically it makes sense in that situation to owe state taxes on income that you earn in the state you earned it.<p>When you later sell you shouldn’t owe taxes in California if you’re out of state for that tax year.')
