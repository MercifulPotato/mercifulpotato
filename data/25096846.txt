Different cooling rate create different properties hence why katanas are made with half of it shielded when quenched. A big part of this (and alloys) is the grain size and the abundance of dislocations in the structure. But I am not entirely sure what the article is suggesting either. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s lowering the cooling rate to create better grain structure or by increasing the water temperature decreases the microfractures in the grain boundaries (like hydrogen embrittlement).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twi-global.com&#x2F;technical-knowledge&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;faq-what-are-the-microstructural-constituents-austenite-martensite-bainite-pearlite-and-ferrite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twi-global.com&#x2F;technical-knowledge&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;faq-what...</a>')
