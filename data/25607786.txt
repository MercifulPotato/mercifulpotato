Maybe I too missed a smoking gun.<p>Its staring you in the face. How can anyone be allowed to pull off half of that shit? I mean if you are _knowingly_ causing someone to take beta blockers, you&#x27;ve got to have a long hard look at yourself.<p>I have made mistakes, fortunately early in my career. I made a colleague cry, I thought it was a &quot;bit of fun&quot; but I was being a horrid shit. I don&#x27;t shout at work anymore. Its a sign that I&#x27;ve lost the argument, failed to see reason, or more often just plain wrong.<p>To allow others to cause people to cry or shout is frankly unforgivable. Especially if they are senior and its aimed at a young&#x27;un. Yes, they might be annoying, or a dipshit. but its up to you to guide them or move them on. Not play with like a cat with a half dead bird.<p>in short: enigneers don&#x27;t let other people be abusive dicks.')
