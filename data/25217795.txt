He does what he is asked, and doesn&#x27;t worry about telling them what they need. They never demand code that doesn&#x27;t crash, they see that as a fact of life, and developers are an overhead. Basically someone else owns the risk, the brokers don&#x27;t, so why should he?<p>People who don&#x27;t like this style (or the code) leave.<p>The direction for quality has to come from the top and be supported by systematic mechanisms. In fact that would be a question to ask in interviews.')
