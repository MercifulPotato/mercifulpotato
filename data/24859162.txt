I think they still are amazing. I think some people have put batteries and an electric drive train in H1&#x27;s. (Arnold owns one I think?) I think you are off about the Hummer fan base. Many just want a good sized, rugged vehicle that can go into the mountains of Colorado without a worry. Yes, the &quot;5mpg lulz&quot; guys are out there, I agree with that. Even when I could afford an H2, I then knew about things like the environment and how owning one looks. So I didn&#x27;t.<p>This EV Hummer looks awesome. I think their timeline to delivering is VERY optimistic and their tech will lag behind Tesla in every single way. I have a deposit on a Tesla Cybertruck and will be keeping that.')
