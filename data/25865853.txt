The problem arises when you try using tools not provided by systemd in conjunction with systemd and systemd actively makes that hard. The accepted solution to that problem in the systemd world is to rewrite more tools the way systemd sees fit with the side effect of extinguishing every other approach and dragging linux further away from its BSD&#x2F;Illumos cousins. This is again a form of feature creep.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I think the tooling available 15 years ago mostly sucked and there was definitely a need for something new. I just don&#x27;t believe cleaning a mess with a giant monolith is the way to go.')
