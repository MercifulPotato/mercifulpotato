In a sane world, we&#x27;d be allocating the total manufacturing capacity (whatever it is) to maximize optimal vaccine production (whether that&#x27;s only the most effective one, or a diversity of vaccines at certain proportions) without regard to intellectual property, but this is not a sane world.<p>One article said the reason of these vaccines can be stored more easily than the other is they use different proprietary formulations of inactive ingredients to carry the mRNA.
