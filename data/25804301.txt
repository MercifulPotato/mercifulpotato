As in, I&#x27;m not running the installer and I&#x27;m not opening Disk Utility, I&#x27;m merely telling the computer to to boot from the USB key. It seems that by the time I&#x27;ve reached the language select screen, the internal hard drive&#x27;s filesystem is toast.<p>I did this several times because I couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing. I can&#x27;t say for sure where the source of the problem lies—maybe something is weird with my installation media—but my theory is that a firmware and&#x2F;or microcode update subtly broke something in Apple&#x27;s old installers, possibly when they added APFS support. I looked into downgrading the firmware, but it seems to be impossible from what I can tell[1].<p>Mind you, outside of this one quirk the OS and installer run fine.<p>---<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.macrumors.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;guide-how-to-get-back-old-efi-after-downgrade-from-yosemite.1803934&#x2F;post-28311855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.macrumors.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;guide-how-to-get-back-o...</a>')
