There&#x27;s enough easily accessible free digital tools for that.<p>General social media use however actually is <i>scientifically</i> associated with quite a lot of negative effects. From increased self-harm in teenage girls (and to a lesser but significant degree boys), to anxiety disorders, bullying, and well we don&#x27;t need a phd to see the negative effects of having genocides arranged on the website.<p>I don&#x27;t really see what&#x27;s anti-intellectual about just looking at the evidence of how these industries manipulate human behaviour, spread misinformation, and cause psychological harm.<p>I think what&#x27;s deeply anti-intellectual is talking down the degree to which these digital services have changed and intruded into our lives because &quot;it&#x27;s just an app on your phone bro&quot; which has been the prevailing attitude, that is only slowly changing.<p>I actually suspect that just like smoking, or drinking, we&#x27;re going to look at how we interacted with online media in the early 21st century with a lot of dismay in the not so far future.')
