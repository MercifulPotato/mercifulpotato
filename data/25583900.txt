Item(by='MeinBlutIstBlau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609350499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583397, text='If you have a family and your significant other is adamant on it, yes. If you treat it exactly as renting and don&#x27;t treat it as a private slush fund to refinance every 5-10 years, yes. If you wish to become a landlord one day, yes. If you intend on staying in the area long term and have a good feeling you will be staying long term, yes.<p>Otherwise, don&#x27;t do it. Cheaper homes are money pits. Newer homes are occasionally farther out from the city and may not have the best service coverage such as internet. Mowing lawn&#x2F;blowing snow&#x2F;raking leaves? What about HOA&#x27;s? Property taxes? Hey your neighbor reported some random one off violation you had no idea existed and now you&#x27;ve got something the city wants corrected and it&#x27;ll cost $5k. In a flood zone? Want to sell? Hey remember you&#x27;re in a &quot;seller pays for buyer &amp; seller realtors fees!<p>The list goes on and on. Homeownership is a monumental chore. It&#x27;s only for people literally do not want to be apartment vagabonds anymore. Homes are for people who would much rather waste their time than their money living. Sure you don&#x27;t get a &quot;return&quot; on renting, but you also have one bill: rent. Obviously I&#x27;m being a bit dramatic about the whole issues with homeownership, but the more people you talk to about owning a home, the more than have that minor minutia thing that eats up your time.<p>At the end of the day, you have to ask: &quot;Do I value my time or my money more?&quot; The former, rent; The latter, buy a house.')
