Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604859803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027295, text='GLA45 AMG, 4 year PCP, £400&#x2F;month. I have actually beaten the depreciation by about £4000 at the end of the contract, sold the car and was left with a massive chunk of money to put towards the next car. Buying the head unit would have effectively wiped all of that money out because its value on sale would have been exactly zero(in fact it would have been negative, as the car would have been now modified which has to be reported to insurers increasing your premium and putting off potential buyers).<p>It was absolutely not worth doing, in any conceivable scenario, not at the price Mercedes wanted for it.<p>But once again, like I said in my first post - this wasn&#x27;t anywhere near the main reason for changing the car, but I would lie if I said I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to finally having access to Android Auto.')
