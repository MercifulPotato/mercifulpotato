You&#x27;re welcome to disagree, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t hold up the distant 3rd place in desktop computing as evidence against my argument.<p>&gt; Oh yeah, especially mobile OSes where every app wants full access to everything or just won&#x27;t install&#x2F;run.<p>Like I said, only <i>mostly</i> correct.<p>&gt; Pop-ups are just as bad because now you just train users to simply ignore them.<p>Agreed, so don&#x27;t do popups.<p>&gt; There is no silver bullet here, and SmartScreen isn&#x27;t some &quot;evil gatekeeper&quot; that just exists to thwart independent software development.
