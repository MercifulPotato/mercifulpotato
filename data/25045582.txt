I notice it the worst with computer card games or strategy games (where text rendering is tricky).  Makes one miss flash... .<p>Godot puts localisation&#x2F;internationalisation really way more in the foreground than Unity (having built-in support for it, while Unity does not, as well as having the development software itself being localised into far more languages than Unity), so it makes sense that this culture would also lead to better text support.<p>(disclaimer: I work with unity a lot - I’ve only done a one or two small projects in Godot, and would still recommend Unity above it generally)')
