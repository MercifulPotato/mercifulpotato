Standards are inherently stifling in so many ways, you risk a lot with heavy-handed forced standardization. Air bags, tire standards, and headlights are small parts of a car with limited standardization, it&#x27;s not comparable to inviting the government to involve themselves in application &amp; hardware platform creation that they have no expertise or stake in developing.<p>Apple&#x27;s behavior is definitely a problem, but government mandated standards are almost certainly not the answer.')
