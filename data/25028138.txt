Trump did explicitly say later in the speech that he wasn&#x27;t referring to the white supremacists as good people, but to others in the crowd that just wanted to protect the Lee statue.<p>I think you&#x27;re right that people were upset with Trump for focusing on that and drawing a moral equivalence between the counter-protestors and even those willing to march <i>with</i> white supremacists. One could even reasonably argue that no &#x27;good&#x27; person would choose to join a march largely inhabited by white supremacists, or even that their support of the General Lee statue was itself a racist act. But those are the points that should have been made, rather than stretching it to say Trump literally called white supremacists good people, which he didn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s plenty you could criticise without resorting to taking him out of context.')
