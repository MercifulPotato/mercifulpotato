Texas<p>Vivid in the memory of the newly independent Americans were those general warrants known as writs of assistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the colonists. The hated writs of assistance had given customs officials blanket authority to search where they pleased for goods imported in violation of the British tax laws. They were denounced by James Otis as &quot;the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book,&quot; because they placed &quot;the liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.&quot; The historic occasion of that denunciation, in 1761 at Boston, has been characterized as &quot;perhaps the most prominent event which inaugurated the resistance of the colonies to the oppressions of the mother country. &#x27;Then and there,&#x27; said John Adams, &#x27;then and there was the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child Independence was born.&#x27;&quot;')
