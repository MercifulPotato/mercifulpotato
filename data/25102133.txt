Like it&#x27;s some horrible disease you&#x27;d never want to catch, like any of us have the option.<p>I really hate that it took this but I&#x27;ve had my feelings&#x2F;depression talked down so much by people who don&#x27;t understand depression, don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a real thing, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve had so many conversations with friends this year that go like this; &quot;I&#x27;ve lost my entire personality, I can&#x27;t motivate myself to get out of bed.. whats wrong with me, is this depression?&quot;<p>Yes, yes it is. Maybe it&#x27;s temporary, maybe it&#x27;s acute or chronic, but that is depression. You never know how long it will last, what it will take from you or how quickly you can overcome it.<p>Be kind to people.<p>edit: Reading this again I can&#x27;t shake that some of you are just so far removed from actually understanding your own feelings and emotions that you can&#x27;t even recognize that you&#x27;re depressed. It&#x27;s absolutely fascinating. &quot;What are depressive symptoms?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll say that one positive of this struggle throughout my life is that I&#x27;ve learned which emotions and feelings I can trust or let guide me. I often don&#x27;t get it right and focus on the negative but I&#x27;m very glad I&#x27;m cognizant and it&#x27;s a bright burning fire of &quot;Yeah I&#x27;m depressed this week oh boy let&#x27;s work on this, I need to make some changes.&quot;')
