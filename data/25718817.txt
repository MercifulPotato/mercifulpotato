That&#x27;s clever, I like it. I&#x27;m not sure if I buy this esoteric explanation though. Right now we&#x27;re back to neoliberalism and neoconservatism, assuming the sky won&#x27;t fall on our heads tomorrow, so I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s any better. People got really emotional and their emotions will be once again used to grab even more power and push further policies that benefits everyone, except the people.<p>&gt; The ability for private companies to deplatform who they want is a feature, it&#x27;s a failsafe against authoritarianism and tyranny - and it&#x27;s not black and white, all or nothing - it&#x27;s a spectrum or gradient, and it can be evolved with good core policies like those that will break apart the duopoly and reduce the power of amalgamated mainstream media<p>If you&#x27;d listen to the right-libertarians, the conclusion they&#x27;ve reached is that if we would take capitalism without the government to it&#x27;s full extent, it would be a very authoritarian system. They correctly predicted this tactics of deplatforming from every angle that we can see today, as a way of getting rid of undesirable people who would try to bring back the government. Ironically enough, they were wrong only in that it targeted them first, not the communists. I guess the second part addresses this, and what can I say to that, I wish I could be that optimistic.<p>&gt; So I don&#x27;t agree with your premise that either side had actual control of what narrative was presented, which is a problem in of itself<p>Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t clear at all in what I meant. By &quot;the left&quot; and &quot;the right&quot; I generally meant that the people in power on the left went after Trump supporters. It&#x27;s showing my own biases there I guess in portraying it as the &quot;elites vs people&quot;, but to my defense, I&#x27;d say it was at least accurately on topic of this thread. And surely there are already more than enough people to go after the right-wingers in power, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine. But I agree with you, Reps and right-leaning media are lying to their base just as much as Dems and left-leaning media are lying to their base, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying.')
