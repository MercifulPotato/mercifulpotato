Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m rank 1,000 in my city, and I play someone rank 250. I expect to loose 99% of those games.<p>I can&#x27;t say the same thing is true for Call of Duty. It may be perception bias, but I think there&#x27;s a LOT more variance between skill and victory. What&#x27;s the breakdown of expected to actual performance? Would it be a 90% win rate, etc?')
