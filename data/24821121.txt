This is part of why this behaviour is so infuriating - it&#x27;s usually the low quality responders who act this way, but there are so many of them that they drown out the high quality ones. Yes I&#x27;m bitter about SO - first they replaced single purpose mailing lists, and then they went low quality, sort of like a big box store first driving out the mom and pop stores and then replace everything with plastic low quality merchandise.')
