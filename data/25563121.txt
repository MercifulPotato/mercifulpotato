If you don&#x27;t understand this reply, I guess you are applying for a junior role? Looking at jobs as if the hot girl you met at a bar doesn&#x27;t call you back, isn&#x27;t exactly a great strategy. And as with girls, being obsessive about employers pretty much has similar consequences. You lower your value, the chances of getting in and your relationship with them will become one-sided, fester and die, unless you change.<p>Employers are there to pay you, because you need money. They need you, because you are doing a great a job and if they don&#x27;t call you back, who gives a f<i></i>*? You&#x27;ve got other options. Actually the more I think about it, the more I like the relationship analogy, even though incentives and goals usually are different, unless you&#x27;ve come to employ a gold digger.<p>And guess what, hot girls have to sift through so many applicants, you really can&#x27;t fault them for not notifying every poor soul who tried, that they are not interested.')
