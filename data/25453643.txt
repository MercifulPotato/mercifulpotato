I’ve ran into it once in a year of using FF containers and even then, that was because of a weird DIY SSO solution I’m running on my home LAN (certainly not something most folk are going to run into).<p>Don’t get me wrong, the issue was highly annoying but it’s definitely not a frequent bug bare.<p>There are existing extensions for managing some popular cloud platforms and that goes a <i>long</i> way in terms of convenience.<p>The bigger annoyance is sites that intentionally cross talk (like “deploy stacks” buttons where 3rd party sites can run Cloudformation scripts against your AWS console). But in those cases it’s an annoyance I’m willing to manage considering they’re blocked by Temporary Containers doing exactly what it’s intended to do.')
