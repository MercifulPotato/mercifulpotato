Item(by='sitharus', descendants=None, kids=[25740136], score=None, time=1610404048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733060, text='I think all products should come with a disposal fee incorporated, based on the reuse&#x2F;recycling&#x2F;compostability ability of the product - with items that are fully biodegradable at home and landfill having no fee at all. This would drive producers to use the most degradable packaging possible so they can drive down the cost of their products. It would also help reduce the problem of producers combining two recyclable plastics in to a single non-recyclable whole.<p>I&#x27;d also like to see a rebate program at recyclers for big-box goods. People are more likely to do the right thing if there&#x27;s an incentive. Probably paid for by a fee on sale, but again scaled based on recyclability (and possibly repairability &#x2F; waste from repairs)')
