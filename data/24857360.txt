For example, movie reviews and blogs.  Assuming you had a way to determine if a page is a review or blog, would it make indexing easier to ignore the rest?  Could a tailored search engine be tweaked to give better results?<p>I kind of think it would be useful, because some websites I use have really great search tools (e.g. ones with tags).  But those are only for the website itself, so there&#x27;s no crawling.')
