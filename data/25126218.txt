When she asks where they may have caught it, they sometimes say at a wedding with 100 people where no one was wearing masks.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine how emotionally taxing it was to be a healthcare worker attending to people with covid in the beginning, but at least then they received a lot of gratitude from their patients. I cannot fathom how these healthcare workers must feel after 8 months of this and then getting yelled at by patients who don&#x27;t think this is real. I almost don&#x27;t even want to imagine how much pain they might be feeling.')
