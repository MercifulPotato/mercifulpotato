Yes, some -- like Rosa Parks -- really are good. But for every Rosa Parks there&#x27;s someone who has decided that a Cabinet member needs to be hounded out of a restaurant because she works for an un-woke President. Or that someone&#x27;s life needs to be destroyed because he or she committed an indiscretion 40 years ago which is now verboten. (Ex post facto laws are unconstitutional, but there&#x27;s nothing stopping &quot;good assholes&quot; from committing ex post facto social justice.)')
