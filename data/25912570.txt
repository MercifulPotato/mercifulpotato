Poland has low trust, but it&#x27;s a lot lower in Russia and if you smile to strangers you may get sullen glances or insults.<p>This has absolutely not been my experience living for the past 1.5 years in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and most recently Russia (but Siberia). Almost everyone I meet is still friendly once speaking, although I think in Russia the willingness to talk to strangers is much less than the other countries.<p>I&#x27;m guessing most of the experiences you&#x27;re actually noticing that trust is lower in cities than in rural areas: the two major &quot;European&quot; Russian cities are both over 5 times larger than Poland&#x27;s largest city.')
