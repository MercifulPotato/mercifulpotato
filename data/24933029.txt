And yet, let&#x27;s dive in to just that: there&#x27;s a lot more I&#x2F;O than an RPi4 here! 8+4+1 PCIe 3.0 slots. Wow. If it can really use the bandwidth these slots expose that&#x27;s very impressive. 4 USB ports but so few folks clarify whether that&#x27;s for real or shared bandwidth under a single usb host or whether they&#x27;re independent. So either an effective +1.25 or +5 extra PCIe3 slots of bandwidth there, again, if this device can saturate those links.<p>I&#x27;m wondering very much how the CPU fares. This is progress either way, but will it match a RPi4? The RPI4 has tiny I&#x2F;O but I feel like it&#x27;s probable the cpu performance is not radically unlike.')
