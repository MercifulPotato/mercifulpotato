I didn&#x27;t live in the &#x27;states until I was a teen, so I know how lucky I am to be here, too.  It&#x27;s also OK to feel grief over loss at the same time.  Like I said, it&#x27;s a relatively new diagnosis for me, so it&#x27;s going to take me a while to process things.  Overall, I am grateful, though, and that is important to emphasize.')
