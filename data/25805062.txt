VX is expensive and mutually exclusive with ReSharper (which I was already paying for), but uses totally different navigation and menus.<p>Then, IIRC, after a brief intro explaining some basic concepts, your first homework assignment is to create a black hole that sucks everything in and then spits it out. Without even really explaining much in the way of &#x27;how&#x27; to do so, or what tools you use to achieve that effect, and neither spending much time teaching how to navigate Unreal docs or otherwise find the information on one&#x27;s own.<p>Not to crap on this particular project, more that seeing the course ad on the right brought back a wave a bad memories.<p>Unreal is a beast to learn, and I get that teaching people to code in it is probably not easy. But this guy&#x27;s course simply did not jive with me.<p>Contrast that with Ben Tristam&#x27;s courses at Gamedev.tv, which are considerably longer, but they do a much better job of explaining what the hell is going on and how to figure out how to do what you need to do to proceed. The 4.22 guide even drops Visual Studio entirely in favor of VS Code (which I don&#x27;t particularly like but will admit that VS trying to Intellisense the unreal engine source slows it down a ton)')
