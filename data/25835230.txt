It&#x27;s not listed under &quot;Shift+H&quot;, it&#x27;s under &quot;H&quot; (capital H = Shift+H). If they had a shortcut &quot;Shift+1&quot;, they would probably rather look up the keyboard mapping to find out what character that is rather than writing &quot;Shift+1&quot;. I still think htop is a great little tool, but sometimes it&#x27;s really too clever for its own good...')
