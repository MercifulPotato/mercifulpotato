It’s bad medicine but when GPs have 20 minutes for a consult and patients are more and more demanding... corners are cut when harm is considered minimal (ie regular low level Benzo dosing).<p>For example, probably 20-30% of elderly patients in hospital are on temazepam on arrival. They’re taking 10mg every night. That should never happen, but it does all the time.')
