I bought Chrysler Pacifica minivan with their &quot;advanced&quot; driver assist package. It&#x27;s just an adaptive cruise control plus warnings when I drift off out of a clearly marked lane. It does not offer a lane keeping ability.<p>That&#x27;s a $50k 2020 model with all premium features added. I haven&#x27;t tried Comma, but from what I can see it can actually drive itself in the most routine situation - staying in a lane on a freeway. My Pacifica can&#x27;t do that, even though it has 8 cameras and a radar.')
