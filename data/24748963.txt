It&#x27;s also cheaper than designing and manufacturing 1 model and physically disabling the pieces after.<p>You could try to regulate that what is manufactured is not gimped on it&#x27;s way to the consumer for ideological reasons but in the end you&#x27;d just end up paying more for a separate physical model because the profit margins on these advanced use cases are simply what drives GPU design.<p>As for the royalty licensing TSMC is ahead in abilities and has captured an enormous portion of the market but it&#x27;s not so far ahead that it can eat however far into customer income streams as it wants. Other manufacturers still exist and get deals, Nvidia is using Samsung 8nm for the latest round of GPUs for example. If it continues to increase its lead then we may see that type of agreement grow though.')
