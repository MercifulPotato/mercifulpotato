I just don&#x27;t see it having any aggregate effect. Basically i don&#x27;t see the local effect translating into global.<p>The herd immunity is 2&#x2F;3. If say 1&#x2F;3 of population has already some pre-existing immunity (from casual reading of Internet it looks that some noticeable share of population  does have it for Covid and it seems larger than 1&#x2F;3) then the total infection rate until herd immunity is reached is 1&#x2F;3. The Spanish flu hit 30% of human population for example.<p>So, for Moscow 1&#x2F;3 is 4M. They already got 0.5M cases and currently is having, despite the tight masks&#x2F;gloves&#x2F;partial lockdown measures,  7K&#x2F;day cases. I don&#x27;t see why would it slow down, and if anything i suppose it will only go up in the coming several months. Thus in the year they will have a total of 2.5M of officially registered cases. If one adds non-detected cases one can see that it is would be in the ballpark of 4M. I.e. herd immunity, end of pandemic, masks or no masks, lockdown or no lockdown. Basically like Spanish flu scenario, and i personally just don&#x27;t see how the numbers can play differently.')
