Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=[24832541], score=None, time=1603150859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24832089, text='&gt;Most computer game companies were probably tiny in the early 1980s. I also wonder what would have happened if Commodore, Radio Shack and other companies had managed to keep up with Apple.<p>You are under the impression that Commodore did not keep up with Apple. As others have said in this thread, the Commodore 64 dominated computer games in the 1980s in the US; Apple was a strong second, until Nintendo on the low end, and PCs on the high end, took over from both after 1988.<p>Compare the Commodore magazine <i>Compute!&#x27;s Gazette</i> for December 1983 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;1983-12-computegazette&#x2F;mode&#x2F;1up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;1983-12-computegazette&#x2F;mode&#x2F;1up</a>) to the <i>80 Micro</i> and <i>Rainbow</i> issues I previously cited. It has ads from<p>* Spinnaker<p>* Atari<p>* Epyx<p>* Orion<p>* First Star<p>* Infocom<p>* Datasoft<p>* Avalon Hill<p>* HesWare<p>* Sierra<p>* subLogic<p>* Access<p>* Adventure International<p>By 1984 several of the above would disappear because of the video game crash, but at this time all were still well-known publishers on multiple platforms. Of the list, the Tandy magazines probably has ads from Infocom (which published its games on every computer known to man) and maybe subLogic and Adventure International. Tandy desperately tried to revive the Color Computer by finally promoting third-party software, which is why the Color Computer 3 (released in 1986) has some releases like <i>King&#x27;s Quest III</i> (but not any others in the series).<p>&gt;Didn&#x27;t many vintage computers (and other electronics) come with schematics so you could troubleshoot&#x2F;repair the machines and&#x2F;or design your own expansions?<p>Some. Of the three 1977 computers, Apple was by far the best, with complete schematics and Wozniak-authored articles in <i>BYTE</i> with technical details. TRS-80 had, as I mentioned, nothing other than the BASIC tutorial accompanying the computer. Commodore was not as good as Apple but much better than Tandy, and would put out even more detailed documentation for later computers; its Commodore 64 technical manual is considered a classic.<p>Other companies also varied. Atari had by far the most sophisticated hardware when its 8-bit computers appeared in 1979. It, like Tandy tried to keep technical information to itself, which no doubt handicapped developers attempting to use that hardware, but in 1981 completely changed course by releasing lots of documentation. TI always kept everything to itself until after discontinuing the 99-4A computer after losing against Commodore in a price war. But no company came anywhere close to what IBM did by releasing everything, even source code to its BIOS. The resulting immediate massive development of hardware and accessories by others was hugely important to the PC architecture becoming the industry standard.')
