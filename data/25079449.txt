I do video editing. I do music production with many VSTs open and running. And of course web browsing with a million tabs opened at once. For any of those tasks I can&#x27;t see what would be the point of having a faster machine. Everything happens at once.<p>Also, having a modular machine lets you replace individual parts when they fail (which they almost never do anyway).<p>What are people doing with their computers that need so much computing power? Is it gaming?')
