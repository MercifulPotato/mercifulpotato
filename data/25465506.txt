They are not the paladins of gaming as their great marketing reinforced when waved the success of The Witcher 3 (btw great narrative, but what a shitty combat system). Missing the holiday season for them would have impacted their short-term revenue and deflated the hype-train. Actually, they did something worst, but I&#x27;m 100% sure that they will recover: they know how to do games. Their brand is clearly damaged and their message &quot;look we are the saviour of gaming&quot; is lost forever.')
