Denmark being above average in terms of stability within the euro zone sets negative rates to shoo people from parking their money there, which would otherwise drive demand and increase the exchange rate for the krone.<p>In Europe as a whole, yes, it is in deep stagnation. There is no where near enough investment opportunity for the wealth within the block, and this is made doubly worse by the governments subsidising all investment, essentially eating half the investment opportunity (while simultaneously creating a beaurocratic nightmare which also needs to be paid for). All the remaining wealth just piles into any old unproductive asset which can out perform the -0.6% bank rate.<p>If you really want a laugh, read up on how banks are competing to acquire physical currency because cash is cheaper to store in a guarded vault than a database entry with the ECB.')
