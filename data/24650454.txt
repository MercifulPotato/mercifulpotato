I am not sure something should be done about it, though. After one week of experience in your first programming language it is no longer a barrier and perhaps the thing that has been introduced to avoid notation now is holding one back because of its verbosity....<p>If I may add a pet peeve of me, I would say that auto formatters and bad style guides are a barrier to entry. Some of the things out there seem to not have bothered to be actually adapted to the human visual system. Also, good formatting is a very difficult job to do automatically so the results are likely to be suboptimal. As a visually inclined person non-optimal formatting really disturbs me.')
