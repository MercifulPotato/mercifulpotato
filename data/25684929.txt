Google <i>is</i> doing this. Several of the pieces are already in place.<p>If you log into a Google account in Chrome, you log into <i>Chrome itself</i> with that Google account. Then Google tools can use your account as an identity signal. This is already available as a feature in Google Ads and Google Analytics. The name of the feature is &quot;Google Signals&quot; - they&#x27;ve posted documentation on how it works and what it does.<p>This identity signal works cross-domain and cross-device. Google is working to kill off other identity signals with those capabilities that would be available to competitors, such as third-party cookies. (This is also why I believe them when they say they&#x27;re actively working against browser fingerprinting.)')
