But if we make people pay the full costs for routine checkups and standard screenings, they won&#x27;t bother getting them.  So it is in the interest of your insurance company to make sure you get those checkups and screenings.<p>By contrast your odds of a catastrophic collision have more to do with drivers and driving collisions than they do with whether you got an oil change recently.  If they were insuring your cost of major repairs and buying a new car, then they would have an incentive to get involved with routine maintenance as well.')
