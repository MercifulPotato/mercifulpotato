Those have semantics that go beyond how enumerations work in most languages and implementing them in the underlying JS is going to introduce some runtime cost.<p>I wonder whether their coding standards still permit <i>const</i> enums, though, as they are also new relative to JS but work more like traditional enumerations in C-family languages. These ought to be entirely compiled away, so it seems like the same arguments around efficiency and portability&#x2F;compatibility wouldnâ€™t apply.')
