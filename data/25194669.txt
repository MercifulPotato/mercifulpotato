The current dogs we have are quite possibly the smartest dogs I&#x27;ve ever been exposed to. But I believe it&#x27;s because they just have such expressive personalities. They&#x27;re a mix between havanese and coton de tulier&#x27;s which amounts to basically aristocratic lap dogs that love to stand on their hind legs.<p>One of them is like a jock, very athletic, very show-offy, loves to cuddle. However he&#x27;s not perfect and has specific quirks to him that only he has! He&#x27;s the one who doesn&#x27;t like being blowed on, he gets really uncomfortable when you pick him up but he&#x27;ll happily jump on your lap.<p>The other dog is the shy type and likes to hide. He&#x27;s kind of schizoid like where he likes company but only when he knows he needs it. Other than that he just wants to be alone. But when you come and say high to him it&#x27;s the absolute highlight of his day. He likes to do things his way and isn&#x27;t afraid to take charge. Often doing risky things like explorer or running in the road. Whereas the other one is really a tepid scaredy cat haha!<p>These dogs have honestly made me question kind of what you touched on. I forgot to mention but these are my parents dogs and I actively do not live with them. But I partially go to visit because I loved these dogs so much when I did live at home. Almost because I essentially raised them when I was unemployed for a while. Now I try to visit once a week and my parents hype them up the days I come over. It just feels like walking in as santa to a bunch of kids on christmas morning. Almost as if they anticipated it and knew I was coming and were patiently waiting. I don&#x27;t know what it is but I constantly question that they aren&#x27;t capable of thinking beyond their daily lives.')
