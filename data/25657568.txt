We&#x27;ve been here before (1950s-1970s); people hoping&#x2F;fearing that general AI was just around the corner.<p>I might be severely outdated on this, but the way I see it AI is just rehashing already existent knowledge&#x2F;information in (very and increasingly) smart ways. There is absolutely no spark of creativity coming from the AI itself. Any &quot;new&quot; information generated by AI is really just refined noise.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not trying to take a leak on the field. Like everyone else I&#x27;m impressed by all the recent breakthroughs, and of course something like GPT is infinitely more advanced than a simple `rand` function. But the ontology remains unchanged; we&#x27;re just doing an extremely opinionated, advanced and clever `rand` function.')
