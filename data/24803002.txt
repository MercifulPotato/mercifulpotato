You can&#x27;t batch using writev() in that case, if you want the benefit of sendfile().<p>- Transmitting a stream of data that is being forwarded or generated.  For example a HTTPS reverse proxy which forwards incoming unencrypted data and formats it into TLS progressively.  It can&#x27;t buffer the whole response as that would add too much delay, so it can send using sendmsg() with MSG_MORE until it reaches the end of the forwarded data.')
