If you wouldn&#x27;t mind, I am very curious about two things:<p>First, what&#x27;s your opinion on alpha lipolic acid and MDMA neurotoxicity? Given its popularity and its rising use it&#x27;d be great to have a simple way to prevent MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, and ALA is pretty widely available and relatively cheap, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to have been much research on its use in humans.<p>And second, how bad are the neurotoxic effects of these drugs? The internet has anecdotes in all directions, from people claiming serious issues from only a few low doses of (cocaine&#x2F;opiates&#x2F;MDMA&#x2F;etc) to people claiming no issues whatsoever from significantly more extensive use at higher doses. I realize that every person is very different, and this is a sort of &quot;how long is a piece of string&quot; question, but what is your personal feeling? More and more college students are experimenting with MDMA and cocaine especially - do you think a few low doses cause serious permanent damage, or do you think the neurotoxicity wouldn&#x27;t be serious enough for concern, or somewhere in the middle?')
