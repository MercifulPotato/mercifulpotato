Of course there are no worries <i>now</i> but you just need to look back and realize that $250k salaries can disappear, sometimes permanently. I remember how awesome it was in 2000, 2001, and then in 2002 and 2003 my friends were suddenly leaving CS to become mortgage brokers. I was blase about my liabilities in 2000, 2001. Not the case in 2002 or 2003. Blase again in 2006 and 2007. Terrified in 2009 (not about student loans but just liabilities in general - COBRA, property taxes, supporting family, etc.)<p>A large number of $250k+ salaries, on Wall St, for example permanently disappeared with the move to open source, shared servicing, etc. Former bosses are &quot;retired&quot; or &quot;consultants&quot; or insurance brokers.<p>Finally, sure, having a spouse who also earns $250k is great, but does everyone have that? Should CS grads only marry other CS grads? What if you wall in love with someone who does HR (which is my case)?<p>Also note, that stretching for a $2M home with two $250k tech salaries is pretty risky<p>0. What happens when you turn 35 or 40 and now face age discrimination?<p>1. Both your salaries are highly industry correlated<p>2. Both your salaries are regionally correlated<p>3. If <i>either</i> of you lose a job, you&#x27;re screwed with a mega-loan.<p>4. What happens when kids come and you cant work (as easily, or at all?)')
