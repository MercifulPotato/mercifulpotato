I looked through the Node.js source on GitHub and was horrified when I didn&#x27;t see any of the text, so I compiled it from scratch and breathed a sigh of relief when my new binary included the text fragments.<p>Turns out Brotli was included as a dependency, and it ships with a list of common fragments that are frequent enough that they justify hardcoding.')
