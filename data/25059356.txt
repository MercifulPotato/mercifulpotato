You&#x27;re making an extra leap in logic that isn&#x27;t true for all people. Just because the protests could lose some votes doesn&#x27;t mean everyone who acknowledge that possibility wanted them to stop.<p>Pick any issue. A person can support the issue and recognize it may have negative consequences. From there I&#x27;m making the distinct that beliefs on the issue can go (at least) two ways:  1) The issue is too important for those consequences to take precedence over fighting for the issue. OR 2) The consequences are too high to continue fighting for the issue and it would be wise to stop.<p>You seem to be saying that someone who supports the protests &amp; believes it will lose votes must automatically jump to #2. That doesn&#x27;t follow. A person can believe the lost votes are not important enough to override the importance of the protests.')
