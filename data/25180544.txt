Nobody cares, except to criticize them as being insufficiently charitable when it happens to be noticed. I think Benioff gets a pass not because he visibly cares, but because he&#x27;s got that local boy made good story.<p>Being a good neighbor in SF (or any other city in the inner Bay) is next to impossible. Anything that happens becomes your fault no matter how unrelated you are, even if it&#x27;s fully self-inflicted. Like the tower, MUNIserable buses, or the housing shortage. Or SF General&#x27;s billing practices, blamed on Zuckerberg after he gave... I don&#x27;t even remember how many millions.<p>I&#x27;ve struggled to care about being kind to, and contributing to, a community that seems to not want me. There is, as far as I can tell, nothing I can do to gain welcome. The best I can hope for is a grudging sufferance, so long as I hate myself enough for being the wrong kind of different.<p>And why <i>should</i> I care about a community that refuses to grant me membership?
