It solves Olber&#x27;s paradox due to the radiation redshift. That model was observationally incorrect, but actually has pretty much been reborn in &quot;eternal inflation&quot; in which the Universe as a whole is in a quasi-exponential state with local regions expanding sub-exponentially like our observable universe.<p>In either classic steady-state or eternal inflation case, energy conservation is not necessarily a problem: you can have vacuum energy that converts steadily into radiation, while being generated by the expansion.')
