China is perfectly happy to declare <i>all kinds of opinions</i> threats to their way of life and disallow them from being spread.  What&#x27;s different?<p>You are not <i>thinking it through</i>.  An imperfect analogy to help make the point: You can&#x27;t put a backdoor in encryption &quot;just for the good guys&quot; because there&#x27;s no way to prevent that backdoor being used by other actors.  Similarly, you can&#x27;t put restrictions on speech &quot;just for the really bad things&quot; because there&#x27;s no way to prevent things being labeled as &quot;really bad things&quot;!')
