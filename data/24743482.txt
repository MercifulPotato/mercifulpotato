Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602385846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743140, text='&gt; Wikipedia is still going with black body radiation as the source of the yellow color of fire.<p>Wow. The flame section is pretty terrible and most claims aren&#x27;t cited (I&#x27;m pretty sure many of them are also wrong, which hopefully makes citations more difficult to come by).<p>GP&#x27;s point about heating metal to an equivalent temperature (and thus color) is correct AFAIK. Interestingly enough Wikipedia actually has an annotated experimental spectrum of a blue flame elsewhere. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Spectrum_of_blue_flame.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Spectrum_of_blue_flame.pn...</a>)<p>&gt; Maybe I should find better sources, although normal wikipedia is great for physics.<p>It&#x27;s indispensable as a time saving overview and index to primary sources. As with any encyclopedia (any non-expert body of text really) you can&#x27;t trust every last detail to be correct.')
