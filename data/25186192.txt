Prioritizing backwards compatibility does not come for free.<p>One result I see from this is that MS keep creating new APIs whole old ones languish in obscurity.<p>On Macs in contrast Cocoa is part of a lineage all the way back to the 1980s. I can still use Objective-C skills I learned even before macOS X was released.<p>The same cannot be said for Windows. Nobody in their right mind writes Win16 or Win32 apps today.<p>So ironically the backwards compatibility MS offers it users come at the expense of backwards compatibility for developer skills.<p>When you ban breaking changes in an API you also stop that API from modernizing and staying relevant.')
