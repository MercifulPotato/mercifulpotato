As somebody who uses Qt in a commercial setting, it is not that simple. The Qt Company <i>will</i> start twisting arms if they catch wind that you&#x27;re not letting them squeeze you, and if your company has an antsy legal department, they&#x27;re not even going to consider fucking around when The Qt Company starts snooping around to see if you&#x27;re compliant; your lawyers will tell you to cough up and deal with the perpetual rent seeking they introduced with their subscription model. I&#x27;ve seen it happen first hand, and it can only be worse now that they <i>force</i> you to have an account with them to download the pre-built binaries they host.<p>I love Qt. For all of its warts, it is wildly powerful and doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near the appreciation it deserves. With that out of the way, don&#x27;t consider it for new commercial projects unless you&#x27;re cool with being bled dry every step of the way by The Qt Company. As wonderful as it is, The Qt Company (either by design or ignorance) keeps expanding its expensive and confusing licensing model, and it doesn&#x27;t look like that is ever going to get any better.')
