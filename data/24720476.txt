In many languages, separate compilation units give you that arm’s length separation you need, without introducing the problem of making breaking changes that you can’t reasonably detect prior to commit, because the code is used in some obscure module you don’t even have checked out.<p>For that reason, monorepos favor the new programmer, which makes it easier to ramp your team size.')
