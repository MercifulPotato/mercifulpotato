Do fizz buzz, ask someone to reverse names in a string with loops - everyone should be able to do that without thinking.<p>That’s actual basic stuff.<p>High level or more complexity? Discuss a relevant problem the company needs to solve and how they’d approach it.<p>Better yet discuss a problem and debug it together. Most programming is debugging anyway.')
