The components are server-grade (Supermicro motherboard, Xeon CPU, and Samsung ECC memory) and ~9 years old, but have only been powered-on for about 1 year. They&#x27;ve been in storage since 2013. I will be adding brand new HDDs, PSU, and case fans.<p>Am I going to have a bad time if I use these components for a box that will most likely be in operation for 5+ years?<p>Thanks!')
