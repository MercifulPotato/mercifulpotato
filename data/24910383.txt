While there is merit to the argument that working on a high abstraction level is limiting and fragile there are two main points nerds ignore. 1) This is a great enabling tool for non tech folks who 99% of the time need a basic CRUD app. A whole new world is opened to them and they and the world is better for it. 2) The people who can get the most out of these tools, sadly, are the people on this thread. Its the folks who understand the low level well who can be super effective at the high level. If you understand CSS you can be a beast on Webflow and 10X your speed of development. But sadly this is unlikely to happen because these people sit on a high horse and look down on these tools and I suspect are a little insecure about how it can impact their value prop. So they never will take the leap and not realize the gains in productivity.')
