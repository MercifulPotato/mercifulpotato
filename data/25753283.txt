What does this look like in terms of the coverage of climate change?<p>I think the climate science, reporting, and advocacy seems pretty good (at least with respect to bias). Maybe we could be a bit more aggressive about policing climate alarmism and other kinds of misinformation (the notion that banning plastic straws is going to have a measurable impact on wildlife such that it&#x27;s worthy of our political will) or the pseudo-religious ideological takes like the arguments that climate change and &quot;white supremacy&quot; are inextricably linked or whatever. But in general, I don&#x27;t see climate professionals behaving as badly as the media en masse or social scientists or other institutions--they seem to be genuinely open to bipartisan solutions and note that this openness doesn&#x27;t require them to deny science (contrary to the dichotomous arguments that some make when people suggest cooperation or neutrality or objectivity).<p>&gt; This already happens. Look at the NYT repealing of the Caliphate stories. How often do we get a retraction as big and public as that from the right?<p>Consistency, consistency, consistency. It&#x27;s not enough to be honest or well-behaved once, it has to be a protracted effort over time. On the basis of this one event, a reasonable person wouldn&#x27;t conclude that NYT is genuinely aspiring toward honesty and neutrality, much less someone who tends toward paranoia.<p>&gt; I will repeat my question from my last comment. Is there an example of this actually working?<p>Sorry, if you asked this question, I missed it. I don&#x27;t know of any examples because I don&#x27;t know of other instances where people were divided epistemologically like this. Case studies would be interesting.<p>&gt; Is there an example of an institution that has lost the right&#x27;s trust that was able to get it back through catering to their viewpoints while also remaining loyal to the truth?<p>I don&#x27;t think that &quot;the right&quot; has ever been this detached from mainstream epistemology in the first place--I don&#x27;t think our institutions have ever been as compromised as they are now, at least not on a left-right axis. But there&#x27;s probably no reason to limit our case studies to corruption of a left-right nature; we could equally look for any institution that lost the trust of a group of people and then gained it back (in part or in full).<p>&gt; I am genuinely asking and not trying to be a jerk by just presenting rhetorical questions.<p>I didn&#x27;t perceive you being a jerk. :)')
