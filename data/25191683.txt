The current development, however, is to move away from the old nix-daemon and to (slowly) finish its replacement that reuses all of the other existing Guix features for process isolation and building.<p>This is desirable as there are minor annoying differences between the build environment spawned by the C++ daemon and the environment one would get using &quot;guix environment --container&quot;.  Unifying this by simply using Guile on both sides of the divide (build side vs host side) would allow for more code reuse within Guix and unlock a few features.<p>It&#x27;s not a high priority because the modified nix-daemon works fine for now, but a CS student is moving forward with the Guile daemon as a university project now.<p>So the dream of sharing the same daemon may not be realistic.  I think that this is not a big deal, because the daemon really should serve the project and as the needs of the two projects diverge so do their respective daemons.')
