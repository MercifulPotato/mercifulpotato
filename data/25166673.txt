He loves using my computer, so I&#x27;m hoping to put on some typing and other simple games for him to use. Goal is to connect it to an older monitor so he can &quot;work like Diddy&quot; and get him into real computers vs. the iPad.<p>He&#x27;s already able to type letters &amp; numbers on the keyboard since he can read them, so it should just amplify his learning.<p>And yes, he gets plenty of regular playtime outside and inside. He spends hours outdoors. It&#x27;s mostly going to just &quot;be there&quot; to use as he pleases, especially with the upcoming cold weather and lockdown.')
