The return value is either going to pertain to the state before the side-effect, the state after the side-effect, or the side-effect itself. The first two could easily be broken out into pure functions. The third, again, mostly comes down to error reporting.<p>I guess things get more complicated when you consider I&#x2F;O. A function that gets a file handle or makes a GET request is technically impure and mutates the state of the macro-system, and yet is primarily concerned with what it returns. I tend to lump these into the &quot;plain functions&quot; bucket, but it&#x27;s a gray area.')
