It sounds like you&#x27;re doing the later, which means indexing your happiness to something you can&#x27;t control. There&#x27;s a lot of randomness in life, the question is &quot;did I make the wisest decision under the circumstances when I made it?&quot;<p>Example: Should you take a bet which has a 99.99% random probability to win $100 and .01% probability to lose $100? The smart decision is to take the bet because probabilistically you will win. Even if you get unlucky and lose, the original decision is sound, and if the opportunity to bet comes up again, you should.<p>Now this example: you and your friend have a choice to pay tuition or buy tuition&#x27;s worth of lottery tickets. You chose tuition and land in a lucrative but not extravagant career. Your friend buys the tickets and ends up winning a life-changing amount of money. You&#x27;d be a fool to regret your decision, back when you made it, odds were overwhelming that whoever bought lottery tickets would end up destitute. The fact that your friend literally won the lottery doesn&#x27;t make him less of an idiot, and chances are if he keeps making decisions this way he&#x27;ll fuck up and be worse off than you sooner or later.<p>That&#x27;s the analogy for your situation. In fact, there&#x27;s still a good chance that all the bitcoin millionaires wouldn&#x27;t be able to cash out and can still crash and burn in a way that makes you much happier with your original decision. Personally, I &quot;sat out&quot; the late 90&#x27;s dot-com boom and everyone told me I was an idiot and missing out... until it imploded on them.')
