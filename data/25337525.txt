I don&#x27;t see any &#x27;product&#x27; limitations towards accepting many payments, that said, they could have some internal financial controls which should have been accommodated by calling ahead and letting them know about the burst.<p>And how would there be a technical limit with Stripe? If payment processing was directed to Stripe.com - surely they can handle the traffic.')
