In that case, there is no choice the worker can make that doesn&#x27;t result in the condition being there, and so there is no choice.  As an example, since binding arbitration clauses were found to be enforceable in court, they have since been added to nearly all contracts.  As a result, there is no choice that does not result in being locked out of the legal system.<p>That said, I do not think that vaccination is an unreasonable requirement.')
