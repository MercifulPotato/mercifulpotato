I downloaded the Android app but, being aware of Facebook apps&#x27; thirst for slurping up all your contacts, I made sure to repeatedly deny contacts permission even though the app was annoyingly insistent that it needed to have it. I only wanted to access this one group chat so I didn&#x27;t see why it needed it. After maybe 20 minutes in the group chat Whatsapp permanently banned my account. Appeals have been denied. I have now been unsuccesfully trying to convince the group of 30+ people to switch to a different platform so I can participate :(')
