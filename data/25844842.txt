The author of trace.moe has to label and store each anime episode somewhere, and use CPU power provided for free to search through these indexes. Adding regular TV series and movies to this dataset could really dirty what gets returned when the service is just about letting someone find out what anime some screenshot is from.</i><p>I simply quæstion the sanity of delimiting the search to animated works from a single country, and as I pointed out since it can&#x27;t find something from <i>Nils</i>, it isn&#x27;t really about that.<p>&gt; <i>The FAQ says they&#x27;ve indexed most of post-2000 anime and very little of 80s and 90s anime. It mentions you can even use a similar drawing of the scene to get a match, due to the method they&#x27;re using!</i><p>It also couldn&#x27;t find anything from <i>The Spirits Within</i> and <i>Advent Children</i>, so it&#x27;s really not about “animation from Japan” but about specific art styles, it seems.')
