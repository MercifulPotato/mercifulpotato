It’s a really great book and it covers lots of topics in systems programming, including assembly using x86_64 for the examples. It taught me a lot about x86_64 even though the primary goal was teaching high-level systems concepts that have stood the test of time.<p>With all the hype around Apple Silicon these days, I’m curious to learn more about arm64. Do you have favorite resources covering arm64? Some ideas for what I’d find interesting:<p>- Blog posts comparing arm64 to other instruction sets<p>- Textbooks or course notes covering arm64; even better with exercises<p>- “Writing a toy compiler targeting arm64, without using LLVM”<p>- Readable compiler codebases with an arm64 backend<p>... or really anything vaguely arm64 related that you thought had good technical depth and was fun to read!<p>[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csapp.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;')
