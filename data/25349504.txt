But that&#x27;s something that can be turned off.<p>Apple more explicitly requests the data via app permissions on your iPhone, so it basically comes down to what Apple apps to which you&#x27;ve given location permission [3].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;answer&#x2F;3467281" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;answer&#x2F;3467281</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;answer&#x2F;3118687" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;accounts&#x2F;answer&#x2F;3118687</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT203033" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT203033</a>')
