Lenses whose thickness is not negligible are sometimes called thick lenses.<p>The thin lens approximation ignores optical effects due to the thickness of lenses and simplifies ray tracing calculations.&quot;<p>Which makes me wonder if there&#x27;s a link between Fourier Transformations and Ray Tracing, and if so, how does it express itself?<p>Although, that&#x27;s probably going seriously off-topic for this HN article! &lt;g&gt;<p>Anyway, thanks again for the link&#x2F;info!')
