You can read about CompuServe and Prodigy&#x27;s different approaches to moderation and liability.  Congress decided that internet services should be given immunity from liability for third-party content, but it&#x27;s clear their intent was not to allow two or three megacorps to act in partisan ways by blocking access to journalism.  They are acting as publishers now and I would not be surprised if Section 230 is amended by congress.')
