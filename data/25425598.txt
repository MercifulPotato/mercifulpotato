Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607993318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425411, text='This is literally a discussion about an article about the CEO of apple exercising his power as a manager of other peoples&#x27; assets to kill a tv show about Gawker who punished him for being homosexual by exposing it when he wanted it kept secret. An action he has just taken. Just now.<p>The &quot;MBS thing&quot; is ongoing. The decapitations continue. Heads are being cut off with swords. Yes it does makes me sick to acknowledge the reality of that.<p>So yes, he continues to apply a principle in the strongest possible fashion to his own benefit while completely ignoring decapitations of others by exercising his power controlling the assets belonging to other people.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;decade between&quot; there&#x27;s no &quot;whataboutism&quot; this is who he is and how he applies principles. I&#x27;m sorry if that upsets you. I don&#x27;t want to believe it either. At some point I feel the need to nod to the reality of how things are rather than how I would like them to be.<p>I don&#x27;t think the media should publicise the consenting actions of adults taken in private unless they are a public figure and those actions show their publicly stated principles are lies or simply hypocritcal. (As an examle, think the politican who says adulterers should go to jail while having 1 or more adulterous affairs - this is enough for publicising the private act to be justified).<p>I also don&#x27;t think homosexuals, performing consentual acts among adults in private should be decapitated for doing so. I think that is wrong and evil and to be opposed always. In most parts of the world this is an entirely uncontraversial view most would deny disagreeing with.<p>I find those two stances to be a consistent application of principle. You might well feel the same way yourself.')
