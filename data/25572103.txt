Personally, I find both Chess and Hearthstone very stressful because of how much thinking ahead is required. It&#x27;s analysis paralysis, amplified and gamified. In an RTS, you&#x27;re generally not working at that level of strategy and have a much smaller state space to search through at the tactical level.')
