At least in my limited experience, functional programmers think so too. Part of what monads let you do is a kind of inversion of control: instead of changing the world directly (as you would if you were seriously threading the world through your domain logic), you return a description of what you&#x27;re doing, and let the runtime (in the case of IO) or the interpreter for the monad (in other cases) actually perform the changes.<p>Similarly, lenses allow you to describe local mutations and lift them to the level of a whole structure.<p>Explicitly threading your state is the first refactoring, not the final destination. If you have a code smell, the first thing to do is draw it out into the open so you can wrangle it. In languages that don&#x27;t conveniently support functional strategies like monads or lenses, it&#x27;s tempting to stop there. But that doesn&#x27;t mean FP is <i>about</i> stopping there.')
