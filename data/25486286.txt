Once I truly started harnessing the power of Vim combined\nwith shell scripts and terminal multiplexers, my patience for\nmany other programs and tasks decreased even further.<p>We have the computing power to run complex physical simulations\nor AI training sequences on a normal home computer, but for some\nreason use programs that take 100 times longer to start than\nold software despite not having more features, and websites that\nsometimes even come with loading screens. Electron isn&#x27;t even as\nbad or slow as many people think, but somehow developers still\nmanage to throttle it so hard that I might as well just use a\nwebsite instead.<p>As someone who is just starting with nodejs and web development\nI find a lot of the tech feels nice but sometimes also\nunnecessarily abstract. Sure, it tends to make a lot of the code\nvery elegant and simple, but every additional framework adds\nanother guide and documentation to look at, another config file\nthat has to be correctly referenced by an already existing one so\nnpm knows what to do, another couple of seconds of build time\nand another source of bugs and build problems. Then of course\nyou need that trendy package for easier imports maintenance -\nwhich IDEs automatically handled in the past, but now we gotta\nuse an editor running in a hidden web browser which started from\nscratch in terms of features but is just as slow in return.')
