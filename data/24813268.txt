You can even install more than one USB Accelerator per host machine if you want. (But if you go far down that line maybe you should get a nVidia Jetson board instead.)<p>I don&#x27;t know why the Coral folks bother with the dev boards; I think their USB accelerators and M.2 cards are better buys. The Pi4 + USB accelerator + SD card costs only slightly more and is more powerful with better community support.<p>I&#x27;m hoping they release a newer, faster version. There are some newer, faster AI accelerators from other vendors (the Gyrfalcon Lightspeeur 2803S, the Hailo-8) but the Coral USB Accelerator is reasonably priced, actually available to hobbyists, (as of recently) has open-source driver for TensorFlow, etc.<p>Note: I work for Google, but I don&#x27;t have any inside knowledge about Coral.')
