That they had absolutely no cover at all? I know you said &quot;<i>potentially</i> no limit&quot;, but you say that, and continue on to posture that they&#x27;re <i>obviously</i> down $21.5B. As far as I understand it, their TAUM is ~13B. So you&#x27;re claiming that they lost the entire fund, and are just... pretending it didn&#x27;t happen?<p>Lets pretend that GME goes to 1500&#x2F;share, and Melvin Capital materially misrepresented (ie, criminally lied, which feels like a big accusation) about exiting their position, and they find themselves down $100B. Again, they only have ~13B TAUM.<p>Where do you expect the other $87B to come from? Or did you switch half-way through and are not just talking about Melvin Capital anymore?')
