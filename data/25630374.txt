But I will try to provide some context badly so someone who does know it can correct me.<p>Javascript is dynamically typed, and so has no type checking until runtime, you don&#x27;t know whether a passed in parameter is a string or not until you try to use it.<p>C# is statically typed, so the compiler knows whether something is a string when passed in at compile time, not making you wait until runtime.<p>Ocaml&#x2F;F# have a stronger type system than c#, so you get the compiler looking for you not only that something is a string, but that it is a named type like fifteenString, which is a string with a length of always 15 characters.<p>F* takes this even further, where the compiler checks for you that you&#x27;ve passed in a fifteenString and that it matches criteria in its value like &quot;starts with hello&quot; or &quot;does not contain bye&quot;.<p>C# saves you from needing to check if a param is even a astring at runtime.<p>F# additionally saves you from needing to check if it is null and 15 characters in length at runtime.<p>F* additionally saves you needing to check its value starts with hello at runtime.<p>Again this is a single language feature probably poorly explained!')
