You could create a library that behaved similar to the Rust version, offering the same compile-time safety checks, in C++. I&#x27;m sure it would also be equally trivial to parallelize the C++ version with Boost or some other library (except that you wouldn&#x27;t get the nice error about the unlocked hash map, so I have to hand it to Rust on that point).<p>I think the author&#x27;s problem is that C++ even allows you to do it the wrong way in the first place, but I&#x27;m sure that you could design an unsafe FS API with Rust as well (though it might be a little harder).')
