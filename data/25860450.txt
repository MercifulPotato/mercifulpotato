The provider can bill for the administration of the vaccine. If a patient has insurance, the admin is billed to the insurance. If not, it&#x27;s billed to a government program called HRSA. At my hospital I have been told that if any insurance company tries to pass on a portion of the administration as copay&#x2F;coinsurance&#x2F;deductible that we need to flag that payment to call the insurance company because they aren&#x27;t allowed to do that.')
