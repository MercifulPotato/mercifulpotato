I figure almost everyone would shift all their focus on doing things that &quot;really matter&quot;.</i><p>Nah. I&#x27;d ensure that my family is going to be well-cared for, that all affairs are in order... and then proceed to blow the remaining time on videogames and whatever strikes my fancy. With an actual dead line of one year, there&#x27;s no point in starting anything that &quot;really matters&quot; to me.<p>Now if I knew for certain I&#x27;ll die in exactly 10 years, I&#x27;d optimize the shit out of my life. I&#x27;d be a god of productivity. Or at least I&#x27;d try. In reality, knowing that my life is likely to actually end in somewhen between 30 to 50 years is already giving me this motivation.<p>Because the problem here isn&#x27;t the focus on productivity, but what you&#x27;re trying to be productive about. Most of us live lives full of things we wouldn&#x27;t want to do if we could afford it. It makes sense to try and optimize them to minimum - to make room for the stuff that &quot;really matters&quot;.')
