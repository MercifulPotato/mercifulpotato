This title is extremely editorialized. I encourage readers to actually assess the evidence in the journal article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;acs.est.9b02226&#x2F;suppl_file&#x2F;es9b02226_si_001.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;acs.est.9b02226&#x2F;suppl...</a><p>1) It&#x27;s important to note that the article title is actually: Flame retardant may cause hyperthyroidism in cats<p>2) Of note, they determined that a p-value of &lt;0.10 was considered statistically significant, and of the studied compounds TDCIPP was the only one with significant odds ratio of exposure being associated with hyperthyroidism in cats (1.36, p value = 0.059).<p>3) Look.
