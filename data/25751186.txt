I noticed that latino grocery stores have some common varieties that are available in my home country, which is in south asia. Those &#x27;little banana&#x27; that you are referring to is one of them, but they taste slightly different from what&#x27;s available in my country (close, but not exactly the same). :)<p>Also, for those who have never tried this before: try to make refreshing juice out of Tamarind (available in latino grocery shops) and maybe a spoon of sugar. Super delicious in the summer.')
