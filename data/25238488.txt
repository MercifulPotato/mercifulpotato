Some of my greatest successes as a taxi driver involved helping people with low self-esteem. Two of my passengers, whom I&#x27;m still in contact with, come to mind...<p>One was quiet, and just provided directions. &quot;Right, right, right, left (into a parking lot)...&quot; Oh, we&#x27;re going to the drive-through liquor store. After she bought her vodka and cigarettes she said to take her back to her apartment.<p>&quot;Do you have any food in your apartment?&quot; Alcoholics are always malnourished. She did not, so I stopped the taxi meter and detoured to McDonald&#x27;s. I called her back a few times, and detected a hint of hope in her voice: &quot;someone cares about me&quot;.  She found my card a few months later, and I learned more about her story. The state had tried to help her with her prescription-exacerbated drinking problem by sending her to minimum-security prison for 2 years (3rd DUI). She&#x27;d tried to stay sober upon release, but life happened and she still didn&#x27;t know how to cope. After her taxi ride, she drunk-called her good friend, who called her youngest son with instructions: &quot;GO SOBER UP YOUR MOTHER.&quot; I eventually told her daughter that her mother needed to feel safe to finish her recovery. She lived with that daughter for a while, then moved to a couch at her son&#x27;s. Now she has a room at her son&#x27;s house, and is doing quite well for herself.<p>I got crucified trying to protect another passenger from do-gooders. She&#x27;s doing well now, no thanks to the professionals who mis-categorized her as a hopeless drug addict. She found that she&#x27;s good at something, and is developing her skills to help herself and others.<p>On a submission about the 1% rule I commented: &quot;We&#x27;re all in our little alcoves of the human experience, trying the best we can to make the most of the situation we find ourselves in. For most of us, no matter how good we are at something, there are probably 100-million other people just as good as you.<p>&quot;The 1% rule reflects this reality: every snowflake is unique, but individual snowflakes are not special.&quot; [0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22623162" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22623162</a><p>Most people are not special snowflakes, but we never know which child will turn out to be someone significant, and who will turn out to be just regular someones.<p>Everyone has the potential to be someone important to someone else. My former-alcoholic passenger (above) calls semi-regularly with updates about her family drama. She is now an asset (&quot;grandma&quot;) to her family, rather than the hopeless drunk I took to the liquor store almost 8 years ago. She recently got her drivers license reinstated, contributes by watching her grandkids and (now) driving people around, and is <i>appreciated by her family.</i><p>I&#x27;m invited to her daughter&#x27;s Christmas party in a few weeks. They&#x27;re rather well-to-do, but I didn&#x27;t know that when I took a few minutes out of my day to pay attention to my nobody-passenger.<p>Very few of us will turn out to be special snowflakes, but everyone has the capacity to become someone significant to the other people in our lives. I think this is the true essence of what this submission calls the &quot;self-esteem craze&quot;.')
