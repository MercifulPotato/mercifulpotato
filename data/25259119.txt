Most of domestic violence happen in private without witness. Even if aggressor is removed temporary, they live together so it is easy to retaliate after. Plus, it is shameful to be victim of domestic abuse. So, reports are few and come in too late and it is hard to prove they are true.<p>Plus, the enforcement is hard. And even harder since domestic violence rates among cops are higher then those of general population.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m saying the expectation going into a marriage should be that one partner is dominant so there are no power struggles much like a hierarchy in a company.<p>Aaaand this is literally what leads to abuse. See, the perfect compliance is not possible nor actually human. The one dominator is bound to do dumb or egoistic decisions here and there. Or decisions that ignore needs of partner due to ignorance. With partner being submissive and not providing feedback, dominating person is bound to become worst and worst.<p>Plus, actual humans have real need for own agency. And when that agency manifests, again, the one who feels entitled to rule it all becomes abusive.')
