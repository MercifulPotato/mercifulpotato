It does not exist for you to selectively manipulate the public commons by removing only negative reviews that happened to use small snippets of the original material. This is why reviews are protected.<p>The DMCA is a bit broken this way; in theory it&#x27;s balanced by the ability for these people to counternotice but in practice that&#x27;s taking on an absurd amount of liability on a consumer to do so, so only a very foolhardy consumer would ever do it and it may as well not exist.')
