A strong dollar makes imports cheaper, hence also lowering inflation.<p>Studies show only 1&#x2F;3 of the stimulus is spent on consumer goods. The rest is saved, invested, or used to pay down debts. Such deleveraging is deflationary.<p>The amount of money is still relatively small and infrequent compared to the vast size of the US economy and total consumer spending and other activity.<p>Even if inflation was to rise, you would not need to hedge, because everything would be shifted higher, such as stock prices, home prices, wages, etc. Because the US dollar is implicitly understood as the global and standard benchmark&#x2F;unit of wealth (the Forbes 400 list is in dollars, not euros), it means Americans do not lose wealth if price levels rise or if the US dollar falls. Bitcoin and precious metals could be an effective hedge if you live in a country that does not have reverse currency status and you need to stave off loss of wealth relative to the US dollar due to the local currency falling against the dollar.')
