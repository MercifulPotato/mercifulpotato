It was tremendously interesting because I was building things that you really didn&#x27;t see out in the wild at the time.  It was also tremendously frustrating dealing with DOM and feature differences.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate the impact of jQuery.  It more than doubled my productivity due to removal of much of the duplicated work AND the general streamlining of DOM manipulation.
