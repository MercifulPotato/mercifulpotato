Everybody already knows this, at least the &quot;everybody&quot; that posts on HN and I&#x27;d wager a good chunk of the rest of the country.<p>Anyone saying &quot;free speech&quot; is not necessarily referring to the first amendment of the constitution. Can we please, <i>please</i> stop parroting this &quot;well ackchually&quot; correction around as if it contributes in any meaningful way to any discussion? It isn&#x27;t an interesting observation anymore, if it ever was, and it certainly won&#x27;t be interesting the next thousand times its made.<p>Implying conflation of the first amendment with the principle it protects is at best a thought-terminating clich√©, at worst intentional bad faith. At least on tech boards. YMMV on Facebook with your relatives.<p>In response to the edit above, which was a stealth edit instead of a reply for some reason:<p>Yes, you have repeated the exact same song and dance I complain about here.
