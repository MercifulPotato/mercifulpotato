I used to be one of these people, so understand the appeal of this argument to those of us that have libertarian inclinations. However, I think it&#x27;s an argument that&#x27;s easily made in theory, but doesn&#x27;t hold up when tested against its actual consequences.<p>Specifically, I have consistently made the point that this argument is appealing due to it&#x27;s simplicity and purity, but doesn&#x27;t grapple with the actual consequences of allowing bad-faith actors to flood platforms with propaganda.<p>Here are links to news stories that show how Facebook has been used by the Myanmar military, and by Sinhalese nationalists in Sri Lanka to incite genocide and anti-muslim violence:\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebo...</a>\n- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;13&#x2F;sri-lanka-facebook-apologises-for-role-in-2018-anti-muslim-riots&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;13&#x2F;sri-lanka-facebook...</a><p>I have updated my prior beliefs in free speech absolutism in the light of such events - some moderation is necessary due to the way social networks lends itself to exponentially amplify propaganda and disinformation in ways that, principled debate and discourse don&#x27;t.<p>I would love to hear what the posters arguing about censorship think we should do about these specific instances.')
