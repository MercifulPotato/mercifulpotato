A confounding factor could e.g. be a more healthy lifestyle in general. Running outdoors will expose people to more sunlight which leads to more vitamin D production - while couch potatoes with an unhealthy lifestyle would get less sunlight and lower vitamin D levels. In this case, supplementing vitamin D might have little to no effect - because all it would do is raising the vitamin D levels while the person still would have bad health because of their lifestyle.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple search for these keywords:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bing.com&#x2F;search?q=covid+19+severity+vitamin+d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bing.com&#x2F;search?q=covid+19+severity+vitamin+d</a>')
