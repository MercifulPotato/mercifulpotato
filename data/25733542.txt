There is basically no censorship and no abuse from &quot;those who can&#x27;t get away with stuff on other networks&quot; in the realm of SMS (or WhatsApp&#x2F;WeChat&#x2F;whatever your country uses).  You can have a very healthy network if the authors are responsible for access control to their content.  That&#x27;s the idea behind my side-project of an easy-to-use, easy-to-selfhost private blog.[1]<p>When people want to use the platform to &quot;become a thought leader&quot; or &quot;expand their network&quot; then you&#x27;re in the realm of public publishing which is where all the problems you cite become issues.  The web makes privacy possible, and I don&#x27;t understand why so few people are interested in that angle.  For me I want to be able to share photos of my daughter with family and friends.  I don&#x27;t care if someone else wants to privately rant about the government to their friends--privacy enables both of these.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mawise&#x2F;simpleblog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mawise&#x2F;simpleblog</a>')
