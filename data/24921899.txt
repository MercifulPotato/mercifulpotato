You realize these aren&#x27;t the same thing, right?<p>&gt; Sure this stuff works fine in Arizona where there is no inclement weather most of the time, and the roads are in perfect condition because freeze&#x2F;thaw cycles don&#x27;t cause excessive wear, but what about the rest of the country and the world?<p>Again, what&#x27;s the problem you&#x27;re pointing to here? Arizona is easy mode, no doubt...and? We already know companies are also testing in areas with fouler weather, after all. Waymo even demonstrated how their sensors handle snowfall two years ago, and presumably they&#x27;ve improved further since then as they&#x27;ve continued development: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2018-05-08-waymo-snow-navigation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2018-05-08-waymo-snow-navigation.ht...</a><p>It&#x27;s absolutely bizarre how many HN commenters assume that the engineering departments in every self-driving car company are chock full of the biggest morons on the planet. &quot;Oh ho ho, did they ever consider that other places have different weather than Arizona? <i>Checkmate, tech companies.</i>&quot;')
