The pitch was that it &quot;decriminalized homelessness&quot;.<p>Austin is still a liberal city, but revocation of the ban is now widely reviled given the tents and trash that have grown everywhere, without doing anything really to help homeless people. There is an initiative on the ballot for an election in May to reinstate the camping ban, and I&#x27;d take a 100-to-1 bet it will pass.')
