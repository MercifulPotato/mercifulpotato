But maybe makes the politics a bit less public&#x2F;transparent?<p>One criticism I have heard from professional mathematicians is that Bourbaki wasted a whole generation of French talent, pulling the best young mathematicians away from their own useful and interesting research to assign to them a project of marginal benefit if any, because being a member of Bourbaki was in itself prestigious. The work tries to be entirely self-contained instead of part of a conversation, which leads to insularity, arbitrary “not-invented-here” reformulation of established concepts, ignoring outside developments, and lack of historical links and attributions. It is essentially all reworking of previously known mathematics, rather than any new discovery.<p>I am not a mathematician, and I don’t really have insight into the opportunity cost of research potential for the people involved, but personally I think the Bourbakist style has been very harmful to mathematics: it is entirely dry and formal, eschewing motivation, examples, or pictures. As a reference for professionals it might be okay, but the same style has infected broad swaths of mathematics teaching, and it serves to chase away many newcomers, almost like a kind of hazing ritual.<p>But Bourbaki is to say the least a controversial group. I don’t think it should uncritically be taken as a model for other researchers.')
