Since Fauna is inspired by Calvin we are not dependent on clocks like Spanner to deliver global consistency and can run on any hardware. Currently, each database is automatically distributed so your lambdas would read from the closest location. We are working on region selection in case you want to avoid the overhead (arguably small latency overhead thanks to the algorithm) of multi-region.<p>Latencies can be found here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.fauna.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;status.fauna.com&#x2F;</a>\nAs a long fan of Fauna (who now works as a dev adv for them after following them for 2 years) for me what was the most attractive is the combination of features without compromises. Scalability&#x2F;distribution without losing consistency, relations and powerful indexing (e.g. best of NoSQL and traditional databases combined). I was also attracted by the temporality aspect personally.')
