One of the API calls return bad data (after the mac wakes from sleep). Side loaded extensions get corrupted on some macOS&#x2F;Safari updates requiring the user to fully reinstall apps.<p>They make reporting bugs impossible because you can&#x27;t just reproduce it by updating your OS again. Native app messaging is done through shared data which forces you to poll for updates.<p>Urggh. I wish they could just own up to the mess (like Microsoft did) and fully move to Web Extensions, including native app messaging.')
