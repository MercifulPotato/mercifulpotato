These use the exhaust to spin a turbine at the back of the engine which in turn spins a compressor at the front (and also a larger &quot;fan&quot; in the case of a turbo fan). So the airplane can be completely stopped at the end of the runway and rev up the engine to full power to start the takeoff.<p>A normal plane only needs its engines to have enough thrust that is a fraction of the craft&#x27;s weight to overcome drag enough to keep it flying at cruise speed. So pointing it down would not lift the plane off the ground. But there have been designs with powerful enough jet engines:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ryan_X-13_Vertijet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ryan_X-13_Vertijet</a><p>An alternative is to rotate just the engine instead of the whole plane, and even more practical is to simply divert the exhaust of a horizontal engine downwards when needed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier</a>')
