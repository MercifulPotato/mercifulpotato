Reddit throttled and seem to have restored the sub. Discord reversed the ban. FB &amp; Google jumped in.<p>Not to mention all the WS action, obviously. Financial press started with an emphatically anti-WSB position but public opinion and regular media went sharply in the other direction. I suspect tomorrow&#x27;s press will be quite different.<p>WSB nutters believe they have withstood an day of coordinated market manipulation efforts. They&#x27;re very pumped for round 2. Meanwhile, it seems like brokers, clearing houses, market makers and the markets are getting ready to reopen trading again.<p>The whole thing has become symbolic, and that might mean even more demand tomorrow.')
