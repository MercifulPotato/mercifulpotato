It&#x27;s likely offset by the fed stimulus spending, for now.<p>Somewhat related anecdote: I looked at a liquor store for sale. In a low-mid income area. After consistently growing sales ~$100k&#x2F;year, 2020 is over a $1M increase over 2019. Of course, seller wants to base multiple off 2020 which is obviously needs an non-recurring item adjustment.')
