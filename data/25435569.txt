Browsers should forbid it, since it&#x27;s a blatant end-run around the limitations a &#x27;web app&#x27; would normally have.<p>Furthermore, browsers even having this ability facilitates inter-protocol exploitation.  It&#x27;s not only local webservers that are put at risk by this, other sorts of local servers can be attacked as well.  See CVE-2016-8606 for an example of a browser being used to attack a guile repl.')
