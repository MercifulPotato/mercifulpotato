Item(by='drivebycomment', descendants=None, kids=[25579776, 25576741], score=None, time=1609286656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25576478, text='&quot;MBAs are running the show&quot; is such a cliche. I see that more as simply a reality which is always constrained by resources.<p>Humanity can not afford to spend all their energy and resources for scientific research. We have many things we need for survival, and some for entertainment, etc. Obviously we do want to invest some amount of resources and human energy into research - but the question is how much is enough and which fields should we invest more or less ?<p>I claim that these questions are fundamentally unknowable &#x2F; unsolvable. So we guess blindly (and very occasionally with a tiny bit of very myopic foresight), and mostly end up unwittingly relying on various historical accidents.<p>This is a very, very difficult question for humanity overall, and we&#x27;re never going to get &quot;right&quot; amount of funding or &quot;right&quot; structure as there&#x27;s no right answer. &quot;MBAs&quot; do and can hinder progress unnecessarily, but not always - they do exist for a reason and they represent society&#x27;s collective attempt to avoid waste or runaway spending.')
