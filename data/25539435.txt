I was there for 35c3. Worst part is that since you don&#x27;t know if you will get a ticket or not and you book hotels&#x2F;flights only after you nab a ticket, you are paying increased prices vs booking far in advance.<p>Which is why you join one of the manymany assemblies and get into the voucher rounds.<p>&gt;I just wish it was cheaper to make it to Leipzig from the US but I understand that they are stretched to the gills in terms of capacity.<p>My only recommendation here is to fly into Berlin and take the hourly train down to Leipzig. It&#x27; somewhat cheaper to fly into and the train ride is a nice ride.<p>&gt;I heard a rumor that they have already maxed out capacity at Leipzig and there is no bigger place in all of Germany?<p>There is place for more people in leipzig, but AFAIK there are internal discussions how large they want it. Hamburg could be used, but not everyone can fit into the CCH. Heard rumors about them considering going for CCH and the large halls nearby. But I&#x27;m not privy to orga details so these are all rumors.')
