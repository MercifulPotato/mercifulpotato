I try to not pay too much attention but it is irking me a little every single day.\nVisual Studio used to be a great product but ever since I started using VS 19 I started having ugly issues every single day. During a day it hits weird bugs such as it simply won’t build, search functionality ocasionally is broken and I get crashes and auto restarts. Looked around for help and others are having the same issues but no solutions. Ms folks close the issues as ‘unable to replicate’. I replaced the machine and did a fresh install but no resolve so I have to live with it unfortunately.')
