Item(by='jmkr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611685083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917622, text='<p><pre><code>    (lamada x:\n      (x+x)\n      &#x2F;x)(n)\n</code></pre>\nWill work, though in Python I usually just create an outside function and pass that in.<p>But yes, not everything in Python is nice for working with fp code.  Using tuples, coming from Clojure, is painful.  Things like returning exceptions for `StopIteration`is annoying.  Mutability of lists outside of a lexical scope without using deepcopy.  Though functools and itertools makes it more bearable.<p>But I also don&#x27;t think types is the answer.  I think something like Racket&#x27;s contracts or Clojure&#x27;s spec is closer to what I&#x27;d prefer.  Gradual typing is nice though.')
