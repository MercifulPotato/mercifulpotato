JS roadmap development would effectively be centralized with Microsoft.<p>Maybe this is not the intent of the TS team specifically but, from a corporate level, if you were the gate keeper for all JS development, that would be an immensely profitable outcome.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even be that hard for Microsoft to do so. Just extend JS development with great new features (innovate quickly) to the point where it no longer makes sense for the average JS developer to build without it.<p>Making it only a matter of time, to achieve ownership of the scripting language.<p>This future is no doubt an interesting one.')
