In the short term, human beings are the way they are, and you won&#x27;t be able to change human nature before the climate is destroyed.<p>People offsetting their consumption is way, way better than people saying &quot;If you just want me to suffer, fuck it. I&#x27;m going to embrace being an asshole and do what I want.&quot;<p>For example, I&#x27;m going to throw some logs on the fireplace over Christmas. I can either find a way to offset my emissions elsewhere, or just say fuck it, those environmentalists are assholes so screw them. It&#x27;s probably better for both of us if I donate, because not having a fire is off the table.')
