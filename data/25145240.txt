You steal almost 1&#x2F;5 of a graduate&#x27;s yearly income.<p>You can put lipstick on that pig all you want, you can call it a duck, but its still a pig with lipstick.<p>To quote snazz further up:<p>&gt;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that Lambda School has sold (or &quot;financed&quot;) many of these ISAs to investors, so Lambda gets paid in advance of the student getting paid (even if it&#x27;s technically a line of credit).<p>&gt;It&#x27;s a nice idea to align the incentives of the school and student, but the current implementation doesn&#x27;t do that if the school sells&#x2F;finances ISAs so that they get paid before the student does.<p>edit- spelling')
