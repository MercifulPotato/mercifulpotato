I&#x27;d speculate that Ryzen 7 5800U should outperform this chip in most relevant use cases (eg. sustained load like running a simulator while developing&#x2F;running build watchers or running VM&#x2F;docker and IDE&#x2F;compiler) while being in 25W range which can be handled reasonably at this device size.<p>Unfortunately laptop manufacturers are so slow at adopting AMD in premium line laptops (I preorder a surface pro with an AMD 5xxx CPU). I don&#x27;t see myself buying an Intel based laptop until they improve the thermals.')
