Item(by='noisenotsignal', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1611955857, title='Ask HN: How could Robinhood have avoided the negative PR from GME?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Based on everything I have read so far, it seems reasonable to conjecture that Robinhood had liquidity issues compounded by a clearinghouse that was rejecting orders, causing them to stop allowing GME buys. How could they have responded instead to stay afloat without alienating investors or running afoul of regulations?<p>I&#x27;ve seen people say Robinhood should&#x27;ve continued to allow purchases from users with cash on hand and not based on margin, but that still wouldn&#x27;t resolve the clearinghouse problem. Was this always going to be a lose-lose scenario requiring fundamental changes in Robinhood&#x27;s operation from the start (e.g. having multiple clearinghouses if that is something that can happen?), or was there a better response Robinhood could have taken in their existing condition?<p>Note that even some other brokers had the same issues, so the negative PR may be magnified by the sheer number of retail investors on Robinhood.')
