Personally I would say around #4 in the meatspace the world, but 2&#x2F;3 I would say they are still being victimized depending on where they lived and whether they routinely left the door unlocked or not.<p>And then in the digital world, there are things like not setting a password or leaving a default one up, but what about patching known vulnerabilities? How long is too long once a patch is made available? What about zero days, and vectors of attack no one thought of... and maybe line employees who just don&#x27;t know better?<p>Just in general, people are very quick to blame the victims in situations like this- I just had an argument about this with someone the other day when I heard the news that a neighbor&#x27;s bike was stolen- from outside their door on the third floor. It was an exterior door&#x2F;stairway, but not visible from the street, and the bike was locked but with a cheap one. They brought bolt cutters and took the bike. People were like &quot;this is on you for using that cheap lock...&quot; but I think he took reasonable precautions, but many had no sympathy for the guy. Personally I can&#x27;t wrap my head around that mindset.')
