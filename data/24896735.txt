Admittedly that&#x27;s a very old crusty laptop, but that&#x27;s without building the libraries, which are compiled separately! Even on much faster modern machines, building the dependencies is at least an hour, maybe more.<p>I wonder if our opinions are so strongly at odds because we&#x27;re simply working in totally different situations to start with. As I hope I&#x27;ve illustrated, compilation time definitely IS an issue for us, but obviously it&#x27;s not for the projects you&#x27;re working on - which must surely be C-based or at least C-like C++ code. I would wager more people are in my situation, but to some extent that&#x27;s irrelevant. The advice to other devs has to be: if you&#x27;re happy to restrict yourself to small C or C-like libraries then single file libraries are fine, but if you want to take advantage of the full C++ ecosystem be aware that there package managers (again, I&#x27;m mainly thinking vcpkg) you can use with only a little initial effort. I think it&#x27;s dangerous for beginners to see articles like the one linked to here in case it makes them think that using C++ has to be like that.<p>&gt; &gt; Again this is specific to header-only libraries, but to avoid code bloat you&#x27;ll need to turn on link-time optimisation<p>&gt; This is nonsense. ... The vast majority of the time you decide what compilation unit to put the definitions into and that&#x27;s it.<p>I said that this paricular objection obly applies to header-only libraries, and that qualification is even in the bit you quoted. I never claimed that there are no single-file libraries that allow separate compilation.<p>But I do dispute that the &quot;vast majority&quot; allow or require separate compilation (either as a separately supplied .c&#x2F;.cpp file, or by #defining something before one of the uses of the header). That is the exact opposite of my experience. As an experiment I looked at all the libraries listed under &quot;argv&quot; in the linked article, and 9 of them were header only with no option for separate compilation (Argh!, Clara, CLI11, cmdline, flags, kgflags, linkom, optionparser, ProgramOptions.hxx) while only 1 (parg) allowed separate compilation.')
