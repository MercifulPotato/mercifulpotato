That&#x27;s a better analogy in this case too; it&#x27;s unlikely that a mishap caused by the absence of encryption or the presence of a back-door will kill you. You might have to live with their consequences for a very long time though.<p>Arguing whether the World has suddenly become more dangerous is counter-productive in that aspect. In the end, we keep becoming wiser, technology evolves, and the World changes because of it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if things actually got more dangerous or if we just got more afraid of them; it&#x27;s the outcome of our actions that we need to focus on.<p>There is something to be said in comparing encryption to what usually amounts to spinning blades connected to some kind of engine; abusing any of those technologies can result in outcomes that are undesirable from society&#x27;s point of view, and potentially from the users&#x27; point of view as well. Because, you know, fingers and toes.<p>The main problem is that just as if you outlawed the sale of lawn-mowers without specific features, there&#x27;s nothing stopping people from using their existing lawn-mowers (or even building their own ones)anyway, the current encryption technologies won&#x27;t go away. There&#x27;s nothing stopping anyone from saving existing tools, or the source-code of existing tools, and keep using then. The only difference would be that such encryption, and the protection it brings with it, would now be restricted to the very criminals that the outlawing of the tools meant to stop in the first place.<p>Arguing whether the World has suddenly become more dangerous is counter-productive in that aspect.

It might get to some of the businesses selling specialized solutions catering to the people law enforcement is after, but in the end it will just result in the baddies simply moving away from those platforms and onto other platforms that are out of reach of EU law-enforcement. That leaves us with everyone else having a big target painted on them because this time we <i>know</i> there&#x27;s a backdoor in their product.')
