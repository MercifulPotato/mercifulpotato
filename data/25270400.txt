That&#x27;s criminal negligence if not arson. Would you please review the site guidelines and stick to the rules in the future?  Note these:<p>&quot;<i>Eschew flamebait. Don&#x27;t introduce flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;<i>Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</i>&quot;<p>&quot;Flesh of murdered babies&quot; is an extreme violation of these rules. The internet is flammable and we ban accounts that blow threads up in this way, so please don&#x27;t do it again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
