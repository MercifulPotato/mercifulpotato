Others have been developed and even gone through trails that never got approved for markets.<p>There are also trials for therapeutics such as inhaled steroids; something doctors in certain regions have been prescribing off-label for months and claim to have very high success rates. Yet organizations like the NIH are saying they shouldn&#x27;t be used until the trials&#x2F;studies are done... and they&#x27;ve been saying that since August.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d rather more effort be put into seeing if existing therapeutics can be used to reduce the effects of moderate&#x2F;severe COIVD.<p>Let&#x27;s face it. The drug companies got millions just to attempt to develop these vaccines, many of those attempts which will be failures. They don&#x27;t care. They already have tax payer money from countries all around the world. This is a push to the first mRNA vaccine out, so the Gavi Health Alliance can start pushing more of them.<p>There is a huge money incentive we&#x27;re ignoring. It&#x27;s not on this particular vaccine; it&#x27;s on all the future vaccines--some which have already been developed and never made it through all their trails&#x2F;approved--and the billions they stand to make from them.')
