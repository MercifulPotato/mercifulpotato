The example and repository has been updated. Many eyes make all bugs shallow. I was hoping to do more testing before posting on Hacker News. Now that the cat&#x27;s out of the bag, I&#x27;d like to explain what&#x27;s being done to make sure bugs like that never happen.<p>Cosmopolitan implements a simplified version of the Address Sanitizer (ASAN) runtime. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;libc&#x2F;log&#x2F;asan.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;libc&#x2F;log&#x2F;as...</a> I&#x27;ve been systematically working towards using it to vet the entire codebase. It&#x27;s helped to address more than a few memory issues so far. However more work needs to be done polishing the ASAN code so it can be bootstrapped for the purposes of having memory safety in the lowest level libraries like LIBC_STR, due to the way that the Makefile requires acyclicity between libraries.<p>This has been less of an issue, because bugs are normally very evident in functions like strcpy(). The BSD version is an exception though, since it was only used to port programs from the OpenBSD codebase which were used sparingly. But in either case, the real focus here is having continual incremental improvements over time, and I&#x27;m very committed to addressing any and all concerns.<p>Cosmopolitan also has extensive unit tests. This is something that C libraries have traditional done somewhat sparingly, if at all, since C library authors conventionally rely on an ecosystem of ported software that very quickly breaks if everything isn&#x27;t perfect. If you build the Cosmopolitan repository, you&#x27;ll notice there&#x27;s 194 independent test executables in the o&#x2F;test folder. That&#x27;s one of the great things about Actually Portable Executable. It makes binaries so tiny that we can have lots of tests, completely isolated from each other!')
