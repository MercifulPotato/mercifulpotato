And whilst it’s not the safest drug ever, the vast majority of people who do it are not dying, or have any real long term negative effects.\nOf course there will always be people who do too much, or become addicted, but that’s the same as alcohol, cigarettes, food, etc. It should then be a public health issue, not a crime issue.<p>I would like to see the statistics on how easily people overdose on alcohol vs cocaine + the magnitude of damage each of them causes on an increasing scale.\nYou can&#x27;t overdose on cigarettes or food, so I always thought that anything you can overdose on can be classified as hard drug, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.<p>Talking about the known dangers is easy, but what about the unknown unknowns? Also, how would it impact society if cocaine became too popular among youth? ( because it is glamorised in movies &amp; music )<p>Being skeptical and asking questions on drugs and their potential negative consequences gets one downvoted nowadays... smh')
