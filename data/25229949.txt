Ditto for some of the other details on the bike, like the medium-dish carbon rims â€” all for the sake of weight savings and aerodynamics (since carbon bikes will usually integrate things like formed handlebars and seat tubes, etc).<p>Suffice it to say, you&#x27;d rarely see a commuter using a carbon bike.<p>This bike, though, feels like a bit of an oxymoron. Expensive carbon frame with none of the aero features you&#x27;d usually see on one, including conventional handlebars.<p>A lightweight carbon frame weighed down by a battery.<p>High-performance rims and tyres but only one chain ring.<p>Low-profile seat stays with mud guards on both wheels.<p>A utilitarian, commuter feature set with a price tag that makes no sense at all.')
