Item(by='banana_giraffe', descendants=None, kids=[25029928], score=None, time=1604873510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028252, text='&gt; Soon after we released iSH without apk, we found users who had figured out a way to get apk back using wget and were posting about this throughout the internet. We suspect this was the reason why our rejection notice mentioned wget specifically<p>As the writer of one of the links in that sentence, I almost feel bad for making the post I did.  Almost.  If I hadn&#x27;t someone else would have, clearly.  I&#x27;m not some super hacker that discovered a hidden backdoor here.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating, to say the least, that Apple won&#x27;t let me do what I want with hardware I own.  Yep, I know it&#x27;s a long standing issue, and I&#x27;m not the first one to have this gripe, but this sort of nonsense is why I&#x27;m moving away from the Apple ecosystem.  Once you piss off your power users, I wonder if the ecosystem will survive for long.<p>Then again, maybe I&#x27;m just having a &quot;get off my lawn&quot; moment, and Apple is on the right path.  I&#x27;m not clairvoyant, I just want to have a nice Mosh client that can run a Python script to find an IP and open a firewall hole.  But nope, that&#x27;s evil scripting, I guess.')
