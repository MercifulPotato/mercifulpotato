(you can leverage these vectors to gain access to privileged data&#x2F;etc. through unprivileged processes).  They&#x27;re <i>differently</i> threatening to you on your own metal, but as long as your systems take user input somewhere, they&#x27;re a threat vector.<p>As to KPIs:  there are significant cultural differences between providers.  That was extremely evident while evaluating them.  The differences in approach, thought, consideration and priorities between even the big 3 was substantial.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to why AWS doesn&#x27;t run a bug bounty, although I could probably guess (lots of their sec teams have background in the intelligence community, etc.).<p>I&#x27;d also like to re-iterate that this is not &#x27;cloud&#x27;, but specific cloud providers.  There were quite a few I looked at that were...unaware that security might be a thing (full push-to-prod creds on every developers laptop, working from cafes around the world, etc.).')
