People develop and change; for example, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s possible for a reckless and careless guy to unintentionally get a girl pregnant, and rise to the occasion and make a commitment and end up raising the child very competently.  It may not even be rare; evolutionary instincts are a powerful thing, and if you&#x27;ve never seen him in that situation before, you may be surprised.<p>However, we work with likelihoods.  Is an irresponsible jerk, or a horndog who doesn&#x27;t want a long-term relationship, <i>likely</i> to end up as good a parent as someone who says &quot;I planned to have kids and made sure I had a decent career first&quot;?  It&#x27;s <i>possible</i>, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely, although I haven&#x27;t seriously looked into it.')
