Voice recognition is getting better, but NLP&#x2F;AI still leaves a lot to be desired, and people are less inclined to use it in public. I firmly believe the next step would be subvocal recognition, so you can issue commands without vocalizing them. Short of intrusive surgery, I think the best way to achieve this is a reader that reads neural signals going to your vocal cords. And the advent of this tech could result in the creation of a new class of device - something you attach to your jawbone, or wear around your neck.')
