It opens the space for others who need to vent. Not everyone on my team does- some just need to hear that others are people too, and some are probably just indifferent.<p>I do have bounds though- I never share inter personal conflicts except with happy endings or as amusing anecdotes (such as my young daughter refusing to wear anything but her princess costume), and while I try to encourage people to share news of life’s tragedies and triumphs, team calls are not group therapy. I’ll happily talk more with people 1-1 about real problems (tragically one of my team members spouse passed recently. We talked about her and their journey multiple times), but other than news of her illness and passing we didn’t talk much about it publicly.')
