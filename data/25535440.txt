That sounds like its harder to write drivers for soundcards for windows.. But the user is not going to be writing their own drivers.<p><i>Any</i> user who needs to perform audio with any computer will <i>need</i> a soundcard in order to have any sort of decent quality, for\n#1 Decent quality inputs and outputs\n#2 The correct input and output types like XLR (or fibre optic or whatever)\n#3 Acceptable latency for live performance.<p>Soundcards are available for mac or windows, the makers provide drivers which deal with the &quot;Audio and MIDI stacks&quot;. From a users perspective theyre both fine. After that, you care about the machines performance, CPU, how much RAM, how fast is the RAM, how fast is the SSD.')
