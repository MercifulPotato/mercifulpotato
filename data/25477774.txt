It&#x27;s 175 miles to the border, where there is medium sized Canadian town on the border. There&#x27;s ~500,000 in the whole region, it&#x27;s just not the same, passenger rail would be extremely expensive to operate in parts of the US that are like this.<p>For reference, it&#x27;s a bit further from Detroit to Toronto than it is from Berlin to Prague.')
