That&#x27;s certainly how I try to live. I have a lot of small subscriptions, and my Patreon bill is over $100&#x2F;month.<p>But I think individual action isn&#x27;t sufficient to get us over the hump. There are just too many things we use on a daily basis, and often those things use things that use things. &quot;Free&quot; is an illusion, but it&#x27;s an illusion with a very low cognitive load. Manually supporting each and every thing I appreciate at the right level is a complex and taxing process. In practice, I&#x27;m sure I miss a lot.<p>In the physical world, we have some solutions for this. I don&#x27;t have to subscribe to each park I use. I don&#x27;t have to kick in for each sidewalk tree I walk by. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of street and alley murals, all community supported in various ways. I think the next step forward for the web involves finding ways for collective action with low individual cognitive load. It wouldn&#x27;t be perfect, but it could be better than what we have now.')
