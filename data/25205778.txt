Later on things were going a little more smoothly, except for one that caught fire but then made it out of the dumpster. I don&#x27;t remember what it said, but it was my favorite.<p>Anyway, this is basically the epitome of 2020 development work for me. I wrote a whole bunch of well-tested code ahead of an event last weekend. At the last moment, a director changed the layout of the event in about the only way I hadn&#x27;t foreseen. All my careful tests passing didn&#x27;t make my code work during the event, which led to a bunch of manual correction the code was meant to avoid. I imagine the Hey team feels a little similar when tests work great and then the humidity ramps up.<p>Both are working now, though, so all&#x27;s well that ends well :)')
