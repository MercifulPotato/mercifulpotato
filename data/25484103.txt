This was the 60 million year period <i>after</i> wood had evolved, but <i>before</i> anything had figured out how to eat it. Trees just piled up and piled up over the millennia sucking out a <i>ton</i> of carbon from the air and leaving an insanely high oxygen ratio, which lead to the evolution of large, high energy creatures with crazy high metabolisms that wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable with modern oxygen ratios.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carboniferous" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carboniferous</a><p>I love the idea of kicking off a second carboniferous period as we finally realize how to fully utilize the power of wood, and start treating it more like programmable diamond, sucking in the carbon from the air around it, and growing into incredibly strong shapes for any purpose.')
