Even the word “boycotting” is an Irish invention IIRC.<p>The laws in the united states that prohibit discrimination this way do so only for “protected classes,” which are pretty much all things separate from a persons ideas and often an accident of their birth, with the exception or religions that accept conversions. This seems like something we would not want to conflate with someone’s ideas. It seems self evident to me that one should be able to judge people based on the ideas they espouse.')
