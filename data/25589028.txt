As someone who manages bare metal, there&#x27;s not that much to it besides using a pxe installer. Didn&#x27;t even use that before we got 20 servers, would just configure IPMI physically the  mount the ubuntu ISO via IPMI and manually install the OS at the office.<p>Ubuntu is actually heavily investing into MAAS (metal as a service) and so is Redhat with cobbler and foreman. So I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s enough demand to justify their development (as every major cloud provider uses in house tools AFAIK)')
