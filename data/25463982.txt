If a light needs to be fixed, at least it helps for the source to be designed to look like it has metal grating around it or something.<p>I remember DOOM 3 blew me away, too. Those zombies you could only see with the flashlight in the first level. Scary! I played it to the end with lights off with my brother and we both got jump-scares regularly!')
