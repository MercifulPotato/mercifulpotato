Someone had written a little library for matlab and gave it away on the mathworks website.<p>Being able to test that library without matlab, confirm it was working, then using Octave to debug the translated code was invaluable.<p>After debugging and confirming both version gave the same result, we were closer to the Google Earth solution, but still off by a bit. That’s when we learned the projection used by GE isn’t very good to compute surfaces, and ours was actually doing a better job. Octave turned day+ job into a one hour session.<p>Massive thanks to the authors, and the author of that matlab library!')
