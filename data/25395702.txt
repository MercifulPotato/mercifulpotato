Doctors will readily admit this. Not sure that the question of whether we&#x27;ve &quot;tried hard&quot; to understand it is a productive one but there&#x27;s a ton of stuff where we have only a vague idea of what is going on, we prescribe drugs that sort of work but we don&#x27;t know how they work, conditions that they can&#x27;t even nail down a diagnosis for, etc. It&#x27;s probably one of the least well understood areas of medicine.')
