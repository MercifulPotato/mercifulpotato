They have to cut parts of their supply chain immediately, whether it has anything to do with Uyghurs or not, to be compliant. So they understandably ask for check time extensions, and so on. This is presented as them pushing for &quot;forced labour&quot; (which they don&#x27;t: they make do with the regular sweatshop labor and &quot;you&#x27;re lucky to have a job, now work 12 hour shifts and sleep in our dorms&quot; exploitation, capitalist style, which they use domestically and abroad).')
