Trump has pretty much said he condemns KKK even after winning the 2016 elections (30+ times and counting). I am sorry to say but your hatred seems to blind you to the facts.<p>&gt; Trump was also a Democrat prior to Obamaâ€™s election<p>And he was a Republican prior to being a Democrat. It doesn&#x27;t matter what party he belonged to. What matters is what views he held with respect to racism, KKK and white supremacy. It is more important to focus on views and policy than on party affiliations. Party affiliations mean nothing. Policy is everything.')
