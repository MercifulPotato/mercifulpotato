Banks and payment processors constantly analyze which categories spawn the most fraud and at a tipping point they ban the category completely. This is why it&#x27;s incredibly hard to fund an online casino account with a credit -- or even a debit -- card without using some shady 3rd party go-between.<p>This bit me with Coinbase 7-8 years ago when I was trying to buy $10k of bitcoin -- they&#x27;d only allow bank transfers, and only $100 at a time until you were &quot;established&quot;.
