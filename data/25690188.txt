If I have a spiritual experience that leads me to believe something is true, I have reason to believe, yet I cannot prove it to others.  Does that make it rational?  I think it could be argued that it is, especially for the person who had the experience.<p>I&#x27;m okay with &quot;myth&quot; being used then.<p>Thank you for the respect you&#x27;ve demonstrated.  I value discussions like this.')
