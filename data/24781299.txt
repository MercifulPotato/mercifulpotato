I have noticed a marked improvement in his mood and reduction in his tendency to fall asleep within 5 minutes of riding in a car since quarantine began and he can get up when he prefers rather than having to leave the house by 7am every morning.<p>Between 5 AP courses and after school activities that kept him there until 9pm a few times a week, he was burning himself out last year. We&#x27;ll be doing remote school until at least February and it&#x27;s been great (for him).')
