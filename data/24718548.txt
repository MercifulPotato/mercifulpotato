Item(by='narag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602160537, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718061, text='I have a lot of examples, so why not show concrete examples? Because then those comments become the discussion and I don&#x27;t want to go into a discussion that I&#x27;ve already said it&#x27;s polarized, shaped as a popularity contest and thus rigged.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s OK downvoting comments because they&#x27;re factually wrong. But this has become downvoting comments because the downvoter has a different <i>opinion</i>. As soon as there is a very popular opinion, you can&#x27;t even state <i>facts</i> that contradict that opinion without being downvoted.<p>I&#x27;m not here to promote some agenda. If I find uneasy to express an opinion, I just shut up, I don&#x27;t lose anything personally.<p>Edit: if you really want, you can pass a comment through the barrier, with a lot of pre-emptive disclaimers and anticipating objections, seven paragraphs of socratic explanations and trying to sound so erudite as to seed a doubt to the knee-jerk downvoter. Too much work for simple stuff.')
