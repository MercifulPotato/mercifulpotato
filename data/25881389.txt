Most of the earth surface can be seen during one day. The earth is not illuminated by sunlight all the time, about half of the lunar month would be completely dark.<p>Moon is in an inclined orbit, which is slightly elliptic. I assume this  is what you meant by &quot;ecliptic&quot; (which refers to the orbital plane of the Earth around the Sun). The orbital inclination has the most significant implications to Earth surface visibility, but the Moon is far enough that almost half of Earth surface is visible at all times.<p>For Earth observation, satellites are better positioned than a lunar surface observatory.<p>The moon isn&#x27;t a great place for an outpost or staging point for exploration. Launches and descents are expensive and spoil all the savings. Maybe if LH2&#x2F;LOX could be manufactured on the moon very cheaply (from water ice), it could make sense to do refueling for exploration vehicles parked on a halo orbit near Lagrange points.<p>But orbital refueling of cryogenic propellants (especially hydrogen) or manufacturing them on the moon aren&#x27;t viable in the near future.<p>There aren&#x27;t a lot of good economic or exploration incentives to go to the moon, unfortunately. It only has scientific and prestige value. The long lunar night (14 earth days) makes it a poor location for a permanent outpost.<p>All of that said, I&#x27;m all for going to the moon with humans on board.')
