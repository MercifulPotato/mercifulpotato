In other IDEs and text editors this is at most a few button clicks to install an extension.<p>The &quot;Scheme&quot; system to manage per-target options is a joke even when being used to it.<p>The debugger variable-view-panel is extremely bare-bones.<p>Xcode used to be slick, but since a few years everything gets bigger, slower and laggier. Starting up, loading projects, starting into the debugger all takes much longer than it should.<p>It&#x27;s unclear how the &quot;new&quot; build system is any better than the &quot;old&quot; one. Apart from being slower than the old one I haven&#x27;t found any differences so far.<p>The one thing where Xcode shines and was ahead of the competition is the easy integration of C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;ObjC validation tools like clang analyzer, ASAN, UBSAN and TSAN.')
