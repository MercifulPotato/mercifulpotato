This is a completely practical problem, and identity instead of value equality is a valid answer. Of course, this doesn&#x27;t contradict the original article: reference equality can still exist in the language, it just helps if it&#x27;s not the default.<p>For example, in Common Lisp you have both `eq` (reference equality) and `equal` (typed value equality) [and even the somewhat stranger `equalp` (structural equality, e.g. (equalp &#x27;(1 2) &#x27;(1 2)) -&gt; true)].')
