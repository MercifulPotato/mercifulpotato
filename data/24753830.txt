Even in Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s original memo proposing the web he stated &quot;<i>Hypertext allows documents to be linked into &quot;live&quot; data so that every time the link is followed, the information is retrieved. If one sacrifices portability, it is possible so make following a link fire up a special application, so that diagnostic programs, for example, could be linked directly into the maintenance guide.</i>&quot;<p>The idea that the web could be about more than static documents was there right from the beginning.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;History&#x2F;1989&#x2F;proposal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;History&#x2F;1989&#x2F;proposal.html</a> - Live Links section')
