Useful for some things I suppose.<p>Wonder what the cost will be for a battery that can haul a 44 tonne truck for 180 miles.<p>My point being: Its easy to announce that EV trucks are on the way next year, its much harder to make them economically feasible and manufacture them in large quantities.')
