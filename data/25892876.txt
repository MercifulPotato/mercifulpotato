It&#x27;s just the lack of compelled profit motive that gets you the ability to do basic research&#x2F;exploration.<p>Society has another mechanism for people to do research without a profit motive - the university - but for various reasons that&#x27;s been working poorly. (One is that they&#x27;ve sort of developed a profit motive, and at the individual level, researchers need to chase grants.)<p>I don&#x27;t think the answer is to tolerate monopolies; I think there are ways society can better support people doing open-ended research without just telling a company &quot;Here, have all the money you want and no accountability.&quot; I don&#x27;t think De Beers, for instance, produced much valuable research for the world with their monopoly.')
