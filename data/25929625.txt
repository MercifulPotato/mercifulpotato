Capping loss with put options — With a put option, you roughly get all the benefit of shorting a stock (minus the premium paid and strike) with a finite amount to lose.<p>&gt; 2. Capping loss with OTM call options — This is my favorite, and one of the more common strategies. When you assemble a short position, you aren’t stupid hopefully — you understand stocks only go up, and infinity is a much farther number from current price than 0 (using a discrete numeraire, of course).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nope-its-lily.medium.com&#x2F;gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-1-d8863f2f8604" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nope-its-lily.medium.com&#x2F;gamestop-power-to-the-marke...</a>')
