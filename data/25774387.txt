High positions in the workforce are often shamed, talked about as &quot;easy money&quot;, as if it&#x27;s inherently corrupt, people don&#x27;t acknowledge their risks and responsibilities. Whether that warrants those high salaries or not, I&#x27;m not commenting on that debate. Public functions or private organizations in which the government invests, must cap salaries at what the prime minister makes, which is &quot;only&quot; around 200k euros, a fraction of what american CEOs make. This includes public television talent; imagine your US network television nightly news anchors being capped at 200k. (I understand those are private, just making the comparison because they&#x27;re the highest watched shows in either nation. Private television in the Netherlands is not subject to the cap, but also has not the highest ratings.)<p>Now that I live in the USA, I&#x27;ve never heard anyone talk like that about a successful CEO. Envy yes, aspiration too, admiration yes.')
