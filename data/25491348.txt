Just install both and switch between them for a while until you decide which one is for you... most applications won&#x27;t care which they&#x27;re running under.<p>FYI, a lot of the dislike for the current Gnome comes from remembering what it used to be in the Gnome 2 days.  You have no such history so maybe it&#x27;ll be fine for you.')
