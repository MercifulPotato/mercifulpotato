In reality, there are lots of external forces that you can&#x27;t escape because they are much stronger than you. Even if you picked an isolated island, the USA is still interested in you and maybe also China. Why do you think most of the world countries did accept FATCA?<p>Now if you get the USA on your side, you might be able to establish a trading hub somewhere. You&#x27;ll be getting the protection and also maybe trade deals if you are good enough in foreign diplomacy. This makes you no different than these small islands like Barbados.<p>The only business, at this point, with no people you can do is either trade, tourism or help tax evasion. You have no infrastructure, no people and building an industry for export is hard with the established players. No one who is established in London (say as a professional surgeon) will move to this deserted island.<p>Trade will depend on your geographical location. But as you have already guessed, these locations will be highly disputed and sought after by big powers. So you probably won&#x27;t. Tourism will depend on how nice the place look, but it doesn&#x27;t create a real economy. Helping foreign companies evade taxes will bring trouble with said countries, so you are going to play international diplomacy while trying to stay behind the US for protection.<p>tl;dr: Nah.')
