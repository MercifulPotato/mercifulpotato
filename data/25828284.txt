There seems to be a lack of willingness to acknowledge an attempted coup as a coup, or a failed insurrection as an insurrection. And I get why. It&#x27;s terrifying to acknowledge that. It&#x27;s uncomfortable to realize how close we came to <i>really bad things</i> (and admittedly, hard to quantify how close we came. Trying to figure out what would have happened if Pence rejected the results, or if he was killed on the 6th is difficult. Many things could have happened).<p>&gt; it doesn&#x27;t take Russians or Chinese<p>Erm, Russians are 100% implicated in stoking civil unrest and conspiracies that built towards the events of the 6th. The Chinese may be, but I don&#x27;t know. The problem is that people refuse to acknowledge that and take the threat seriously, which is how we got here.')
