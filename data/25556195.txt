It was OK for the first week or two but then I noticed my head hurt. My ears felt full and I had ringing in my ears that was quite loud. I have mild (self-diagnosed) tinnitus but this was beyond that by a significant amount.<p>I&#x27;m aware of how noise cancelling technology works it&#x27;s by creating an opposing sound wave of equivalent energy to nullify the unwanted sound wave.<p>My theory is when I am off a call and I have the headset on my head with ANC enabled it&#x27;s working to cancel the background noise. It&#x27;s only needed on a call but it&#x27;s obviously on all the time. These are not cheap headphones I&#x27;ve seen them for $300 so not cheap but I&#x27;m sure not the highest end.<p>I&#x27;ve tried taking them off, put around my neck, on my head between calls. But a few times I&#x27;ve fumbled them and hung up on someone or picked up before I was ready. My solution was to turn off ANC which made the sound clearer and my ears don&#x27;t ring as bad as with ANC on.<p>My own anecdotal evidence but there is an obvious effect on my ears. I was about to go to the doctor the ringing was getting so bad.')
