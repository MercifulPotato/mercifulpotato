Ask an edge router. If you have a request open, even though it&#x27;s not doing CPU, that request has to be in a queue somewhere, tracked for a response that can be transmitted back.<p>I don&#x27;t know the infra costs of operating lambda, but my guess is that it&#x27;s far from CPU-dominated.<p>I would not be surprised if the Cloudflare pricing model is making a tradeoff to make CPU-bound workloads pay for more of the infra than the rest. It&#x27;s a valid trade-off to make as a business offering, and it might be feasible given the mixture of workloads. Whether it&#x27;s the <i>right</i> way is debatable. Whether this model can be tanked by an army of actors taking advantage of CPU-insensitive pricing remains to be seen, or is an acceptable risk that you can take (which you can observe and protect against).')
