That&#x27;s what the tippy-top schools pay the top 1% of students. The few schools that go higher -- AFAIK in CS only NYC+Boston+CA -- are in markets where a single bedroom in a shared house runs $1K+&#x2F;mo. And in that sort of rental market the federal poverty guideline is rote bullshit.<p>$16K is perfectly normal for the vast majority of folks who aren&#x27;t at top 5 programs in the most in-demand field.<p><i>&gt; But who is getting 30k anyways? If that is the stipend of one grad student, you need to double it to get the household of two grad students</i><p>Yeah but then you subtract child care and someone might as well stay home because it&#x27;s literally costing them money to work.')
