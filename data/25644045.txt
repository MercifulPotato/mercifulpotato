You could then record the show (which consisted mostly of &quot;whiirrrzzzzzzbrbrrzzziii&quot;), and load the programs on your computer of choice.<p>Those were the days where you&#x27;d spend hours browsing your local magazine shop for new and exiting computer magazines, and debugging included reading manuals, and not just pasting code from StackOverflow :)<p>I often think back to the world when i was a kid, and while the Internet has certainly made a lot of things easier, i&#x27;m not always convinced that it&#x27;s actually helping. When answers to every question you have are readily available, what happens to curiosity ? At age 11 i could hook up just about any home computer, program in BASIC, could take apart electronics and fix them (which was a lot easier back then).<p>I learned by taking things apart (and rarely breaking them in the process), and for those more specialized things (electronics) there were evening classes for kids. We had a &quot;programming class&quot; when i was a kid that was basically just a lab. Show up at 18:30 and &quot;here&#x27;s a RC 700 Piccolo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.old-computers.com&#x2F;museum&#x2F;computer.asp?c=650" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.old-computers.com&#x2F;museum&#x2F;computer.asp?c=650</a>) to use for whatever you like&quot;. There was no set program, and the instructor was the other kids in class. Those were the best classes i&#x27;ve ever taken.')
