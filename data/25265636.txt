What matters perhaps the most is that qualified and capable students continue to emerge from, and sustain, America&#x27;s scientific institutions.<p>Arecibo has been fighting for its fiscal life since I was an undergraduate in the early 2000s. I couldn&#x27;t understand then why anyone would want to cut funding to it, as the facility is unique and capable. As a more-mature scientist, I now understand that older instruments sometimes must sadly make way for new endeavors.<p>This collapse is a powerful moment for US radio astronomy. Will the community redirect the funds to promising new instruments, buck up and rebuild an upgraded Arecibo, or use the fleeting prominence of the moment find a way to grow the funding pie and do both?<p>It is embarrassing for the planet&#x27;s leading scientific nation to have China&#x27;s larger modern copy of Arecibo (FAST) come on-line in 2016 and our venerable telescope collapse without replacement in 2020. We owe it to ourselves to do better than this.')
