Full stop.<p>Correct in the jargonic sense. Incorrect in the colloquial. MCAS was necessary because the MAX was not compliant with Stick force response curves in high AoA flight regimes, and would experience a reversal in the pressures required to bring the plane up to a stall.<p>So yes, it was not aerodynamically unstable, but in the layman sense there is an instability or undesired quirk being compensated for.<p>I know we&#x27;re all pedants here, but lets be productively pedantic.')
