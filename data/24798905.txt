Each interviewer has his own style and I think it is fine.<p>I think giving the candidate a hint has a purpose and that is to keep the process of finding a solution progressing. Otherwise the candidate may get stuck and as an interviewer this is bad because we are now wasting time to let me know the candidate.<p>At the very beginning I tell the candidate some of the things that I feel are fine or not fine. For example, I will tell the candidate that I am happy to give out names of functions and lists of parameters as long as the candidate can describe exactly what the function is doing. So I give these for free because in normal work I would expect he&#x2F;she can find it in couple of seconds on the internet, anyway, and that&#x27;s also how I do this. What I don&#x27;t give for free (ie. mentally deduct points for) is give larger hints that would normally be thought as part of the solution.<p>Likewise, when I start technical question section I tell candidates that &quot;I give 5 points for not answering the question&quot;. Most people are quick enough to figure out this means I penalize bad answers and would prefer the candidate to say they don&#x27;t know something rather than keep talking nonsense.')
