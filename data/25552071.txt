Item(by='noxer', descendants=None, kids=[25552435], score=None, time=1609086483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551809, text='&gt;&quot;commercial banks invest my money on my behalf without me having any control over the process&quot;<p>This is completely wrong. Your money on your bank account doesn&#x27;t exist. What you see is the number of dollars the bank owes you. Its a debt. They dont invest your money anywhere. It doesn&#x27;t exist. When someone transfers &quot;money&quot; to you the bank subtractions debt from their account and adds it to yours. Its still the same debt they just owe it to someone else now. If they give you credit for example because you want to build a house. They create the credit out of thin air by putting the house on the balance sheet so they can give out credit worth as much as the house. You pay it back and the house is yours you dont pay and the house goes to the bank. Your own money is used first so the house is allays worth more than what the bank credited at any point in time. Nowhere does the bank need someone else&#x27;s money to give you that credit.')
