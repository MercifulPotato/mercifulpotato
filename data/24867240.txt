Ramanujan in particular is known for his fastidious notebooks calculating thousands of digits numbers like pi. From writing out the calculations for hours and days, he&#x27;d come up with simplification formulas and develop new insights. These days, we have a tendency to just look at the formula and go &quot;wow, how the heck did the think of that?&quot; Well, what we would call &quot;busy work&quot;.<p>Do the busy work. Do the calculations. Write it all out. Nobody is better than the busy work: it pays off and it&#x27;s how you learn.')
