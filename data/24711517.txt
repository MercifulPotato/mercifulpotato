Typical bolus duration, Blood Glucose mg&#x2F;dl lowered per unit of insulin etc) when you first start using it, it can be just as effective as the name brand anologues.<p>Sure, it has a longer duration and takes a bit longer before it takes effect, but those shortcomings can be addressed by simply making adjustments to when you are dosing.<p>I typically need to bolus about 1unit&#x2F;12g of carbs 20-25 minutes prior to eating with Novalin vs 1unit&#x2F;15g 10-15 minutes before using an analogue.<p>I&#x27;ve actually used Novalin R in lieu of analogues in my insulin pump now for about a year with no issues. I realize getting these devices may be financially out of reach for many since they are expensive, even with insurance. If you&#x27;re interested in using one but are not able to afford the cost of initial cost, Medtronic used to offer a payment plan that did not require good credit at all (mine was a complete dumpster fire) back when I got mine 6 years ago so people who are interested and could possibly afford to make monthly payments it&#x27;s worth taking to your doctor and the manufacturers reps about the options they have available.<p>Sorry in advance for any grammatical&#x2F;spelling errors, on mobile topping in a text box ~6 lines tall and 32 characters wide.')
