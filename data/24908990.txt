My point was about strategy.<p>And who will win general driving is yet open, and just assuming it Waymo is foolish. I think is funny how on HN people dismiss Tesla when there are actually tons of people who already do their commute on the highway almost without intervention literally all over the world.<p>They have trucks that will have this same feature and they have already talked about the idea of platooning.<p>Just downvoting me because you don&#x27;t think Tesla approach is as good as Waymo&#x2F;Daimler approach doesn&#x27;t make what I said wrong.')
