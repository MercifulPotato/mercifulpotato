And comparing it to a centralized database is useless anyway. You would need to compare it to global net of nodes which all sync with one master database. Due to the time it need to sync you simply cant ever reach performance of a single DB.<p>The second thing that is misleading is the idea that a read-only DB would be possible without either trust or decentralization.<p>Just because your software doesn&#x27;t implement a delete or update method doesn&#x27;t mean its read-only at all. And even if there is crypto verification in place like a chain of hashes that would break if something is changed in the past. I all means nothing if you dont wanna trust the source of the data and verification.<p>The key part of &quot;blockchain&quot; (pls call it distributed ledger (DL), it doesn&#x27;t need chains of blocks) is the public state of the system. It allows to verify the data without trusting the parties that gave you the data.<p>The conclusion of the article is correct. If you dont need the trustlessness and decentralization you almost certainly dont need a DL.')
