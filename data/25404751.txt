As an engineer I often considered 10% tolerance to be sufficient.  I think enforcing speed limits to anything greater than 10% is just silly.  I often drift +&#x2F;- more than 10% of my intended speed.  It&#x27;s just human nature.  I pay more attention to potential dangers and obstacles, and less on whether I am within a % of the speed limit, and I really hope other drivers do as well.')
