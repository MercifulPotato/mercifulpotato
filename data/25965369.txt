Because everything I&#x27;ve read is that each got a 100 million dose initial order, so that&#x27;s 100 million people total to begin with.  Moderna was already part of Operation Warp Speed, the contract signed 11 August 2020 according to Wikipedia.

Both have since signed additional 100 million dose contracts, and Moderna an option for an additional 150 million.<p>Operation Warp Speed worked with Moderna, spent a lot of money on both them and various parts of the supply chain to do the best to manufacture this new type vaccine as fast as possible, and I&#x27;ve not heard anything about their failing in their promises.  Whereas Pfizer initially went it alone, and starting in December has been failing to keep their promises everywhere, now even shutting down their plant in Belgium to increase capacity.')
