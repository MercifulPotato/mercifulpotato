It&#x27;s available on both desktop and mobile.<p>We noticed it&#x27;s still surprisingly hard to answer simple questions about our finances. There are other personal finance apps and sophisticated paid budgeting tools, but we wanted to build an easy (and free) way to search transactions that doesn&#x27;t involve creating and maintaining a budget.<p>We&#x27;re excited to share Fion with the HN community.')
