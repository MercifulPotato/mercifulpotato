What actually happens in physical reality does not always match the guidelines laid out on paper.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s relatively difficult to pull off hoodwink when you&#x27;ve got adversarial observers standing there.<p>I read assurances about what happens in physical reality on a regular basis.  Often, these assurances are not actually correct (in no small part because the person providing the assurances <i>was not actually physically present</i>).<p>I am not asserting that something improper has occurred here, but when journalists are asserting <i>unequivocally and in unison</i> that nothing improper has happened, because the US election system is non-exploitable (while providing zero evidence of this), after having just finished telling me <i>in unison</i> for the last 4 years that Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the 2016 election, I hope you can pardon me if I&#x27;m not too keen on taking evidence-free assurances on pure faith.<p>There was a lot going on across a huge number of voting stations that evening, the notion that <i>not one single thing went wrong</i> is a bit of an extraordinary claim, especially coming from a group of people who don&#x27;t exactly have a pristine track record of bias or accuracy.<p>I doubt we&#x27;ll ever find the truth, or even exert any significant effort in discovering it - that&#x27;s just the way it is and I can accept that.  But it&#x27;s frustrating that the public is so accepting of this state of affairs.')
