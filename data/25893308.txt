My argument is that maybe we should listen with a high degree of skepticism when such people talk. It doesn&#x27;t completely invalidate any report (although in this example, there&#x27;s no data to back assertions) , but as with most things from academics go, they are usually not testable, so.<p>(What people say and people do are different things)')
