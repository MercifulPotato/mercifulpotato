This is the opposite of what Google wants.<p>Therefore the only logical conclusion is that Google will not allow any webview-based browsers.<p>In <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25156594" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25156594</a> kbenson clarified that they think Google should not allow any webview-based browsers regardless of whether this hypothetical petition process exists or not. I responded by pointing out how this distinction does not help in any way, because even a new browser written from scratch that gets allowed by Google can then turn around and implement a webview library based on itself anyway.<p>My point is that this entire thing that Google is apparently trying is nonsensical. Maybe it works for phones, where &quot;malware&quot; (ie alternative browsers) can&#x27;t easily change whatever Google is looking for in the HTTP requests (user-agent header, etc) to identify webview-based browsers vs the few they chose to allow. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense for regular PCs. Anything an allowed browser can do, &quot;malware&quot; can mimic.<p>Actually, there is one way that it&#x27;ll work on PCs too - if every google.com website starts using DRM. I almost look forward to that just because of the carnage that will occur in response.')
