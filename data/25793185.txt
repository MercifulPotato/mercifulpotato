All my friends( couple of year out of college) in the bay area have become multi millionaires over last year from stock growth.<p>Bunch of them bought second houses in LCOL areas, beach  houses, ski condos from liquidating some of their stocks.<p>This article has it all wrong. Elon Musk added to his net worth due to stock growth which was caused by govt indiscriminately pumping money via stimulus, interest rates ect. Govt actions eg: giving money to ppl who experienced no loss in income has caused this. Investing in stocks was the top use of stimulus money across all income classes per cnbc.  \nSo this was caused by govt actions not by amazon exploiting their employees  more, they have been doing that forever, that hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>I think guardian here is advocating for billionares to &quot;trickle down&quot; their wealth to employees. So giving money directly to ppl also causes &quot;trickle down&quot; ?')
