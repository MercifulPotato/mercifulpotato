I&#x27;m wearing a non-brand polo shirt and jeans most days.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;d go to a good mens clothing store and talk to them about your goals. Don&#x27;t buy too much at once, try to stay fairly classic&#x2F;timeless at first until you figure out what you like.<p>I can&#x27;t do it because I&#x27;m too much of a tightwad to spend $180+ on a shirt, or $1,000 on a blazer, which is what the average is at the store I&#x27;m thinking of. But they will work with you, get your measurements, and do alterations so that the stuff you buy really fits well (which is a big part of what makes an outfit look really good -- it&#x27;s more than just the right combination of colors).')
