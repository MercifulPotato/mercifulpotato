You&#x27;re certain to get worked hard and billed out to clients for a lot more than what you get paid, but it can be a great environment for learning rapidly and also getting real world exposure to seeing how general math &amp; computer science &amp; optimisation techniques can be combined and fruitfully applied to some particular industry or business niche. Early in your career it is a lot easier to do something for a year or two and decide it isn&#x27;t for you, and try something else -- or decide that it&#x27;s a good fit and that you want to keep pursuing it in industry or pursue further studies to go into more depth about an area you didn&#x27;t realise you were excited about.<p>I&#x27;ve found the work most engaging in my career where there&#x27;s a combination of learning about and understanding some particular industry and then combining that with software development and mathematical modelling&#x2F;optimisation techniques and then seeing the real world industry-specific results --- but it&#x27;s hard to know what opportunities in specific real world industries exist and if you would enjoy them without being immersed in it.')
