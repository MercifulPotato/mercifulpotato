Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603101035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820505, text='You&#x27;re right of course, I just mean that it makes it a bit verbose and error-prone to write in full &quot;(i &gt;&gt; (32 - shift)) | (i &lt;&lt; shift))&quot;. I need to triple check that I&#x27;m not off-by-one and that all the operators are in the right direction every time I write this. If you had rotation operators like, say, &quot;&lt;|&quot; you could write &quot;i &lt;| shift&quot; instead and that&#x27;d be a lot nicer to read and write IMO.')
