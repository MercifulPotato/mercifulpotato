Can confirm. I&#x27;m given to understand that legacy systems (think 30ish years ago) were much better engineered, but there&#x27;s not enough Proper Engineers(tm)(r) to design (and build) all the critical systems that are necessary.<p>The biggest issues are that an engineer with the knowhow is expensive, a team of them is prohibitively expensive, a lot of companies outsource this work to different countries and make them sign onerous and dubiously-enforceable contracts, pay little, demand too much, and have incredibly unrealistic deadlines for the type of work that needs to happen.<p>You know how it is, if it never fails, you&#x27;re throwing money out. That&#x27;s the mentality of a lot of management types I&#x27;ve dealt with.')
