At a guess, you&#x27;d probably want to build at something like [dimensions] + 2*[tolerance]. So if your build process produced a 10cm cube with +&#x2F;- 1mm, you&#x27;d  want to build a 10.2mm cube so even a worse-case -1mm tolerance issue you&#x27;d still have +1mm of and so still be able to get the dice in without using force. And assuming the dice themselves didn&#x27;t have some crazy high tolerance ranges.<p>I&#x27;ve got a side-gig&#x2F;hobby making stuff, and the the 2x tolerance works pretty well as a rule of thumb for me, but the project type, material, and application probably play a big part in those considerations. Any industrial&#x2F;mechanical&#x2F;materials engineer care to weigh in?')
