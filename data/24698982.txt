Unless the regulations are carefully crafted, this might lead to a situation where platform owners decide to completely vertically integrate software on their platform, rather than allow third party vendors to play in their walled garden.<p>Look at gaming platforms and their respective stores, for example. If Microsoft isn&#x27;t allowed to compete with third party publishers on their platform, they might very well say, &quot;screw it, Xbox doesn&#x27;t run third party games anymore, it only runs Microsoft games&quot;. Then you&#x27;re in a situation where the Xbox is nothing but a vessel for Microsoft software.<p>To a certain extent, we&#x27;ve already seen the gaming industry move slightly in this direction, with Microsoft and Sony buying an ever expanding list of gaming studios. It&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t exactly be a huge leap for them to restrict their respective consoles to running games coming from their in-house studios.
