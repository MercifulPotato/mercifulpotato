The Mac App store is quite buggy. Sometimes I have to log in two times in a row. I hate it so fucking much that I almost consider not buying a good product just to avoid the Mac App Store&#x27;s shitty app.<p>I also hate that the purchase is tied to my Apple ID, especially for a utility that I&#x27;d like to use in another computer. Say a workstation where I might have a different Apple ID.<p>If an app, for example, can be installed in two work machines, I don&#x27;t want my Apple ID to dictate which machines.<p>Anyways rant over.<p>I get that for the seller&#x27;s point of view the Mac App Store&#x27;s updated policy is a boon.')
