You can’t hide widespread outbreaks. Iran failed to. Russia failed to.<p>There are millions of Chinese outside the country with relatives outside. Vast economic trade networks. Satellites scanning every inch of China every day. Witness the exposés on Uighur concentration camps despite intense Chinese effort to hide them.<p>Life in China appears to be....mostly normal virus wise. And multiple other countries achieved the same. It doesn’t strain credulity to believe China mostly contained it.<p>I could believe China has <i>somewhat</i> more cases than they say, but it’s simply implausible that they have a raging epidemic.')
