Which can most easily be accomplished by increasing taxes on the consumption you want reduced.<p>The ocean pollution in the article is due to shipping plastic waste to other countries, who subsequently let it shed into the ocean.<p>Couldn&#x27;t this problem be eliminated in a near instant by disallowing export of that low value plastic waste, and landfilling it in the US? It doesn&#x27;t solve the oil &#x2F; carbon problem, but neither does exporting it. It does solve the ocean pollution aspect pretty completely though.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the <i>best</i> solution, but it does seem like a stepping stone.')
