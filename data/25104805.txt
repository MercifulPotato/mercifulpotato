My family has a history of cholesterol disease. Within the first year my LDH and HDH level was at the optimal range. Doc cut the disease by half and the second year was within normal range but a bit higher than the first one.\nI honestly don’t feel any different. Doc said mostly it could be that the negative news is the worthy ones to publish.\nI don’t think changing diet would make a lot of difference in my case. Without statin my LDL and HDL would be off the charge. I know those two numbers alone are not determining how I could die but what else I should believe in?')
