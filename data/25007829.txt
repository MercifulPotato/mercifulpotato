Put a shaft on that turbine, and put a pump on the other end. That pump should be able to pump water from the 60 foot tank up to the 61 foot tank. You would get less water in the 61 foot tank than in the 60 foot tank. Quite a bit less actually, but you could still harness the energy in the 60 ft tank to get some water to the 61 ft tank.')
