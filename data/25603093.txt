Item(by='jt2190', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609507584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602768, text='If useful, the US Department of the Treasury can issue a coin or bill with a value of any denomination, including .005 USD, and so is “infinitely divisible”.<p>Bitcoin divisibility is limited, by design, to 0.00000001 BTC (1 Satoshi)<p>Whether this is “enough” is very difficult to answer definitively. If the demand for BTC is greater than the supply, the value of BTC will rise until supply and demand reach equilibrium. If the demand outpaces supply, holders (“HODLERS”) have less incentive to trade and more incentive to keep their BTC, because the value of their BTC increases.<p>If demand gets too great, few to no holders trade, because they get more value by doing nothing, and trades involving BTC slow or stop completely. (We can think of this as kind of a “consensus attack” by “store of value” advocates on the “medium of exchange” advocates.) The demand doesn’t go away, though, so supply and demand can’t reach equilibrium.<p>Eventually this would lead people to start using something else as a medium of exchange, perhaps just bartering at first, eventually settling on something common. So now we have a problem: BTC demand has been satisfied by another “medium of exchange”. But what happens to the “store of value” part of BTC if it is no longer the “medium of exchange”? Do coins become like works of art, traded infrequently for great sums? Or do they become worthless?')
