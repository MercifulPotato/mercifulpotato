Fueled up and invested in your belief, it becomes harder to surrender that.<p>I do believe our best bet is to let science speak louder and put more weight into that. Both in our algorithms and into our debates. If people see some dude on a talkshow with an opinion vs an expert in a field, some equate that with both having equally valid and valuable opinions. Same if that happens on social. The presentation makes it seem both opinions have equal and valid weight.<p>That said, itâ€™s a valuable discussion and a good incentive to really work harder and to do our research as technologists so we can be better at curbing the trend.')
