Item(by='tesseract', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603770000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903918, text='I grew up in the 90s in a low-density suburb in Michigan and was allowed to bicycle around the neighborhood and hang out with other kids (although, I was also pretty introverted and usually not interested in that). I rode a school bus to school along with most of my classmates. That said, access to things like nature, shops and restaurants, and the library all required a car - not being able to access those independently made me feel somewhat restricted compared to how my parents described their childhoods (dad in a walkable college town, mom in a rural area where kids played in the woods) and compared to kids I read about in books.<p>One very noticeable recent-ish norm shift seems to be parents dropping off and picking up elementary and middle-school age kids at school. I don&#x27;t know exactly when the trend started, but it seemed to hit critical mass after 9&#x2F;11, and over the course of the following decade seemed to become the norm to the extent that suburban schools started remodeling their grounds and parking lots to accommodate a waiting line of parents in cars - something I&#x27;ve seen now in multiple states.')
