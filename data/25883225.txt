Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25883663, 25883389], score=None, time=1611418042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882954, text='I don&#x27;t see how putting everyone in a huge radius, journalists and those otherwise uninvolved included, under investigative suspicion and location surveillance to respond to what is only charitably described as an insurrection (the group was almost entirely unarmed) is in any way reasonable.<p>It seems like a massive overreaction.  If we&#x27;re truly interested in democracy and the rule of law, we&#x27;d do well to not shred our standard democratic and legal procedures (such as the presumption of innocence, and the fourth amendment&#x27;s prohibition on searches without probable cause) the instant a few thousand angry, unarmed yahoos show up with pitchforks and banners and achieve precisely nothing.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t even do that if a few thousand armed, trained people show up, with the express intent of doing battle, taking control, and holding territory (which, again, to be clear, is not what happened).  We absolutely should not do it when a bunch of idiot yahoos break windows and set off fire extinguishers and steal shit.<p>Even had the building burned to the ground, universal surveillance such as this would not be a proportionate reaction.')
