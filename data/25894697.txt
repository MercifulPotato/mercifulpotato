We have become used to having strong binary statements about nuanced socio&#x2F;economical&#x2F;physcological phenomenon throw out as capital S Science. And then the obvious second paper comes out with the opposite conclusion which is also presented as &quot;Science&quot;.<p>Think of all the stuff online &quot;Science says this is the beset way to fold your clothes&quot; and they link to some weak paper that mentions that there is some benefit to doing something maybe in some constrained situation. Is it any wonder we have a society of people half of whom think it&#x27;s all bullshit?<p>Yes, these studies use the same scientific process regarding hypotheses and data collection as a physics or chemistry experiment but the nature of that data is VERY different and conflating the two is a mistake in my opinion.')
