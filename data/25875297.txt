You can&#x27;t use .NET concepts to bridge into an understanding of React. If you need to carry over .NET&#x27;s paradigms, don&#x27;t pick React.<p>Personally, I think if you want a deep understanding of React you need to first get in a few cycles of working with DOM, JS, CSS, etc. directly. Maybe throw in a functional programming language too. <i>Then</i> try to pick up React.')
