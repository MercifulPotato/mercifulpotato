You would have to add an element of &quot;no screen peaking&quot; where the contestants cant see which door opened for the other person.<p>So you have Player A who chose door 1.  The host flips the goat in door 3.<p>You have Player B who chooses door 2.  For them the host flips open the goat in door 1.<p>Player A should switch, and wins the car.  Player B should switch, but had the car and loses it.  The right move in both their cases was to switch.<p>Really, its no different than playing two separate games.  Unless, like you said, you somehow change the rules and limit someones choices, in which case Im not sure why its a part of the conversation, other than being introduced through confusion.')
