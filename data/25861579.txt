Regex is, IMHO, a easy-to-write hard-to-read language, so I find it more fruitful to use tests to specify what is the task being accomplished, so that - if it&#x27;s easier - I can just rewrite the appropriate regex from scratch rather than trying to decipher how the old one is broken.<p>If the task is complex enough, regex might not even be the right tool for the job, and the function boundary provides a sensible encapsulation boundary.')
