In my experience the number is one, and it was 2015. I mean, backends of projects I worked on or somebody offered to hire me to work on. It could be selection bias and yet they&#x27;re asking me about Java, which I basically abandoned about 15 years ago, PHP, which I know since the beginning of it but only kind of toyed with, even C# which I can read as a foreign language close to one I know but never used. I wonder if anybody asked me about Rust or Go, probably not. What they ask me about and I accept to work on are Ruby, Elixir and Python, in order of my preference. Python is a distant third (as preference.)<p>About frontend: JavaScript all the times if there is a frontend separate from the backend. React with some rare Angular project.<p>I&#x27;d like to make a poll and see how many of the people here are working on a JavaScript backend vs any other language.')
