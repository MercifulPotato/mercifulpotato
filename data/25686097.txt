Unable to get online access working for a corporate account, I was stuck calling them every month to manually pay a line of credit or get dinged for a late payment. Their service reps are friendly, but unempowered to do much. All this for a side business--it hasn&#x27;t been worth the effort. I really don&#x27;t want to spend the time and effort migrating accounts _again_ but will do so if the conclusion of Azlo closing is to just drop us all into BBVA&#x27;s system.<p>The best I can say for BBVA is that they&#x27;re less bad to work with than BoA and Wells Fargo.<p>On the personal banking side, Schwab has treated me extremely well for years; I have no complaints. They feel like the Amex of bank accounts.')
