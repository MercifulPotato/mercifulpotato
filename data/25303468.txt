The Apple Pencil + Paperlike experience really do it for me.\nNotability is nice and when I write feature designs I don’t have to transcribe my handwriting to the computer. I simply select the handwriting, convert it to text and move it over my computer.\nAnother great thing about this is that I can run searches on my handwriting, I really enjoy that because looking for that one page in a notebook is never practical, specially when you have many notebooks.<p>I’m a fan of the simplicity of your system but I don’t know if it’ll work for me. I really like writing with a pencil, that’s when I feel like I’m learning or reflecting on information.')
