But let&#x27;s dissect them a little.<p>But first, let me just that I had no intent to try to &quot;delegitimize&quot; NC culture at all. If anything I was more trying to just move the boundaries a bit, and insist that it is bigger than that description suggests. I see it as more like some sort of set theoretic thing: any given culture anywhere on earth is a complex set of overlapping previously-existing cultures, gathered from across time and space, and the exact mixture will vary if not inch-by-inch then probably mile by mile. My sister- and brother-in-law live are OBX&#x27;ers and from many visits with them combined with a few to friends in the NC mountains, one could scarcely imagine they even live in the same timezone let alone the same state.<p>Tobacco: a huge piece of the economy measured in terms of dollars, but measured in terms the percentage of the population directly involved in it, not so much. So on the one hand, we have an industry that made and keeps a small number of people very wealthy, and on the other we have an industry that provided nothing more than a regular wage to many others PLUS doing substantial harm to those who smoke, both in NC and elsewhere. Thus ... when a Senator from NC votes on tobacco related issues, I would insist that what they are generally voting for is to preserve the existing distribution of power and wealth within the state.<p>Now, with rural broadband, one could argue that this goes the other way. Surely, one might say, universal (and affordable) access to reliable high speed internet service <i>changes</i> things a lot, in ways that actually threaten to change the existing distribution of power and wealth in NC (and obviously elsewhere too). I don&#x27;t think that this is wrong, but I think it&#x27;s very important to dig deeper into such proposals. Why? Because so often when someone bothers to do this, we find all kinds of nefarious self-interest still at work, hidden under what is almost certainly excellent public policy. Does it matter if someone who is already among NC&#x27;s &quot;landed gentry&quot; (they would never call themselves that, of course) gets a bit richer while a process that gives everyone functioning Netflix occurs? Maybe, maybe not. I&#x27;d just be curious to see how Cawthorn sells this idea to his wealthier donors compared to his more public facing version.<p>I am not surprised by your reaction to Seattle. As I mentioned in another comment here, most people want to feel part of a group of &quot;similar&quot; folks that is of a size that they can wrap their hearts and minds around. I was reading something this morning that mentioned an area of Manhattan called &quot;Alphabet City&quot; - a relatively tiny area but one that still contains enough people for its residents to think of themselves as living some aspects of life with shared experiences and goals. So this sort of association&#x2F;community&#x2F;culture building goes on everywhere and at all times.<p>I don&#x27;t think your a hopeless idealist. I think your experience and outlook is probably much closer to that of a majority of Americans than mine.')
