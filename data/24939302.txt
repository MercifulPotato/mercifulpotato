There are some similarities but we view ourselves as much lighter weight and flexible than ZS.  A few ways we&#x27;re different:\n- We eliminate the performance penalty of routing all your traffic through their cloud.  We do almost all our routing decisions and authorization checks on-device to minimize performance hits. \n- Our service is protocol agnostic, so things like SSH, RDP, etc work out of the box (no special SSH proxies, SSH settings, etc).\n- We also let you try it out for free and our pricing is transparent :)<p>That said, we&#x27;re big fans of ZS and think they are doing the world a huge favor by getting folks off traditional VPN :)')
