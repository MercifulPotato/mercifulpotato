The driver was buying meth in our small town, and returning to their small town.<p>The dealer sold meth to somebody who was obviously far, far beyond the point of being able to drive, got their money, and sent them back on the road merrily. This dealer is also selling to somebody who obviously has almost no money (besides the bit scraped together to pay for the drugs), was just released from prison, and is addicted to both hard drugs and alcohol.<p>Ya, I&#x27;d say dealers are pretty much scum of the earth.')
