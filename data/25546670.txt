After all, it&#x27;s a public health harm to everyone else allowing them to breed and inflict their deformity on innocent babies that would have otherwise been normal.<p>And then one day an actual disease based on a germ of some sort comes along that just <i>loves</i> to live in the valleys of human fingerprints, and the entire human race dies because we erased the few people we had that would have been immune.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the excuse for failing to recognize that the value of diversity outweighs it&#x27;s inconvenience. I don&#x27;t know how long that has been grade-school knowledge. If not multiple hundreds of years, sure at least it&#x27;s been a known thing since before the brith of any currently living person?<p>We are turning ourselves into human Cavendish banannas.')
