If you care about what is true, and not the historical development of ideas, there&#x27;s not much point in reading things written before, say, 1900, or even 1950. So no Hume or Hegel or whatever. In general these texts are poorly written and unclear compared to modern ones. And of course, they can&#x27;t treat the developments that have taken place in the intervening years. Consider an analogy: you would not read Newton&#x27;s original manuscripts to learn calculus.<p>This type of view is extremely common amongst students of analytic philosophy. The &quot;problem&quot; approach to philosophy.<p>IMO Reading Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Heidegger, etc. and other thinkers deemed outdated and unworthy is absolutely a good use of time for anyone interested in Philosophy. This post is actually the first time I&#x27;ve ever heard anybody suggest not reading Hume.')
