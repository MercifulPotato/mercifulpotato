But I did take a class at Woodcraft that was pretty nicely done about 10 years ago.  It was a simple course over a few nights.  I learned a couple woodworking tricks that upped my game, but there were a couple beginners.  Hopefully Woodcraft will start having classes again once things start opening up again.  If so signup and they will teach you how to use the basic tools and more importantly you will walk away with a bit of confidence and knowledge on how to fix mistakes.')
