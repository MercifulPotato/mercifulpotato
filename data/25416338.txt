The ones I have actually thought about so far are<p>* bandwidth (BunnyCDN is the best I&#x27;ve found, and they and AWS do private pricing after hitting an aggregate of a couple petabytes a month). Offering yearly plans would help bring in enough cashflow to buy bandwidth options. BunnyCDN allows me good margins at the retail price.<p>* support load: will likely put in an hourly rate for needy customers, or do the CD Baby &#x2F; Derek Sivers &quot;buy us a pizza&quot; thing. I&#x27;m also okay with helping customers off the system or firing them outright if they&#x27;re toxic. But ideally will automate whatever gets asked for the most, and offer services from a team for creative work, at hourly rates.<p>* customer acquisition: put my own blogs on it first (I have a personal blog, and a couple of OSS projects), bring on the companies I used to work for that avoided Ghost because we had 20 people teams and it was too expensive, then go one by one from there. Will get my mom and her embroidery boutique on, then friends with their cooking blogs. If everyone is happy, can evaluate next steps.<p>I&#x27;m bootstrapping as well, but the good news is there&#x27;s no cost to this (my own blogs will already warrant the baseline infrastructure). So I&#x27;d like to think I can take my time with this.')
