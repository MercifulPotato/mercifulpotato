If that&#x27;s what you think this thread is about, then you are very off-topic. If we are truly doing that, then we need to avoid all institutions and policies since they all have some bigoted background, and there&#x27;s no path forward because everyone can just unsupportively call anything racist.<p>&quot;Are you implying that it happening has had nothing to do with the inflammation of racial tensions by elites and media organizations?&quot;<p>You have been stating that subjecting everyone to the citizen test is racist and said that we shouldn&#x27;t do it because the racist policy will lead to parties fighting each other so the elites are left alone.<p>I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s already happening, so you don&#x27;t have any premise for why not to do this. And quite frankly, you have derailed the actual topic of thread and failed to provide any logical reasoning for your stances (paraphrased, because all past policies have been racist this one must be racist and shouldn&#x27;t be implemented).')
