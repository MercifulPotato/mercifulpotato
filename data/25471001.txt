In familial (i.e. hereditary) CJD, a mutation in the PRNP gene (DNA) creates an abnormal misfolded protein, i.e. prion. In sporadic CJD, it&#x27;s basically bad luck that the protein gets folded wrong. In acquired CJD, exposure to brain tissue with the prion protein causes it. Once there&#x27;s a prion, it causes more of the protein to misfold, creating more prions and causing the disease.')
