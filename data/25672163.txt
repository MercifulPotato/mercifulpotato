This means these votes cannot be verified as being authentic or legal. Also the IT infrastructure is not secure, despite Christopher Krebs&#x27; claim. How do I know? Georgia&#x27;s Election Machines was remotely exploited by Jovan Pulitzer&#x27;s team. Pulitzer also has diagnostic technology which can forensically verify if a paper ballot is inauthentic.<p>America simply needs to do better. Third world countries have higher standards with their elections. This election (&amp; others) is an embarrassment to the United States.<p>~~edit~~<p>To fix these reoccurring issues&#x2F;embarrassments, we need the following:<p>* All laws need to be followed<p>* A full certified chain of custody for all eligible &amp; legal ballots<p>* Audit ALL Elections<p>* Open Source ALL relevant Election Software &amp; Hardware<p>* Public Domain &amp; distributed Voter Rolls<p>* Public Domain &amp; distributed Precinct data<p>* All Tabulation traffic is logged<p>* All Electronic Ballot images is saved<p>* All ballots are forensically audited using automated processes. The forensic technology should be Open Source.<p>* Equal representation of both parties with the poll workers, poll watchers<p>* Protect poll watchers from harassment &amp; removal<p>* Ensure public health safety measures do not affect Election Integrity')
