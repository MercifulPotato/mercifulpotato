The most it can do is direct fumes to the ceiling instead of in your face.  Incredibly little effect, when I then need to had the windows open with a box fan for a few hours any time I pan-fry anything.  It&#x27;s very frustrating, as those fumes could have been caught and exhausted from the source with much less exchange of air.')
