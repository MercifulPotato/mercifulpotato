But honestly, I think that their reasoning for releasing it is exactly to reduce worries in people, that &#x27;it&#x27;ll never happen feeling&#x27;. I think they needed to put something (before it was even 99% ready) out, otherwise people would lose hope and investors balk at the progress. I really do think that it&#x27;ll never happen, at least in the ecosystems current form. There needs to be special lanes or routes that self driving cars can take, special pick-up points, etc. Humans take risks while driving every day, the problem is, that we have an incredibly good picture of the risks involved in everyday things. Machines don&#x27;t have this sense perfectly attenuated yet, and I have yet to see evidence that they ever will. With us, there is no variability in our senses. Our eyes mostly work the same every day, our perception skills doesn&#x27;t change. Machines cannot even trust their senses, and their code has to reflect that.<p>Obviously, this is all speculation on my part, but when I see videos of waymo sitting in roadways and parking lots, blocking traffic, pedestrians, and just the overall flow of life, the more that I get the feeling that machines should not be allowed to participate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g5SeVxYAZzk</a>')
