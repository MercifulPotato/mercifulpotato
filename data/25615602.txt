Power doesn&#x27;t have to be free, but it should be everywhere.<p>It&#x27;s like all the EV charging networks try to replicate gas stations. It&#x27;s stupid. Nobody wants to take their car to a charging station, pay by the minute, and park their car somewhere else when it&#x27;s full.<p>People just want to park their cars wherever, and plug them in when they know they&#x27;ll stay there for some time, and just pay per kWh, and they definitely don&#x27;t want to go park their car somewhere else when it&#x27;s full.<p>The nice thing about electric is that you could theoretically charge cars pretty much anywhere, outlets would be cheap to install almost anywhere! And cars are parked somewhere 90% of the day anyway. So you don&#x27;t need fast charging.<p>I feel like the guys trying to build infrastructure for EVs in most cities are fucking stupid.<p>You don&#x27;t need to build 20 fast charging stations. For the same money you could probably install 2000 standard outlets, controlled with a relay and a phone app for payment.<p>That&#x27;s something that would actually drive EV adoption.<p>Right now the only people who buy EVs are people who have a house where they can install an outlet for charging. People who live in appartments are stuck with ICE cars...')
