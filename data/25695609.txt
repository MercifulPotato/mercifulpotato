Trump has all to lose and nothing to gain from this event. But the opposition, and the anti-T republican party gains everything. The concerted Goog, facebook and Twitter censorship, something that would have been impossible to do 6 months ago now clamored if not sanctioned politically.<p>Civilian coups are very different from military coups. Military ones are easy to understand: the guy with the gun did it. Civilian coups happen when a majority or at least a great amount of people agree with what is happening so are willing to go along with the situation.<p>Trump is an idiot and gave a massive opening here. But the fact that there is so much consensus on what&#x27;s happening next is not a defense of institutions, specially if this was sparked.')
