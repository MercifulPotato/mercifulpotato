It&#x27;s not just a straight list of chatrooms like ... every other chat app on the planet. The rooms also show what appears to be IMs for group chats (the style&#x2F;UI) instead of a chatroom.<p>The calendar integration is nice and the video chats are good, but The Linux version of their client just stops pulling audio all the time unless I do a `killall -9 pulseaudio` and restart it (and it&#x27;s the only app left where I still have to do that).<p>Teams gets a big &quot;Meh&quot; for me on calls and awful for text chat.')
