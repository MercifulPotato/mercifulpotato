Maps and navigation in the Croatian countryside is comically broken. Not only are the locations of addresses way off, if you travel to that location, they&#x27;ll then send you somewhere else and eventually in a circle.<p>Maybe they don&#x27;t care about poor countries with lower usage, but I&#x27;d be embarrassed to have that in my product.<p>Having said that, rich western Europe is in some ways no better. If you create a public transport route, Google maps will send you walking hundreds of meters around non-existent barriers, or sometimes insist that you go one tram stop past and then catch the tram back to the stop you want to go to.<p>Maps, like search seems to be slowly suffering from some sort of corporate rot over at Google.')
