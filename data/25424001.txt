In addition those boards have better memory traces, increasing the chances that you can overclock memory (beyond XMP) and tighten memory timings. On my 3950x this all resulted in about a 15% performance uplift (compared to XMP enabled alone).<p>If Apple were to ever use AMD hardware, they would likely use a B450 - it is perfectly capable of running all the components to spec.')
