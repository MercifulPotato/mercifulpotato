What are you getting for the taxes?<p>I moved to Hong Kong this year. Public health care, amazing public transportation, no tent cities[1], and the <i>top</i> tax rate is 17%. It&#x27;s not perfect, but this idea that the solution to every societal problem is just to pay more and more taxes is nonsense.<p>California has the highest taxes in the country. \nIf the quality of life there is worse than in states with lower taxes, then it&#x27;s time to start questioning how that tax money is spent, not shovel more of it into a black hole that isn&#x27;t doing anything.<p>[1] I won&#x27;t say there&#x27;s no homeless, because I don&#x27;t know that for sure, but there are hardly any panhandlers. I know there is subsidized housing available, but I hear the wait list is long. Whatever they&#x27;re doing, there&#x27;s hardly any homeless on the streets.')
