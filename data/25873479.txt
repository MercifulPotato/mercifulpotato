I think the issue of which features are desirable in new vs older cars holds though.  Another example could be 4x4s - 4Runners, Land Rovers, etc - most of these are bought as family cars, and those first buyers are looking for niceties like high-end stereos, leather seats, etc.  But once the trucks are older, people care less about an obsolete stereo or worn leather and more about which suspension or other off-road options it has, etc.<p>Going down a bit of a rabbithole there, but I&#x27;m still curious to see what the perceived desirability of used electric cars turns out to be for &quot;average&quot; Americans.')
