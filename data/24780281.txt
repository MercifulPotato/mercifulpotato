We met during our PhDs. We have done a number of side projects together, gone to software conferences together, and sometimes discuss work things at home and help each other. I know this can be a recipe for disaster but for some reason it brings us closer together. Now that we have both been forced to work from home for the past 6 months I have been wondering if it would make more sense to actually seek work together. Is this something possible? Are companies willing to hire a couple full-time remote or contracting would be the only option? Anyone else feels the same?')
