Plastic is rather efficient, you only need a tiny drop of oil to create a lot of packaging.<p>If food production at some point becomes CO2 neutral you still have a lot of other detrimental effects to the environment from food production to account for. Plastic is a net positive for the environment when it comes to food packaging.')
