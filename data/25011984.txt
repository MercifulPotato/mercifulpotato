Not just from federal law enforcement with proof of it, but twitter, youtube and facebook know it and admit to it too. Smarter Everyday interviewed all 3 and their folks talk about this directly.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FY_NtO7SIrY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=FY_NtO7SIrY</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1PGm8LslEb4</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V-1RhQ1uuQ4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V-1RhQ1uuQ4</a><p>The actual social media platforms saying it&#x27;s happening.<p>At the same time though, it&#x27;s not all their fault.

Let&#x27;s be sensible and stop going to the extremes and work together.&quot; This is the fantasy that fills my dreams. Not flying, being rich or anything like that. That, society being sensible and taking some personal responsibility. That&#x27;s my crazy, wild fantasy...')
