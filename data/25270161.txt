We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to continue to bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians&#x27; needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. Some examples of what your weeks may look like:<p>* building remote tools for pet owners to sign consent forms, pay invoices, and fill in information online so they don&#x27;t have to walk into the clinics during the pandemic<p>* creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time<p>* designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders.<p>You&#x27;ll be working directly with the thousands of veterinarians and staff using Vetspire every day, and talking with them often to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It&#x27;s an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone&#x27;s pets. It&#x27;s half-part engineering, half-part problem-solving.<p>Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix&#x2F;Absinthe application written in Elixir, our frontend is using React with the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.<p>Email me if interested at sam@vetspire.com (include &quot;HN&quot; in the subject), or view more information here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;vetspire&#x2F;7db76974-453a-49dd-be68-d96954672cb0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;vetspire&#x2F;7db76974-453a-49dd-be68-d9695...</a>')
