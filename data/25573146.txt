I totally understand if it&#x27;s not enough to make a switch, but I&#x27;m glad you were able to see that it&#x27;s not <i>so</i> bad on this side of things. There&#x27;s definitely not enough niceties for the average computer user (GUI editing and installing) and some missing for any user (package manager). I will stand by piping as a matter of taste (the biggest benefit for me is it allows for using the tools I&#x27;m already familiar with, awk and grep or plain c&#x2F;zig).<p>---<p>My interest in neatroff is mostly the code itself. A tiny and opinionated project with readable source that still achieves quite a lot (all that I need anyways). But it&#x27;s definitely not for everyone! The author doesn&#x27;t use a windowing system, for example, and instead uses the framebuffer for pdf viewing and editing (both custom implementations). It is ISC, by the way. It&#x27;s included in the bottom of the readme.')
