Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25959685], score=None, time=1611938769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959077, text='The other issue is that it tends to be underspecified whether a discussion is about law or policy.<p>Someone comes in and describes from first principles what a reasonable system would look like, and then someone else haughtily chastises them because that isn&#x27;t how the existing system works. But if you read it as they intended it, i.e. as a policy proposal rather than a legal opinion, then the fact that it isn&#x27;t the existing system is the point. The intention is to change the system to make it that way and the desired response is either support or a criticism of the mechanics of the proposal rather than its basis in existing law.')
