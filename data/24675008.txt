My mate nearly blurted out that, &quot;well, we just use the standard recommended XXX&quot; but his boss gave him a kick just before he did. The competitors were simply cutting costs by not using the standard recommended XXX and that was literally the only thing that borked their quality, and yet they hadn&#x27;t picked up on it.<p>The point is, the stuff that seems without value to you may be of incredible value to others. We have stated this time and time again on HN when it comes to privacy and data protection and yet I still need to see stuff like GHunt to remind me.<p>It&#x27;s fun and scary to see how little tidbits of information are both easily available and easily linked.
