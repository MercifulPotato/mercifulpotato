I do know of textile factories that have pivoted temporarily. Can you build up a short-lived production line for an integrated circuit and then tear it down but leave all of the infrastructure in place to pivot to something else? What I hear out of Intel is that setting up such a fab is a long and expensive process.<p>What I also hear is a lot of people challenging Intel&#x27;s wisdom. So now I don&#x27;t know what to think.')
