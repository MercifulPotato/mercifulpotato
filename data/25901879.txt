Yes, this is what puts food on the table of academics. I don&#x27;t understand your criticism. Racket is very impressive in many ways, but making a run-of-the-mill webapp in two lines is not one of them.<p>IMO, thinking that nothing important came out of Racket reseachwise is a highly uninformed opinion. I mean, dependent type systems as macros (therefore bringing true static types as a library)! Come on, is that not impressive?! Rewriting Scheme-on-Scheme to obtain something simpler and pretty much as fast as Scheme-on-C is not impressive!? A Scheme program that compiles to a C parallel GC is not impressive!?<p>On the contrary, the core Racket team is very, very impressive. Just not for the things you yourself wish for.')
