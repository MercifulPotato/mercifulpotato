I really don&#x27;t want a rules-based democracy voting to kill me and my family, so I&#x27;m glad that I have the fundamental right not to be subject to that risk (even if it <i>were</i> supported by the majority.)<p>One of the values that&#x27;s pretty prevalent in the United States and a lot of other developed nations is a respect for property rights; if you worked for something, you get to keep it, even if other people would want it more.<p>Both of these rights exist on a spectrum (e.g. the death penalty can override your right to life in the extreme case, and taxes can override your right to your property to a small extent), but by almost any measure putting your right to property to a vote is <i>extremely</i> far on the &quot;not respecting property rights&quot; side of the spectrum.<p>Also, I have extremely little confidence that the best way to assuage our political divide is to introduce the perpetual threat of &quot;the majority had better think that what you&#x27;re doing is useful, otherwise we&#x27;ll take everything you have.&quot;<p>The rule of law means that sometimes things will arise that slip through the cracks in unintended ways. The solution to this is to <i>fix those cracks</i> and make the law more clearly define what&#x27;s desired. If this makes a given business model non-viable, then so be it; that&#x27;s the price of progress. I&#x27;d imagine that those is favor of the rule of law, though, can see the slippery slope of letting the mob vote on what do with the property of those who <i>were</i> following the law at the time.')
