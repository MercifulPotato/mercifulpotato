Item(by='adamsea', descendants=None, kids=[25564638], score=None, time=1609197191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563773, text='&gt; I think this response and some others vastly underestimate the value and complexity of „unskilled“ or „menial“ work.<p>IMHO the parent poster is not talking about, let’s say the “inherent” value of such work, but the value our society places on it when it comes to money - aka when it comes to acquiring the basic necessities and securities of life and what it takes to live a decent life in the modern world.<p>Otherwise, I agree with your comment 100% and suspect several of the other posters do too.')
