This question is the most extreme form of the issue, as well. (Few ought to believe widespread fraud definitely occurred, many more likely believe itâ€™s possible strategically targeted fraud occurred, a much weaker stance but similarly dangerous.)<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll just assume the I&#x27;s are closet Republicans. But don&#x27;t blame me if you aren&#x27;t willing to face reality that this skepticism is not just going to go away through coercion.')
