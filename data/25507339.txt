Everyone discussing this law should really read the text instead of reading whatever nonsense the media is spinning.<p>Here&#x27;s the full text of what is being prohibited:<p>&gt; PROHIBITED ACT.<p>&gt; â€” It shall be unlawful to willfully, and for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, offer or provide to the public a digital transmission service that<p>&gt; (1) is primarily designed or provided for the purpose of publicly performing works protected under title 17 by means of a digital transmission without the authority of the copyright owner or the law;<p>&gt; (2) has no commercially significant purpose or use other than to publicly perform works protected under title 17 by means of a digital transmission without the authority of the copyright owner or the law;<p>&gt; or (3) is intentionally marketed by or at the direction of that person to promote its use in publicly performing works protected under title 17 by means of a digital transmission without the authority of the copyright owner or the law.<p>From my understanding, this basically means they&#x27;ll go after platforms (since they are the ones doing the act of offering to the public a digital transmission service).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tillis.senate.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;files&#x2F;A30B0C08-FB97-4F90-BB60-43283EB7AF35" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tillis.senate.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;files&#x2F;A30B0C08-FB97-4...</a>')
