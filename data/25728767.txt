Especially considering that he goes on to claim he won by &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of votes. Shouldn&#x27;t he be interested in uncovering that massive fraud, therefore supporting his assertions that it actually happened?<p>Your unconscious bias against Trump is what is defining your interpretation of that exchange. A person not trying to find something wrong with everything he says will interpret it the way I did. Using your same logic, if he won by hundreds of thousands then why does 11,780 matter enough to commit a felony?<p>&gt; Come on, Fox News has been doing this since the 90s. They literally posted an article suggesting their base drive their trucks into protestors[1].<p>And many have moved on from Fox News as a result. But the same can&#x27;t be said for the left and CNN. Further, your still not tending to the divide, just jumping onto the problem and saying &quot;me too&quot;.<p>&gt; Those poor, innocent, conservatives being attacked by the thugs in the mainstream liberal media.<p>Great job\n&gt; Here’s a compilation of liberal protesters getting pushed out of the way by cars and trucks,” wrote the article’s author. “Study the technique; it may prove useful in the next four years.<p>Isn&#x27;t this promoting violence?

You want to ignore cancel culture. And again, the left wants to take statements and twist them to make some outlandish point. It&#x27;s only going to divide us more.')
