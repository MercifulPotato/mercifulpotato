I absolutely fucking hate working from the office. Any office.<p>I have worked for companies big and small, so, I  sometimes don&#x27;t get most of the perks the author talks about.<p>I absolutely value my privacy and don&#x27;t want to feel like a criminal for browsing social media during office hours for brief periods of time while people stare into my screen.<p>I absolutely fucking hate sitting across a transparent windowed room from where my boss can see how long I&#x27;m out for lunch and not and bring it up casually during chit chat.<p>I absolutely hate that wall hanging TV (55&quot;) connected to Spotify at all times, playing stupid music I don&#x27;t like.<p>I absolutely hate namesake team lunches which again force me to give up my already short lunch break to discuss about work which stresses me out.<p>I absolutely hate people in open desks sitting across me, talking so loudly that I simply cannot get through my day without an expensive noise cancellation headphone. (Recommendation: Sony 1000XM3 or XM4 works wonders).<p>I hate forced &quot;team outings&quot; from office for &quot;team bonding&quot; activities which I cannot opt out of.<p>I hate being dragged into whiteboard &quot;brainstorming sessions&quot; I cannot opt out of, while I could be working on something else important.<p>Right now:<p>I&#x27;m at home, doing my own thing, with 100% privacy to do whatever I like whenever I like.<p>Nobody can walk upto me and yell &quot;Hey, got 2 mins?&quot; and expect me to attend to them or take offense if I don&#x27;t.<p>Nobody can drag me anywhere.\nPeople need to now send me calendar invitations which I can accept or reject along with a reason&#x2F;description in the invite itself.<p>I have full control over my time and I how I want to spend it.<p>Team meetings are now shorter, more efficient.<p>I can finally have some family time, save much more on transit costs and don&#x27;t need to be tired by the time I reach home.<p>Perhaps, the most important thing about NOT being in the office is that I&#x27;m not judged by the number of hours I&#x27;m glued to my desk, but rather the tasks that I complete on time and the quality of output I produce...which is how work should be judged.<p>THIS is the value of remote work for me. I simply cannot see myself going back to office.<p>I value my productivity and so should every company hiring me.')
