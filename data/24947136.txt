Maybe blind faith is more powerful than one believes.<p>(And all I talked about was only done in 1 year, I could go back and each year was bad).<p>We have turned into some third world country where injustice, incompetence and corruption are routine and people just turn a blind eye.<p>And I have loved ones who have been affected from this administrations policies. It must be easy to say everything you said when it doesn&#x27;t directly affect you. But we are all real people who are getting impacted with this hateful incompetence.')
