I now carry multiple different (and incompatible) USB-C cables which is in no way better than the magsafe + usb charger I had before.<p>Three years ago I had one USB-C charging brick with a lightning and USB-A cable and my macbook magsafe brick.<p>Now I carry a USB-C charging brick with a lightning cable for ipad and iphone, my USB-C charging brick for my macbook pro with a USB-C PD? cable, a USB-C -&gt; USB-C cable for my external SSD (which I cannot use to charge my macbook and the charging cable of my macbook does not work with it). Additionally I have a USB-C to USB-A adapter with a USB mini cable for my headphones and mifi dongle and a separate adapter for HDMI and SD.<p>I ended up with more cables and I would be in that situation for at least two years more until the last mini USB devices are discarded.  But even in that case I end up with multiple USB-C cables just because they are incompatible to each other.')
