I also happen to be a person who&#x27;s been doing network engineering for ISPs since 1996-1997 or thereabouts, and currently has business cards that read &quot;Senior Network Engineer&quot; on them. I&#x27;m not willing to give up anonymity here, but ask a specific two way satellite technology question and I&#x27;ll be more than happy to answer.<p>As a note there were lots of people buying and installing cheap COTS 1.2-1.8 meter size ku band vsat terminals at all sorts of military sites in Afghanistan for MWR purposes, it&#x27;s not rocket science or really hard to do at all. This stuff was, and is, all kept air gapped and separated from anything that is a real DoD or ISAF&#x2F;RS network. These were networks for peoples&#x27; own personal recreational internet and entertainment in their rest time. You absolutely would see weird latency, jitter, packet loss behavior on those.')
