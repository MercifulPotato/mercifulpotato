Parts of the trip are pretty scenic.  You can get delayed quite a bit by other rail traffic, but as you point out, you still have a table and can move around.  Acela isn&#x27;t much faster, but it is a lot smoother then the regional trains.<p>But for family travel, we end up driving, as the cost for 4 people is just too high (even considering expensive NYC parking).')
