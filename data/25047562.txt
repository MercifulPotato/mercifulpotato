ST Micro have at least one as well.<p>I think the unique thing about TSMC is that they&#x27;re an &quot;unaligned&quot; fab, not part of one of the giant chip companies. They&#x27;ll take contracts from anyone. This leads to their name getting mentioned a lot by all the fabless semiconductor companies, while Intel, AMD, Samsung etc. turn out billions of chips with zero news coverage.<p>They are the free market in chip manufacture.')
