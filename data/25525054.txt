Was it a little bit fascist? Yes, very slightly, but obviously I judged it to be overwhelmingly on the harmless side of things.<p>Still, it&#x27;s instructive to look at parades in Nazi Germany and so forth. Lots of friendly, smiling faces waving flags, not so different from the ones I wave to each July 4th. Societies can go down dark roads much more easily than we&#x27;d like to think.')
