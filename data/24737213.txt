Looks like you beat me to it. I figure it&#x27;s been long enough that I can share some war stories.<p>I was in the car w&#x2F; the founders on the way to Hacker Dojo when they got the news that they&#x27;d been accepted into YC. At this point much of their tech demo had been built by some kid they&#x27;d hooked up with at the Dojo. One time I remember one of the founders was on the phone with his mom trying to get more time out of him. I never saw the technology deliver on any promises but I was probably like 22 at the time and I was stoked to get to play with depth cameras and AR goggles at all. I helped them film some tech demos and build some jigs to take footage through the googles. It&#x27;s through Meta that I met Steves Mann and Feiner. I had a few great conversations with them at the time, and later it also made me realize that brilliant people who you deeply respect can make some really dumb bets too.<p>The best way to describe Meta is &quot;store brand Magic Leap&quot;. Huge gap between what they had and what they were selling, and never enough focus to put in the hard work to narrow it, or the humility to admit that they overpromised. They did eventually pay me, though I think some friends of mine were not so lucky. I would say it was mostly incompetence and not malice. I think the founders truly believed many of the lies they told and it was easy to get caught up in that energy. Working with them and hanging out in their general orbit at ChezJJ and the Hacker Dojo was probably the most HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley experience of my life and I&#x27;m deeply grateful for it.')
