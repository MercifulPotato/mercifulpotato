The issue they focused on was the fact that the checks are basically worthless. Most Danish banks had no idea how to handle them.<p>Part of the problem is that checks where fased out almost four years ago. To handle the checks the banks would need an American partner bank, but it’s still more trouble that most banks are willing to deal with and they aren’t obligated to cash in checks anymore.')
