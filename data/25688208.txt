People writing education content.  Or trying to understand existing content, steeped in misconceptions.  Students.  A science-literate public.<p>When I hobby work on OER science education content, or even when I answer a &quot;ask a science&#x2F;history&#x2F;whatever question&quot; on reddit, I use google scholar, open access. <i>and sci-hub</i>.<p>And &quot;I&#x27;d really like to see paper X&quot; is <i>not</i> my common case. Though it does occur when double checking that I&#x27;ve finally understood something correctly.  My usual case is wrestling with a concept, or trying to put an number to something. I search, and I surf, and I find a paper that <i>might</i> have one helpful sentence in it, 10% chance. And I can check... for only $40!  And again a minute later.  Or sci-hub.  And it&#x27;s not just greatly reduced friction - those sentences found, are not infrequently, the difference between success and punting, or the lead to a better way of understanding and explaining something.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that the American Chemical Society is working with Elsevier to make research literature <i>less</i> accessible to the public, while chemistry education research, describes chemistry education content, using words like &quot;incoherent&quot;, and as leaving both students and teachers steeped in misconceptions.')
