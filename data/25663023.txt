E.g. one compared the voting rate in 2020 and 2016 but used votes to registered voters in 2020 but votes to eligible voters in 2016.<p>The others were similarly laughable, but no body cared when I posted this.<p>Others says it better than I can, but the people who believe this stuff believe it because they want to, not because it makes sense.
