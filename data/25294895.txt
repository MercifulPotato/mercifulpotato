Keep in mind that if right now I wanted to hire: A smart graduate from EPFL, Polytechnique or ETH Zurich who interned at CERN and has contributed to the Linux kernel for a software engineering job at a unicorn startup<p>or<p>A grad from a second tier &quot;technical college&quot; in India with a visa refusal rate of ~90% for a job doing manual UI testing and QA for a body shop<p>my only path forward is H1. They&#x27;ll both be listed as &quot;computer related occupations&quot; and apply for the same visa in the same quota. Does that makes any sense to anyone?')
