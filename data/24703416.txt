My experiences suggest that this has promise. Using normal QWERTY, I currently type 160 wpm on average at 95%+ accuracy. I can get up to 180-190 if I risk letting typos through. I noticed that I unconsciously adopted a related idea to the one suggested here: my fingers automatically type out sequences of letters that I&#x27;m used to. For example, &quot;-tion&quot; is a common suffix. Instead of typing t, then, i, o, n, my fingers just bang out &quot;tion&quot; as one fluid motion, like a piano scale.<p>There&#x27;s a special type of keyboard called steno that takes this further. Instead of typing out individual letters, your keyboard has about 20 keys, and you use &quot;chords&quot; of keys to type entire syllables at a time. Experts can reach upwards of 300 wpm. Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U7AFutd9Gos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=U7AFutd9Gos</a>. I tried to do this but it took too much time to learn.')
