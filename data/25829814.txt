Item(by='NortySpock', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611028342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25828653, text='&gt; the word &quot;insurrection&quot; means armed violent action in order to overtake the government<p>The mob I see here is clearly armed with liberated riot shields, flag poles, sticks and billy clubs, and pepper spray &#x2F; bear spray, and they are attempting to forcibly push their way into the congress building via mass mob shoving.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cJOgGsC0G9U?t=748" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cJOgGsC0G9U?t=748</a> (30 minutes, probably NSFW) timestamp links to a coup attempt participant deploying bear spray against the police.<p>I would call that an armed violent action, if unorganized. Could they have overtaken the government (congress)? Maybe with a bit more time, weapons, violence or energy, yes.<p>&gt; It is literally impossible to change result of the election by jumping on a desk in a Congress.<p>And if the coup attempt participants had managed to take 20 or more congresspeople hostage and beaten them with sticks until they passed a law that made Trump&#x27;s term in office infinitely long? Sure, it wouldn&#x27;t pass the sniff test or the Supreme Court, but it would be an attempt to overthrow the functioning of government.<p>You can&#x27;t say it &quot;wasn&#x27;t an attempt&quot; because they didn&#x27;t succeed. I can say it was an attempt because a mob broke into the congress building, with some of the members intent on forcibly stopping the election results from being accepted (as has been seen in other arrested individuals and those who had zip tie cuffs).')
