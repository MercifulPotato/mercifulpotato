I work on a team at the moment with one of the most dogmatic developers I’ve ever met, and when challenged his rationale for any decision is “20 years of experience”.<p>He was recently asked to fix a rather simple bug in a C# project, a language he doesn’t use very often, but he was certain this would be an easy task for him. The project used a small amount of unmanaged resources, and he just couldn’t figure out how the ‘using’ keyword worked. He spent a few days trying to get to the bottom of ‘using’ before demanding to be sent on a C# course, which everybody thought was a great idea because it would keep him busy for a while. Maybe he’ll have “21 years of experience” by the time he gets around to fixing this bug.')
