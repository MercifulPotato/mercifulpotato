So it might make sense and be fair, to make rich childless people without kids pay a bigger penalty for that choice than poorer people.<p>So far so boring.<p>But let&#x27;s flip our perspective now:<p>Take the childless case as the baseline and instead talk in terms of getting tax allowance for having kids.<p>Now we can argue that rich people shouldn&#x27;t get a bigger tax allowance for having kids.  That wouldn&#x27;t be fair!  At most they should get the same tax allowance as poor people, or perhaps even a smaller one.<p>If you step back a bit, you see that talking about a tax allowance or a tax penalty are just two faces of the same coin depending on what you see as the baseline.<p>Just talking about some nebulous fairness let&#x27;s you argue for either approach.<p>So you need to supply some extra information to actually make a decision.')
