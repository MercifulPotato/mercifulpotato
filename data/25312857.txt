So they don&#x27;t purchase &quot;like everyone else&quot;.<p>I am not in China but in Japan, and I&#x27;m tired of seeing second-class clones of US companies that strongly win the local market just because they are localized.<p>Only with translating their websites, western companies would be able to win a lot of the market. And if they can also localize it, then it&#x27;s a lot better. But if they do neither, as long as there is <i>some</i> sort of local alternative, your software is dead on the water.')
