We manage to be perfectly civil to each other.<p>And my reputation does not follow between groups either. I can even have completely distinct friend groups for different activities. Nobody at boxing class knows anybody I work with and the people that hang out with me at a bar can be a completely new set all over. I could even use different names in all these groups! :O<p>Yet we&#x27;re all perfectly civil.<p>The same works online. I choose to use `swizec` everywhere, but is `ralston3` the same as `@r_ralston3` on twitter? Who knows. Does it matter? Not in the least. Look at us being perfectly fine fellows to each other.<p>On the other hand, you have to show government ID to walk into a bar and yet people are kicked out for bad behavior all the time.')
