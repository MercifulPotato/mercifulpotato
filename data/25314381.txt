Even amongst those anti Google and broadly in support of her, there&#x27;s no whole agreement with all of what Timmit says; the assertion of her story, the reasons why and the conclusions.<p>that a. She was fired b. That she was fired because of sexism and racism and c. That all research at Google is pointless and should stop until reform.<p>On Twitter there is more vocal support, but here and Reddit even on those most critical of Google and behind Timmit, there&#x27;s no entire agreement with her. There are comments supporting some parts but none supporting all, none agreeing with the Google Walkout document. Comments pointing out holes with official explanations but not supporting the conclusions.<p>Why is this? I find it odd, I would expect more unequivocal solidarity seen with less public visibility.')
