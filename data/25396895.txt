If they did they wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied with token gestures, but do radical changes to the society&#x2F;workplace&#x2F;lifestyle (some of that kind, like reduced flights, WFH, etc., came as a result of COVID, but would have been met with huge uproar by the general population on environmental grounds).<p>&gt;<i>it is made to last like a &quot;normal&quot; headphone and all of the software (ahem, computational audio) stuff can be achieved with any normal computer or smartphone where most people already have and use it as the audio source.</i><p>Technically, not really, as it depends on embedded microphones, movement sensors, and such.<p>It&#x27;s not just the &quot;3d sound&quot; experience of yore, which was solely processed and encoded as a regular audio stream.')
