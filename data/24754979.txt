The solution is the same as the author found:  don&#x27;t keep Exception objects around past the actual lifetime of the exception.<p>An Exception has the traceback, and the traceback has all the frames of the call stack, and each frame has a reference to the local variables in that frame.<p>Keeping an Exception around past its time can yield a huge tangle of circular references that puts a <i>lot</i> of pressure on the GC.<p>I reduced memory utilization dramatically by deleting 1 line of code.')
