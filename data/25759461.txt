Blood runs from the cow across the road to the other side. It&#x27;s not broad daylight there, it&#x27;s pitch black where the trail of the blood ends. The sky, the street, everything.\nHe says almost every African from smaller areas knows these experiences.<p>In the West, such things are horror stories. Another friend kind of jokingly said it might be „due to radiation, which affects the crazy energies of nature“ in the west. That‘s why we don‘t have these sightings.<p>I know, no scientific contribution, but finally the possibility to share this story in a proper forum.<p>Because what makes me think: my friend is smart, not crazy and told it very convincingly.\nAt least in such a way that I believe that he has seen it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it real, I know, but kind of scary for a European.<p>In corners of South America without infrastructure I have also experienced very strange situations and felt the darkest energies, had the weirdest encounters and strangest hallucinations...<p>Anyways, i am glad that for me, these are just stories. I don‘t want to be the guy that has one of those encounters and then has to either forget about it or fight for his credibility.')
