Completely reasonable question.<p>Not everyone has the same needs.  So UBI either has to be so high that everyone can have a basic standard of living (e.g. a nurse for a disabled person) or you retain a plethora of other social programs to address those needs.<p>And I always ask - what about the drug addict that blows through their whole UBI on day 2?  What then?  Let them starve in the street?  Of course not, there will be a separate social program for them as well.')
