Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24878145, 24878661], score=None, time=1603532587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24875533, text='Windows has a built in &quot;project&quot; functionality where you can use any other windows device as a secondary screen - not only it&#x27;s super easy to use(press win+p, select the device, done) it&#x27;s also very very smooth, and the other device appears as a native secondary screen in all settings panels.<p>The only limitation here is that it&#x27;s WiFi only, and only on devices with an Intel CPU as it&#x27;s using Miracast underneath. But I use a Â£29 Tesco tablet with a crappy Atom CPU for this and it&#x27;s fantastic as a portable secondary screen that works without any cables and literally takes 2 seconds to set up.')
