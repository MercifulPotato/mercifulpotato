Companies generally settle when their legal fees for going to court would exceed the amount of the settlement.&quot;<p>I was going to write exactly this but didn&#x27;t because it seemed too obvious to do so. The plaintiff ALSO has legal costs if they go for a ruling. This is why I said a settlement is usually considered a victory. If both parties already agree on the outcome then going trough the legal procedure is a waste of time and money. Only if sandmann&#x27;s lawyers didn&#x27;t agree on the settlement money then it would be advantageous to push for a ruling. Hence this could be considered &#x27;winning&#x27; the suit even though there is no such thing on courts. only rulings(Ex, in favor of) and paying the legal fees of the other party.')
