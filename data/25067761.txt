I will make an issue now and seriously consider it. Investigations begin!<p>Also, an update on the binaries. I just pushed a new set of binaries, and tested the linux and windows ones worked. Hopefully that should resolve the binary issues people were having, but I&#x27;m pretty scared some people will still have issues. If you do, please report them, ideally as an issue.')
