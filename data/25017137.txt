As far as I&#x27;m aware the latter is completely false, and the former is generally thought to be mostly false as well (though Nixon was certainly racist).  This myth seems to have started with the alleged John Ehrlichman quote from &#x27;94 - it&#x27;s not generally given much credence.<p>I look forward to your reply')
