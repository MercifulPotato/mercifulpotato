Anyone surprised by violence from Trump supporters have not been paying attention for the last four years. All the warning signs have been there. You&#x27;ve got documented evidence of Trump and his followers setting small fires for four years and half the country shouting &quot;HEY WE&#x27;VE GOT A FIRE!&quot; suddenly people are surprised that the building is burning down around them?
