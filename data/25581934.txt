Teams is very far from perfect but Slack is worse in my opinion because it just seems to have been designed from the start with the goal of disrupting your productivity. It feels like I&#x27;m fighting a constant uphill battle - mute this, unsubscribe from that etc etc. - I guess the main reason why Teams doesn&#x27;t feel as much &quot;noisy&quot; is the fact that it&#x27;s based around the idea of teams - as the name suggests.')
