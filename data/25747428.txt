Wondering if anyone can reinforce my opinion or counter it.<p>Drag and drop still seems like a mess.  Browser support and touch support varies so you can&#x27;t just use native APIs.  Every popular library sits with tons of open issues and open PRs.  Corporate solutions that have been open sourced appear abandoned.  All the libraries I saw clocked in over 100kb.<p>Am I wrong?  I want the &quot;preact&quot; or &quot;day.js&quot; drag and drop library.  10kb or less poly fill that gives me the basics.  Does that exist?')
