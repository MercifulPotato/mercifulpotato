This predicts an additional depth channel using CNNs which you can then use to create some sense of 3D by translating the image elements differently based on depth when rotating the camera a limited amount. However you won&#x27;t be able to e.g. inspect the backside of the object or model things like cavities using this approach. It&#x27;s more like a heightmap or relief.<p>With nerfs you get an actual volume representation with a mapping from every point in 3d space to whether it&#x27;s inside a volume or not. It&#x27;s an actual 3d model instead of a 2d image with a depth channel.')
