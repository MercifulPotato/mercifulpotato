Adding too many people too early actually slows things down. But, of course, I&#x27;m biased.<p>The thing about this getting to production next year is that we&#x27;re doing it in our cloud, which is a services based system where we can bring all sorts of operational tooling to bear. Out of band backups, usage of cloud native services, shadow serving, red&#x2F;green deploys, and all sorts of things. Basically, it&#x27;s easier to deploy a service to production once you&#x27;ve built a suite of operational tools to make it possible to do reliably while testing under production workloads that don&#x27;t actually face the customer.<p>As for us rewriting the core of the database, that&#x27;s true. But I think you&#x27;re unrealistic about what the data systems look like in closed source SaaS providers as they advance through orders of magnitude of scale. Hint: they rewrite and redo their systems.<p>As for Grafna, MetricsTank was their first, Cortex wasn&#x27;t developed there, and Loki and Tempo look like interesting projects.<p>None of those things has the exact same goal as InfluxDB. And InfluxDB isn&#x27;t meant to be open source DataDog. That&#x27;s not our thing. We want to be a platform for building time series applications across many use cases, some of which might be modern observability. It also doesn&#x27;t preclude you from pairing InfluxDB with those other tools.')
