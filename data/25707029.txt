It is not unreasonable for people spending time researching and writing an article to get compensated for that effort. Ads is one way of getting compensation. Another is to use something like medium. Medium also gives much better exposure than something like a personal blog.<p>As someone who has written personal blog for 20 years I can tell you medium has made a huge difference. I have switched to doing the bulk of my writing there. It gives better reach and allows you to get compensated for the effort.')
