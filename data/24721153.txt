You don&#x27;t need an &quot;extension loading framework&quot; on Vulkan (you might be confusing something like volk with that), since the loader is standardized, and a lot of the extensions are for very minor things or IHV moon-shot ideas, or are rolled into the maintenance extension.<p>Vulkan has a lot of faults, but this is such a weird complaint.')
