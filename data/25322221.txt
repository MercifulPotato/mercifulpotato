It&#x27;s meant to show you the catalog of episodes twice: once for the like ratio over time (at the top of the chart) and once for the views over time (bottom).<p>&gt; The blue banner below Screen Time looked like a footer to me, so I assumed that&#x27;s where the page ended<p>Really great point, updated the copy on this one - thanks!<p>&gt; The &quot;Search for a different episode&quot; under Episode Similarity doesn&#x27;t seem to be working<p>You&#x27;re right, that was a pretty obvious bug I should&#x27;ve caught.
