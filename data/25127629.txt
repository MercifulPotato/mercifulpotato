I&#x27;ll watch them say it for another 10 years.<p>Yes, Bitcoin has problems. The transaction fees are pretty high. Transactions are slow as molasses. It&#x27;s value fluctuates wildly. But I don&#x27;t care because I only really use it on large transactions online.<p>Bitcoin is great for me because it takes me 1 click to send money to anybody else who uses it. If I send a transaction with a decent fee I know 100% it&#x27;s going to go through. It won&#x27;t get blocked by my bank for fraud. The government will have no idea I sent the transaction (Bitcoin isn&#x27;t 100% anon but it&#x27;s more anon than most other systems). The other party also knows that once the transaction is confirmed, I won&#x27;t be able to dispute it.<p>I&#x27;m also 100% confident that my money is mine alone. Nobody is able to freeze my funds. You can&#x27;t take my Bitcoin even if you rob my house.<p>It&#x27;s the confidence combined by the guarantees that gives Bitcoin so much value to me.')
