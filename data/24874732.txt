People are prosecuted for it quite frequently.<p>&quot;An agreement between two or more people to commit an illegal act, along with an intent to achieve the agreement&#x27;s goal.&quot;[1]<p>If the wars in the middle east, (I would say Iraq moreso than Afghanistan, as at least Afghanistan actually harbored Al Qaeda&#x2F;Taliban), don&#x27;t count as a textbook definition of conspiracy, I&#x27;m afraid nothing does. Indeed, I would even disagree with the statement about the DoS (a subsection of the government), their entire job is supposed to be diplomacy, not war, thats what DoD is for. This is why I strongly disagree with the now common knowledge among those in the realm, that intelligence agencies embed and use DoS as cover so frequently, as it undermines diplomatic initiatives heavily. As for dismissing something as &quot;something Britta said on community&quot;, it isn&#x27;t even worth addressing.<p>&quot;What happened on 9&#x2F;11 is that we didn&#x27;t have a strategy, we didn&#x27;t have bipartisan agreement, we didn&#x27;t have American understanding of it, and we had instead a policy coup in this country, a coup, a policy coup. Some hard-nose people took over the direction of American policy and they never bothered to inform the rest of us. Whether you&#x27;re a Democrat or a Republican, if you&#x27;re an American you ought to be concerned about the strategy of the United States in this region. What is our aim? What is our purpose? Why are we there? Why are Americans dying in this region? That is the issue.&quot; - General Wesley Clark<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;conspiracy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;conspiracy</a>')
