Item(by='Zenst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603722949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894604, text='&quot;opinion pieces&quot; nailed it there and sadly that is what journalism has become and fuelled these so called `culture wars`, it&#x27;s as if they create the issue to report about - which given the bulk of content in the Guardian (other newspapers just as guilty and maybe more so), I find somewhat farcical.<p>I miss the days when all the facts was reported, instead it is opinions that are slanted one side or another to market to the social media rabbles of the moment.  In effect social media like twitter has becomes the REUTER&#x2F;news wire source of news and opinions are treated as news today.<p>But in a world in which problems are ignored until some celeb parrots them, one can only cry at the loss of real investigative journalists who are drowned out by a sea of bandwagon opinion pile-ons.')
