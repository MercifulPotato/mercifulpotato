No major planetary development models predicted them. The current best explanation for them is they formed much further out from their parent stars and migrated inward. The migration phenomena is still poorly understood, it wasn&#x27;t on anyone&#x27;s radar in the 70s and 80s.<p>So until Hot Jupiters were discovered they were not predicted. No one even thought to look for them. No one was thinking about Hot Jupiter detectors that just didn&#x27;t get funding.<p>Had billions of dollars flowed into astronomy instead of particle accelerators exoplanets (of all types) might have been discovered earlier. Then again they may not have. It&#x27;s a pointless &quot;what if&quot;.')
