Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605848676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149206, text='I would also like to add that Youtube have relatively recently removed OPML output (which can be used for an RSS feed). This is after they also removed emails for the channels you press the &quot;bell icon&quot;. If they do not bring back the RSS feed I&#x27;m leaving. I do not want to spend time on their dark-pattern user interface wasting time.<p>Between this and not paying creators because of some &quot;glitch&quot;, showing ads on videos that the creator cannot get paid for (if that be because they don&#x27;t have &quot;enough&quot; followers or because they got the yellow checkmark), the bullshit preferential treatment of news agencies I could not care less about, becoming the arbiter of truth with &quot;fact checking&quot;, randomly deleting channels, zero customer feedback or recourse with a human - the list goes on.<p>These days, if I want to watch somebody like EEVBlog I can just go to BitChute or Library. Content creators and users are fed up.')
