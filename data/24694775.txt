I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it was an after the fact change; I&#x27;ve observed that HN admins never let &quot;X Y.Z Released&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s New In X Y.Z&quot; headlines stand but change them to &quot;X Y.Z&quot; or even just &quot;X&quot; almost immediately.<p>It&#x27;s a strange HN-ism that puzzles me - &quot;OK, what&#x27;s so important about Foo 3.14?&quot; There is a rule that is (barely IMO) on point though in the posting guidelines you linked to:<p>&gt; <i>If the title begins with a number or number + gratuitous adjective, we&#x27;d appreciate it if you&#x27;d crop it. E.g. translate &quot;10 Ways To Do X&quot; to &quot;How To Do X,&quot; and &quot;14 Amazing Ys&quot; to &quot;Ys.&quot; Exception: when the number is meaningful, e.g. &quot;The 5 Platonic Solids.&quot;</i>')
