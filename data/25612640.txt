I can see that they probably wanted to be able to skip writing 2&#x2F;3 language CDKs out of the box, and DSLs probably hit on the need for simplicity really early, but infrastructure code is somewhere you really want to be able to drop into the full expressive power of a programming language.<p>I use Pulumi[0] for my projects, and while I doubt people will be able to get it as much adoption as I think it should have in corporate environments, Terraform has introduced the CDK[1] which is a similar approach. Have a talk with your engineers about complexity (and how not to strangle the rest of the team with it) and stop using DSLs in places you need more expressive power.<p>I think a good indication of when you need to stop using DSLs or when you should maybe realize a DSL wasn&#x27;t the right way to go is when you start doing things like writing control flow. You could can get away with DSLs if you were using s-expressions, but that is an exception that proves the rule (because there happens to a family of languages that treat s-expressions as syntax).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pulumi.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pulumi.com</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hashicorp.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cdk-for-terraform-enabling-python-and-typescript-support" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hashicorp.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cdk-for-terraform-enabling-py...</a>')
