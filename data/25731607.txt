It actually doesn&#x27;t in practice as tons of people use do notation and state monads. The more people use do notation, the more they are embracing side effects. Literally I&#x27;ve seen haskell code where all function definitions had some form of do notation which is basically against the claim made by this article.<p>To push side effects to the edge you have to only use do notation and monads when you absolutely have no choice.')
