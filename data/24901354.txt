Most people who get tired and disillusioned dont belong to any &quot;Language&#x2F;Framework evangelism task force&quot;. They just want some stability, substance over form, hate silly hype, hate self-proclaimed gurus, hate clueless HR managers. Give them a solid set of tools (no matter much which), sane working conditions, sane managers, a reasonable development strategy and they will more than happily come back. Cut back the ageism and leave political activism for the after-job hours, that will help too.')
