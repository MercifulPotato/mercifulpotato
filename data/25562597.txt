The rest of what you said stood entirely without them.<p>Can you say what value those phrases added other than to just undermine the person you were responding to as a way of establishing your interpretation as ‘correct’?<p>I see I’ve been flagged for asking if you were gaslighting, but frankly the comment I was replying to fell foul of the site guidelines too.<p>Perhaps I should have just flagged it, but my sense is that it wasn’t enough to warrant that.<p>You can interpret the question about ‘gaslighting’ as some great insult, or you can take it as real observation about a toxic conversational gambit that it seems like you unintentionally engaged in.<p>Your choice.')
