Are those people employees? They might be.<p>There are approx 700 cities for uber according to a random google search, lets say 10 people work at each center.  That&#x27;s 7000 employees alone.  Then you have all the support staff, people who have to manage cities and so on.  Uber is not a pure software business like twitter or FB is, they need a lot of &#x27;retail&#x27; staff like apple does.')
