People were invited to share content, to aggregate, to link, and relink. 99% of the people reading this now, who learned to code on the Web, learned by copying other people&#x27;s code snippets, and not paying them a dime. Scraping content isn&#x27;t a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. View Source is a the primary feature of published Web content. Content scraping with transformation, is fair use, and a feature.<p>IMHO, if you publish something on the web, and you don&#x27;t have a paywall, and you don&#x27;t block in robots.txt, and you don&#x27;t have a LICENSE that covers use, people are free to link to your content. Otherwise, why even participate in the web when you don&#x27;t want to be part of it (the linking).<p>If people start charging for links, you may as well pack up the open web.<p>If there was an federated free search engine, like bitcoin-like for search, these news publishers would still be in trouble, and they&#x27;d have no one go after, which suggests the problem is fundamentally, something with their business model.')
