But it defeats the point of building a forward-secret system.<p>Think of it like this: if I&#x27;m an attacker that breaks into the forward-secret chat app on your device, and you have kept a perfect record of every conversation you&#x27;ve ever had using that crypto system in _the same place you keep your identity keys_, then does it really matter whether the messaging system was &quot;protected&quot; by a forward-secret system? You might as well just have scrapped all that complexity and had non-forward-secure messages if you want to keep a perfect, eternal record of your conversations.<p>I actually think the Keybase guys did a great job at this. They have non-forward-secure chats by default (so that you never lose chat history), but exploding messages (which delete themselves after a short time by design) are forward-secret, since then it actually makes a difference.<p>I suppose it depends on your &quot;threat model...&quot; How do you want to use your chat system?')
