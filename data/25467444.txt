And for a long time too. (I’ve been given different durations for the challenge period, but they were all at least 3 weeks long when I last investigated this.) This is why I’ve never done the test.<p>Random tip: if you accidentally expose yourself to gluten, taking Benadryl right away can help with the flu-y sort of inflammatory symptoms. You’ll still get the gastric distress, but you might not feel like you have the flu for the next week, which for me is the worst part.')
