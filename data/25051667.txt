On the other hand it has been obvious since .Net Core 1.0 that this is where the future is going to be.<p>All announcements before .Net 5 has been clear on the compatibility issues and preparations required, for a couple of years now.<p>Whoever haven’t been planning this migration can thank themselves.<p>Calling what is effectively .Net Core 4.0 for simply “.Net 5.0” is just a way to make it <i>completely obvious</i>, even to those not paying attention, that .Net Framework 4.8 is now superseded, and that the upgrade path <i>is</i> .Net (Core). There’s no other option around the corner. Get with the times. Etc.')
