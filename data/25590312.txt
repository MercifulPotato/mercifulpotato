It&#x27;s not intuitive or the way it&#x27;s taught.<p>&gt; Lots of Python programmers don&#x27;t use comments or descriptive variable names either.<p>You have to have variable names in Python. If you want to give them shitty names, that&#x27;s your bag, but unlike Excel, it&#x27;s not an extra step.<p>You also have to deal with the fact that every cell in a range has its own unique formula. It&#x27;s like you have a special function for each and every cell. You have nice conveniences for it like copy&#x2F; paste and dragging, but ultimately you are copying formulas all over the place. And it&#x27;s super easy to update all but one of those when you make a change.<p>Yes, you can create custom functions, but much like named ranges, it&#x27;s not the default behavior, takes extra steps, and it isn&#x27;t the way Excel is taught.<p>Spreadsheets are amazing for small to moderately complex things, but beyond a certain point, they are just an unmanageable mess regardless of who creates them.')
