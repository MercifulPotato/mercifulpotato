But what’s forgotten is the massively complex “stack”, if you will, that brings everything together. Just saying “oh this billion dollar company is terrible!” Is being lazy and doesn’t contribute to a solution, all it does it make people feel entitled and validated because it doesn’t take much real thought.<p>The real problem at root is human&#x2F;consumer behavior. Turning a logo into a fitting evil character borrowed from childhood cartoon narratives is not real.<p>Thanks for taking the time to write this up.')
