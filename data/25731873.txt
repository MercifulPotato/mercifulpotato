Rust doesn&#x27;t have subtyping in general for this and other reasons, but lifetimes do have subtyping. I am sure this would get ugly.<p>Correct. Haskell is the only language I know of with globally decidable type inference, and uses the similar hindley-milner method as Rust... but no doubt some of Rust&#x27;s language features can break global inference. In Haskell, many common language extensions can also break global inference.<p>I think if Haskell was written today they probably wouldn&#x27;t pick global inference as a goal, Haskell &quot;best practice&quot; types the function boundaries in the same way that Rust enforces.')
