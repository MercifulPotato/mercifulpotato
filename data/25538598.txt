If you build a Windows desktop with compatible components, it mostly works fine. If you install SW from parties who don’t have adequate expertise or quality control in place, you will start experiencing weird behavior. This is because Windows let’s the installed apps&#x2F;drivers do a lot.<p>Windows 10s should fix some of these issues by restricting what the SW can do and what SW one can install to the machine they own, but not everyone wants to be restricted like this.')
