Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[24838061], score=None, time=1603203822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834937, text='For ideal scenes that fit completely in GPU memory and use hardware meshes and hardware texture filtering and GPU shading, rendering on a GPU is often in the range of 10x to 100x faster than CPU (as reported by the people writing production renderers today). Since production scenes are commonly larger than GPU ram and even CPU ram too, it complicates things. Embree is a renderer and OptiX isn’t, so they can’t be directly compared, but I think it’s fair to say that OptiX based renderers are typically significantly faster for ideal scenes that fit in memory and use hardware supported primitives, while there are cases where Embree has some huge advantages, like scenes that don’t fit in memory, and Embree has oriented bounding boxes that can make some kinds of scene geometry render much faster.')
