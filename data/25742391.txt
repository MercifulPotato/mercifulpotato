Now why cry over balkanization of the internet when that is what was pushed for by the leftists in these Big Tech companies? What do you think would happen if Big Tech kept censoring something it did not like? You would obviously have a reaction to it. I view the Polish laws as a reaction to the ridiculous ideological censorship stance taken by the Big Tech. First polarize the population, then cry why opposing laws are being framed that shatters your idea of what internet should be. I won&#x27;t be surprised if many other countries follow the same path. Those who experienced censorship know it first hand what it&#x27;s like. Looking at you being shocked at this legislation just shows how wide the split is. That one bubble is completely oblivious to what the other bubble is experiencing.')
