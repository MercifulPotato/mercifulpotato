Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601768149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674840, text='&gt; This sums up how I feel about the whole tiktok&#x2F;huawei thing as a European. An interesting part of it not mentioned in the article is how the USA also pressures European countries into applying the same rules.<p>The US has a treaty obligation to protect (most) European countries militarily, particularly from Russia but to a lesser extent from China and other countries in Asia. This is a partnership of course, and America&#x27;s European friends contribute, but the bulk is still borne by the US for obvious reasons (gigantic military budget, global deployment, desire to preserve peace between France, Germany and the rest of the continent).<p>All of that is to say, for better or worse, the US feels that it can apply pressure. Brussels may not like it, but Washington knows Europe will choose America to Putin&#x27;s Russia or Communist China most of the time.')
