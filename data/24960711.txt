Violence like when the Trump supporters held parades, shops were looted, people were beaten, buildings were burnt, and police were assaulted? So much so that shops boarded themselves days before the parades? Violence like protesters threatening &quot;burn the system down&quot; or &quot;there is going to be a war&quot; if they lose election?<p>Or violence like Hollywood actors and actresses openly discussing beheading or assassinating the most evil orange man, or politicians openly discussing how they wanted to snap Republican supporters, and how BLMs and Antifa chanted that they wanted to kill the police?<p>Of course there are extreme and crazy people in all spectrums, but where are the right except a few marginalized small groups?<p>Oh wait, I’m wrong. Anyone who disagree with the left is far right, right? So Shapiro should be beaten in Berkeley. Mayor Wheeler’s apartment can be stormed. Anyone carrying our flag can be sucker punched?<p>Yes, half of the nation is far right right and they threaten violence.')
