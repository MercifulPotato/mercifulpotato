Like you can literally tell the caste of a person from their surname. Its insane that no ruling part had the guts to ban that.<p>A large parts of population in South Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala no longer have surnames that are tied to the caste. Mostly because of the people deciding to do that by themselves. But the issue is very very bad in Northern states which is where the majority of the population lives.')
