However I guess the person who &quot;never looks into a newspaper&quot; remains informed through people who do read it at least from time to time. I would wonder <i>why</i> &quot;Europe is now at war&quot;, even if it&#x27;s speculation, since that sort of thing is often highly subjective (see: Armenia and Azerbaijan right now).
