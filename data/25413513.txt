I am puzzled that there are so many comments saying it does not.<p>I did a 20% project 2 years ago. My goal was to get into a new area of the company since my then current role was not going anywhere. I worked 20% on the new role and 80% on my existing role, so no extra hours required.<p>I worked on a project that ultimately failed, but I got to know enough people in the new domain that I was able to find a project to join in that area. So as far as I&#x27;m concerned 20% is a great (and ongoing) thing about Google, even if it does not lead directly to new products.')
