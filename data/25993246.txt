Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app\n2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.\n3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controllers.\n4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games.<p>Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#x27;t understand why Google doesn&#x27;t push this.')
