Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app<p>2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.<p>3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controller.<p>4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games and explicitly explain you don&#x27;t need a xbox&#x2F;playstation to play these games.<p>5. Buy out Witcher 3&#x2F;Call of Duty 4&#x2F;Project Cars 2&#x2F;other older games and make them free for TVs with Stadia bundles.<p>Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#x27;t understand why Google doesn&#x27;t push this.<p>Fiddling with my phone to play Stadia on my TV is pretty crumple some. It&#x27;s just too much work for normal folks. People just want to turn on the TV and start playing.<p>Edit: I guess monopolistic abuse is a concern. However Sony and MS have their own streaming services. Google can just advertise &#x27;play games with Stadia and Playstation Now and Xbox Cloud on your TV!&#x27; I am 100% if players switch to playing games on TV without game consoles, it hurts MS&#x2F;Sony a lot more than to Google.')
