Might even be the only reasonable part of the story!<p>Imagine you were in charge of such a galaxy-spanning organization, encompassing multiple worlds, species, and cultures. Needless to say, communication in general and naming things in particular would be quite the challenge.<p>Literal names and clarity are probably the primary things you want to really value there.<p>Particularly if you&#x27;re in charge of saying &quot;hello&quot; to a new species (humans, in this case) who are likely to find the experience a bit overwhelming. There&#x27;s more than enough new information for them to absorb, right? Keep things as simple as possible.<p>Yeah, &quot;Galactic Federation&quot; sounds about right.')
