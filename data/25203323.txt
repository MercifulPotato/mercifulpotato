And you need to care about a lot of metrics and outcomes to make that you are successful as measured by those metrics, or that it doesn&#x27;t look like you are responsible for the failure.<p>Just doing a great job doesn&#x27;t cut it.  No client ever really wants on day 90 what they signed up for on day 1.  For most clients the person who is signing your checks, the person you work with on a day to day basis, and the people who will be using your apps will be different people. They will all have different ideas of what success and failure are, and they all have other people they are responsible to. And all of these tensions need to be managed successfully, and this involves a ton of BS that is completely unrelated to what a na√Øve engineer would describe as &quot;delivering value&quot;.<p>In a normal job your boss is usually your friend, and looks bad if he throws you under the bus.  This is not the same for a lot of consulting engagements where people are highly motived to blame their failures on you.')
