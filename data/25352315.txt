I don&#x27;t agree with anyone branding this as done for purely technical reasons.  Having CentOS Stream may be needed for technical reasons.  Stopping CentOS 8 is in no way a technical decision.  They are unrelated in any technical sense.<p>If Red Hat just doesn&#x27;t want to put resources towards CentOS as it traditionally existed anymore, that&#x27;s their option, but they deserve any flak they get for taking over an open source project just to extinguish it, since CentOS is in no way really needs to be linked to their Stream product.  They could just as easily called it RHEL Stream and said it&#x27;s free, and it would be a less confusing and more direct funnel of people that want RHEL stability into RHEL subscriptions.  Using the CentOS name is just a mind-share grab and screwing over an open source community.  They control it so can do it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not going to call them out for doing so.')
