OpenShift&#x2F;Kubernetes Secrets mounted into the Pod at runtime.<p>2.  Hashicorp Vault (has a really well designed API.  It&#x27;s very usable just with curl, which makes using it a joy)<p>3.  Sealed Secrets (less experience here but it&#x27;s looking positive right now) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitnami-labs&#x2F;sealed-secrets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitnami-labs&#x2F;sealed-secrets</a><p>If you&#x27;re using a different PaaS besides OpenShift, it may also offer options worth considering (although do think about portability.  These days apps move platforms every few years on average, though I think that may be changing now that K8s is becoming the standard).')
