Conservative projection at its finest, combined with a little cherry picked racism as well. Great job! You represent your kind well. I&#x27;m not a Republican so I don&#x27;t deny actual facts.<p>Even if your numbers were up to date and accurate, which they aren&#x27;t (get out of your bubble, Fox boy) the causes are tied to much more than race so it&#x27;s a meaningless number designed only to incite racial hatred. Good job again!<p>To repeat: Fear and ignorance. Which you just gave us a great example of.<p>Also, to the other HNers. It&#x27;s election season, so enjoy the &quot;overly political&quot; comments for a while.')
