If they are not the cheapest, then you buy from elsewhere... which still isn&#x27;t the USA.<p>But that&#x27;s still good. It provides for supply chain diversity even if it isn&#x27;t in the US. Now you can buy from China and Mexico instead of only China.<p>Then you get a functional supply chain operating in Mexico, which has geographical proximity to the US and has greater overlap in language and culture, and you&#x27;re one step closer to manufacturing in Arizona and Texas.<p>&gt; And then China does the same thing: retaliating with tariffs, and then buying goods from elsewhere, which isn&#x27;t the USA either.<p>But the US has a 3:1 trade imbalance with China, so we can use a third of the money to cancel out their tariffs on our stuff. Or threaten to raise ours 33% if they don&#x27;t stop.<p>The US has leverage here, but only if they use it.<p>&gt; And, anecdotally: I still buy products from china.<p>Manufacturing left the US over the course of 50 years. It isn&#x27;t going to all come back in less than 5 years. We&#x27;re talking about long-term here.')
