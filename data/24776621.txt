I&#x27;ve always thought macros were neat. Coming from Rust, macros like `vec!` make the language age a lot cleaner and easier to read.<p>The issue with adding them to Python is that Python is already clean and easy to read (for the most part). They point out Python&#x27;s simplicity being one of it&#x27;s biggest strengths, and I think macros will help add to the clutter on top of Python. I also just don&#x27;t think we need them in Python. All of the examples they gave were underwhelming and seemed like they didn&#x27;t offer a really good way to convince people that this is a worth while feature.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see how things play out. If it gets approved and implemented, I assume that they&#x27;ve found good uses for it.')
