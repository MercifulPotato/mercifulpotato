Some random subjective comments based on my experience:<p>- it was hard work<p>- there was no way I could have passed these interviews without all the work.<p>- my past experience and education barely helped me for the interview<p>- it&#x27;s not enough to be able to solve the problems, you need to be able to solve them on the spot, without much thinking, in an interview context<p>- I passed system design quite easily, even though I have little real-life experience with these systems. It would have been easy for interviewer to catch me off guard on real-life technical details, but they didn&#x27;t care<p>- these companies (FB and Google) gave me a chance (even several ones), even though my resume is slightly atypical, and I&#x27;m on the older side (mid forties)<p>- Recruiters and interviewers were friendly and respectful. Overall they gave me a very good impression of these companies<p>- The whole process is very random<p>- I did learn some things while practicing. Not the best use of my time, but not totally lost either<p>- Algorithmic questions were harder at Google compared to Facebook<p>- The whole process was more fluid at FB (team-matching at google took forever, I was even ghosted by a recruiter after she told me I passed).')
