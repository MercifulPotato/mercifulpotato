So I had not only disinterest but some reluctance to make sure I stayed disinterested.<p>In late 2017, I grudgingly promised a sibling to piece some of our extended family history together. In 2018 I found a lost sister on Ancestry. And then I found a cousin who pointed me to my last surviving aunt (who I visited in 2019 and who passed 6 weeks ago). I also reunited with another lost sister. The sisters and I talk most days.<p>By the end of this year I will have added about 10k names in Family Search and 15k-20k in Ancestry (w&#x2F; much overlapping).
