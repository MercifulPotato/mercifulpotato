The human brain can&#x27;t function at max threat level over time, and more and more people are chafing at the correct (but impractical and toothless) policies.<p>I feel like those type of good value decisions are hampered by the lack of federal response. A cohesive &quot;wear your mask&quot;, massive PPE manufacturing mobilization,  and benefits would have really driven home the seriousness of the situation and provided people the tools to weather the storm. Bars are open because owners don&#x27;t have many other options to support themselves. If the government provided support, that would surely reduce the overall amount of places where masks and social distancing aren&#x27;t enforced, which in turn would allow for better enforcement of existing policies. All this results in a negative feedback cycle where the reduced cases improve contact tracing, reduce waits for tests, etc.')
