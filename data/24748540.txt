I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case. In fact I&#x27;ve been driving my bike daily to work for 13 years, and never been hit from behind by a car. I&#x27;ve had a few close calls and they&#x27;ve always been on intersections with cars coming from the front turning left or from the sides. So velocity and acceleration are not important when sharing the road. Vehicles of different kinds have always shared the road without any problem. If you encounter a vehicle slower than you, you just need to slow down, adapt your speed and pass if safely to do so. It&#x27;s that easy.  By the way, those countries already had cyclists before they kicked them off the roads. Do they have more now or less? Also how do cyclists interact with other cyclists? don&#x27;t they have to follow any rules either? don&#x27;t they need any skills?')
