That makes it more like - reject the transaction if it would move the account balance below zero, unless the account has a flag to allow overdrafts (which is over on the accounts table), in which case we allow the transaction and also enter another transaction for the overdraft fee.<p>Probably need some more rules like max overdraft amount, max number of transactions etc. I&#x27;ve heard some places may also have the &quot;let&#x27;s be jerks&quot; rule to reorder transactions to hit overdraft as soon as possible to maximize fees.')
