I also went to work for a software&#x2F;hardware company which had tight, open office desks, hardware everywhere, no remote options, longer hours, stressful deadlines, etc. I knew I made the wrong decision during my orientation. I choose option 3, which was was stick it out for two years. Ironically by the time 2 years was up, I was in a much happier state. I had just become used to the situation.
