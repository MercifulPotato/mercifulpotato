Item(by='disgrunt', descendants=None, kids=[25693722], score=None, time=1610146396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25690509, text='The first thing that happens is the ballot is separated from the envelope. This is to protect the secrecy of the voter&#x27;s choice. What is supposed to happen is that the signature on the envelope is matched with one on file (usually with the DMV or equivalent), but this rule was relaxed in Georgia in March 2020. This is the only point in the process where a mailed in absentee ballot can be verified. After this point it becomes a &quot;naked ballot&quot; and is not tied to the voter&#x27;s identity [0]<p>So to summarize: the only verification method was a name and a signature and the signature verification was rendered useless as a result of relaxed rule changes. Not that a signature verification is a reliable verification method, but this means the only verification mechanism in place other than a voter registration lookup was effectively removed. This means you could have voted absentee on someone else&#x27;s behalf as long as a) you knew their name and that they were a registered voter, and b) could scribble on an envelope.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;technology&#x2F;georgia-recount-signature-match.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;technology&#x2F;georgia-recoun...</a>')
