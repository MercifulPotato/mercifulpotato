Also, some non-MVP features are almost stable, e.g. atomics are now enabled on chrome by default IIRC.<p>WASI, the posix-like system interface ABI, is still technically a &quot;snapshot&quot;, which has made me slightly concerned wrt stability given that Rust can compile to WASI even on the stable channel, but hopefully even the full stable version is backwards-compatible with snapshot-1.')
