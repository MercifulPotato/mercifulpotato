Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=[25680632], score=None, time=1610068195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679621, text='&gt; for not letting people pass who signal they intend to.<p>That&#x27;s not what you get ticketed for. As long as you&#x27;re overtaking the cars in the lane to your right at a reasonable speed, you can stay in your lane. If there is a gap between cars that you can safely enter, <i>then</i> you have to move to the right. There is a duty to let people pass if you&#x27;re driving very slowly, but this is meant for a tractor driving 15 km&#x2F;h, not for someone driving 5 under the speed limit.<p>Especially if there are two lanes, no speed limit, the right lane has heavy truck traffic going 80 and you&#x27;re going 130, the Ferrari has to wait until you&#x27;re done overtaking, even if that takes you until the end of the no-speedlimit section. And if the Ferrari gets pushy (e.g. honking&#x2F;high-beams), they are risking not just a ticket but criminal prosecution (on top of any penalties for violating the minimum safe distance).')
