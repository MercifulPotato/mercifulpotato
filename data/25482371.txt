She would routinely total up the cost of the exec&#x27;s outfits and jewelry&#x2F;shoes&#x2F;purse and also always be measuring herself against everyone else in the meeting room.  Who hadn&#x27;t brushed their hair, who had recently gotten teeth whitening treatments, she even noticed when one of the directors got a facelift over work from home.  She was able to point out his facelift scars via a screenshot she took.<p>She ended up getting let go for creating a &quot;mean girl&quot; culture when she iced out some new hires.<p>It just seemed like a very dystopian way to view our coworkers.  I prefer to see everyone as a potential friend and not look for flaws.')
