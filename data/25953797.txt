Personally, after several rounds of disappointment with bluetooth mice, the only thing I use bluetooth for is handsfree calling and sometimes music in cars. Even that sometimes doesn&#x27;t work (my spouse&#x27;s Nokia 7.2 couldn&#x27;t connect to her car between July and December, because something in the Nokia firmware was broken; worked fine with my car though).<p>So, my guess is nobody who works on OpenBSD a lot cares about bluetooth on OpenBSD, because they&#x27;re not using bluetooth much, and don&#x27;t see any use cases for it that would help them.')
