Item(by='roywiggins', descendants=None, kids=[24740736], score=None, time=1602351575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740154, text='It&#x27;s not like the shoes are going out the door without them knowing that the same person just ordered three pairs in different sizes and is almost certainly going to be returning two of them.<p>It&#x27;s simply not possible to be sure about a shoe size sight unseen. Even within the same brand of shoe, fit varies. I have to assume a very high returns rate is totally expected by online shoe retailers (and for that matter offline ones).')
