Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610891014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810397, text='&gt; Consider that the parent who berates his child for smoking marihuana to be part of his clique will the next day consume alcohol at his office party, as to not be left out.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is good example. I dont want my kids to drink alcohol yet. When I do drink alcohol, it is really not so that &quot;I am not left out&quot;. Pretty much all office parties I have been at had bunch of people who were not drinking in them.<p>And marihuana has added effect of being illegal in many places.<p>And if your kid is smoking it so that the kid fits, it absolutely makes sense to treat it as issue. Regardless of whether you sometimes drink alcohol at office party.')
