I’ve seen similar patterns with (to pick a recent example) shared front end component libraries. You make something more general at the expense of increasing complexity, if you have a team dedicated to that more complex proposition and enough consumers of that system you might well benefit at an org level. but if you don’t it’s easy to get caught up supporting that complexity at greater cost in time and effort than a less general solution would require. It’s a tricky call')
