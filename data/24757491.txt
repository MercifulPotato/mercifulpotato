That if people aren&#x27;t making enough of an &quot;effort&quot; in some way, that their critiques should not be taken seriously? Maybe you&#x27;re serious, but it sure sounds like an extreme moving of goal posts to me. Presumably I would then link to you some activist group or other pushing to change these laws -- I expect you&#x27;d then come back with some variation of &quot;oh well, that&#x27;s not really trying &#x2F;hard enough&#x2F;, look at all the &#x2F;other things&#x2F; they care about more.&quot; Just... very strange.<p>If you don&#x27;t think sticking your neck out as a prominent intellectual like Chomsky or Hitchens to defend neo-nazi&#x27;s right to lie in the public square.. if you don&#x27;t think that constitutes a &quot;serious effort&quot; in and of itself, then YES I guess you can go further and look at Human Rights Watch&#x27;s statements or whatever else.<p>I doubt you will. But maybe other readers of this exchange will leave better for reading my comment here.')
