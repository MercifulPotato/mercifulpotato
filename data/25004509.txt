If you&#x27;re afraid of your vehicle being unexpectedly totaled, you can insure it! Similarly, you can buy health insurance to insure you against the scenario you&#x27;re so worried about. It&#x27;s an unheard of idea, I know. And even better, the extra 30+% of your paycheck that you don&#x27;t have to pay in tax, you can use that to pay for your health insurance.')
