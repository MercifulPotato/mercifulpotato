(Russ describes himself as a &#x27;classical liberal&#x27; rather than as a Conservative.) Though originally primarily focused on economics, the show&#x27;s topics have become increasingly diverse in recent years. Russ&#x27; conversations with people he disagrees with are his best in my opinion and are always respectful and edifying.')
