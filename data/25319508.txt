This article was written clearly out of a self-righteous desire of the author to declare his own morality, and the result is that he ends up looking like he would be okay with <i>controlling</i> the users of whatever he builds.<p>So, as usual for people who make that claim I quoted, he fails to see how his own approach has clearly made <i>him</i> an example of his own words.<p>&gt; [Unrestricted speech in the internet is worse than] criminal activities, terrorism and child pornography<p>Not a good start if the first implication is &quot;online agitators&quot; belonging to the fringe and extremes are somehow worse than actual crimes.<p>They aren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; All these extreme ideas have divided societies and increased social tensions. And they’re responsible for a number of acts of terrorism which caused the death of too many people.<p>This is pretty damning, in that those extreme believes he listed before this are far from the only ideas increasing tensions and leading to terrorism.<p>The more one reads, the more obvious it becomes—as seemingly always happens with defenses of censorship—that his problem is not so much with &quot;unfiltered speech in the internet&quot;, but unfiltered speech in the internet <i>that he disagrees with</i>.<p>&gt; It won’t be because of my help.<p>And here I feel lies the root of the problem, at least in its modern form, and what often causes good intentions to pave the road to hell nowadays: <i>Some</i> people are no longer content with merely having &quot;opinions&quot;; they need to have &quot;stances&quot; now.')
