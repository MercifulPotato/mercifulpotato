Some torn ballots also have both checkmarks and rectangles filled. It seem highly unusual that someone would fill the rectangle for all the categories and then come back and put checkmarks?<p>If someone accidentally put checkmarks instead of filling the rectangles. Then why would they come chose a different answer next time? As seen in the video where for many torn ballots one box is filled while other is checkmarked. [Sorry a picture would be helpful but you&#x27;ll have to go therough the video manually]<p>My asserion is this: the provision for discarding a spoiled ballots was exploited and valid ballots were marked with checkmarks in order for them to be discarded.<p>You can also see from the long tails of the checkmarks that the person doing it was doing it quickly.<p>Also if it was spoiled ballot why were there only mostly Trump ballots? If you think it was a a staged video, we can certainly contact the poster&#x27;s instagram and ask him about his intentions.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CHY19zygjJw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CHY19zygjJw&#x2F;</a><p>_________________________________________________________<p>Regarding the Georgia video, the only thing the article says it that it was not a &quot;suitcase&quot; but a ballot box. Which doesn&#x27;t dispute the fact that the ballot-box or &quot;the suitcase&quot; was pulled from under the table and then the ballots were counted after the poll watches were told to leave.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=avh-kOYfaOs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=avh-kOYfaOs</a>')
