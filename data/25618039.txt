To start the day with clear goals, etc) question list self served at night.<p>A score of “10” on eating well might mean one thing while on PTO and another on a busy travel day where simply not grabbing the king size snickers at the airport convenience store is a massive win. So it’s relative to your ability and to the environment and to where you are that particular day.<p>I personally paid a young teen to call&#x2F;text me daily with the question list for about a year and tremendously enjoyed it (as in benefited from it).<p>But sorry to agree with you by jamming another system in :)')
