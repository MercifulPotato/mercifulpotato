Item(by='acover', descendants=None, kids=[25952850, 25952768, 25952716], score=None, time=1611885692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952241, text='&gt; A substantial amount of trades in the market are executed by liquidity providers that provide efficient two-sided \nmarkets. These important trading firms trade on both sides of the market and are largely risk flat at the end of the \nday. Real-time settlement would require these liquidity providers to have significant sums of capital and securities \non hand to make trade-for-trade deliveries. \nThe current infrastructure relies on the efficiencies of trade netting to accommodate substantial amounts of trades. \nWholesale market-making is important to the infrastructure as it provides the capital and balance sheets to back \ncustomer trading. Significantly increasing those capital requirements by requiring pre-funding of all trades without the \nbenefit of recognizing the offsetting trades would substantially increase the costs of trade execution to the end user. \nReal-time settlement could also introduce operational inefficiencies. In a typical low-volatility trading day, NSCC \nand DTC process over one million shares per second on average, valued at over $16 million. During peak trading \nhours, such as market open and close, this number spikes to over 300 million shares per second, valued at over \n$25 billion. Settling these amounts throughout the day in real-time would introduce substantial financial and \noperational risks to the equity markets. \nAccelerated settlement that abandons the significant capital and operational efficiencies gained through \ncentralized multilateral netting would be a step backward for the worldâ€™s most liquid markets. Striking a balance \nbetween the capital efficiencies of netting and the risk mitigation benefits of moving settlement closer to trade date \nshould be the goal of the industry.<p>Thanks!
