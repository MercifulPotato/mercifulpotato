For example the compiler which generates native code for various processors is written in Common Lisp. A lot of code can be written from Common Lisp, which calls external OS routines via Foreign Function Calls. Thus there is not much C-based glue code needed.<p>In GNU Emacs the execution engine running the byte code is written C. The byte code compiler is written in Emacs Lisp.')
