If personalised ads stand to lose 60% of their value, why not switch to contextual ads?<p>Google is mainly contextual ads, with some personalisation mixed in I&#x27;d assume. If you&#x27;re already on Facebooks platforms they know who you are, they have access to all the personal information that can be extracted from your Facebook account and activity. Shouldn&#x27;t that be enough?<p>What I read this as, is that Facebooks own data isn&#x27;t actually that good, and they need data from source that aren&#x27;t Facebook in order to provide value to their ads platform. It&#x27;s the same issue every time Facebook complains about regulation or increased desire for privacy, they always end up in a situation where they devalue their own products and technology.')
