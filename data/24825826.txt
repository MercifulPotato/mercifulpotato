I&#x27;ve enjoyed many of his interviews. It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s a more stoic version of Joe Rogan.<p>Some of his guests, however, are a very bad choice. In particular I am thinking of Eric Weinstein who has been on TWICE. Weinstein is a master-class bullshtter, who opines on his theory of everything yet has NOTHING to show for it. He also manages to pull in politics, academia, culture, and the kitchen sink, all obfuscated by turgid rhetoric.')
