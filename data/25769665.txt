The big tech industrial complex has infinitely more control over our thoughts and proclivities than any previous power center.<p>Nope. Huge swaths of the democratic party are opposed to these SV companies because they see Twitter, FB, etc, as having played a huge part in Trump gaining the influence he did and the conspiracy nutjobs evangelizing their craziness as well.<p>I expect pushes for regulation, just a different sort than Trump would&#x27;ve pushed for.<p>Here we have people dying because a President who was afraid of losing spent months preemptively setting up a fraud excuse. An excuse that was enabled and amplified by social media platforms that also helped people spread conspiracies about the supposed non-existence of a global pandemic, and thus the need for different behaviors.<p>Even if you end up saying Trump himself shouldn&#x27;t have been banned, you have a huge echo chamber problem that has now passed the point where we can dismiss it with stuff like &quot;they just need to feel heard.&quot; Lots of people listened, and it led to lots of violence, and is the way we&#x27;re currently (not) regulating social media sufficient?<p>All of these nutjob theories have gotten MORE prevalent in the past 4 years DESPITE their candidate winning the 2016 election and DESPITE their candidate completely failing to expose any national pedophile conspiracy or any of the other nonsense they spout... The ultimate influence of the big social media platforms has been anything but left-leaning.')
