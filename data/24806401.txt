Name a single programming language and someone will have something bad to say about it. I think C# is fantastic, and I bet someone, somewhere will thrash on it despite it being quite a powerful and rich language. Heck, I can pick on things about C# I don&#x27;t like, but fortunately they seem to be aiming towards partially addressing those.<p>I think C++ is not inherently completely bad, the usual thing is &quot;do it the right way&quot; which is usually some spec the community has drafted up with arguments why certain styles or code decisions are bad and what their better alternatives are and why. In the face of Python we have PEP-8 for example.<p>C++ makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot with a shotgun, and that means you need to think a little more about your approach and ensure you know what you&#x27;re doing to begin with.')
