Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606235091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25199587, text='I mildly like Garfield.<p>Never particularly cared for Calvin and Hobbes (always found it somewhat preachy, tacky, and emotionally kitch, the &quot;I think we&#x27;ve learned something today&quot;, going-for-the-feels type), though the writer is nonetheless very talented (and a lot of its strips are great).<p>The post also mentions the New Yorker cartoons. Never cared for them either, not because I &quot;missed the joke&quot;, but because I dislike their faux-high-brow attitude to humor, given that the content is more often than not trite observations about society.<p>I also like lots of webcomic strips (Cyanide and Hapiness, Dinosaur Comics, SMBC, The Parking Lot is Full, etc), and comics like Gosciny, Mafalda, Mortadelo y Filemon, and so on, besides &quot;serious&quot; comics.')
