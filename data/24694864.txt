If you catch a disease while the mask is off, then when you put the mask back on you&#x27;re breathing your own shedding back into different parts of your respiratory tract.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s been shown that surgical masks don&#x27;t do that much even in surgical settings: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4480558&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4480558&#x2F;</a>')
