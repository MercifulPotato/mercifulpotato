Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609118945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25555566, text='&gt;I am currently going through the Fall of Civilizations series [0] which I highly recommend.<p>Thanks for the recommendation. I&#x27;ll check it out.<p>&gt;The central point of your original comment was that there is extensive historical information available connecting us to our past but one has to put in the effort to discover it. You provided links to support your point.<p>That was <i>one</i> point I was attempting to make.  I further wanted to make it clear that such resources are more available to more people than they ever have been.<p>However, the <i>central</i> point I was attempting (apparently unsuccessfully, in your case) to make was that history is not, and never has been, all that important to most people, that our media and culture <i>actively</i> discourage any interest in history; and that feeling a &quot;disconnect&quot; from history is neither unusual nor a recent development.<p>Again, I appreciate your feedback, as I already know what I think and <i>want</i> to say, but (obviously) don&#x27;t know how others will interpret what I <i>do</i> say.<p>Edit: Clarified several points.')
