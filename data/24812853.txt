And the section about it was at best loosely tied to the rest of the article. The article would have been just as good, and possibly better, if that entire section was simply removed. It&#x27;s addition took what was otherwise a quite decent article and made it feel like they were trying too hard to hook people in with a clever gimmick of a title.')
