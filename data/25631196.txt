I am <i>sure</i> that I am very unusual, but to this day I very much prefer not to grant execute permissions to ever page I read.  JavaScript is a huge security&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;performance hole, and is simply not needed for displaying lines of text and images, nor for accepting forms data.<p>It has some pros, too, but on the whole I really miss the mid-2000s Web and am not fond of all the web applications out there.')
