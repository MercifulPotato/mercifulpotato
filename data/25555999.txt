You and I have read the same post differently, and your attempt to villainize me as a gasligther is not something that should be accepted in polite conversation. Knock it off.<p>Furthermore, if you&#x27;re going to accuse someone of gaslighting, then do everyone the favor of actually paraphrasing their arguments correctly. It is <i>deeply</i> hypocritical to run around accusing others of gaslighting <i>while misrepresenting their arguments</i>.<p>&gt; You said: “GP’s argument wasn’t that the Scandinavian model is better”<p>What I <i>actually</i> said is that their main argument is that other countries are plainly run better. You can tell because that&#x27;s their first sentence. Yes, they point to Scandanavian countries <i>as an example</i>, but their core argument is that &quot;the US is more poorly run than other countries&quot;.<p>Furthermore, you can tell that their core argument isn&#x27;t about Scandanavia, because they spend most of their post talking about New Zealand.
