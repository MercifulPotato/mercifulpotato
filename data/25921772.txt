This often causes the browser to re-layout, re-render, and re-draw content. If you create a thousand elements in a loop that&#x27;s tons of extra work for the browser and blocks interactivity. You can do batch updates or non-display elements but it&#x27;s not (or at least wasn&#x27;t) built into jQuery. It&#x27;s faster but more complicated.<p>With React and the like they operate on a copy of the DOM and automatically batch updates to it. All of the changes are applied at once so there&#x27;s fewer layout, render, and draw events.<p>Part of the problem with jQuery is there&#x27;s a cohort of web &quot;developers&quot; that grew up with it. Instead of learning the actual web stack they learned jQuery. Everything is put together (slowly) with jQuery. Even if they&#x27;ve been promoted out of junior positions they&#x27;re not PMs or marketing drones requiring slow scripts because they&#x27;re written in a style they understand.')
