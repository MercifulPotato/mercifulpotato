Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25682823], score=None, time=1610082260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680641, text='&gt; China&#x27;s per capita emissions increased by 55% while those of the West have declined.<p>Well that&#x27;s because china was late to industrialization ( by 150 years ) has come from a low emission base. And even if ignore the fact that a significant chunk of china&#x27;s emissions are dedicated solely to manufacturing goods&#x2F;junk for the west, if we completely stopped all emissions, it would still take china many decades of emissions to catch up to the emission&#x27;s put out by the west the past 200 years or so.<p>&gt; China&#x27;s per capita emissions have risen from 5.25 tCO2&#x2F;capita in 2007 to 8.12t in 2019 while the UK&#x27;s have dropped to now just 5.45tCO2.<p>That&#x27;s deceptive since much of UK&#x27;s emissions was export to china via manufacturing. It&#x27;s like your roommate &quot;cleaning&quot; his room by dump his trash in your room.<p>Just by something as basic as &quot;standard of living&quot;, it&#x27;s a certainty that the west, and especially the UK, accounts for far more emissions on a per capita basis. It&#x27;s impossible that on a per capita basis, a brit has lower emission footprint that a chinese person, indian, african, etc.<p>Certainly, we aren&#x27;t any better here in the US. I remember watching a documentary that said that if everyone on earth lived like us, it would take like 5 additional earth&#x27;s resources.')
