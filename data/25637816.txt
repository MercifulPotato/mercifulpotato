Made artificially inefficient to compute to stop the evil governments and organizations which were apparently making life impossible before the existence of cryptocurrencies. Now it has become inevitability because its price is going up and therefore by induction it has become more valuable and necessary for the whole society.<p>With all the free money that is currently floating around bitcoin is again slowly moving towards its saturation point where the pool of potential buyers is exhausted and the prices have become unsustainably high. The psychology of the market will reverse causing a &quot;run on the bank&quot; (which apparently is a good thing by some gold standard advocates in this thread) and it will again sink like a stone without anything to stop its fall. A good thing to remember is that bitcoin has yet to face a real depression akin to dotcom bubble. If and when it falls to levels so unfathomably low that it would incur losses so heavy that would shake the whole industry to its core, then it might forever lose its status as a digital store of value which price increases forever to infinity.<p>One thing I must say and what most people forget is that bitcoin is also a form of gambling and which actually explains some of its success. It has the characteristics of a sport which is fun to discuss, interesting to research and easy to bet on with a lot of volatility that can be as addicting as gambling in a casino. Can we explain why gambling or sports are so addicting or necessary to the whole society? We humans are emotional creatures that believe in the most silliest of things that defy normal logic yet which we can not unravel like the people living in a cave in Plato&#x27;s allegory. God is dead said Nietzsche and therefore we are constantly seeking something &quot;valuable&quot; to cling onto.')
