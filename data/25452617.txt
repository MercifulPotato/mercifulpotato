But, at least relative to the way I think and learn, I <i>really</i> want to quickly be able to do three or four things when learning a new language: sequence, selection, iteration, and console I&#x2F;O.  Once I can do that, I can write essentially any arbitrary program. And then I can start adding onto my knowledge and learning the more interesting ways of doing things.<p>Maybe I&#x27;d have a different perspective if I&#x27;d learned Lisp first, instead of having 20+ years of programming in Algol derived languages under my belt first. But I do feel uncomfortable spending days and weeks with a language and not even learning how do use (their version of) a for loop or whatever.')
