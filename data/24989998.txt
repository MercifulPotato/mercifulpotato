He is explicitly saying the problems predate even the disputed 2000&#x27;s cycle.<p>His point stripped of the vitriol is the trust in the system is eroded when there is substantial delays in declaring the result.<p>It is important in a fragile democracy to declare the results without delay, it is also why countries like Brazil do it fast.<p>Sadly America is a fragile democracy today, the sitting President inability to commit to peaceful transfer of power , prematurely claiming victory, trying to stop counting , or constant attacks on the integrity of the election and fraudulent votes , if it is any other country you would agree without question.<p>It is by design that each state has heterogeneous voting system ,  However while nation thinks it votes for the president it is just voting a guidance to their legislature on who the electors should be,there is no constitutional protection otherwise.  Just this election 15$&#x2F;hour minimum wage and other policy items have been passed by same people who have voted for trump , clearly policy is not deciding factor to elect the president.<p>It is important to align the system to what people think they are voting for,')
