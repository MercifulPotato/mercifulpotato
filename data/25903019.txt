Item(by='eqvinox', descendants=None, kids=[25903328], score=None, time=1611582394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901891, text='&gt; For an actual Thunderbolt display (contrasted to the DisplayPort alternate mode), the sole DisplayPort controller shouldn&#x27;t be a limitation, as render offscreen + DMA to the device would work just fine in that case.<p>No, that&#x27;s not how this is implemented.  The difference between a Thunderbolt display and a DP-alt-mode display is that the TB one decodes the additional DP-in-TB layer to get at the DisplayPort data.  And since it does TB to do that, it can (but doesn&#x27;t have to) implement PCIe &amp; USB functions too.<p>TB displays do <i>not</i> implement a PCIe endpoint for the actual display contents and don&#x27;t have any DMA capability.  The DisplayPort stream is <i>wrapped</i> inside TB packets (with some empty bits being left out, e.g. H&#x2F;Vblank); the Display (or TB dock&#x2F;hub) just decodes the packets back into DisplayPort.<p>... which means the host needs to be able to encode a particular number of DP streams into the TB connection, and depending on the silicon and its connections this may only be 1 stream.  The only way around that would be with DisplayPort MST support, since that&#x27;s only one GFX-&gt;TB stream for DP :)<p>Thunderbolt essentially transports 3 kinds of packets over its connection:<p><pre><code>  - TB native packets (bit of a FireWire followup, kinda)\n  - PCIe packets\n  - DisplayPort packets</code></pre>')
