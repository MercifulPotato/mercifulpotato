Have you considered having community supplied component library? Also have you considered premium elements that are richly documented? The official Apple docs are poor so it would definitely be worth a premium to get access. \nThe vast majority of iOS development is the same stuff over and over with slightly different colours or backgrounds or effects. If you could get navigation, onboarding&#x2F;login&#x2F;password reset screens, maps, api queries bound to components, you’d have 80% of the app and developers could instead focus  on the critical bits that add real business value. I’ll definitely follow your project.')
