Thus my assertion that I&#x27;m free to the extent I am aware of how my environment and society affects me.  Though that&#x27;s not a complete definition, as we&#x27;ve discussed the issue of not just soft power, but also hard constraints.<p>One wrinkle is that some advertisements aren&#x27;t only manipulation, but information as well.  They&#x27;re freedom-reducing to the extent they undetectably manipulate, but freedom-increasing to the extent the provide information that allows more choices!<p>Further, the protagonist in our story has new choices that aren&#x27;t options in our society today.  It&#x27;s not clear that the protagonist has a net-negative freedom experience, compared with today.')
