But didn&#x27;t that bring along the capability to form coalitions?<p>If we dismantled NATO what framework would a wide western coalition, as was deployed in Libya rely on?<p>Can you magically make distinct militaries of different counties coordinate logistics and operations together?<p>My point is that, besides the mutual defense agreement, NATO coordinates training and integration of capabilities across borders, without which I doubt we launch coalitions as we did in Libya or Kosovo.<p>Both of these followed a UN resolution. In Libya there were participation from non-NATO members, yet these coalitions were NATO-led, why? Probably because NATO was the only organization with experience, training and infrastructure to coordinate such a coalition.')
