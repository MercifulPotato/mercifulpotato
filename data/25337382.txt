I thought you were questioning the existence of free-wheeling culture in CA.<p>As to why CA, I don&#x27;t think there is any one reason. The weather and geography are huge. It was a lightly populated state in the 1950s, so real estate was much cheaper than on the heavily populated east coast (big for both start ups and &#x27;artistic&#x27; types). And the gold rush mentality is&#x2F;was pervasive, which I personally think leads to a government and culture that is generally supportive of start ups and small businesses. While CA has a reputation for being unfriendly to businesses, the taxes and regulations are largely targeting big businesses. So that leaves more room for small start ups to compete.')
