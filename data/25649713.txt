Creative work is <i>original.</i> You can build on previous ideas - or not, it&#x27;s up to you - but it&#x27;s nothing at all like gluing together a bunch of frameworks that someone else created and patting yourself on the head for being a true original.<p>I&#x27;ll accept that copyright is bad when developers who hate copyright give <i>all</i> of their work away for free - code, consultancy, equity, all of it.<p>Until then people earning six figures a year telling artists they should work for nothing - or perhaps some begging on Patreon which might cover the rent (but probably won&#x27;t) - is insultingly naive and unattractively entitled.<p>This has nothing to do with academic journals, which are a very special and obnoxious example of rent-seeking and which absolutely should be replaced by open access - not least because the work has already been paid for by the public.<p>But that shouldn&#x27;t be confused with the creative arts, where new work <i>isn&#x27;t</i> funded by the public. In fact it isn&#x27;t usually funded by anyone at all, except the artist.<p>If you want creators to work for free, you&#x27;ll get what you pay for - which will be somewhere in the uncanny valley between nothing at all, and disposable filler of no real interest.')
