Item(by='Uninen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609546240, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604671, text='I remember reading Fireplace Delusion by Sam Harris [1] (it&#x27;s about religion, but uses the fireplace as an analogy of harmful thing that people in some sense know that is harmful but still keep enjoying and using) a long time ago and have been thinking the harmfulness of burning wood ever since. It&#x27;s weird how hard it is to take news like this in even though it&#x27;s backed by actual science. I just <i>like</i> the smell and the type of the warmness that a wood stove (or a fireplace) creates and would use them instead of electric stove or heaters when given a chance.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure people can&#x27;t be cured of brain bugs like this after some age or some degree of conditioning (in the sense of &quot;it&#x27;s always been like this and I don&#x27;t want to change&quot;). Hopefully the next generation is raised better based on new data and will be smarter than us. (Or at least me.)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samharris.org&#x2F;the-fireplace-delusion&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samharris.org&#x2F;the-fireplace-delusion&#x2F;</a>')
