Not just to some spy agencies, but just to normal police. It&#x27;s heavily used against opposition leaders as well as some entrepreneurs. \nSo there is literally tens of thousands of people who can leak phone billing information to anyone.<p>As for passport data there is tons of points of leakage too since Russia have well-centralised online government services and tons of people have user-access to these databases. E.g people in police, medical services, education, tax departments, local government, etc.<p>And obviously salary of most people with such access is well below $1000 &#x2F; month after taxes so they are happy to sell any information for few hundred dollars. Imagine it: all spy agency staff profiles don&#x27;t have &quot;TOP SECRET. PLEASE DON&#x27;T LEAK THIS&quot; warning on it,')
