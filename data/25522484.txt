Weirdly it seems to load fine and I can scroll the content for a second or two while its still loading in. Then it puts up an error dialog and I can&#x27;t access the content any more. Once thats happened if I reload the page the error dialog comes up immediately and the page doesn&#x27;t bother loading behind it.<p>I&#x27;m on firefox on MacOS too, and it happens with my ad blocker on or off. Chrome works fine. The support document linked in the error explicitly says only chrome and safari are supported on macos. I&#x27;m confused why my grandparent comment has been downvoted - this is a real bug report stopping me (and maybe others) from reading documentation that looks to have a lot of thought put into it. And given the content seemed to be loading fine before the error message came up, well, it feels forced.')
