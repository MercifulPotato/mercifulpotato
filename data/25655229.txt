I&#x27;d love a world where all tech documentation is open, but there are competitors etc etc.<p>Apple is a remarkably focused company with a lot of experiments that never see the light of day. They don&#x27;t sell their chips or motherboards to anyone else.<p>Qualcomm&#x2F;Broadcom etc exist to make their chips for other companies to use and still getting real documentation from them is often not possible unless you are a giant OEM, commit to millions in orders and sign lots of NDAs.<p>Apple&#x27;s not only created a pretty great integrated CPU&#x2F;GPU and nearly seamlessly transitioned CPU platforms (AGAIN!) but they are at the very beginning of this roadmap.<p>I&#x27;d LOVE them to empower&#x2F;support Linux on Apple Silicon (as they seem to be saying they will for Microsoft) but I expect a generation of two of chips before things solidify&#x2F;stabilize enough for them to open up the platform.<p>And, it&#x27;s not like this is something within their business model or is going to give much value back to them.<p>Lots of people say Apple &quot;Needs&quot; to do whatever... Clearly they don&#x27;t as they seem to be surviving OK doing things how they want.')
