GPUs are my specialty, and much of my professional work has been in Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA<p>But AVX-512 is a real step forward, if you look at the price&#x2F;performance ratio for real-world workloads. So AVX-512 is the focus of NN-512<p>GPU cloud compute is almost unbelievably expensive. Even Linode charges $1000 per month, or $1.50 per hour (look at the GPU plans: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#row--compute" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#row--compute</a>). It&#x27;s really hard to keep that GPU saturated, which is what you need to do to get your money&#x27;s worth<p>An AVX-512 Skylake-X cloud compute instance costs $10 per CPU-core per month, or 2 cents per hour, at Vultr (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vultr.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;cloud-compute&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vultr.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;cloud-compute&#x2F;</a>). It&#x27;s easy to saturate that core<p>Think about it this way: a GPU is really just a cluster of SIMD units with fast memory. A GPU thread variable is just like a SIMD lane, and a GPU warp variable is just like a SIMD vector register<p>Nvidia&#x27;s SIMD pseudo-instructions are called PTX and they are like a 1024-bit version of AVX-512. An AVX-512 core is like a general purpose CPU with a 512-bit GPU core built in<p>So paying for a single AVX-512 core is like paying for part of a GPU (16 threads), plus the general purpose compute you need to keep that GPU part supplied with work')
