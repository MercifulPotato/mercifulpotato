Attacking them on those grounds is part of a campaign by the oil companies to make you and I fight people who are not the root cause of the problem. Don’t be taken in by it. A small number of large companies are responsible for the vast majority of omissions, and even many rich individuals changing their behavior have no impact on that.')
