In a tight election in a few states swung by a few counties, “widespread” has never been a requirement.<p>Anyone can be forgiven for doubting the integrity of our election process in the face of worrying anecdote. The answer isn’t to call for blind faith by ignoring the red flags, but to shore up the process and improve its systemic integrity.<p>What would your standard be if this concerned the finances of your own company? You wouldn’t be telling the organization to not worry and ignore warning signs.<p>Some states eliminated witness signature requirements on absentee ballots; some states allowed new votes with no postmark up to a week after the election; videos showing the eviction of poll watchers, political placards posted at the entry of polling places; a “reporting error” with an extra zero corrected only after being called on it, software “glitches” resulting in 3000-vote over-count in one county corrected only after being challenged; a box of ballots produced after Election Day, 100% of whose contents went to one candidate; counting paused in the middle of the night. None of it helped by being refereed by a media plurality that clearly wanted a specific outcome all year.<p>There’s enough widespread questionable anecdote to warrant a top to bottom audit, which nobody can afford.<p>Every time the media (trusted by the public less than Catholic priests and politicians, btw) says there’s “no evidence of widespread fraud” in the face of this, it  doesn’t help - it only raises another red flag.<p>And this isn’t just the Presidential election, btw.<p>That we are incapable of building and executing a process with inherent integrity is getting increasingly risky&#x2F;dangerous.')
