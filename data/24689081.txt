That&#x27;s awesome! What I would likely end up doing, though, is use that as the underlying representation but still return individual interval objects through the query API with a start and end date on each interval.<p>The article addresses that concept:<p>&gt; It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the constraints will still hold.')
