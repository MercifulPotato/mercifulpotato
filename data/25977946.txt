Surely an &quot;eventually consistent database&quot; can be built on top of XMPP? It&#x27;s just message passing.<p>When evaluating WhatsApp alternatives, this somewhat made me choose XMPP over Matrix. I recently uninstalled WhatsApp, Telegram and LINE (felt pretty good) and now use Conversations with most of my friends and family who were kind enough to try it out. Apparently Quicksy is free in the Google Play Store which is good news because nobody was willing to pay 2.50 EUR for Conversations and installing F-Droid just to install another app was quite a hurdle.')
