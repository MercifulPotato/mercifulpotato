They somehow manage to avoid annoying feature bloat and crapware. No nagging, no bullshit, they are actually creating features that improve workflows instead of features to tick boxes on corporate purchasing department meeting room flipcharts or buzzword bingo. Remarkable and I really hope they don&#x27;t get bought-and-killed by one of the giants. Or VCs wanting to &quot;make it more $marketing_buzzword&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve used NetBeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio, QtCreator etc. over the years and always used to pull my hair out over the mess. JetBrains IDEs are way ahead in UX, usability and working day-to-day, minute-to-minute. Nothing flashy, nothing overly marketed, just rock solid and great value.<p>Free educational license, no-brainer update management with the JetBrains toolbox, everything fits, doesn&#x27;t demand attention to itself and lets you concentrate on the work.')
