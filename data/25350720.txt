As the kernel is, IMHO <i>strongly</i> based on a microkernel design, the OS APIs presents itself as userspace APIs. They are in fact, defined by what the userspace implements. And there is a lot of freedom on how to implement this API.<p>The majority of microkernel based OSes just implement these APIs to emulate UNIX APIs and that IMHO is a waste of potential but understandable in order to be backward compatible and not have to develop whole new userspace applications from scratch.<p>But I really like Fuchsia&#x27;s take on the design of this userspace and the way the &#x27;capability security model&#x27; is integrated into it. The amount of APIs built into the base &#x27;Fuchsia platform&#x27; really blurs the line between and OS and a stack with OS plus essential services. Today, IMHO, things like automatic updates, software distribution, crash reports, and other low level application centric facilities should really be provided by the OS and that is done in the base Fuchsia platform.')
