Item(by='justinclift', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608607025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485225, text='&gt; ... main and large side quests as some of the best I have played over the last 20 years.<p>On that note, if you haven&#x27;t already played Horizon: Zero Dawn it&#x27;s very much worth trying out.<p>I&#x27;d just finished a marathon multi-day session start-&gt;finish with that, and it&#x27;s easily the best I&#x27;ve come across so far.<p>It&#x27;s not as huge and sprawling as Cyberpunk 2077, but it&#x27;s a fairly big open world and the writing is tight.  The side quests and story are probably the best I&#x27;ve (personally) yet seen. :)')
