Item(by='asiachick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608192670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453610, text='&gt; - I will not vendor lockin myself into some store &quot;Hey, buy xy monitor and you can only use software for it from xy store&quot;.<p>Steam VR games, the largest VR market, have no vendor lock in AFAIK<p>&gt; - I will not pay for the VR substantially more than good monitor (of normal size)<p>A Rift 2 is $300 right now. Many of the windows ones are also in the $300-$500 range. I don&#x27;t know what your range is. To me it would be unreasonable to limit the price to $100. I&#x27;ve bought monitors for $800, $1500, $4000, $200, $400.<p>&gt; - I will not pay extra for games that I have already bought as non VR<p>you don&#x27;t want non-VR games ported to VR. They suck<p>&gt; - I will absolutely not buy anything subscription based.<p>I know of no subscription based VR except porn and even though you&#x27;re paying for access to their libraries and you download unencrypted mp4s. Your subscription just gives you access to new content.<p>&gt; - I will never buy it from facebook (,google,...), I dont consider them a trustworthy company and I am not buying anything that is positioned in home from those.<p>Agreed though sadly, in my experience, they do have the best experience ATM (I know others disagree...) I hope that changes meaning I hope the experience elsewhere becomes better.<p>&gt; - While watching tv, playing playstation whole family can have fun, for the same price, not just one<p>Not sure what your point is here. you&#x27;re comparing apples to oranges. That&#x27;s like saying &quot;I&#x27;ll never buy a snowboard because my car carries 4 people&quot;')
