As an IC, if you&#x27;re talented and lucky, you&#x27;ll eventually stall at the &quot;senior coder&quot; at FANG level. That comes with a respectable salary of 500k&#x2F;year and a hard glass ceiling. At that point doing even more IC work won&#x27;t bring you any further. Most settle there, buy a house, start a family and continue doing their &quot;senior coder&quot; work till retirement. Nothing wrong with that.<p>There are two primary paths from that level: middle management and senior management. If you like the first, learn to speak well, work on your image and build the reputation of a responsible and reliable person who takes the rules seriously. You&#x27;ll get promoted and eventually you&#x27;ll stall at the &quot;director&quot; level.<p>The senior management path is about financial and personal risk. This is where you&#x27;ll need to build a successful side gig, turn it into a multi million dollar business and negotiate a senior manager position, with very nice compensation, with competitors who will try to take you down in the process. A lot more fun, more risk and a lot more reward.')
