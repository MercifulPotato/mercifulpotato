Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610156616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694278, text='The above poster does have an important point: Freedom from speech also includes freedom from compelled speech.<p>The things you listed entail selling materially defective good, and discrimination on the basis of race and gender. These are not examples of compelled speech. Here are some more applicable questions:<p>* Can the government force Hacker News not to flag and hide certain posts?<p>* And the government make a bookseller to stock certain types of books?<p>* Could Trump pass a law or executive order to make Twitter revoke his ban?<p>* Can the government official compel a newspaper to print certain content?<p>The last one was actually addressed in a Supreme Court ruling [1].<p>Freedom of speech includes freedom from compelled speech. It&#x27;s also against the law to tell a person or business to print or say something, or not ban certain content. Sure, if a business exclusively bans content based on the race of the poster they they could fall afoul of anti-discrimination laws. But note that it wasn&#x27;t the <i>content</i> of the speech that matters here, it is the discriminatory nature on the basis of race.<p>These protections don&#x27;t magically go away when a company grows to a certain size or number of users. Market share is relevant to things like anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior, but the people claiming that Facebook or Twitter have to run content because they&#x27;re big are incorrect.<p>The exceptions to protection from compelled speech are very narrow, like showing your passport at the border and nutrition labels on food or health warnings on cigarettes. They almost always have a direct and tangible safety or administrative justification. Furthermore, political speech is the <i>most</i> protected form of speech in the US by far. I would be astounded if we ever pass legislation compelling platforms like Facebook or Twitter to host content against their will.<p>I agree that the principles of inclusion and freedom of speech should be upheld by Facebook and Twitter, but I strongly disagree that they should be enforced by the government. I could see wisdom in making ISPs, payment providers, and DNS providers act like utilities and extend services to all lawful customers, but not at the application layer.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miami_Herald_Publishing_Co._v._Tornillo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Miami_Herald_Publishing_Co._v....</a>')
