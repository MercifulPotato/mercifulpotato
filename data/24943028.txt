I currently subscribe to: Youtube TV, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Prime and HBO MAX. I spend more on streaming services than I did on cable.<p>I&#x27;m not asking for them to lower their prices; I&#x27;m not even asking that they don&#x27;t raise their prices. I&#x27;m simply saying that when they raise the price it makes me think about the value proposition and I am reminded that I&#x27;m paying for far more content than I can possibly consume. That&#x27;s my fault and nobody else&#x27;s.<p>I don&#x27;t need a service that rotates my subscriptions as suggested above. Rather, if someone wants to create a service for cable cutters, I&#x27;d like a central place to curate what I like, what I&#x27;ve seen, what I&#x27;d like to see and know when that content becomes available. I agree that Apple does some of that, so does netflix, and HBO and some of the others... and I do use those features, but there is still an opportunity for someone to create a service that is centralized and provides more depth.<p>For example, I&#x27;d like to go a little deeper than a thumbs up&#x2F;down when rating Netflix content. I&#x27;d like to have more than one playlist on Apple, Prime, etc. I&#x27;d like to know when a hard to find movie&#x2F;show gets licensed and will be available on a streaming service, etc.<p>So, no... I don&#x27;t want to pay very little money for lots of content. I just want to rebalance what I do pay for to match what I have time to watch. No, I don&#x27;t want to spend very little time... I actually want to spend more time curating.')
