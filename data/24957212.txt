Mostly this means using &quot;foo == null&quot;, which works for both. Using undefined as a default convention is well and good, but trying to get to a place where you can guarantee it across a whole project is folly. I&#x27;ve personally seen the JSON case, in particular, result in some fairly pointless extra complexity converting all nulls to undefineds.')
