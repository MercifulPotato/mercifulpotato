Facebook wanted to shut it down and then looked for excuses. Violence, hate speech, etc. They would have found whatever they were looking for. This is pretty much the standard big tech M.O. No amount of calling for &quot;violence&quot; will shut down pages they like.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t this just incentivize political adversaries to join groups they don&#x27;t like and make threats just to have pages shut down?<p>Sadly, this is just going to add gasoline to the fire. It&#x27;s just going to antagonize and rile up these people more than anything.')
