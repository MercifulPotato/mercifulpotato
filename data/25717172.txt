If you have a convincing answer for it I&#x27;ll be glad to engage with you further. I say so because Twitter is hosted on AWS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;news&#x2F;twitter-signs-up-aws-for-its-cloud-needs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;news&#x2F;twitter-signs-up-aws-for-i...</a>)<p>If Amazon cannot kick Twitter out then I say that Big Tech is hypocritical and ideologically biased. Or that Twitter is a big paying customer and Amazon wouldn&#x27;t want to mess with the relationship it has with Twitter. You pick what is the excuse going to be.<p>---<p>Replying to your posts as edits because of rate limits *shrugs*<p>&gt; It was those images PLUS context, and you argue the context is they&#x27;re right leaning, and I argue the context is they refused to censor hate speech and ended up being a haven for it<p>Censor hate speech in low engagement content? Isn&#x27;t that the very reason you gave for why Twitter is not removing those hate speech filled posts? Because they are surprise, surprise <i>low engagement posts</i>.<p>So why bother? Why is Amazon going out of its way to remove Parler from AWS for low engagement posts? It is not like some high profile user with a large following asked for people to commit violence right? I am literally using your own justification for Parler too. Why is your justification for Twitter okay while not okay for Parler?<p>If Amazon had evidence of high engagement posts spreading violence in Parler it would have attached those images. Not images from low engagement posts. This just goes to show that Big Tech just doesn&#x27;t want Parler in there. That is all there is to it. It is an ideological battle. Else the same filth you find in right wing Parler you find in Twitter, Facebook and the rest of social media. There is literally no difference between any of these social platforms.')
