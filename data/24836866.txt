They have little incentive to try and find a job, frankly and many actively live with food stamps, housing subsidies, free healthcare, and just kinda bum around.<p>I will be very honest: this is a very unsubstantiated claim, even if you know personally 10-15 people who are just bumming around and living on benefits that is a very small portion of benefits claim in society and this kind of behaviour will always exist. Benefits fraud is a thing, the good that benefits and welfare does to a society are much larger than the impact of fraud.<p>Do you really believe that someone who lives with handouts from the government have very little incentive to get better? Do you believe that this almost less-than-baseline level of living is enough to make a significant portion of the populace unwilling to work? To the level where participation rate would become unfair? Have you ever lived on that lifestyle to check your assumption that they have &quot;very little incentive to try and find a job&quot;?')
