When the bean counters look at the line item that is free coffee and soda, they see a big old number to cut. But it causes the staff to have to run over to the coffee shops to grab the joe, taking a lot longer time than the break room commute. Meaning that management isn&#x27;t really thinking hard anymore. The talent notices this and starts to quietly put out the CV again, as they know that the company is going to go into stasis or downhill altogether without intelligent bosses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steveblank.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steveblank.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;12&#x2F;21&#x2F;the-elves-leave-middle-ear...</a>')
