Just doing whatever you want in a market does not make it a &quot;free market&quot;. If somebody can go and hold a gun to your head and thereby persuade you to give them your goods for free, that&#x27;s not a free market. A free market needs enforcement of rules of trade. And those rules include that you don&#x27;t damage other market participants without compensation. Be it a potential bullet to the head, the mentioned &quot;crap on the streets&quot;, or carbon emissions in the atmosphere.')
