The marginal utility of money for funding the basics of life diminishes as you move into the .1% of the income&#x2F;wealth distribution, which is the argument for taxing those people more.  The marginal utility for political power, however scales up with wealth, which is an even more compelling argument for strongly progressive taxation.')
