I have been programming for at least 15 years so maybe I felt some kind of kinship or relatability to what I was reading. Still, I thought I&#x27;d make a post here and ask for more.<p>How long have you been in tech?<p>In what capacity?<p>What are you doing now?<p>How has tech changed since you started?<p>If you could change tech today, what would you do?<p>What are some negatives and positives of the current tech landscape?<p>What advice do you have to give to others?<p>Or just chat about your experiences in general. I love reading them.')
