Lots of people just refused to go to work, or do outside things when the death toll started climbing in Italy, to the point it was all over the news.<p>Everyone knew it was a matter of time when it would hit NYC, and when it did, we were blind as there was no testing available to people unless you ended up in the ICU.<p>My soccer team just forfeited their mach, as team members did not feel safe to play while the virus was spreading. This was way before the lockdown in early march,<p>I stoped going to the gym too. People just didn&#x27;t feel safe, and even if things were open, people would just not go out.<p>Almost, all places were at about 30% capacity. In the long run, they&#x27;d still have failed.  People just wont&#x2F;don&#x27;t like to go out or travel.<p>You can still go in places like Albania, or Turkey, or Greece, who managed the virus&#x2F;had low levels of it, yet their tourism is not doing well at all as many folks don&#x27;t like risking it.')
