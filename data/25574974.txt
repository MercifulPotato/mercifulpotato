Item(by='Sodman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609275793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574254, text='Professional athletes, along with most people who work out 4+ days &#x2F; week, have their own more advanced&#x2F;expensive ways of determining their own personal weight and judging where they should be, factoring other measurements like muscle mass percentage. They also make up a very small percentage of the US population. For everyone else, it&#x27;s a decent approximation of weight.<p>As anecdata - I&#x27;m on the opposite end of the physical activity spectrum to Tom Brady, I&#x27;m also 6&#x27;4&quot; and the heaviest I&#x27;ve been is about ~210 lbs. I was definitely starting to feel &quot;a bit too big&quot; at that, and would confidently say I&#x27;d feel overweight at 225 lbs, so the scale doesn&#x27;t feel massively miscalibrated to me.')
