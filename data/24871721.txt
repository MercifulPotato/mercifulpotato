By the way, on a similar vein - I finally ditched QuickBooks &#x2F; Quicken &#x2F; all that crap and moved everything personally &amp; for my consulting company over to hledger (which is just a slightly fancy version of ledger).<p>Turns out, everything I hated about QuickBooks for all these years centered around its inability to bulk-edit transactions or categorize&#x2F;recategorize things en masse, leading to countless hours wasted clicking or, worse, those bulk journal entires to move things from one place to another (which forces you to follow a breadcrumb path of asset movements, which is a nightmare).<p>But when everything is just a list of things in a text file, you get the power of every great text editor on earth (vi, emacs, or whatever) and can make mass changes trivially.  Life&#x27;s much much much much better this way.')
