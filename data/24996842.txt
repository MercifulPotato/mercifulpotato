Still does not have ROCm support, so its been sitting in a shelf for &gt;1 year.<p>Some people here value &quot;open source&quot; drivers over &quot;working drivers&quot;. I value &quot;working drivers&quot; over &quot;open source&quot; drivers over &quot;proprietary&quot; drivers.<p>An open source driver that does not work, is worth zero to me.<p>If it were true that &quot;open source&quot; means somebody can go and fix the driver, then somebody could have added ROCm support for the 5700 XT a long time ago. The fact that this has not happen, to me at least, means that open source is not as valuable as people seem to try to make it be here.<p>Sure it is better than closed source, but if your driver doesn&#x27;t work, and AMD doesn&#x27;t want to fix it, it definitely does not mean that anybody will fix it within the lifetime of the card. This card will be surpassed by the 6000 series next week, no chance I&#x27;m going to buy one of those.')
