Whether it is more like a thug or more like an embodiment of the collective will of society is immaterial. It&#x27;s just another customer on the market.<p>&gt; <i>This is then made worse by the fact that the party who receives the services purchased (the patient) is someone different again who has no skin in the game at all.</i><p>This is the exact same scenario as an advertiser paying a company to expose me to advertising; I have no skin in that game either, and I&#x27;m subjected to something I do not necessarily want. But nobody would say it&#x27;s not &quot;free market&quot;. Hell, in the case of the clinics, the situation would be identical if the party paying for the procedures was not the government, but a billionaire philanthropist.<p>In fact, nothing about a free market precludes such scenarios, where the choices available to a buyer are dependent on the deals made between the seller and some third parties.<p>--<p>[0] - The concept that &quot;government has no money&quot; is silly outside the quite obvious reminder that government is mostly funded by its subjects.')
