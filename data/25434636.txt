Even in the US, the home of free speech, you can&#x27;t post child pornogaphy online. You could easily put forward the argument then that freedom of expression doesn&#x27;t exist in the US.<p>Freedom of expression has never really meant you&#x27;re completely free to say and anything (at least no in a civilized world). There are always going to be gray areas, but equally there are areas where expression should obviously be protected.<p>An example would be, if Facebook decided to eradicate all homosexual content. Clearly the EU stepping in and saying you can&#x27;t discriminate against gay speech is protecting the gay communities freedom of expression.<p>Equally the EU stepping in and saying the Facebook isn&#x27;t doing enough to protect victims of revenge porn is providing safety online. And is a reasonable balance between the rights of free expression from the poster vs the victim.')
