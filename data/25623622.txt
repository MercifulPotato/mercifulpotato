If your account was compromised, you have no way to do audits to understand what happened without $$$, which leads to many more attackers.<p>(3) Expires Chromebooks rather quickly. Fortunately, unlike Android, it lets users know, but given the target market, many can&#x27;t afford to upgrade.<p>(4) Runs appstores full of malware.
