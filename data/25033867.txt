Any attempts to delete it or contact the company has been a failure and I am amazed they are not being inundated by fines for this criminal behaviour, there are no contacts to ask GDPR data deletion (apparently it&#x27;s a subsidiary that handles them..?) and by that no means to have your personal information removed. I can&#x27;t imagine buying any software or hardware that would be in any way related to a company with such an hostility towards their customers.')
