Our SAAS product was initially based on Firebase, but we&#x27;re in the process of migrating to almost the same stack that you are offering (but hosted on Heroku) as firebase is quite limiting<p>Some feedback:<p>- Have you considered offering compute? The ability to run a proper backend would be a dealbreaker for me. Not having a backend is advertised as simpler but in my experience it&#x27;s the opposite, especially when integrating mobile apps that have a long lag time on updates. You simply don&#x27;t get enough flexibility for complex tasks, even with something like Hasura. Heroku offers docker containers with fixed resources that might be a good way to go. If you could offer some kind of managed container service that allowed me to share resources between all my containers then even better. Maybe you could build something on &#x2F; offer a managed version of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dokku&#x2F;dokku" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dokku&#x2F;dokku</a> ?<p>- Managed Redis or some other in-memory caching service would also be super useful. This is really important for scaling efficiently.<p>- Do you have any kind of availability &#x2F; durability guarantees? This is super important for us at $DAYJOB as we provide similar guarantees to our clients.<p>- Pricing seems reasonable, although a tier between Pro and Enterprise or a more &quot;pay what you use&quot; plan might be a good. We&#x27;d probably just about fit into the &quot;Pro&quot; tier for now but would be needing the Enterprise tier soon. We&#x27;re currently paying more than the cost of the enterprise tier. However, that covers the cost of compute in addition to our databases and storage.')
