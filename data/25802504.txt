(to be fair, this seems to be coming from whatever stuff google has added to the android build process, rather than gradle itself.)<p>these days, once gradle starts spitting errors, i know better than to read them. instead, i have to start thinking about when the build last worked, and what might have changed. if that path proves not to bear fruit, then it is time to trash that project completely and recreate it from scratch, which experience has taught me will take a lot less time than trying to “fix” the gradle build errors.')
