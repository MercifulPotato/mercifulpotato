I&#x27;m about 6 months in making a game 99% myself, full time. Writing all the code &#x2F; making all the 3d models &#x2F; sfx &#x2F; marketing etc. A friend has recently been helping me with music. Reading what you just said is heartening, I&#x27;ve received some shade about how inefficient it is to do it this way.<p>I chose to do that so my vision would shine through (and so the art style would have some core consistency!). It&#x27;s still an open question if society will appreciate what I can deliver enough to support me continuing to do it.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting feeling to be in the midst of it. ~Every other day when I post a little 30 second video of progress on twitter, it&#x27;s like a question to society asking if I&#x27;m good enough, if I should be allowed to go to the dentist, maybe buy new glasses some day as a reward. Is my mettle enough to survive without evermore accepting the indignities that come with fealty to someone else&#x27;s banner? Someone else&#x27;s dreams? The trickle of likes and follows have been a resounding &quot;maybe! We&#x27;re bewildered but intrigued. Keep going!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like a super position between a catastrophic, financially ruinous midlife crisis -- or being some eccentric who knew he would be alright all along. Just between you and me, it could go either way. Reality will write the label.<p>While the uncertainty is kind of fun, I&#x27;m really excited to be nearing a moment to get a firmer answer. It&#x27;s hard to imagine any answer could get me to stop tbqh.')
