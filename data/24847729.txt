It&#x27;s obviously (technically) hard to create and maintain software in various languages. It&#x27;s laborious. It&#x27;s mostly a manual process.<p>But can&#x27;t help but think its made harder because there&#x27;s this sense (among those managing resources) that its a nice to have, not a crucial aspect of product development. Which is funny because software, specially web software aims at a global market (at least implicitly).<p>In my experience localization is even less prioritized than accessibility (non locale related accessibility). Maybe because there&#x27;s more awareness around a11y. Likely because unless you&#x27;re actively working in a specific market (with a specific locale) you don&#x27;t care about making it readable for that market, and yet you gladly take credit card details from that market.<p>On the other hannd, and while I&#x27;m an ignorant in these matters, I&#x27;m really surprised that AI&#x2F;ML is not helping us more on localization and yet, we can make it make up new&#x27;ish text (in en-US), replace people&#x27;s faces instantly in photos and recognize faces in google photos.')
