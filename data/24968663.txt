This is <i>exactly</i> why we need regulation. I swear, if &quot;just go somewhere else&quot; were good advice (and it&#x27;s not), we wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation. How many years has it been, though, that Google and other consumer-ignorant companies have been able to get away with this, helped along by people who tell victims to just &quot;go somewhere else&quot;?<p>Normal people will only put up with this for so long. Either regulate it intelligently now, or expect actually scary regulation a decade or two from now.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a law that says: &quot;You cannot close a customer&#x27;s account with no remediation, no recourse, and no explanation.&quot; What is Silicon Valley so afraid of there?
