The GP comment is about (mis)attributing causation.<p>&quot;Women can&#x27;t do science&quot; and &quot;bell curve arguments about some races being less intellectually capable than others&quot; are both  causal arguments. &quot;The SAT exhibits racial bias&quot; is an observational statement. You took the GP&#x27;s argument about causal misattribution and turned it into one about hiding observational conclusions, but that wasn&#x27;t present in the original comment.')
