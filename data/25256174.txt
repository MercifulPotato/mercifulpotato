The main goal of the vaccine is to stop the virus from spreading in the population and getting a chance to reach vulnerable people. Even if it were to only protect people who wouldn&#x27;t die of Covid in the first place, that&#x27;s the vast majority of the population and enough to significantly reduce the chance of spreading.<p>At the condition that these studies measure the right thing. If it merely stops the symptoms but doesn&#x27;t stop the spread of the virus, that may be a problem.')
