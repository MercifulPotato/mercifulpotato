Unfortunately I&#x27;ve seen too many &quot;startup&quot; CTOs that have difficulty making the transition successfully with the result that they either fail their company or are replaced.<p>Does anyone have suggestions, books, mentoring programs, or advice they could pass along.  I love this company and the team we have built and want to give us the best possible chance for success.')
