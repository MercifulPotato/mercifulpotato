This is the problem: people making multiples of $50k live fundamentally different lives from those making sub-$50k. They have money to burn, and they do just that, often on self-serving goods and services with limited ROI compared to what the same amount of money would buy people with more basic concerns. However, they want to align themselves with struggling families and individuals culturally, because it absolves them of responsibility for changing private and public policy towards the nature of labor and welfare, and provides cover for them to continue their mindless march into the Moloch of a false meritocracy.<p>If you&#x27;re paying $30k-$50k a year to send your kid to a private school, we&#x27;re not talking about the same kind of family as a people working one or two jobs sub-$20&#x2F;hr just to make rent. No one listens to the latter; if you&#x27;re the former, you have positioned yourself socially to be heard by the decision-makers and policy-executors. If you don&#x27;t say anything except in your own defense, knowing what an educated person should know about poverty and suffering in America, even somehow envisioning yourself as <i>among</i> those suffering, that&#x27;s a choice.')
