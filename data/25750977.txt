Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610475428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741922, text='To be perfectly clear, my point wasn&#x27;t that people have near-supremal intelligence (the thing you seem to be arguing against), but that given the hypotheses in the parent comment you couldn&#x27;t rule out such an eventuality.<p>While we&#x27;re on the topic though, no it doesn&#x27;t have to be unlikely or strange for people to be near-supremal, and throwing more hardware at the problem doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it go away:<p>On some level that idea comes down to defining what we mean by &quot;intelligence.&quot; Suppose we can only measure intelligence by proxy by measuring performance on specific tasks. Then the composition of those tasks plays into any final intelligence score. If they&#x27;re all fully parallelizable then you&#x27;re totally right that people almost certainly aren&#x27;t anywhere near the &quot;top,&quot; and moreover a &quot;top&quot; probably wouldn&#x27;t even exist. In standard parlance though, intelligence is something more than the ability to add a lot of numbers quickly, and most of our current measures of intelligence have exponentially (or worse) diminishing returns as more hardware is added.<p>In that latter case where intelligence is measured by performance on algorithms which are fundamentally hard, people wouldn&#x27;t be near the top because of some rare process which accidentally made us that way. People would be near the top because _anything_ displaying a modicum of thought would be near the top because of the vastly diminishing returns of additional hardware. As a crude ballpark, if you mustered every atom on earth into its own processor running at 4GHz then you could solve a fully parallelizable exponential problem roughly 4x bigger than what one of Google&#x27;s newest TPU&#x27;s can manage.')
