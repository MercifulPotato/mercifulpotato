Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610559679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763433, text='Do you understand why your comment has been downvoted? If not, it&#x27;s this part:<p>&gt; Someone who wasn&#x27;t stupid<p>Being bipolar&#x2F;depressive doesn&#x27;t make someone stupid, or necessarily ignorant. Not knowing the individual I can&#x27;t make any judgements regarding this. But I have experienced severe depressive phases. During those (and similarly with manic phases) you can lose control of your mind and understanding&#x2F;beliefs about the world. You may <i>act</i> stupidly (but do not <i>become</i> stupid) based on how your beliefs about the world change or the general loss of control over yourself you&#x27;re experiencing.<p>You&#x27;re being downvoted because there is a qualitative difference between these statements: &quot;Someone <i>is</i> stupid&quot; vs &quot;Someone is <i>acting</i> stupid&quot; or &quot;Behaving stupidly&quot;. Though many people don&#x27;t hear the difference when it&#x27;s directed at them, there is a difference in sentiment and intent. The former is about the person themselves, the latter about their behavior. The former is hard to correct if true, the latter is something someone can alter about themselves (assuming they have some degree of control over their faculties and behavior).')
