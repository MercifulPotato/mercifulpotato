No they don&#x27;t. 2. Cows&#x27; methaney burps aren&#x27;t the only greenhouse gas issue w&#x2F; animal agriculture. Those animals definitionally eat more food than they produce (in in the case of cows, it&#x27;s by a large factor). Meat is inherently an inefficient form of food. 3. Don&#x27;t throw your food scraps in the trashâ€”it&#x27;s easy to compost.<p>&gt; need ruminants to provide the fertilizer to soil to make it into a positive carbon sink<p>No. No you don&#x27;t. Composting works just fine. But furthermore, the number of cattle we have today is laughably excessive for talking about fertilizer production.
