Item(by='oliwarner', descendants=None, kids=[25044903], score=None, time=1605007354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044670, text='This is an absurd comment for two reasons. <i>Most</i> games aren&#x27;t multiplayer with anti-cheat requirements. And you&#x27;re only talking about lazy, client-side anti-cheat systems.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to verify everything between eyeball and public network. The drop-in systems available essentially check for known things, good and bad. This war on clients has a front line moving lower and lower into your computer. It used to be process and driver inspection but it&#x27;s in the process of moving up to UEFI-locked ring0 (Riot&#x27;s Vanguard) and it&#x27;ll be a TPM-like hardware module by 2025.<p>There&#x27;s another way: INSPECT ACTIONS. Every client knows what&#x27;s going on, the server —if one exists— knows what&#x27;s going on. Just replay 10 seconds leading up to a suspicious event and you very quickly discover wall-hacking, or aiming too fast and too accurately, or impossible macros. This system can be automated, cross checked by multiple clients, and you very quickly know if somebody is probably cheating.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t want to spend time tuning your machine learning, you can just replay scenarios to other players. Hackers aren&#x27;t subtle! CSGO&#x27;s Overwatch is essentially crowdsourced moderation... and it works.<p>The reason we pretend that client-side checks are the only anti-cheat feature out there is because they&#x27;re cheap. Drop-in. But they&#x27;re awful for gamers&#x27; freedoms.')
