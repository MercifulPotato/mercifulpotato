Ground that can grow animal food pretty much always can grow a human food.  I know of no exception (particularly for high production foods).<p>About the only exception I can think of is undeveloped grazing land in the mountains.  However, that&#x27;s such a small percentage of the food that goes into feeding livestock that it&#x27;s hardly worth mentioning.  Most of our meats don&#x27;t come from animals living on mountain ranges, that&#x27;s too expensive.  It takes ~2 acres to pasture a single cow if you don&#x27;t actively farm that pasture.  On the flip side, that same 2 acres if farmed can easily feed about ~2 cows.<p>In other words, you cut your land requirements in half if you don&#x27;t pasture your cows.<p>&gt; The plants animals eat are easy to process mechanically at huge scale. The plants humans eat, not so much.<p>Humans do require a bit more processing of their foods than animals do, but not much and not enough to introduce any sort of scaling problem.  Certainly not more costly than meat processing.  Most meat processing requires manual interaction which is super expensive.  On the flip side, plant based processing is pretty much completely automated.  About the only part that isn&#x27;t 100% automated is transport (and usually harvesting, though that&#x27;s changing fast).  As with everything, manual processes are the most expensive part of anything because humans cost a lot of money.<p>Meat is a solution to the energy density problem.  Meats are high in protein and energy which makes for a good winter food for farmers (so long as you can keep it cold, it will last a long time).')
