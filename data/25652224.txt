Trump wasn&#x27;t even involved in negotiations (too busy contesting the election with no evidence and&#x2F;or golfing) and then he refused to sign the bill for several days because of surprise, last minute demands he decided to make (and then go back on, gaining nothing but losing us all time). A competent leader would have been all-in on the entire process.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s also worth noting that these healthcare professionals you are attacking have been working under difficult conditions and at significant risk for most of a year and probably deserve either a) a bunch of extra pay that states cant afford on their own or b) some damn time off.')
