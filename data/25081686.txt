Using Poetry for local development is fine but don&#x27;t build a huge infrastructure around it and don&#x27;t use in production.<p>I migrated the CI&#x2F;CD of my company to Poetry some time ago, it worked fine for some time until we needed a feature that Poetry didn&#x27;t support. I submitted a PR adding the feature to Poetry but their sole developer was apparently taking some time off and the project remained without any development for several months.<p>I migrated the CI&#x2F;CD to use my own Poetry fork but it was very cumbersome, Poetry has a very weird build system so forking it is not simple.<p>At this point, I realized that I was just wasting time. There is nothing that Poetry does that the other (old and stable) tools don&#x27;t do. Poetry was the result of me falling for the shiny toy syndrome.')
