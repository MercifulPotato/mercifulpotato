Developers should start taking note of this kind of stuff and anything that might ruffle the feathers of big media should go into plugins.<p>Do the digital equivalent of the way rich people use holding companies and shell companies.  Put all the high risk stuff into the smallest independent repo possible and abandon it at the first sign of trouble.  Use an MIT license so anyone can fork it and continue development if you have to abandon it.<p>It probably wouldn&#x27;t even take a ton of money to set up a matching corporate structure so you could control everything.  Put all the risk into a subsidiary that doesn&#x27;t make any money (or makes very little).  Drag out DMCA complaints until they sue you and then bankrupt the asset-less company.  Rinse and repeat.<p>If you want to get super ballsy, sell the plugins that infringe, but siphon all the money out of the subsidiary with trademark licensing.  That way you can license the same trademark to the next company to maintain the brand.  Bonus points if you put the holding company in a tax haven.<p>IANAL.  That&#x27;s probably a really bad idea.  Don&#x27;t do it.')
