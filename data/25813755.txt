In that case there is no way for me to figure out whether I&#x27;m on the actual site or a phished site.<p>For example see this (it is the Visa opt-out website that was posted a few days ago on HN): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketingreportoptout.visa.com&#x2F;OPTOUT&#x2F;request.do" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketingreportoptout.visa.com&#x2F;OPTOUT&#x2F;request.do</a><p>Supposedly the above it authentic, but the Cert is showing Cloudflare as the Organization. Now unless the claim is that Cloudflare will never serve phished websites, which I doubt unless Cloudflare is doing a human validation for each client, this is a problem.')
