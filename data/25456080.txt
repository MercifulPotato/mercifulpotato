If you could somehow get the proxy to register the transfer function of the Chainlink contract as a diamond facet, you (or anyone else) would then be able to call it via the proxy and move the funds as if you were the owner. Aavegotchi, as any diamond, has an admin interface for changing registered functions, called IDiamondCut.&quot;<p>Cryptocurrency is gonna need its own Certified Public Accountants.')
