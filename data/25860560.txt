We shouldn&#x27;t let &quot;how the Chinese might perceive us&quot; to influence us very much.<p>That said, I think there are other reasons to not like this; specifically while I appreciate some acknowledgment of the human rights issue, I don&#x27;t especially like Twitter playing moderator for so much of the world&#x27;s discourse--even if it correctly moderates a handful of high profile issues, it can still shape the enormous torrent of lower profile issues to its liking and deceptively point to those high profile cases when people challenge its neutrality. Consider for example how easy it would be for Twitter to turn a knob tomorrow and boost the amount of subtly pro-CCP content we see (or replace pro-CCP with whatever issue you don&#x27;t think we should want more people exposed to). While yes, Twitter is a private entity and (in many western countries, anyway) they are legally free to moderate how they like, I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a social good--I don&#x27;t know that our various free speech laws considered the possibility that <i>so much</i> communication could be at the discretion of a single private entity (or even a small handful of private entities).')
