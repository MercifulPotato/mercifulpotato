Theres such a huge misunderstanding of &quot;value&quot;. Scarcity within itself does not create value. It&#x27;s the mix of demand and scarcity that does, but to have demand there needs to be some inherent value in it along with timeliness.<p>One of the biggest fascinations I had in games was the EVE marketplace. If you dont know, EVE is a scifi mmo. The economy in the game is so legit, the devs have an econ PhD to analyze it and use it to help balance the game when new gear is in. Theres a good youtube video about this to help give a better explanation, but the jist of it, items in EVE are not permanent. Other mmos you can use whatever item indefinitely then sell it when you get something better. Dying and collecting your gear is trivial. Thus items have lower values, especially when better ones come in over time. In eve, when your ship goes boom, only 25%-50% or so of it survives... and whoever killed you nabbed it. This keeps the market value stable(ish). A bigger better gun or ship is no longer neccesarily better. The value, and I&#x27;m not talking about just price but the overall market demand, goes up for parts and ships that are niche and cost effective.<p>I&#x27;m on a phone and this is getting too long. Overall bitcoin is an investment vehicle based on privacy and scarcity. The first part no one can deny is rather brilliant and as far as I know has worked out as advertised (though let&#x27;s not kid ourselves who 90% of that demographic is). The second part... I swear to everyone reading this, just get The Great Courses so you can listen to their Econ 101 class. Or just get it from the library or even get a random econ textbook. Read it. I bet you within 30 to 50 pages you&#x27;ll fully grasp how childish bitcoin is. At that, everytime a major media news source has their econ expert talk, you&#x27;ll realize they were all at the bottom of their classes.<p>Oh, somewhere in there I meant to say your comparison to Mario was bad because that game has inherent value, both nostalgia and still fun to play. You&#x27;re comparing to something with no value other than giving utility companies more money due to the excess electricity generated to mine bitcoin. I still say Satoshi was just elec execs who drunkenly came up with this crypto scam: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption&#x2F;</a>')
