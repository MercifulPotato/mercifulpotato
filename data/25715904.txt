They&#x27;re all still up as far as I can see.  Trump incited an attack on congress.  He got banned.  Parler deliberately cultivated an extreme community of violent rhetoric (they really did, have you looked at that site?).  They got banned.  Who else?   Seems like only people reasonably identifiable as extremists are affected.<p>I remain horrified at the right wing community&#x27;s ability to rationalize violence.  The President directed an attack on Congress last Wednesday to prevent his opponent&#x27;s certification.  And... what people really want to talk about is Parler losing their hosting?<p>(Edit to note that you refused to answer the question and jumped off on a WHATABOUTBLM?! tangent instead.  In fact, contra your hyperbole, no moderate right wing voices have been censored or silenced.)')
