(frozen carb for ex)<p>Carb freezing doesn&#x27;t occur as a result of mixture mismanagement, but rather by failure to apply carburetor heat when flying in conditions conducive to carb icing.<p>Mismanaging the mixture is far less likely to have any acute effects.  Descending with a lean[er] mixture may cause issues at lower altitudes where the mixture would be too lean, but it would be unusual for that to lead to an engine stoppage.<p>Further - a pilot inexperienced in mixture management would likely not lean the mixture at all and just fly full-rich which again, wouldn&#x27;t likely lead to any acute failures, just higher fuel consumption and longer-term issues with the engine.')
