In the 1860 US presidential election, Southern politicians and newspaper editors spread fears of what a &quot;Black Republican&quot; win would mean, painting horrific pictures of what the emancipation of slaves would do to the country. In the 2020 US presidential election, modern-day Republicans used Cuban Americansâ€™ fears of socialism in ads on Spanish-language radio and messaging on social media. Because of the emotions involved, many voters believed the campaigns enough to let them influence their decisions.<p>... where he sets up (anchors) a reprehensible example of an emotional appeal (19th century racial bigotry) to reflect a &#x27;reprehensible&#x27; example of modern-day emotional appeal (animosity towards a social&#x2F;economic philosophy.) To reinforce his point he purposefully neglects to mention it was Southern <i>Democrats</i> who spread fear against &#x27;Black Republicans&#x27; and instead uses &#x27;Republican&#x27; twice (as a callback) to tweak the more modern-day version of that political party.<p>The irony of Schneier using his long-standing and influential blog to insist we &#x27;have a serious conversation about limiting the technologies of persuasion&#x27; is not lost on this reader.<p><i>Edit</i>--Feel free to downvote, but perhaps explain where my comment is wrong?')
