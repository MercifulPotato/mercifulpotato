I kept doing small talk, while being very scared, in hope that this was not going to end up with me and my gf killed. A mindhunter’s ed kamp vibe. At the end of the ride I told that to my gf and she told me she felt the same way. We were pretty shook and we thought about alerting the FBI or smthg, but a vibe didn’t feel like a strong enough intel.')
