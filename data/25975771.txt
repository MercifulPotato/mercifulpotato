Areas include but not limited to :<p>-simulated keyboard&#x2F;mouse input (some progress recently with some composers)<p>ability to inspect window attributes (e.g. window title, executable and handle)<p>ability to manipulate windows (e.g. maximise, close, etc)<p>Considerations do need to be made in the framework &#x2F; protocol for accessibility.
