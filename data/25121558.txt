Git is the simplest version control system I&#x27;ve ever used. The concept of merging, rebasing, cherry-picking, and resetting works so naturally that I&#x27;m basically going to expect this level of ease of use from any VCS I use going forward.<p>That being said, I know there are some who have trouble with Git. But IMO it isn&#x27;t because Git is hard, but because they don&#x27;t have to truly understand Git to use it. That&#x27;s how easy it is.')
