I&#x27;m glad to see another company take a stab at iterating on Heroku while keeping ops burden low.<p>I&#x27;m interested to know - what&#x27;s the sales pitch for DO over Render?  I&#x27;m noticing some pricing differences but at first glance it seems they tip Render&#x27;s direction.  I&#x27;m also noticing Render is a bit further along (persistent storage, cron jobs, custom domains).')
