Stubbornly wrong.<p>Most of the advice about debating and persuasion is worse than wrong. This article calls out the &quot;backfire&quot; effect.<p>I was one of them. I eventually figured out it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been trying to find and learn better strategies.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to apply lessons learned from Camp Wellstone, Prof David Domke, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heroesnarrative.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heroesnarrative.org</a>. (I even study people from the other side, like Frank Luntz, Ben Shapiro, Grover Norquist. Know they enemy and all that.)<p>I&#x27;m also very impressed by ideas from deradicalization, cult deprogramming, Chris Voss&#x27; (hostage negotiator) &quot;radical empathy&quot; and others. Guarded optimism that this stuff will help.<p>I&#x27;m just so sick of the food fight. Alas, there&#x27;s still real work that needs to be done. And I&#x27;m forever trying to figure out how to sneak progress thru the chaos of war.')
