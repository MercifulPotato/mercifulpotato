The expectation of airliner reliability for self-driving cars is what I get from the discussions around this. Here on HN and in other places. Maybe it will be lower and the uncanny valley will be smaller but I wouldn&#x27;t bet on it. People are much more afraid of flying than of driving even though driving is much riskier. And that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re much more willing to accept risks when you think you&#x27;re in control of them. Self-driving cars will take that illusion of personal control away.')
