Item(by='Chris2048', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612222625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989711, text='Most financial institutions need some kind of basis for a promise - something that &quot;secures&quot; the contract e.g. like a loan secured by an asset.<p>A regulated entity might have capital requirements which would limit the no of burgers promised to money held. Another might be a contract with mcdonalds for N burgers, or a warehouse full of burgers - shorted stocks require the lender to actually sell a stock, and the shorter to actually sell it (and buy it back later) but there will need to be security&#x2F;&quot;deposit&quot; on the returning of the stock - there exist a risk that the lender will not get their stock back, which is part of the reason for the premium.<p>Since you&#x2F;I are not regulated financial institutions, not may would trust us to deliver 1 trillion burgers on paper; so the flaw exists in &quot;What if they take their future 1 trillion burgers and sell half&quot; - sell to whom? They&#x27;d have to find someone willing to buy. &quot;What if you walk into McDonalds to claim the 1 trillion burgers&quot; - the &quot;paper burger&quot; is an agreement between you and some third-party, not mcdonalds. You couldn&#x27;t pre-order items from one shop, and go to another store with you invoice and demand they fulfil it - your contract is not some general&#x2F;official currency, there is no obligation to accept it.<p>&gt; So you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s okay to promise burgers as long as it&#x27;s an amount that actually exists and McDonald&#x27;s can fulfil it.<p>It&#x27;s a promise that <i>you</i> will supply N burgers, so the criteria for ok-ness is that <i>you</i> can supply N burgers, that McDs can provide that many is necessary-but-not-sufficient alongside:<p>- you can pay for N burgers\n- you can transport N burgers (on time)<p>but when I say &quot;ok&quot;, I mean from a &quot;morality of making personal promises&quot; perspective, not &quot;financial promises&#x2F;obligations made by a regulated financial institution&quot; perspective. Individuals are not financial institutions, and financial institutions are regulated as such.')
