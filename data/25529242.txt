I have basically moved completely away from Windows toward Linux for my home media PC, and I have enjoyed it so much I would like to do the same on the laptop.  I was seriously considering an XPS 13&quot; before I bought an M1 air, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like any other laptops are quite there at the moment.
