When I&#x27;m humble, this means I don&#x27;t think of myself as a rockstar ninja developer.  I&#x27;m fallible just like the next guy.  Right?<p>But my own aspirations to do great work are still there!  So because I&#x27;m not that great, I work hard to get better.<p>Reflecting on the above, it seems right now I&#x27;m not humble enough, I&#x27;m too satisfied with myself.  Thank you for giving me the chance to reflect and improve.')
