Item(by='spekcular', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602356834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739739, text='I&#x27;ve used Arch for about a year and agree that the need to attend carefully to updates is annoying. There was a particularly egregious case of this recently with PAM, where if you did not update a certain file following the instructions given by the pacman messages (or just missed it), then you wouldn&#x27;t be able to log in. I also had another instance of not being able to boot into Arch due to a bug in the package governing my encrypted drive. In both cases it was simple to solve by booting from a rescue USB and changing the appropriate files (downgrading in the second case), but it was still obnoxious.<p>However, as far as I can tell, it should not be a problem to wait 6 months (or even years?) to update. There are periodic reddit threads where someone updates a years-old Arch installation just fine.')
