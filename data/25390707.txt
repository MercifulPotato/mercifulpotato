I live in a tiny pre-zoning code neighborhood where my neighbors and their kids are 100 feet away. I see and talk with neighbors every day when leaving the house, and not just people like me but people of different ages and backgrounds. My parents live 10 minutes away and we’re their multiple times a week. Same for my neighbors—one couple has their parents living in the same subdivision, another lives with her sister and young kid. It’s so much better than when I lived in DC I can’t even convey it.<p>My only regret is that my extended family lives on the other side of the planet. When I was little everyone lived in the same city (Dhaka, Bangladesh). My mom’s sisters were at our house several times a week. Moving to the US was depressing—so much so that my mom has always been quite bitter about it.')
