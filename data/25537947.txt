And follows to giving pretty expected results.<p>I suppose I could come up with a few dozens scenario that would explain no results in your case (as a software engineer, I have heard a rumor that sometimes those &quot; server&quot; thingys have what they call &quot;glitches&quot;.)<p>But I of course completely understand that the hypothesis of DDG specifically censoring the query for you looks more plausible.<p>You&#x27;re probably a very important person that needed to be hidden the fact that the WMF had a conference about restarting the economy after the covid - which <i>obviously</i> means that the prince Charles of UK is behind a global conspiracy to manufacture viruses from scratch in order to overthrow capitalism. (I&#x27;m just kidding, I know that&#x27;s not what you believe.)<p>Sincerely, i hope you have the best possible holiday season, and take care of yourselves.')
