Reliance on the cliffhanger, too much pandering to current events&#x2F;politics, overuse of the &quot;mystery box&quot; plot technique, and so on.<p>There are a few other personal gripes I have that may not be shared in this community (like, I think shows are way oversexed and have far too many grotesque and gritty elements for my taste) which have basically turned me completely off of modern television shows.  For the time being, I&#x27;m watching &quot;classics&quot; and movies.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that cancelling TV shows too soon is creating a problem. The bigger problem, for me, are the above features + an over-abundance of volume of content (the ol&#x27; &quot;Netflix will produce just about anything&quot; criticism).')
