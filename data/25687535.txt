Democracy works when you are able to understand somebody is fool even if you can read what they write.<p>Yeah, but what we have seen in social media is that the discourse gets polarized. Everyone hangs around in groups&#x2F;channels&#x2F;subreddits&#x2F;blogs that are of the side they identify with. They are echo chambers which shape their own reality in many ways. So people often tend to believe one version of the events. Over the years we have seen fractures between ideologies grow deeper. So, I am not sure if this strategy works.<p>&gt; This time we believe it was acceptable because our political views here in HN, mostly are aligned with the ones of folks running social platforms. Next time it may be different.<p>Completely agree on this. It is definitely dangerous.')
