Don&#x27;t sell yourself short, if you&#x27;re looking to find a better job, promotion, whatever you&#x27;re looking to get from others in life.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten plenty feedback about my job experience, saying it indicates very slow progress and complacency (and that&#x27;s just the general idea). Despite all of this I&#x27;m also being told not to sell myself short. If your feedback gives you a harsh reality check how can you resist not to? How do you &quot;sell up&quot; when people give you few positive things to say about yourself?')
