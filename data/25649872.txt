If someone parks the corporate car in a no-parking zone, or spits out chewing gum on the sidewalk, you&#x27;re not going to fine them x% of net worth. At least in terms of consequences for the corporation, you&#x27;d they would be (punitively) proportional to the economic impact of the criminal activity.<p>What was the impact of this conduct? It&#x27;s not mentioned in the story. If they paid a $10 million fine on criminal activity that gleaned them a $1 billion advantage, then yeah this is a slap on the wrist. If it&#x27;s a $10 million fine on something that gave them a $10 advantage, it&#x27;s arguably overly punitive.')
