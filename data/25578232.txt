The approach is to give you a concise problem that should exercise some part of your python knowledge, and have you write code, re-write your code, bang your head against a problem, and then, once you&#x27;ve written something that passes all the unit tests, you get a walk through possible solutions by someone who knows python well.<p>Trey starts with a description of how you <i>might</i> solve the problem (which is about how I solved the problem 50% of the time) that is almost always clearly wrong, even though it &quot;works&quot; - then he shows you a somewhat more pythonic and modern way - and you go, &quot;aha!&quot;, and then, he shows you the <i>elegant</i> solution - and it changes your life, and you use that pattern in everything you write.<p>His focus though, is really on how to write clean pythonic 3.x code more than the latest and greatest features, but he tags his problems&#x2F;solution sets, so if you really want to dive into decorators, or context managers, or dunder methods - you can zoom right in.<p>The only problem I&#x27;ve had with Python Morsels is I look at the code I wrote a year ago (I&#x27;m not a developer) and I&#x27;m embarrassed and ashamed at how gross it was.')
