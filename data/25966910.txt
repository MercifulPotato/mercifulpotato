Back in those days, people used Basic, Pascal, and C for programming competitions.<p>Already had some experiences with Basic, and found C to be too &quot;low level&quot; for my taste, I picked Pascal. Next year, I jumped into Delphi: learning Win32 GUI basics and some database programming with MySQL. Probably pretty advanced for a high school kids, since most of my friends were interested in music or games :)<p>I never used Pascal&#x2F;Delphi for work though, because Java has been a major player in mobile development scene (J2ME -&gt; BlackBerry -&gt; Android....).<p>One of the things I appreciate about Pascal compilers is: blazing fast compile time. And I think it still applies to FPC (Free Pascal Compiler).<p>You can rebuild the whole compiler + basic libraries from scratch under 5 minutes. Can&#x27;t say the same thing about GCC. Well the last time I did this was in 2014 (or 2015?), though.<p>Now, if I want a native compiler with fast compilation speed, I&#x27;d pick Go or Nim.....')
