Biggest driver of revenue was focusing on an industry that buys everything in bulk - services, software, you name it. The federal government. It took two years of laying groundwork to get our first few contracts then took off from there. Biggest mistake we made was twofold - one, hiring too early in the beginning (we used a small amount of debt initially paying salaries for &quot;overhead&quot; people, like marketing, sales, consultants, etc., that simply didn&#x27;t work out or were far too inexperienced) and, two, giving a substantial amount of equity to someone who was intended to be a cofounder type but was a paid employee, didn&#x27;t put any money into the business (but took plenty out), and didn&#x27;t have the mindset of an entrepreneur. Key lesson: choose your partner(s) and employees wisely.')
