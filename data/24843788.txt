We continue to use multi-phase power because it enables continuous delivery of power (unlike single-phase, where the delivered power drops to zero at least twice per cycle).  And two phases require just as many wires as three phases, with more power delivered for a given mass of copper and insulation, so... we use three.<p>&gt; If the current on phase a is 20 amps and the current on phase B is 20 amps what is the return current on my neutral?<p>That depends on the (complex) impedance in each branch.  In the pathological case, the current on the neutral <i>could</i> be as high as 40 Amps.')
