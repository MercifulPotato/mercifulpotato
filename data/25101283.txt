It&#x27;s not that i don&#x27;t care about how the thing isn&#x27;t working for you, it&#x27;s that I have other things that are more urgent or more important to me. (Improving the world is important to me, and e.g. you getting my software to work in your weird special environment won&#x27;t)<p>If you want me to care more, then do most of the work (or all of it, send a PR), because then the gain is better software and an encouraged OSS contributor. That, or pay me (but see above).')
