When users agree to updates they agree to let a corporation silently install and run new code on their computer at will, at any time.<p>This permits the company to create a situation where person A&#x27;s browser is not quite the same program as person B&#x27;s, there will be differences.  Thus the corporation can run an &quot;experiment&quot;.  Both person A and person B might believe &quot;I am using XYZ browser&quot;.  The two users believe it is the same program.  However there are differences.  The differences can be added and removed through &quot;automatic updates&quot;.<p>How do users maintain privacy in that situtation. The company behind XYZ browser can easily isolate groups of users with similar&#x2F;different traits by conducting such experiments and observing user behaviour.  &quot;Cohorts&quot;.  While the company may argue it is only testing software, there is an argument that it can also be testing users.<p>The words in parentheticals above can be defined and redfined any way you like.  What is important is what the corporation is actually doing, not the label&#x2F;name&#x2F;terminology they assign to it.')
