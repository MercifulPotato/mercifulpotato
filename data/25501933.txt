It can&#x27;t get ahead in any meaningful way there. Plus, sensor tech has plateaued a bit.<p>Nikon, if it were to survive, would need to move into new markets. dSLRs are dying, but imaging is exploding. Nikon and Canon ran into the innovator&#x27;s dilemma: they didn&#x27;t want to eat into their core market, so they released crippled products like the Nikon 1 or Canon M-mount. By the time they got into the game, their market was collapsing, they lost a lot of credibility, and Sony had a huge lead. It&#x27;s probably too late, but we&#x27;ll see.<p>Drones, industrial, teleconferencing, and hundreds of other markets are popping up, but Canon and Nikon are conspicuously absent.')
