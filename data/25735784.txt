You are therefore acknowledging a limit to free speech. But that isn&#x27;t the point yet.<p>The point is that you (not necessary you) are drawing a line at all. It&#x27;s that there <i>is</i> a line. And if there exists a limit to free speech, it means <i>someone</i> has to decide where that limit is placed. We are almost to the point.<p>And if someone gets to decide where the limit to free speech is placed, who gets to make that decision and why? Clearly <i>you</i> have put that line between ISIS and Parler according to your own belief system (or maybe not, you haven&#x27;t explicitly denoted anything). But the point is that there <i>exists</i> a reason to limit free speech. I promise the point is coming.<p>If there exists reasons to limit free speech then we have a problem. You see, you and I may agree ISIS should be de-platformed, but other people may believe other things and therefore have other reasons. The <i>point</i> is that there is no such thing as &quot;free speech&quot;. That everyone has their reasons. And that the people shouting &quot;free speech&quot; often mean &quot;free speech within the thresholds that I am comfortable&quot;. That nobody actually, truly, deep-down believes in &quot;free speech&quot;.<p>The point is that &quot;free speech&quot; is a myth.<p>So quit wasting your time calling out Amazon for infringing on something that doesn&#x27;t exist (again, not necessarily you).')
