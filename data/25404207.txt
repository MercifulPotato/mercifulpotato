Isn&#x27;t that a form a violence ? Even if never comes to anything physical ? You can really do damage that way.<p>Given the replies above, it looks like your understanding of the word &quot;violence&quot; is narrowed down and only considers &quot;physical harm made to people&quot;. It really encompass more than that. It is a powerful word that express the idea of harm being made, regardless of the target or the form.')
