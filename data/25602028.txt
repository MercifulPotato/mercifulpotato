I disagree with the assertion that the DX7 was the synth that made synth music mainstream.<p>A lot of pop from before was already using synths. Funkytown was a Billboard #1 hit 4 years before the DX7, and so was Vangelis, Human League, Eurythmics and Owner of a Lonely Heart a year or two after that, not to mention lots of Michael Jackson and even the Ghostbuster theme... and that&#x27;s just the Billboard #1 hits. Even Van Halen released &quot;Jump&quot; a year before the DX7, and England was already having synth bands since the late 80s. People were more than used to synthesizers by the time the DX7 hit.<p>And about the 909&#x2F;303, back in the 80s&#x2F;90s a lot of EDM tracks had 909 in the title, including a Daft Punk track. Same for some 303 tracks (but Acid was way more obscure). House and Techno people definitely heard about those. In fact, they were probably more popular than the DX7.<p>Sure none of those comes close to the 808 today, but that&#x27;s because the 808 itself had a resurgence in the mid-2000s, and hip hop only got bigger since them.')
