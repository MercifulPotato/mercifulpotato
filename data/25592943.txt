I don&#x27;t have an account and I even accessed it from a browser I never used before (e.g. had to accept cookie policy). This is the form I&#x27;m talking about:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;contact&#x2F;180237885820953<p>What I do is, I check:<p>- &quot;Data Access&quot;<p>- &quot;I donâ€™t have a Facebook account and I want to access my data&quot;<p>Then I enter my data and click send. But unfortunately, I get greeted with a dialogue saying:<p>&quot;An error occurred while processing this request. Please try again later.&quot;<p>Only when I try submitting the page a couple of times: reloads etc., I get the same error message but suddenly a reCAPTCHA is shown, that when completed allows me to send my request.<p>Can anyone reproduce this? Please let me know so that I can send a bug report to Facebook. Thanks!')
