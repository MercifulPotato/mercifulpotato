I filtered to US-only, handmade goods. I waded through pages of junk and finally found a lamp that was being billed as handmade with a design I liked, shipped from the US.<p>No tracking info to speak of (red flag of drop-shipping!) and when it finally arrived, it was a drop shipped special. From AMAZON. Another cheap, Chinese piece of junk being dubiously billed as &quot;handmade&quot;. The seller just tacked on a $15 premium (I found the original product listing on Amazon) and on they went.<p>There are actual small producers still on Etsy, but recently more and more of my purchasing is shifting away from the Amazon&#x2F;Etsy&#x2F;Wayfair world back to eBay, of all places.')
