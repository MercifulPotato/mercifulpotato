But, to be realistic, it needed to be something with a pretty narrow scope.<p>For years, we&#x27;ve curated stacks of hand-written index cards for our weekly date nights. In 2020, that&#x27;s turned into weekly bottle-of-wine-on-the-deck nights, but we still do it. Once we started handing decks out to friends, and hearing back that they enjoyed them too, we decided it&#x27;d be fun to put Date Night Questions out into the world where anyone could use it.<p>My mom (beta tester #1) said: &quot;It&#x27;s fun. And, I&#x27;ve learned so many funny things about your dad. He took a class from Buckminster Fuller! We&#x27;ve been together 38 years! I probably knew that years ago, but have forgotten.&quot;<p>My wife designed and illustrated everything. I built her designs as set of web components (Deck, Card, etc) with Lit-Element.')
