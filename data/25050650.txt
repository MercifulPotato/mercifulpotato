The point of these reports is to get to the &quot;primary causes&quot; of the accident and include design decisions that contribute to an accident.<p>These are trained pilots who did not follow their training. They didn&#x27;t follow procedures that were in place for these types of events. They did not follow cockpit management procedures. They didnt know how to properly deal with stall conditions, a fundamental piloting skill. They managed to crash a airplane that was flying perfectly fine.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the fixation on the sidestick. Its not like they just tossed it in there. Thousands of engineer hours were spent creating the systems to manage control inputs. It may have been a contributing factor, but the sidestick isn&#x27;t even mentioned in the proposed improvements section. This was pilot failure.')
