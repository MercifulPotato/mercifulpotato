There&#x27;s a small icon with three twinkling stars. Click it. You&#x27;ll see two options: &quot;Latest tweets&quot; (pre-2019 behavior) and &quot;Top tweets&quot; (2019+ default).<p>Change it to &quot;Latest tweets.&quot;<p>The change will last as long as your session does. For whatever reason, it will revert to &quot;Top tweets&quot; every time your browser&#x27;s session expires. I assume Twitter does that to nudge people to experience the new feed ordering, but I think silently reverting it probably just baffles and&#x2F;or frustrates them.')
