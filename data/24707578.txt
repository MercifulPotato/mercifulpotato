Almost like a form of objectification.<p>Look at him, dressed like a dandy, with his accomplishments framed and a much too clean workspace and Hollywood scientist accessories.<p>That&#x27;s not how I portrait a hacker, especially not a kid hacker. I want to see him on a workbench with tools all over the place, I want to know how he solved the hundred of problems that arose. I want to see him yelled at by his parents because he didn&#x27;t follow safety rules. Everything looks too clean to be true. I don&#x27;t mean that kid is a fraud, but the article doesn&#x27;t really show his &quot;hacker&quot; side, besides a few pictures taken when he was younger.')
