I did not mean to imply a global ordering of places to live. I interpreted the original question &quot;what practically speaking is so intolerable about living there or your neighbors?&quot; as &quot;what ... is so intolerable [for someone who doesn&#x27;t wish to live there] ...&quot;. It is perfectly reasonable that you find it enjoyable to live there and I find it intolerable. I interpreted the question as &quot;why do you find it intolerable&quot; not &quot;why should I find it intolerable&quot; since the latter is harder to answer - I don&#x27;t know your desire vector and&#x2F;or moral foundations.<p>And to be clear, I did not mean illegal immigration. I meant legal immigration.')
