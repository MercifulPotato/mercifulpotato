I&#x27;ll sometimes ignore the update for a few hours, but not usually longer than that.<p>If I need to retain some information over a period of more than a few hours, I&#x27;ll transfer it to a note-taking app or something similar. Habitually <i>not</i> keeping a large number of tabs open helps me maintain focus to some extent, and deliberating over whether to close a tab or window presents and opportunity to think about extracting a snippet for storage elsewhere.<p>To me the idea of keeping an entire webpage open as a method of storing what is likely a very small subset of what it contains just doesn&#x27;t seem &quot;right&quot;, regardless of <i>actual</i> resource consumption on the computer I&#x27;m using.')
