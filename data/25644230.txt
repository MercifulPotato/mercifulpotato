If someone does not agree with what we store or host, it may be rejected and even banned&#x2F;deleted WITH our consent (because we accepted the EULA) but without our authorization. We would not own anything we create or send to the cloud.<p>We would all become Cloud Developers, Cloud Web Developers, Cloud Engineer, Cloud SRE in our resumees.<p>This should be more open and not be driven by Vendor Lock-in.')
