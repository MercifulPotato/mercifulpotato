His wife, Cindy Engstrom, said he had injured one of his feet in October, accidentally took too much Tylenol for pain relief and suffered liver damage.<p>As sad as it is to lose a person at age 55, it&#x27;s even harder to digest the tylenol induced liver failure part until you experience foot injury&#x2F;pain. I spent last December in excruciating foot pain that came out of nowhere and the thought of wanting to guzzle down entire bottle of Advil&#x2F;Tylenol touched my mind at least couple times.<p>Anyway, RIP.
