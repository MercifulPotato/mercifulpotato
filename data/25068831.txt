But if you consider the packaging (small, light, sturdy, now-decent keyboard), and consider their performance, and then consider macOS, I think they are more than competitive.<p>Even if you match every spec, including size&#x2F;weight and durability, it comes down to Windows vs macOS.  Ironically, macOS is free while Windows is not, but macOS is worth more (to me and many others).')
