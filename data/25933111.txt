There are decentralized trustless platforms running on Ethereum right now. You can transact currency on a plethora of decentralized exchanges, without all the layers that doing so with an exchange of USD -&gt; RMB requires today. There are pilot programs built around blockchain that allow people to sell excess energy production (e.g. with home solar) back to other people on the &quot;grid&quot; in an entirely decentralized way.<p>And with tokens that are tied to real-life things, the benefit is that once you&#x27;ve used real-world trust systems (e.g. real-life contracts &#x2F; lawyers &#x2F; courts &#x2F; etc) to tie something to the blockchain, you can (going forward) hand everything over to the trustless and secure system. i.e. You tie your property to the blockchain once, and from then on you don&#x27;t need to involve all those inefficient systems, you just transact the tied token directly on the blockchain.<p>Just because it hasn&#x27;t been done successfully yet doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not viable. How long did the internet exist before [thing that is taken for granted on the internet now] was successful?<p>Finally, Ethereum launched in 2015, not sure where you&#x27;re getting 13 years from.')
