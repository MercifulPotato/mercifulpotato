Such that the same car would progressively score less if it were to repeat the Euro NCAP test year on year.<p>I hope this helps your concern.<p>In &#x27;standard height&#x27; cars the first impact is usually on lower limbs or torso and secondary trauma to the head will happen on the bonnet or windshield.<p>In SUV&#x27;s, pedestrian and cyclists are much likely to suffer head trauma on first impact.<p>My point is, in the horrific scenario that this should happens the survival rate will always be higher for non-SUV vehicles (ideally with longer bonnets and pedestrian friendly deformable structures).')
