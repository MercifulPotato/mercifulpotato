(With the implication that for some reason the potential employee would instead want to start low and get raises).<p>I&#x27;m not sure where &quot;The assumption is that the candidate is already worth the top of the pay range for the position&quot; comes into this. As a potential employee, i want to maximize my $$$. How much the employer thinks i&#x27;m worth is the employer&#x27;s problem not mine. If the employer gives me a choice that i can either (a) make more money or (b) make less money, i am going to choose (a), and i don&#x27;t know why anyone would chose (b), all other things being equal.')
