Item(by='pndy', descendants=None, kids=[25402125], score=None, time=1607801491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398160, text='There&#x27;s tons of skins obtainable in GW2 from gameplay; some pop from regular loot you get - the very basic ones, for some you need <i>a little bit</i> of engagement like dungeon, fractal, raid sets, (there are also pvp sets) or sets added within Living Story updates. There are rare skins you can get from mystic forge, or if you&#x27;re lucky juggling unidentified gear loot. The really exclusive ones would be legendary weapons and gemstore special offers - the latter you can still obtain via gold to gems exchange. Then there are unique cosmetic items like Queen Bee, Liquid Aurillium, Chak and Confetti indusions and Invisible Boots skin.<p>Path of Exile and GW2 seems to be sharing microtransactions model - both include account&#x2F;character upgrades, convenience items and additional more appealing skins. Not sure about PoE but GW2 still allows you to exchange in-game currency for shop currency &#x2F; gems to gold at I&#x27;d say fair rate.')
