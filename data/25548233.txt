If it falls short of their expectations, ask which dimensions contribute the most to the diff.<p>This might give you some perspective on what life would be like in another vertical. It probably isn&#x27;t as rosy as you imagine, but you might have done this already.<p>---<p>I would recommend to younger people, that they shouldn&#x27;t make their career choice through the lens of prestige, because time has demonstrated that social standing is flimsy and unpredictable.<p>A profession&#x27;s relative prestige varies regionally, temporally, socioeconomically, and in the eye of the beholder. These are mutable dimensions for the duration of a normal career.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like the old advice: if you&#x27;re interested in marrying someone for life, don&#x27;t marry based on one dimension alone (looks, money, health, personality, family). Any of these can invert completely.<p>In finance terms, it&#x27;s like betting your financial portfoilo on the 40-year performance of a single ETF: not outright stupid because some people will be successful, but it&#x27;s not super wise.<p>If this doesn&#x27;t help you feel better, maybe you should consider changing careers? As a SWE, you have enough intellectual capital, time and domain-specific education is the only thing standing in your way.')
