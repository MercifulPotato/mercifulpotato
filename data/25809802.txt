For instance, I want it to alert me as soon as there&#x27;s a web connection and that&#x27;s only possible with the current connection model and for security measures I think it&#x27;s safer to have only one instance at a time.<p>The connection reliability is a hassle but usually when you&#x27;re in the desktop you also have a good wifi connection and even though the web client loses connectivity temporarily it keeps working as good as it can.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s easy to forget that you have an active session in other apps such as Telegram unless you keep track of it in your app. Someone you share your laptop with can just open the Telegram app and they&#x27;ll be able to see my chat conversations be default.<p>I know some of these things might be something you&#x27;d prefer but I choose the hassle instead.')
