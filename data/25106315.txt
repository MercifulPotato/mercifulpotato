With higher market share the malware will come.<p>Linux has a higher server market share already, and its virus problem there is still not as bad as Windows&#x27;.<p>&gt; &gt; No bullshit forced updates when the OS feels like it.<p>&gt; True, but that also means you&#x27;re going to end up with a lot more botnet nodes out there because people will never update. Or they&#x27;ll never update and still complain things are not working.<p>Today, Windows has forced updates and Linux doesn&#x27;t, and Windows hosts are more likely to be part of a botnet than Linux hosts.<p>&gt; distros won&#x27;t distribute nonfree drivers by default, for ideological reasons.<p>True but misleading. For example, Ubuntu doesn&#x27;t install nonfree drivers by default, but all you have to do to install them is check the checkbox when the installer asks you. Way easier than dealing with drivers on Windows.')
