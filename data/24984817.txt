I have a Brother DCPL2550DW that I got for $130 when the pandemic started and it&#x27;s been better than the LaserJet 4 ever was in the following ways: more reliable (not a single jam), duplex printing out of the box, much cheaper, built-in networking (both Ethernet and WiFi), uses a modern interface (USB) that modern computers actually have ports for, built-in combo flatbed&#x2F;feed tray scanner, better&#x2F;more intuitive buttons on the printer, faster printer speed, and high enough data throughput to max out its print speed even for complicated pages.  For a bit more money you can get a version of this that does duplex feed scanning as well (it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me but it was for troydavis in one of the sibling comments).<p>The LaserJet 4 was fine for its time but it doesn&#x27;t compare to decent modern printers.  Substantial improvements have been made over the past few decades.')
