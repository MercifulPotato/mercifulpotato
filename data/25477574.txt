I had a &#x27;friend&#x27; in high school, an only child. We&#x27;d be doing some group activity and look around and &quot;Hey! Where did Kirk go?&quot;<p>Next day, I&#x27;d ask. &quot;My TV show was starting&quot;. No goodbye, no excuses, just said it like it was a reasonable thing.<p>See, he valued &#x27;friends&#x27; as long as they were more entertaining than a TV show. Then he&#x27;d simply choose a more entertaining option. Screw the friends; screw social norms; just go stimulate his senses with something else for a while. Totally self-interested in a sense.<p>So only children can certainly be strange.')
