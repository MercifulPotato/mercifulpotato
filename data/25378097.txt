It is up to them to prove it.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve already provided you with links and citations, but you&#x27;re ignoring them, so I&#x27;m not going to waste my time on that again, since you&#x27;re arguing in bad faith, and have already proven you won&#x27;t read them anyway.<p>These are the three links you provided, prior to this post:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_troll#Concern_troll</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;944744105&#x2F;trump-asks-supreme-court-to-let-him-join-widely-scorned-texas-election-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;944744105&#x2F;trump-asks-supreme-...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DZmyFid7FRg&amp;ab_channel=LateNightwithSethMeyers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DZmyFid7FRg&amp;ab_channel=LateN...</a><p>The first link is an ad hominem attack.  The substance of the second link is summarized by the below quote from that link:\n&quot;As election law expert Richard Hasen put it about the Texas filing, &quot;This is a press release masquerading as a lawsuit. ... What utter garbage. Dangerous garbage, but garbage.&quot;\nThat link was entirely missing in substance and provided no useful information, it just called the lawsuit &quot;garbage&quot; without providing any detail.\nThe third link (youtube) was likewise missing in substance and was very similar in substance&#x2F;style as the second link.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize you were expecting a response to these links, as they have no meaningful substance.<p>If you can provide a link with meaningful substance, that counters the specific claims being made in the Texas lawsuit, or any other election lawsuit, I would like to see it.<p>&gt; If you support states rights so much, then why do you support Texas interfering in other states rights, or does it only go one way?<p>I actually don&#x27;t think Texas should be interfering in other states elections.  The reason I posted a link to the Texas lawsuit, is that the document very well summarizes the evidence that is available in the various states.<p>If Texas loses that lawsuit because the judges determine that &quot;Texas has no business interfering with other states elections&quot;, that would be a positive outcome for me.<p>If it&#x27;s fine with you, I&#x27;ll disregard the rest of your post as it was based on a faulty assumption, and seems to be getting off topic.  If you have anything productive to add please do so, but I would prefer if you stay away from the ad hominem attacks &#x2F; strawman arguments.')
