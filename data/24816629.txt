Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603014201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24816189, text='&gt; The types of folks who are deeply affected by large governments having logs of their transactions are not the downtrodden masses<p>Those same masses don&#x27;t care about cameras everywhere, they don&#x27;t care about websites tracking them etc; they have no privacy concerns at all outside &#x27;hope they cannot see me naked when in the shower&#x27; (which i&#x27;m not sure about with all the camera devices either though), so that&#x27;s not a very good example imho.<p>I don&#x27;t want the gov to see every transaction I make, but i&#x27;m not into trafficking, corruption or money laundering or whatever. It is not the govs business; it is their business to see how much money I get in and for me to pay taxes over that. They do not need details of anything unless i&#x27;m a suspected criminal. But there is the rub, in my opinion, they would need to prove I did something to warrant that, not blanket rules like AML over everything financial.<p>&gt; The uptake for real transactions seems like itâ€™s near zero.<p>Not sure, most my work (and many people I know, especially since covid) these days gets paid in crypto because it&#x27;s international, fast, easy and there are no limits (unlike banks who start AML freezing stuff willy-nilly). I declare everything as income and outgoing business income&#x2F;expenses. Works fine. It&#x27;s fast and convenient for non-crime payments; I pay people with it as well. Especially for large amounts.<p>Also; I do not work in or with blockchain tech generally, but my clients started asking if they could pay in it this year (they also don&#x27;t work in blockchain, but it&#x27;s just far more convenient and faster and cheaper than SWIFT payments internationally).<p>I also see no use for it vs local banks; most banking transactions locally here are instant and simple, but international money is still very annoying and can take a long time (and, as we have seen, often bounces or stalls for no visible reason at all).')
