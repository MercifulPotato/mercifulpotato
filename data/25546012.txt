Both of my FWD cars get front tires to wear more, and if I wanted to keep the better tread on the back, I&#x27;d never rotate them, and fronts would wear out much faster than the backs.<p>Not to mention that front wheels also have bigger brake rotors, so worse tread up front would also mean worse breaking.')
