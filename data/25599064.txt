Nothing in there suggested 2 spaces after a full stop ;) And the manual used to talk about the &quot;computer programme&quot;!<p>I guess it&#x27;s down to teacher and style, as you say. I find it interesting that I never met this until post 2000 internet forums with Americans, though. I wonder how widespread it is.<p>And like tabs vs spaces, I get that there&#x27;s a &quot;this is the way&quot; answer. Tabs are the right answer, and anyone who says spaces is an idiot. But 2 spaces after a full stop is clearly the right way, but I&#x27;m buggered if I can bring myself to do that ;)')
