Sure, you <i>can</i> do something like that with Nim&#x27;s macros, but you can&#x27;t expect that all third party code is going to play nice.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with the macro approach: it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s ultra-flexible, but it also sucks because it&#x27;s ultra-flexible. Everybody ends up doing their own little DSL that fits their use case or their personal taste, and it adds friction at the interfaces.')
