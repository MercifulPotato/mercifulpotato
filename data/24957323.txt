But Microsoft didn&#x27;t have the fight in them to really push it as a competitor to PDF. In part, I suspect b&#x2F;c it&#x27;s hard to justify investing a lot of money in your competing document standard as there is not much revenue you can derive from it. As of 2018, Microsoft no longer bundles XPS support in Windows 10.')
