I don&#x27;t think that assumption is justified.<p>Consider an exactly one minute outage that affects multiple things I use for work.<p>First, I may not immediately recognize that the outage is actually with some single service provider. If several things are out I&#x27;m probably going to suspect it is something on my end, or maybe with my ISP. I might spend several minutes thoroughly checking that possibility out, before noticing that whatever it was seems to have been resolved.<p>Second, even if I immediately recognize it for what it is and immediately notice when it ends it might take me several minutes to get back to where I was. Not everything is designed to automatically and transparently recover from disruptions, and so I might have had things in progress when the outage stuck that will need manual cleanup and restarting.')
