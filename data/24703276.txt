Even the book you read that purports to teach you someething that you find worthless for the task should be illustrative of either what things are not useful for you in learning that, or how to structure something in such a way that it&#x27;s hard for you to take away good meaning from it, and ultimately, some hints about what to look for next time that doesn&#x27;t have the same problems.<p>So, copying isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>creating</i>, but it should be an act of <i>learning</i>, and learning should hopefully help in creating, even if it&#x27;s something totally divorced from what you were originally copying.')
