They kind of look like subscription services, or worse places you have to join or else there are unintended consequences from other examples where they mention looking at union membership as an indicator of some experience (so kind of like a tax).<p>The screen actors guild and all the movie-related guilds seem interesting, but aren&#x27;t those kind of like freelancers more than closer to fully employed people? I guess it would be beneficial for salary negotiation for non-software engineers and maybe contractos, but I don&#x27;t really see the incentive to join one as a fulltime software engineer.<p>Maybe I have a bad opinion on unions due to how they operated in my country that&#x27;s not US :D.')
