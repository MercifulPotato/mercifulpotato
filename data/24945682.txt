Attackers know that they won&#x27;t succeed, that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t even try, and that&#x27;s why CF doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant attacks against their clients. Your average hosting company will quickly fold against a large attack, and will then have to make a decision: suffer the attack, or kick you from their servers. It&#x27;s obvious that they will kick you out.<p>Keeping a website available against opponents with some money to spend gives you a handful of companies that you can rely on.')
