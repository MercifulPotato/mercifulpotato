For instance, I might have a special handler via userfaultfd(2) that detects if I&#x27;m doing an increment of the null pointer and handles it in some special way, but can&#x27;t handle just setting it to 10. For a more real example, I might have acquired a lock around do_substuff, and I might be okay with the thread segfaulting only if the lock wasn&#x27;t held.')
