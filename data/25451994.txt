Computers have always held my attention better. I&#x27;ve gotten much more into reading _after_ having a kid because I wanted them to love books and be better at reading then I am.<p>Started by reading to my kid before bed. Even at a really young age when the book didn&#x27;t mean anything, it still seemed to calm them. It allowed me the opportunity to A) read anything I wanted, B) build a foundational hobby over time, and C) spend time with my child. They now bring me books (usually whatever story we&#x27;re reading at the time, but occasionally a short kids book) and I make a point to take a break and read to them. Because of that and other events this year, I&#x27;ve been able to complete dozens of books.')
