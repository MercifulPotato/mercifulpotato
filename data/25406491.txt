It&#x27;s more likely that the security flaws are patched quickly in Wordpress. Whatever else you&#x27;ll use, you&#x27;ll be just as dependent on that. Wordpress is very performant if you optimize it for that.<p>There are many other choices depending on what you want. If you just want a blog with a comment section, you could use hugo + disqus and host it on an s3 bucket. It will be fast and will cost very little to host.<p>You could go with something like Laravel if you want more control over the dynamic website. I say Laravel because if you&#x27;ve been developing for Wordpress, PHP is the most familiar language.<p>There&#x27;s always Joomla which is more flexible and will give you some diversity while being familiar (also PHP).<p>If you&#x27;re OK with Python, there&#x27;s always the trusted old Plone CMS.<p>There are many other choices. Depends on what kind of websites you want to build and what you&#x27;re looking for.')
