Certainly normal prosecutors could get convictions on that sort of thing[1] in normal courts.  The only reason it seems gray is because the speaker is the President.<p>[1] Remember that in context they were at the capitol because Trump himself, in person, had directed they march there just an hour before.  I mean, really, that&#x27;s pretty open-and-shut as far as mens rea.')
