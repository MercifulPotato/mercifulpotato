Introduced in 1992, and by 1996 cryptographers were already recommending that people switch to a replacement such as SHA-1 or RIPEMD-160.<p>SHA256 meanwhile was introduced in 2001, and since then no significant attacks have been found. So not only has it withstood attack for much longer, cryptography has advanced greatly compared to what we knew in 1992.<p>That still isn&#x27;t a guarantee of future success. But look at it this way: I don&#x27;t think you could have introduced Bitcoin in 1998. Hash functions were just too new to be trusted to the extent that Bitcoin requires.')
