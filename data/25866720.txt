This is pretty much parser combinator syntax but restricted to regexes.\nDX-wise, I&#x27;d just prefer a parser combinator library.<p>In practice this probably compiles to a regex for performance reasons: a JS parser is probably much slower than hooking JS to a C regex library.<p>In a faster (compiled) language you don&#x27;t have this limit, eg. Haskell and Rust have several popular parser combinators libraries.')
