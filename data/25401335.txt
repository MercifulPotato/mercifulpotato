Item(by='zemo', descendants=None, kids=[25401661, 25401847, 25401910], score=None, time=1607804514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398429, text='he poses the idea of being earnest about something in a way that is disingenuous.<p>&gt; Why can&#x27;t there be people interested in self-driving cars or social networks for their own sake?<p>If you are interested in self-driving cars, but you are not interested in the effects that self-driving cars have on society, you are not actually interested in self-driving cars: you are interested in yourself. To be interested only in the problem-solving aspect of a domain is, first and foremost, to be interested in your own mastery. I am not saying that it is bad to be motivated by mastery: I am personally very motivated by mastery. It&#x27;s what has kept my interest after a decade of programming professionally. I relate to being interested in a problem because it&#x27;s an interesting puzzle.<p>But we should not pretend that being interested in the aspect of solving a problem is the most genuine manner of interacting with that problem (or the opposite: that caring about the side-effects of your work more than you care about the work itself is somehow lacking in earnesty). It is not. What you are building does not stop at the problem-solving phase. How the things you build affect the world is what you have done. If we set our ethical standard at &quot;so long as I am interested in doing the building, I am being earnest&quot;, our efforts will forever be deployed by others, perhaps with effects that do not align with our values.')
