On the other hand, being able to rewrite operators in Ruby does take it a bit in that directionâ€”While not strictly new syntax, changing the meaning of an operator can really throw people off.  As an example in the standard library, there is `Dir[]`.  `Dir[]` is a shortcut to `Dir.glob`.  Sure, it&#x27;s technically doing some kind of access, but everyone knows it as hash access and certainly aren&#x27;t accustom to passing a pattern to it.  Elixir libs do stuff like this.<p>And I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t know if can actually add new syntax in Elixir, but you can certainly change the meaning of existing syntax (as in Ruby).')
