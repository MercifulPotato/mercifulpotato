If I remember rightly I set up multiple VPN connections (across multiple geographic locations) and set up a way to link them all together as a logical interface (I think it was called a gateway). I then pushed out that gateways IP to the server over DHCP. I guess routing tables would have also worked. I assume all of this is possible with just pf.<p>These days, I have removed this functionality from my router and moved it directly onto the server. I run the container               haugene&#x2F;transmission-openvpn which creates and maintains a VPN for transmission, but also has a proxy I can direct other containers to use. This has the benefit of keeping more of the prerequisites of these servers managed in the same docker compose file. It bakes in most of the popular public VPN configs, so you can enable them with a few ENV vars.')
