Item(by='input_sh', descendants=None, kids=[25604324], score=None, time=1609517232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602236, text='&gt; Investigative journalism, I hope so.<p>I work for one (not involved in the actual stories) and I can guarantee that the process I&#x27;ve seen is pretty meticulous.<p>&gt; But general journalism...<p>There&#x27;s a separation that needs to be done here as well between news and columns &#x2F; opinion pieces. News are supposed to answer what&#x27;s known as Five Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why), while columns&#x2F;opinion pieces are rarely expected to be held to same standards, are often inaccurate, and subjective by their nature (they are <i>opinion</i> pieces after all). Unfortunately they&#x27;re almost always published under the same brand, but usually when I see people complaining about journalism, they don&#x27;t make that distinction.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say news in itself is not biased, because even picking what&#x27;s newsworthy is a process that relies on bias.')
