When looking into the root cause it turned out that the bug was created 18 months ago. So for 18 months it went unnoticed and then multiple people come across it pretty much at the same time. This has happened a few times and the people who found the bug were working on different things so it&#x27;s not like they find it because they&#x27;re working in the same area.')
