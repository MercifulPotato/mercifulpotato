Item(by='bardworx', descendants=None, kids=[24661084, 24651249], score=None, time=1601558714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650095, text='You probably know what you&#x27;re doing but for a beginner, 2x4 isn&#x27;t a good choice because:<p>1. 2x4 are not 2&quot; x 4&quot; and when you start, you make a lot of assumptions that land you in hot water.<p>2. A beginner will not know what does &quot;green&quot; vs. &quot;klin&quot; mean and will have a hard time getting anything to be straight.<p>3. Construction lumber is made for construction and not interior use because of many different factors.<p>I would highly recommend choosing poplar 1x8 boards (they will neither be perfectly 1 inch in thickness nor 8 inches in width but close). They are easy to work with because poplar is soft, even though it called a &quot;hardwood&quot;. And the wood takes paint and stain very well.<p>Also, with poplar, your list of beginner tools will be spot on. You wouldn&#x27;t even need much more and I&#x27;m confident that I can put together a good enough kit for under $250 by using only corded tools and an extension cord.')
