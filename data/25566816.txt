For me, the best API which we discovered this year was a CRUD API for handling i18n keys in our system. We were using our in-house solution to keep translation keys in SQL together with translations. The support team was maintaining the translations, and we as a dev team were responsible for translation keys and own translation editor. This year my colleague found an app called SimpleLocalize which provides a simple CRUD API, and translation editor for a fairly good price (important factor due to COVID). We removed our submodule for translation management (which was buggy as hell) and switched totally to the simple CRUD. Feels good man. We cut 1&#x2F;10 of code which was mainly used by our translation management.')
