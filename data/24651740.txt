Make cool stuff. Learn every day. ---<p>Atomic is growing a diverse and inclusive team of curious, creative people who love creating great software for our clients.<p>JOB OVERVIEW\nAtomic makers work on self-managed teams of 2-10 designers, delivery leads, developers, and testers. They collaborate to create products for our clients, from the idea phase through launch and beyond. Teams are project-based, so you&#x27;ll get to work with new people and tackle new challenges every 6-12 months.<p>As a software developer at Atomic, most of your time will be spent writing tests and code alongside other Atoms. But your role isn’t limited to technical responsibilities. Atomic promises clients a great experience and a great product. Software developers deliver on that promise by being kind, curious, positive individuals who provide excellent high-level technical advice to a diverse set of clients.<p>WHY ATOMIC?\nSince 2001, Atomic Object has designed and developed software products for web, mobile, desktop, IoT, and connected devices. We were founded on the belief that not all software is created equal. Many people can write code, but it takes a close-knit team of passionate people to create exceptional, innovative products that change the way people do business.<p>We’re an employee-owned company and a certified B Corporation with 70+ Atoms based in our Ann Arbor and Grand Rapids offices. Unlike many other technology companies, we have a flat organization. There is no corporate ladder to climb. As a company that values transparency, we practice open-books management. At Atomic, you can stay close to the craft of making software for your entire career without missing out on owning a part of the company and its profits.<p>INTERESTED?\nIf you&#x27;d like to find out more about Atomic or this position, don&#x27;t hesitate to check out our current open position:\nSenior Software Developer &amp; Consultant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomicobject.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-developer-job" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;atomicobject.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;senior-software-developer-j...</a>')
