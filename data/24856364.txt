There&#x27;s a lot of foreign language content that clogged up my front page and I&#x27;m not even in Europe for some elementary locale checking to try and match content. Then of course, decentralised streaming in this way is incredibly slow and has the same pitfalls as torrents: If there aren&#x27;t any&#x2F;enough peers you&#x27;re screwed or just generally going to have a really bad time.')
