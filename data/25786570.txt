I was amazed, and it was the intent, that independent of how few or many videos you played and no matter when you started each of them, all sounds blended together nicely.<p>I don’t know what to call it when there’s no inter-sound coordination - a timing independent harmony?  It was so cool.<p>Anyways, I would be super interested in attending a zoom concept of that sort that might side step some technical difficulties.')
