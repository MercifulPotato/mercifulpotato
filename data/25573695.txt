I still use ruby all the time though, mostly for scripts&#x2F;automation that violate my rule on bash v. other lang for scripts (basically do I need arrays, maps, or to parse json beyond simple extractions that jq is great at).  I do have a couple sinatra services now though that I maintain.  Sinatra is wonderful with simple needs like mine.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much of an anomaly I am though, interested in hearing from others as well.<p>Edit:  not looking to debate bash vs other langs here.  Of course you&#x27;re free to do such below, but I won&#x27;t be engaging (got to focus on work and have had the debate many times and I don&#x27;t think any of us will ever convince the other.  It&#x27;s become religion at this point).<p>Also I use Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix these days for use cases that used to be rails')
