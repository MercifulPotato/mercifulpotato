We can’t possibly catch up to the skill, tooling, and pure ability of the Asian countries making our stuff.<p>Tim Cook points out that many believe it’s about labor costs, and that’s largely a matter of arrogance in my opinion. Many of us don’t even realize how few of us here can actually make the stuff we design. Even if we could afford our own labor, we couldn’t find the people to pay to do it anyway. How will we compete?<p>I’m actually curious if anyone knows what the solution to this is. It worries me quite a bit. I don’t see a bright future for North America because we can’t manufacture so many things and I think it’s going to eventually bite us very hard.')
