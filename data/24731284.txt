The biggest place CodeQL is used right now is lgtm.com, which is used in CI as an automatic check for code quality and common mistakes (including security vulnerabilities). I took a different approach, making a tool that auditors can use that prioritizes finding as much stuff as possible over reducing false positives. lgtm.com is awesome, but there is a limit to what you can identify in a CI pipeline. Itergator-style tools are essential to finding deep&#x2F;complex vulns that require heuristics and manual inspection.')
