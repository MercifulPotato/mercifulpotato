Have you seen what people dying from COVID actually look like? I still get stressed out just recalling a video that showed a patient with COVID in a hospital hallway taking these horrible rapid short breaths that didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for them.<p>What you described is why COVID is so deadly to society as a whole. The people it &quot;barely affects&quot; get off with a flu (and often some lifetime complications but that&#x27;s a special treat for later when we start seeing the long term effects of an inflamed heart) and the &quot;few&quot; it affects end up being massive drains on our healthcare system. Then the people who end up between those two extremes end up with a less prepared healthcare system and so on...<p>I found myself driving much more carefully post-COVID the times that I have because if I get in a serious accident something tells me the standard of care is not going to be near where it normally is....<p>Of course, the same people who talk tough like this and think &quot;oh well if I get COVID just let me die! I probably won&#x27;t die from it anyways!&quot; are inevitably some of the same people who end up fighting for their lives in dark rooms alone regretting everything that lead them there...')
