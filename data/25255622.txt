Even for n = 1,000,000, <i>O(e^n)</i> isn’t necessarily problematic, <i>if</i> the constant is small enough, or if you throw enough hardware at it.<p>This “uses approximately 128 TPUv3 cores (roughly  equivalent to ~100-200 GPUs) run over a few weeks”. That is a moderate amount of hardware for this kind of work, so it seems they have a more efficient algorithm.<p>Also, this algorithm doesn’t solve protein folding in the mathematical sense; it ‘just’ produces good approximations.')
