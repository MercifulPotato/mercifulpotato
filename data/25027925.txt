Let&#x27;s also bear in mind, though, that even with all the people voting this year that&#x27;s still I think less than half of all eligible voters.<p>Other countries which have national voting holidays or making voting mandatory (which tbh I kind of like; you&#x27;re a citizen, it&#x27;s your duty, you can go vote for no one but goddamnit you have to vote) see much higher turnout.<p>This means that votes alone don&#x27;t currently present an entirely accurate picture of the view of the country.<p>There is also the vote surpression which is nontrivial and hard to measure. Probably not a massive difference but perhaps more than a tiny one.<p>Lastly I&#x27;m actually not a fan of Biden&#x27;s age. I&#x27;d like to see more politicians under the age of 50.<p>By the way although I&#x27;m sharing my disagreements I thought your comments were thoughtful and insightful and appreciate our conversation : ).')
