RPC is always going to be a more reliable approach.<p>If something goes wrong with a complex system, I would much rather an exception be raised immediately and crater the caller than have a message wind up not being answered silently and having to remember to check other areas of the system after the fact.<p>I have worked in environments that used messaging on a massive scale, and can vividly recall having to write adhoc software to reprocess 3+ gigabytes worth of messages that failed to be picked up by another system.<p>A simple example would be a &quot;Constraint Warning&quot; message that might be produced by some factory tool. Perhaps you want to make sure all lots that tripped that warning are handled in an extra QC phase to double check things. Perhaps this is another system listening for these messages. What happens if that system fails to see these for whatever reason and you dont have a full-time employee monitoring dead letter queues? You might end up with weeks worth of broken products in your logistics chain and millions of dollars in damages before you figure out what went wrong.')
