Item(by='webmobdev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607265026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321461, text='&gt; You also know the thief will mostly be stuck with a low-value device that is all but useless without some sort of jailbreak or scam to resell it.<p>(1) Jailbreak is a feature for many who consider it a way to free their iDevices from Apples&#x27;s iron clutches.<p>(2) And I used to think too that remote locking the device makes it less viable for thieves. Turns out that&#x27;s a fallacy because they are doing what some automobile theives do now - strip it and sell the parts. (And thanks to Apple&#x27;s exorbitant prices for its parts and suing most &quot;unauthorized&quot; sellers &#x2F; suppliers, that&#x27;s a lucrative market too.)')
