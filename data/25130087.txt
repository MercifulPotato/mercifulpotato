I often use a style checker on my fiction, to highlight repeated words, sentence fragments, passive voice, overused words, and clich√©s. Most of the suggestions I ignore (particularly sentence fragments, which I use a lot in stories), but it&#x27;s still a good exercise in making me consider whether I can rephrase sentences to be stronger or more interesting. Sometimes passive voice is what you want, but sometimes the sentence is better in an active voice; it&#x27;s easy to overuse intensifiers like &quot;really&quot; and &quot;very&quot;; and there&#x27;s a few other verbal tics that tools like that can catch.<p>Technical writing may be a bit more formal, but you still have to selectively apply suggestions from tools like this.<p>Having said all that, I find Hemingway Editor to be infuriatingly bad at this. It&#x27;s terrible at actually <i>editing,</i> while it&#x27;s a plain text editor it&#x27;s not Markdown-aware, and it doesn&#x27;t actually catch the sort of things I&#x27;d want such a tool to watch for (like &quot;actually&quot; earlier in this sentence). Its primary function is to harangue you about sentence length.')
