The double slit delayed choice quantum erasure experiment is analogous to time travel as there is no way the particles could &quot;know&quot; that their path would be observed at some point in the future, yet if they were, those particles mysteriously only took paths that created the gaps. Given that this is a real, testable phenomenon in the real testable universe, it would not require magic to explain that idea that only timelines in which a time traveler doesn&#x27;t cause a paradox can exist. The time traveler, like the particles in the experiment, chooses paths as they see fit and it only later turns out that they necessarily were ones in which paradoxes were avoided.')
