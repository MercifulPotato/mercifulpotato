Think back a few years to when Apple refused to open a felon&#x27;s iPhone for the US government, because &quot;they couldn&#x27;t.&quot; If that happened now, they wouldn&#x27;t even have to ask Apple, given the felon has Face ID enabled.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m kind of surprised by the downvotes, given I thought HN was pretty big on personal privacy. Just thought I&#x27;d stir up the discussion, that&#x27;s all.<p>Edit 2: I personally think U2F is the way forward here, not Face ID or Touch ID or other biometrics.')
