Because of this false premise, we need to be eagerly building weapons as fast as possible&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a classic argument and it stands up to no scrutiny whatsoever.<p>So instead the standard response is to generalize it through a deflection: &quot;this is just general forward motion progress&quot; which is exactly what happened.<p>That&#x27;s not the point.  It&#x27;s the idea that the fundamental inescapable nature of humans is to be as violent and brutal as possible - which is not true - it&#x27;s a <i>choice</i>, an act of <i>agency</i>, a <i>matter of policy</i>, it&#x27;s a <i>decision</i> that is freely made.<p>Just getting to that simple realization, that barbaric brutal self-destruction takes choices, planning and intentional action that we can simply just choose not to do, would be a groundbreaking epiphany to most.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident I&#x27;m going to die without murdering anyone, just like almost every human ever. It&#x27;s not natural in the slightest.')
