Set up office down the road\n2. Poach top engineers\n3. Come up with some excuse to cancel use of supplier and integrate in house.<p>The media and fanboys are remarkably complicit, coming up with excuses for apple&#x27;s behaviour and giving very favourable coverage.<p>In this case, intel are too big for this trick to work and apple already have loads of ARM talent so it makes perfect sense to transition.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t rule out apple trying on the whole &#x27;we don&#x27;t need a license&#x27; thing any more with Nvidia but it&#x27;s probably unlikely given their size.<p>I worked at imagination technologies who was bankrupted by Apple doing this technique and whose GPUs are still used by them so I saw this and people&#x27;s remarkable lack of attention on the incredibly consistent pattern of control first hand.<p>While all of this is obviously true, I actually think it&#x27;s great that intel and AMD are receiving some serious ISA competition and it will net benefit non-apple consumers too long run.<p>Congrats to apple for pretty impressive technical work but I do wish more would see apple for the ruthless control freaks they are.<p>At the end of the day I think rather mundanely it&#x27;s really more about money than anything else.')
