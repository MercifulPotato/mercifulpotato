Nobody ever “owes” me a beer.  If I buy them one that’s the end of it.  We are always “even”.<p>I don’t assume others work the same way so I also attempt to return favors.  I think it’s a healthier frame of mind to not keep track of all the ways people potentially <i>owe</i> me something.  Especially when it is trivial.<p>If I am keeping track I think it’s worth reevaluating the relationship entirely.<p>Or said another way I can see this policy working for Buy Nothing because it requires a healthy community.  If the community is unhealthy the system breaks down.  This reverts to any number of other perfectly good money&#x2F;barter based alternatives like Craigslist and clones.')
