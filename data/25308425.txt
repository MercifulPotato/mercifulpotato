Things like music training are another area with, I think, similar patterns.<p>Almost by definition, truly top athletes are unlikely to be able to have coaches <i>more accomplished</i> than them, especially when you consider the overall trend-line in sports performance is upward.  So clearly &quot;more accomplished than you&quot; is not a strict requirement.  But it might still be the optimum for everyone else.<p>I think my personal model is this: First of all, the most-important asset for a coach is that they have a correct model of improvement in the field.  That doesn&#x27;t strictly require them to be any good at all.  However, they&#x27;re much more likely to develop a correct model if they put a bunch of time into trying to be good.  And also, if they were never good, they&#x27;re much more in danger of having a subtly-totally-wrong model of how improvement would work.  So although it&#x27;s not strictly necessary that they be any good at the activity itself, it markedly improves both upside risk and downside risk.')
