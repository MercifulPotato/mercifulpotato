He lost his state and local cases contesting the election. He lost the supreme court case.<p>All this time him and his enablers have had their foot on the gas, grooming their extremists to sedition. Everyone who rules against them is &#x27;deep state.&#x27; Every Republican judge who didn&#x27;t support the cases are a &#x27;Chinacrat RINO.&#x27; Liberals are considered sub-human.<p>There is open talk of executions again. &#x27;Treason against (Trump&#x27;s) patriots.&#x27; They say. Their proof is claims, claims peddled by who?<p>Trump and his enablers. The Koch&#x27;s properties, Murdoch&#x27;s. Lately Epochtimes and Newsmax have come into favor since franchises like FoxNews are considered part of the Deep State cabal.<p>What is @rayiner trying to say? Trump lost. He can say how many votes he gained over Obama but he wasn&#x27;t running against Obama. Trump lost.<p>This needs to end. There has been too many shootings, a &#x27;MAGA bomber.&#x27; Right now election officials have mobs outside their homes calling for their deaths. The AZ GOP asked supporters if they are willing to die.<p>Trump lost. He lost. This needs to end. It doesn&#x27;t matter that @rayiner cannot come to terms and say that Trump lost to Biden. Talking about Obama doesn&#x27;t matter. Trump lost, him and his enablers need to stop stoking their extremists and cultists because this has gone on too long.')
