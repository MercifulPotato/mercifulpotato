Item(by='AndrewBissell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607397549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25339732, text='FWIW, I post tons of unrelenting criticism of the CIA and the Western establishment and haven&#x27;t encountered anything like this. The worst I&#x27;ve seen from mods was back in 2019 when they would constantly flag links about ties between Jeffrey Epstein and leading tech industry figures.<p>The &quot;posting too fast&quot; limit is just a brake which as far as I have seen is applied fairly and helps keep HN discussions on the rails (my own posting emphatically included). I think it&#x27;s possible mods reacted harshly to your criticizing it.<p>That said, I think pretty much every forum or venue is subject to some of this kind of manipulation. I certainly get an immediate torrent of downvotes whenever one of my comments is particularly pointed or &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;')
