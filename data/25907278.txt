Stupid, huh? Not as stupid as an earlier version of CoD (Black Ops 1, IIRC) that wouldn&#x27;t let you name a load out &quot;assault $WHATEVER&quot;, &#x27;cuz you know, &quot;ass&quot;. But &quot;anal&quot; is so much better so that was allowed.<p>They fixed it in later versions, but I still have a &quot;penetration&quot; class because I&#x27;m immature that way.')
