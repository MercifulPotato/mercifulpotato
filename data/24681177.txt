I actually took HTML in grade school (late 90s) and C++ in high school, but they didn&#x27;t stick. (Of course now I wish they did!) I originally went to school for TV production, which I had worked in at a local news station all through high school, but wound up getting into a band, took some time off to try that out, and then went back to community college for music.<p>I started hacking around with windows mobile circa 2006, not really programming but taking the OS apart and making custom ROMs and whatnot. A while later I decided to take a networking course as an elective, because I had been getting more interested in tech. The teacher was all about networking as a field that you didn&#x27;t have to get more than a two year degree plus some certs for, and I thought hey, I like this enough, they&#x27;ll be plenty of jobs, and it&#x27;s not much school. So I changed my major.<p>The next year my mom (who teaches at a college) said &quot;Go see if they have any internships&quot;, so I did. The lady at the department checked what she had and said &quot;Here&#x27;s something at (a major media company) as a web producer, is that applicable to your major?&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; I half-lied immediately, because it sounded very cool. The internship was great, but beyond just CMS&#x2F;production stuff, they throw Javascript&#x2F;JQuery at me. I got hooked immediately. I guess I was always a tinkerer and problem solver, but I hadn&#x27;t realized how much fun solving all these little problems and getting to see what I built come to fruition was for me. I bought some books, started teaching myself web dev and Linux (which had always intrigued me, and by &#x27;08 I had a server running FreeBSD serving up my music collection for all my friends out of my parents&#x27; house. When I graduated with a network admin degree in &#x27;10, one of my teachers immediately got me a job at a liquor store doing web and IT.<p>The great postscript to this is that today, after working in a few different places across the spectrum of web and hosting, I&#x27;m back at the media company as a software engineer.')
