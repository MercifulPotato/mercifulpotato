I have a mid 2014 macbook running 10.12.6. It&#x27;s way better than my work laptop.<p>The work laptop is a maxed 15&quot; macbook a year or two old, and it can barley handle video conferences, let alone bazel compilations or debugging in vscode. Keyboard and touchbar are a mess as expected. I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on my worst enemy.<p>I&#x27;m going go straight to a Linux&#x2F;windows desktop, since I&#x27;m working from home anyways. More ram, cpu and a real modern video card is basically what I want, and I won&#x27;t get that with a mac.')
