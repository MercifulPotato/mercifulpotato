Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608514866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491109, text='&gt; This was absolutely a central principle of the revolution. The objections to taxation by Parliament rested on the colonists&#x27; lack of representation in that body.<p>Right, but the replacement didn&#x27;t functionally address the broad issue of consent of the governed. It replaced a government of wealthy white gentry with a wealthy white gentry in a different location. Your average American citizen didn&#x27;t actually gain much, if anything, in terms of representation. Only the upper class did (which is, in many ways, the class we&#x27;re arguing about).<p>&gt; Perhaps at the founding of the US that was true, but Pennsylvania passed a radically democratic state constitution in 1776 that was highly innovative and unusual in many ways<p>And it was practically unique in that regard. The NJ constitution had a wealth requirement and, despite originally granting women and free black people the right to vote, it later rescinded those rights!<p>Not to mention a Constitution like South Carolinas, which <i>required</i> slave ownership to hold public office.<p>But more importantly, while the US was busy regressing from the founding principles it only halfheartedly upheld, other nations were busy drafting and creating new constitutions that better uphold those ideals. And tot he point I keep returning to: our deification of the original constitution prevents many necessary improvements in that regard.<p>&gt; But it did deliver much more economic development than the old slaveocracy.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve said otherwise. You seem to think the argument I&#x27;m making somehow relies on slavery being a lynchpin of the American economy. It doesn&#x27;t. It only requires that it have been present.')
