Should not be downvoted imho.<p>Sadly, it seems that the majority of people who start researching things on their own often arrive to completely wrong conclusions. And that&#x27;s dangerous, for them and for everyone else.<p>An economist, for example, would have years of information and training in the field. And that forms a knowledge base in their brain that&#x27;s (mostly) accurate, so anything they research and learn will be more correct than what an electrician&#x2F;programmer&#x2F;politician by trade would find.<p>To put it simply, they have more information and experience.<p>Of course, there are exceptions, some people are smart and can run circles around experts, but as I said, the <i>majority</i> of people are likely to arrive at the wrong conclusions.<p>I don&#x27;t know how this could be fixed, perhaps more oversight and checks over the experts (many cases where people are just winging it or are complete frauds). But going off on your own and not trusting experts <i>at all</i> is a bad idea.')
