AWS isn&#x27;t considered a utility but I think it&#x27;s far closer to one than the other companies. I&#x27;m personally skeptical that it should be because AWS encompasses a whole range of products, many of which have decent competition and aren&#x27;t really &quot;basic&quot;.<p>The ability to host stuff yourself on the internet is, however, a freedom I consider to be basic and necessary, so I do support net neutrality and related legislation that classify ISPs as utilities.')
