It&#x27;s not common for issuers to even offer certificates that haven&#x27;t already been logged, but some applications want that, and it&#x27;s perfectly possible to do it, Google do it for some systems. The issuer has no special right to log certificates, broadly anybody can do it (big issuers have some agreement for volume performance, but you&#x27;re probably only doing one or two by hand so who cares).<p>Major logs just have a public endpoint, you give them a certificate they give you back an SCT (the timestamped &quot;proof&quot; it was logged). The modern logs tend to have two constraints: The certificate must be from a CA they trust (in almost all cases that&#x27;s going to be a similar list to the list Chrome uses) and it must expire in the right year because they&#x27;ve all sharded their backend systems by expiry date, this way all the 2019 expired certificates can get flushed away in 2020 rather than needing valuable always on-line storage forever.<p>Your HTTP server needs to actually give the SCT to the web browser (whereas if it was baked into the certificate that&#x27;s not your problem) but you can configure popular servers to do that.')
