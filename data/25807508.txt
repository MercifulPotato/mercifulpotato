Item(by='pcthrowaway', descendants=None, kids=[25809000], score=None, time=1610850524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807082, text='&gt; It takes a lot of disposable income to be a serious climber.<p>If you&#x27;re not specifically talking about high-altitude climbing, then I&#x27;d argue this is wrong.

Lots of serious climbers build up their rack from &quot;booty&quot; (taking material abandoned by other climbers in a range of situations, often bordering on questionably unethical), live in a van or a tent, hitchhike, etc.')
