This is especially true in a place like HN, where its entirely possible the core maintainers of a project may read my feedback, and may or may not feel inclined to clarify, quantify, or at least acknowledge what I have to say about a project.<p>I&#x27;m not bringing it down by being honest in how I feel. My praise for nim is genuine and forthright, and I&#x27;ve recommended many others looking to get more performance coming from a Python background give it an honest look. This is completely subjective, but I don&#x27;t like &#x27;ugliness&#x27; in a syntax. Sometimes it can be changed, sometimes it can&#x27;t, and it is what it is, I get that, doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t mention it. There&#x27;s a certain beauty to how a syntax <i>looks</i> when being written, IMO. Why else would developers spend so much time on theming, font choices etc for their editors? :)<p>tl;dr I&#x27;m not one to shy away from giving honest feedback')
