This whole white-lie-in-the-public-interest never turns out well. If there was one reason attributable to the USSR&#x27;s downfall, it&#x27;s this attitude. Because socialism was better, it was okay to lie in its defense, and this lead to the equivalent of hyperinflation on both the corruption and the truthiness fronts.<p>The rapid growth of racism in blue states comes back to this attitude. If people can&#x27;t speak freely, when they have false beliefs, they keep them to themselves, and you can&#x27;t address them. The sorts of blue state beliefs about minorities are just wacko at this point.<p>People should be free to speak.<p>No, I don&#x27;t agree with OP, but this whole &quot;why talk about it?&quot; thing is an issue. You talk about things together, critically to come to a common understanding of the truth. That has a lot of value in itself. It&#x27;s not all about impact of words, and how you can politick the change you want in the world. Society works better when people speak openly, even when those words are false and harmful, and when people can be confronted on that, not with cancel culture, but critically, logically, and civilly.<p>We&#x27;ve worked ourselves into a corner where we can&#x27;t do that anymore.')
