There&#x27;s not an easy answer.<p>First of all, to clarify, if the employee is using any racist speech at work at all, there&#x27;s no question that s&#x2F;he&#x27;s creating a hostile workplace and that warrants termination. I&#x27;m very wary of allowing any private speech to constitute a hostile workplace due to the slippery slope and ease of abuse, but I certainly empathize with the impulse.<p>If the &quot;Klan rally&quot; is burning crosses or otherwise threatening or harassing people, then the law should handle this. Basically we should have stronger protections against mobs--make it easier for the law to prosecute participants. This also would have lots of additional social benefits (including protecting victims of BLM riots).<p>If the hypothetical Klan rally is truly peaceful (however abhorrent their ideals), then all they can really do is result to the same cancel culture tactics we&#x27;re debating--if we can render those tactics impotent, then the Klan rally is impotent. Moreover, it becomes an opportunity to hold a counter-rally where we talk about why Klan ideas are abhorrent (because ideas about racial superiority&#x2F;guilt are abhorrent, etc).<p>Note that while this isn&#x27;t as satisfying as firing someone over their private speech, it provides much more protection against abuse, and it&#x27;s more holistic--it not only covers your hypothetical black employer &#x2F; racist employee scenario, but the much more common scenario involving racist employees offending their coworkers.')
