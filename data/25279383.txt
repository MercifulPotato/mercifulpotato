Item(by='Pryde', descendants=None, kids=[25280352], score=None, time=1606932857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278910, text='Hey, thanks for engaging and no worries, nothing in your comment struck me as condescending.<p>I see your point here, and will grant that I&#x27;ve been fortunate to not have been in a situation in which I&#x27;ve had to consider anything approaching a &quot;bad deed&quot;. Most of my thoughts on the subject are purely hypothetical, and informed by conversations with my dad, who has Seen Some Shit.<p>Looking back on the 2 times I can think of where I have considered striking someone to cause harm (both in middle and high school, a bully and a fight respectively), it seems to me that there is an element of considering consequences, but in neither circumstance were those consequences external. In both cases, it was very much a question of &quot;am I going to feel bad about this later?&quot;, which prompted the question of justification rather than punishment. Perhaps at a certain level this is the same thing, but it seems at least qualitatively different to me, a kind of fear of my own judgment rather than that of another person. Would you generally consider this to be the same process, or not?<p>In either case, I can only wholeheartedly agree that perceiving oneself as incapable of evil is a Bad Idea. It seems dangerous to me for much the same reason you laid out, and I will occasionally attempt to engage in the kind of introspection necessary to grapple with what I might be capable of in a similar situation. I&#x27;m hesitant to say I&#x27;m incapable (psychologically) of doing something terrible in a similar situation, and my previous comment was from the reductionist point of view of a spherical murderer in a vacuum, as it were. Were I in that father&#x27;s position, I know that I would feel _justified_ in taking that kind of action, which may prompt me to seek the opportunity, which is again where I see a slight difference from being prohibited solely by the fear of consequences, if that makes sense.<p>Again, thanks for taking the time to respond!')
