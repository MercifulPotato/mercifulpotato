That way I can donate more with the same effective &quot;cost&quot; to myself.  I get that it&#x27;s not trivial to set one of these up (especially for someone who is already in a funding deficit), but I think it would make donations a more attractive option for people.<p>Additionally, the email talks about funding in hours of development work, but doesn&#x27;t mention what each hour costs... would be helpful information to have in order to size a donation.')
