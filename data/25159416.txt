A (further deep-)linked blogpost on ligatures in general states:<p>&gt; <i>Ligatures were invented to solve a practical typesetting problem. In the days of metal fonts, certain characters had features that physically collided with other characters. To fix this, font foundries cast ligatures fonts</i> [0]<p>But that&#x27;s not true. That is why ligatures are used by many foundries more recently, but it&#x27;s not why they were invented, and it doesn&#x27;t cover all traditional uses of ligatures. German and French orthography in particular contain a lot of examples that are closer to programming operators in use than the author&#x27;s &quot;fi&quot; example.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;practicaltypography.com&#x2F;ligatures.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;practicaltypography.com&#x2F;ligatures.html</a>')
