The paper is written in a confrontational and snarky tone, for example: &quot;The theory has been spectacularly successful on one front, that of public relations.&quot; Not a way to build bridges.<p>3. The author seems bitter that the paper wasn&#x27;t accepted into Physics Today, and that the suggested rewriting into a letter to the editor did not result in publication either.<p>4. The author is sticking to their guns.<p>No matter how well-founded the idea that string theory is a dead end, this isn&#x27;t likely to improve things.')
