When I&#x27;ve used it for math (as I work my way through Gilbert Strang&#x27;s book &quot;Linear Algebra and its applications&quot;), I add full problems that seemed to be key to the topic, or surprised me in some way. These take longer to review, but I find it&#x27;s been really helpful. And once it sticks, I don&#x27;t have to review it again for months.<p>I also find it can be helpful to have a single card that prompts review of related definitions, for instance:<p>&quot;What are the four subspaces of a matrix A? What are their dimensions with respect to the rank r of A? What are they subspaces of? (Fundamental theorem of Linear Algebra part 1)&quot;<p>Remembering these things together is easier for me than breaking this down into multiple cards as one piece of this in isolation doesn&#x27;t make as much sense as a part of the whole.<p>This is all to say that I disagree with the author on the point that it&#x27;s important to find ways to break up cards to be bite sized. Otherwise great post IMO!')
