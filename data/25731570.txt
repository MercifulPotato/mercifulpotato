This basically precludes someone selling a phone secondhand entirely if they haven&#x27;t unlocked it first by holding the value of the phone hostage (phones are worth less when locked). Completely anti-consumer. And AT&amp;T isn&#x27;t even the worst about this. I once tried to unlock a phone through Rogers and they wanted $120 to do it! This was back around 2011 so their policy might have changed but given Canada&#x27;s terrible telco situation I doubt it has changed much.')
