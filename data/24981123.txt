In other words, when borrowers defaulted the bank itself lost money. This made them insolvent and caused the whole collapse.<p>In the case of Ant on the other hand, they essentially function as a lead generation platform for banks - currently 98% of &quot;their loans&quot; aren&#x27;t really theirs at all, but rather are funded by their partner banks; if the loan defaults, it&#x27;s the partner bank&#x27;s problem, not Ant&#x27;s.<p>The reason this change is such a big deal is that forcing Ant to fund 30% of its own loans will require raising an absolutely enormous amount of fairly expensive capital, driving up costs and significantly decreasing the value of the company.')
