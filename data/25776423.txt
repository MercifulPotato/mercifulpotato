We just launched a project we&#x27;ve been toying around with for a while now, called Memgraph Playground.<p>The initial idea was to let anyone to learn Cypher (a popular graph query language) and get an idea of what it&#x27;s like to work with graphs without any friction:<p>- In-browser experience. No downloads required.\n- No download or sign up required\n- Preloaded datasets with many more to come\n- Step-by-step tutorials with example queries &amp; explanations<p>The project is still in the early days, and we&#x27;re planning to add more functionality, but for now you can:<p>- Run read Cypher queries only. Wright queries aren&#x27;t supported\n- Run some popular graph algorithms (Breadth First Search, Weighted Shortest Path). We&#x27;ll be adding many more.\n- Visualize your results as a graph or in a table. We&#x27;ll be adding more styling options.<p>I hope you find this tool useful and fun. If you have any suggestions or questions please drop them in the comments below.<p>Cheers!')
