You don&#x27;t _become_ a billionaire by exploitation, but it sure does help you _keep on_ being a billionaire.<p>Facebook, Amazon, Apple and others didn&#x27;t start out exploiting people, but they sure as hell do exploit at at least some group of people now. Content moderators, warehouse workers, assembly line workers. It&#x27;s not a neat and clean picture, a lot of those people would themselves say it&#x27;s a job they decide to do-- and their agency shouldn&#x27;t be diminished-- but the exploitation does exist and it is real. You at some point just have to listen to people, and enough people in this country are saying its systems are exploiting them.<p>Simply put: It would be nice to see Paul write an essay about how Facebook should treat their contracted content moderators better, rather than expend his mental energy retorting to a few progressive politicians. I too wish that those politicians understood tech a bit more, but there&#x27;s lots of people who I wish understood lots of things better. This essay is mostly quite wise and thought-provoking, too bad his grievances color it.')
