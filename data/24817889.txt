You can see the voltage changing in Ryzen Master. I think intel has it too but not sure.<p>Also, I am not sure it is correct that energy &#x2F; op is constant, even at a given voltage? I&#x27;m no expert but I read about this when I was thinking about overclocking my device. At a given voltage, higher frequencies still use more energy due to the capacitance of all the components on the device. This is why overclocked energy dissipation scales super-linearly with voltage. Because you aren&#x27;t just increasing the voltage you are increasing the frequency as well.')
