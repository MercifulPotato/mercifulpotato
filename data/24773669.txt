We have it beyond good on the US compared to most places in the world.. And we still managed to have Trump, Hillary, and Biden be our presidential choices in these 2 elections.  All it takes is one bad idea or leadership that takes the helm of an entire world government instead of several countries keeping each other in check and having different ideas&#x2F;philosophies.  I worry people actually want to be ruled by a king&#x2F;monarch&#x2F;dictator.  I wish people would stop putting so much emphasis on the federal government and focus on local community politics.  Higher level government should do less, not more.')
