The bed and breakfast experience is one that I love and thanks to AirBnB there are thousands of more options for that experience or something close enough to it for my tastes. In addition I have loved almost all of the (activity based) experiences I&#x27;ve booked through the platform.<p>The key to me is that when I use AirBnB I really feel like I&#x27;m dealing directly with people, with the interested party who is passionate about and responsible for my experience. That&#x27;s what their marketplace means to me. No hotel can provide that.<p>I know very well you have to look for this kind of interaction on the platform and there are plenty of uninvolved multi-property rent seekers, but I avoid them and AirBnB makes it <i>possible</i> to avoid them and for that I am extremely grateful.')
