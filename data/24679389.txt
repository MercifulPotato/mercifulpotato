What&#x27;s even cooler is that the iguana also only eats seaweed and algae, which means it does not need to kill other animals to survive. It has developed evolutionary adaptations to subsist on this diet as well, such as nasal glands that remove excess harmful salt from their bodies.<p>I am a firm believer that all of the war and crime you see in the world is driven by some biological wiring that most of us continental organism possess, from ants to humans.<p>If we had all evolved to be more like iguanas, I wonder if society would have made more (or less!) technological and societal progress, given that a lot of technological advancements come from the demands of war--<p>but war is not a necessary condition for technological advancement now is it?<p>Long live the Galapagos iguana!')
