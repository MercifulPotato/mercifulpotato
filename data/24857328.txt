They also once <i>called me</i> to say they&#x27;d detected activity which indicated malware was present on my network, and that I might like to resolve that.<p>Depending on where you live, there&#x27;s also quite a few ISPs popping up who are running their own fibre throughout cities and selling symmetric gigabit connections for about the same price as BT would charge you for 60Mbps.')
