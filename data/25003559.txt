Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25006685], score=None, time=1604621757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003202, text='I&#x27;ve tried for years to find the right combination of plugins and configs to make vim (and now neovim) as comfortable as IntelliJ for &quot;large&quot; languages (like Java &amp; Scala), and I still can&#x27;t do it.<p>I actually very much agree with you that IntelliJ&#x27;s all-batteries-included bits can be distracting and frustrating at times, and it&#x27;s annoying to track down and disable the stuff you don&#x27;t want.  The memory usage makes me cry; occasionally the OOM killer murders it on my 16GB laptop.<p>But IntelliJ actually does all the things I want it to, reliably, and (mostly) without fuss.  vim&#x2F;nvim just... doesn&#x27;t.  Or I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get it to do it after hours of trying, which amounts to the same thing.<p>It makes me super sad, because a part of me rebels at having to use a giant IDE to be productive, but that&#x27;s just been my experience.  I too would rather put a motor and bags on my bicycle than start cutting down a truck, but I haven&#x27;t found a motor and bags that fit and work right for me, after more work than is reasonable trying.')
