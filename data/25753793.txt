That was back in April and I&#x27;ll treasure it for the rest of my life. The fact that someone&#x27;s willing to go through those lengths to say thank you is still mindblowing.<p>Since then, the project that I&#x27;ve been working on opened publicly for donations in November. We&#x27;re going to hit 1,000 donations today, with ~$13,000 and close to ~$600&#x2F;m recurring [0].<p>It&#x27;s a massive motivator to keep going. The &quot;thank you&quot; messages and financial contributions have turned my time spent contributing to open source into probably my most emotionally fulfilling experience.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;ankidroid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opencollective.com&#x2F;ankidroid</a>')
