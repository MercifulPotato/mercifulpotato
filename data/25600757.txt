Also at any bigger company, no one person&#x27;s experience is completely representative. It depends on the person, manager, team, org, etc. There&#x27;s no way any one person could know everything about a company.<p>But my comment wasn&#x27;t really about cultural or org issues (which can be much more subjective); it was more about specific facts that are binary. I&#x27;ll read people say something like &quot;x company is rewriting everything in Go because Rails is slow&quot; when it&#x27;s not true at all.')
