Overseas pay the full price, domestic students are subsidised and only pay Â£9k, but the uni gets it in full anyway. And, no, they still take overseas students (with remote studies it&#x27;s not more difficult, than domestic ones). Imperial&#x27;s Chem department even filled more places for 1st year than usual.')
