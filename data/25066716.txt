Item(by='pengaru', descendants=None, kids=[25067238], score=None, time=1605158186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066604, text='FWIW I&#x27;ve done a lot of lifting for engine and trans services with nothing more than ratchet straps or a come-along hanging from either an overhead joist or I-beam, or a constructed A-frame when the former were unavailable.<p>Honestly two post lifts are more just a space and time saver for quick service shops and kind of suck.  Back when I worked at a muffler+brake shop it was the two post lifts that did the most damage to vehicles due to poorly located pads or doors hitting the posts, and put the mechanics at the most risk.  And when you use them to lift something lopsided like a FWD vehicle off its K member for major service, it becomes so imbalanced the damn car is liable to fall off.  Not a fan at all.  But they conferred good density to fit more bays in the shop.  It&#x27;s a shit compromise from a mechanic&#x27;s perspective.')
