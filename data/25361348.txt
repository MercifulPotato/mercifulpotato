Thanks, God!<p>All this proves my point in this discussion that Mother Teresa is a textbook example of someone with an extremely dark personality, who was so good at and focused on self promotion, that she managed to conceal that fact that she&#x27;s a sociopath, and fool people into thinking she was a saint, and literally bending the rules to grant her sainthood after her death.<p>The fact that she wasn&#x27;t personally piloting the private plane she chartered (and that wouldn&#x27;t have been there otherwise) which killed five people, or that one particular person like Christopher Hitchens who justifiably and correctly criticized her was an anti-theist, or alcoholic, or gay, or a jerk, doesn&#x27;t detract from the uncontested proven facts, man.')
