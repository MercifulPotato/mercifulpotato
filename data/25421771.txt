Trying to sell you on <i>my</i> epistemology was outside of my intent.<p>Your epistemology leads you to not &quot;know&quot; all of science.  Even logical positivism accepted the results of repeatable experiments, and logical positivism is itself too narrow of an epistemology (which is why it was rejected in the end).<p>I also profoundly mistrust any philosophy that says &quot;the only way we know is X&quot;, where that rule (about the only way we know) is not something that is knowable via X.  That leaves adherents using a rule (which by their own statements they do not know is valid) to decide what they do and do not know.  That&#x27;s... not something I can accept.  It seems self-contradictory to me.<p>I&#x27;m not going to wade through your wall of questions.  That&#x27;s a much lower level of conversation than I am willing to get bogged down in.')
