I&#x27;ve driven one and tried out the wireless CarPlay, and it works more or less like the wired version (no lag, as smooth as wired CarPlay AFAICT). The only major inconvenience is probably that, if you have a passenger and they want to use their phone for music, you will need to pair their phone to the car instead of just finding the wire and plugging in. Takes about 30 seconds to a minute to go through all the setup. While the cars listed are not cheap by any means, there are a few moderately optioned minivans around the same cost of some of the less expensive cars from BMW (base cost around $38K USD).<p>Honda is also rumored to be adding wireless support ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;10&#x2F;10&#x2F;wireless-carplay-support-expected-in-2021-honda-accord" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;10&#x2F;10&#x2F;wireless-carplay-...</a> ) for their 2021 Accord model so seems the feature is become available on more affordable cars too.')
