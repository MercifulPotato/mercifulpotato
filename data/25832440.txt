A two-sided approach would be better. Still, I&#x27;ve seen far more people hurt thinking HR was their friend than by not empathizing enough with HR.<p>&gt; How is that subtext not correct here?<p>The grammar is a little bit hard to parse in the original article, and I don&#x27;t know the cultural context, so I don&#x27;t so much have AN interpretation as a probabilistic cloud of possible interpretations.<p>The thing I would remember when reading anything like this is how much language means different things in different cultures:<p>1) Words like &quot;racism,&quot; &quot;white supremacy,&quot; &quot;gaslighting,&quot; and &quot;abuse&quot; get tossed around a lot in younger, ultra-liberal circles. If I call someone conservative in their fifties a white supremacist, I won&#x27;t be welcome back ever again. If I&#x27;m talking to a liberal 20-something, we&#x27;re both expected to accept our white supremacy.<p>2) Positive &#x2F; negative language varies between cultures. If an Eastern European says something is mediocre, they mean it&#x27;s typical. If an American says the same, they mean it&#x27;s bad. Some cultures use language in ways which are hyper-positive, and others, in ways which are hyper-negative. Acceptable degree of exaggeration varies too.<p>I recently had a &quot;friendly&quot; lawyer for an adversarial party provide me with some &quot;friendly&quot; legal advice (which was specifically that I had no case, and would be out both sides&#x27; legal fees if I went to court, and so on). They were lying. I knew that, and they knew that. This was an attorney for a megacorp, where I filed an arbitration complaint as a typical consumer (so they probably didn&#x27;t know that I knew that they were lying).<p>With filters for how the author might be using language -- well within the norms of some cultures I&#x27;ve interacted with -- I didn&#x27;t see this as going far beyond &quot;If an opposing counsel tells you that you have no legal case, they might be lying to you.&quot;')
