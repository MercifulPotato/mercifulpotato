The testers on the Windows team were going through various popular applications, testing them to make sure they worked OK, but SimCity kept crashing. They reported this to the Windows developers, who disassembled SimCity, stepped through it in a debugger, found the bug, and added special code that checked if SimCity was running, and if it did, ran the memory allocator in a special mode in which you could still use memory after freeing it.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-microsoft-lost-the-api-war&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2004&#x2F;06&#x2F;13&#x2F;how-microsoft-lost...</a>')
