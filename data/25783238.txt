We also rate them Mixed factually and borderline Questionable based on poor sourcing and the spreading of conspiracy theories that later must be retracted after being widely shared.&quot;<p>Bellingcat:\n&quot;we rate Bellingcat Left-Center biased based on story selection and positions that moderately favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.&quot;<p>These are vastly, vastly different forms and scales of &quot;bias.&quot; They are nearly incomparable.')
