Instead, it&#x27;s a sort of &quot;launcher&quot; that lives outside the tabs. This creates all sort of bizarre UX issues, like if you click on a top-site, click back, and click on another top-site, you now have two tabs open.<p>- The tab switcher has been replaced with a janky spring-loaded pop-tart that appears to have been lifted directly from the Google Maps search results screen without any understanding of why it works in that context.<p>- Several important areas of the UI are now dedicated to &quot;Collections&quot;, a feature that&#x27;s just like bookmark folders (which are still present), except for weird subtle differences like not syncing properly.<p>- You can no longer display your bookmarks on the New Tab Page.<p>- You can no longer use themes other than the included &quot;light&quot; or &quot;dark&quot;.<p>- You can&#x27;t navigate to data URIs anymore -- you get a generic something-bad-happened error instead.<p>- A thousand little UI papercuts. Why do half the animations do weird-looking double fades? Why is the New Tab Page scrollable even when there&#x27;s no additional content to reveal by scrolling? Why are the contents of the hamburger menu slightly different when you&#x27;re on the New Tab Page?')
