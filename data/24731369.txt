I&#x27;m certainly not one, but I&#x27;ll make a suggestion that I think is worth considering.<p>Beaches are normally much busier which means a lot of disturbing noise that keeps sea creatures in general away from the noise of the beach.<p>As far fewer people are at the beach, there is much less noise to disturb sea creatures in general, so they are now coming closer to shore (and sharks follow their food source in towards shore too).<p>If there are more sharks in the area they are more likely to come into contact with the smaller number of people there and anything in the water is a potential food source for sharks, including people.<p>The shark experts can pitch in with whether that makes sense and propose more expert opinions.')
