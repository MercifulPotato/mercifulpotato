Item(by='jdbernard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608306307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467322, text='&gt; it&#x27;s not the job itself, it&#x27;s the whole system that makes it unbearable after a while.<p>Absolutely this. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and I&#x27;ve been working professionally since high school (worked full-time through college). I still love the craft but I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding companies I enjoy working at long-term. Thought I found one, then we got acquired and the work and culture changed. The acquisition was probably a good thing as I don&#x27;t know if we could have weathered COVID as a small company, but that fact only makes me lament the more the inevitable unbearability of it all.<p>I say this to underscore my agreement. It&#x27;s not just one job. It&#x27;s the whole system that seems unbearable. After a while you give up on finding the mythical company that fits you.')
