I&#x27;d that the standard seven day creation story is about as outlandish as the narrative that the holocaust is a big hoax.<p>Is it technically possible to explain away all the evidence with sufficient effort? I suppose. But occams razor tells us that yes, the holocaust happened, and no, three days did not pass before the sun was created.<p>My point is that we generally don&#x27;t expect mathematics-like incontrovertible proof to establish historical fact, and it&#x27;s unfair to demand it to disprove religion. More broadly, Facebook now has to figure out what the standard of proof is for their platform.')
