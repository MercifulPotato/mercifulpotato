They have some nice to haves, but the price you pay (not $$) for it is too high.<p>I have two colleagues who got Model X&#x27;s, they both drove as much Model S the first 6 months (at least) after getting the vehicle as the quality was so subpar. One door had to be repainted because the gull wings were scraping against eachother, panel gaps, the car started to kernel panic after an update and was immobilized, the list goes on (This is only what i know off, i stopped asking after awhile).<p>It&#x27;s only a sample size of two, but I&#x27;ve never heard of anything like it before. I wouldn&#x27;t want that from a 1.5MSEK purchase. The problem is that they won&#x27;t just magically become better without lowering production speeds, which they can&#x27;t to because then the stock might just finally pop. So buying a Tesla you&#x27;re stuck getting something rushed together rather sloppily. Go Lexus&#x2F;Toyota unless you really need the Tesla &quot;cool factor&quot; but rather a good vehicle.')
