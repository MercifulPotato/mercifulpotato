No one (sane) is delivering a lisp image as &quot;The Product&quot; without also having a way to regenerate that image. If you write something in the REPL and <i>never</i> convert it to a proper function&#x2F;class&#x2F;struct&#x2F;package in source, you&#x27;re hosed when your system reboots and that image is lost.<p>This requires no more discipline than, say, actually committing files to a version control system to collaborate with others. Versus shouting from the hills, &quot;It works on my machine!&quot; and being confused when it turns out that you didn&#x27;t commit &quot;foo.c&quot; and compiled it manually rather than updating your Makefile and committing both changes so others could use it.')
