Item(by='dkobran', descendants=None, kids=[25368103], score=None, time=1607560398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367036, text='&gt; You don&#x27;t possess the right to steal or murder, regardless of the existence or lack of a government.<p>You absolutely do, because nothing is preventing you from doing so.  Maybe you are referring to a moral right?  We are discussing legal rights.  These don&#x27;t exist without a system of governance.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t &quot;sacrifice&quot; my &quot;right&quot; to murder someone because I never had such a right.<p>Absent of any political order, who is to say what rights you have or don&#x27;t have?  This is the entire point of government and the social contract.  It is a universal and mutually agreed on pact, which takes the form of an exchange of certain individual rights for protection of other rights, that critically, everyone must abide by and that maximize the well-being and security of everyone. It formalizes which universal rights exist and also what limitations exist.  This system is what dictates your rights.<p>&gt; You are forced to abide by these restrictions because of the social contract between yourself and the government which creates and enforces these laws.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how to respond to this.  No, governments do not literally &#x2F; physically force you to stop speaking in the case of your freedom of speech.  Being &quot;forced to&quot; in this context would mean being compelled to abide by the laws of society.  This relationship defines the social contract that you, and everyone else in society, has entered into with the ruling authority&#x2F;government.')
