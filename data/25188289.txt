It&#x27;s possibly the humming and the calming effect induced on me. Somehow I think this is a learned experience but I may be wrong. I just imposed on myself to be relaxed as I used to be very anxious and tense when I was flying. A few times of trying this and now I fall asleep as soon as the plane takes off and many times I skip the meals offered on the plane altogether because I&#x27;m deeply asleep. I somehow associated the experience of flying with something very relaxing that my such that body anticipates the flight, I already start yawning when I&#x27;m boarding the plane.')
