I&#x27;ve seen senior people talking about &quot;manageable productivity drops&quot; more than &quot;no difference&quot;, or &quot;even better&quot; but of course sampling bias applies.<p>But also, there is a potential semantic difficulty.  By remote friendly I am thinking about &quot;open to hiring a single person in a different city&#x2F;country&quot;, not &quot;employees that don&#x27;t come into the office much&quot;.<p>I would draw a distinction between those, and I&#x27;m not convinced we&#x27;ll see a huge shift in the former.')
