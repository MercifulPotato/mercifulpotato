By the time the &quot;nerds&quot; find out, it&#x27;d probably be far too late and lives could be at stake.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunately such the nature of the beast that being half-hearted about security does not yield a half-secure product, or a product that&#x27;s fully secure against half the hostile actors, it yields a product that only gives the presumption of <i>safety</i>, which is far more dangerous.<p>I use many messaging services in my life as security absolutism leads to a very miserable, very paranoid life, but my expectations are accordingly tempered when I use them, and I let my contacts know my expectations too. Everyday chat? Sure. Sensitive, personal info? Maybe, depends on the exact topic. Trade&#x2F;state secrets (if I were to handle them)? Hell no.')
