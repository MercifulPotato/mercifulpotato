Project A interacts with project B and that interaction causes a bug or awful problem. Project A and B both wash their hands of it.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly mind support requests via the bug tracker - particularly since a pattern of support requests often highlights a UX issue or a lack of clarity in the docs.<p>Some people view them as irritating annoyances that should be pushed to some forum like stack overflow though.')
