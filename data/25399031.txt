Only news outlet posting about it gets discredited and shadow banned on social networks.<p>After election: Feds are on Hunter Biden case (before the election even!) and it is real. Coverage on news networks now.<p>All of this editorializing and censoring is setting a dangerous precedence. It&#x27;s obvious there&#x27;s some sort of agenda, just not sure what it is. Could it be that they (who is they even?) want Biden elected and then make him step down due to his son affairs so Harris becomes the first female president with a migration background?')
