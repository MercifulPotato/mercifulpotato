That&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no grand conspiracy. You&#x27;re either for non-violence and a civil, reasoning-reasonable society - or you are living in ignorance is bliss and you don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s chaos and the world burns.<p>I guess these platforms were on &quot;team: chaos and the world burns&quot; throughout the BLM riots, and were on &quot;team: conspiracy theories&quot; throughout the 2+ years of &quot;Russian collusion&quot; coverage.<p>And if you can&#x27;t see parallels to this same statement you&#x27;re making and echos throughout history when someone decides what&#x27;s OK and not OK to say, I&#x27;m not sure what to tell you. Literally every authoritarian could make the case that silencing their opponents is worth it for the greater good.<p>&gt; Also, no one&#x27;s freedom of speech has been taken away. These are private platforms, they&#x27;re not the public space - the internet itself is the neutral platform, likewise these people have other means to communicate. They don&#x27;t get the automatic right to using the most convenient technology provided by private companies though.<p>People said this when it was just Facebook &#x2F; Twitter. Then it&#x27;s the App Stores on mobile devices, and now we&#x27;re down to cloud infrastructure providers and payment processors.<p>That&#x27;s fine--just be prepared to move your goalposts when people start pressuring ISPs to block the content, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening next.')
