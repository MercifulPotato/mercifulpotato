Being able to claim a donation is registration did make getting a donation through my employer easier for me.<p>Specifically, this part:<p><pre><code>    What is the difference between sponsoring and registering?\n    \n    It has a different name.  Use the term &quot;registration&quot; \n    if your boss doesn&#x27;t like &quot;sponsoring&quot; or &quot;donation&quot;.\n    The benefits are the same.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure if continuing to use the term register versus being &quot;that guy who tries to sponsor projects&quot; is what works now though ;)')
