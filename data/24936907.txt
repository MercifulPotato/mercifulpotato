Even when you buy a DVD, you are just buying a license to use that DVD to consume the content on it. You don&#x27;t own the content, and it&#x27;s a violation of that license to copy a movie off of a DVD and onto your hard drive, for example, even if it doesn&#x27;t have DRM. It&#x27;s just that the legal content owner typically doesn&#x27;t come after that type of violation.')
