And it&#x27;s possible that an IP ruling in &#x27;some important place&#x27; sets the material precedent anyhow.<p>If the US or EU rules one way, then others will be influenced by that on some level.<p>A lot of this could possibly be more clarified by legislation, but I only think the EU and maybe the UK really have the wherewithal or importance to make an impact. Germany possibly but I see them wanting to do that at the EU level. I don&#x27;t see anything on the horizon for the US.<p>I would definitely double down on my heretofore down-voted statement: if you care about open source, you really, really want to have &#x27;good, clean cases&#x27; pushed through and tested in the courts.<p>If Open Source proponents leave it to the wind, patent trolls, or big corps - you may see &#x27;bad cases&#x27; go through the system and set really bad precedent that hinges on weird corners cases.<p>Do not underestimate how much of a big deal this is. IP is a discussion at every point along the way when contemplating investing in independent or internal projects and &#x27;ambiguity&#x27; is a huge factor in risk aversion.<p>All of these IP licences are just &#x27;ideas&#x27; waiting to be &#x27;more or less law&#x27; when they face legal scrutiny, so if I were the &#x27;God of Open Source&#x27; I&#x27;d be looking to find cases to build a favourable pipeline to the Supreme Court. Major rulings will have a beneficial impact for everyone.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;law&#x2F;help&#x2F;domestic-judgment&#x2F;canada.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loc.gov&#x2F;law&#x2F;help&#x2F;domestic-judgment&#x2F;canada.php</a>')
