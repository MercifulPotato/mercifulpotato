A company isn&#x27;t going to indefinitely maintain dedicated space at 25% utilization. Not to say they can&#x27;t maintain some dedicated space for people who do want to come in 80% of the time. But I expect post-COVID, many offices will look very different although I don&#x27;t expect many companies to go fully remote.')
