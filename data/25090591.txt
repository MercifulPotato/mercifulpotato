Item(by='peter_d_sherman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605333309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085286, text='In the following HN article:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24131831" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24131831</a><p>The author (somewhat of a crackpot!) writes:<p>&gt;&quot;In classical physics, you have the particle&#x2F;wave duality. Basically, one is the other, depending on frame of reference.<p>That particle wave duality (I&#x27;ve determined) is actually a particle&#x2F;wave&#x2F;field TRINITY.<p>That is, particles ARE waves (depending on how you look at them), waves are particles (depending on how you look at them), BUT ALSO waves are fields (depending on how you look at them), and fields are waves (depending on how you look at them), and fields are particles (depending on how you look at them) and particles are fields, again, &quot;depending on how you look at them&quot;.<p>Google &quot;Starlings&quot;. A single starling at rest is a particle, in motion, it&#x27;s a wave, and many of them together moving in unision, that&#x27;s a field.<p>Also (and this is the advanced lesson), you can have various degrees of recursion in this, for example, a whole field of starlings could be viewed as a single particle, then that could comprise multiple particles if teamed up with other fields of starlings, and then those things could move like wave.<p>Think nested particles&#x2F;waves&#x2F;fields -- inside of other particles&#x2F;waves&#x2F;fields.<p>Also, the smallest unit of space (to implement all of the others), DOESN&#x27;T NEED TO PHYSICALLY MOVE; that is, it only needs to state-change, like a pixel, if it were a magnet, it could change from a North Pole to South Pole (or possibly neutral), if charged, the charge could go from positive to negative and back, if a region of force, the force could push one way and then the reverse, etc., etc.&quot;<p>PDS: I don&#x27;t know; but the author of that post sounds like a <i>crackpot</i>, and pretty <i>delusional</i> to me...<p>(Oh, wait a second... <i>I&#x27;m the author of that post!</i> &lt;g&gt;)<p>(<i>I resemble that remark!</i> <i>Doh!</i> &lt;g&gt;)')
