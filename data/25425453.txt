Governments are basically institutions that we allow to restrict our freedoms for some benefits - safety, various common-good things, etc.  We all have our preference for where we draw this line personally on the liberty&#x2F;convenience &lt;--&gt; safety spectrum.  A lot of people (including myself) feel like these lockdowns, pandemic mitigations, etc. have far crossed the acceptable line in this spectrum.  In my opinion, I&#x27;m not fighting a virus any more.  I&#x27;m fighting people trying to steamroll my rights and lifestyle.  Others may feel differently - they may feel like for the sake of global&#x2F;community safety, I should have fewer rights.  I don&#x27;t feel that way.  This isn&#x27;t binary. Nobody is right or wrong - we are all fighting for our line on the spectrum.')
