If you have become 25 this year, you&#x27;ll have lived for more than 10% of the US&#x27;s entire lifetime. 75, and you&#x27;ll have lived for a third of its existence.<p>Those institutions which are longer lived are usually subject to tons of change. Think of the imperial Chinese system with its many dynasties or the church with its schisms. And despite behaviourally modern humans having lived on this planet for tens of thousands of years, thousands of generations, you won&#x27;t find any institution that has survived longer than a few hundred generations.')
