Item(by='chriswarbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603504207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24874888, text='EToys is pretty nice <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squeakland.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squeakland.org</a><p>It&#x27;s similar to Scratch (both use drag and drop &quot;blocks&quot;, both use Smalltalk, although I think Scratch has a JS version now). The nice thing about EToys is that it manipulates objects in a direct and live way, whereas Scratch separate the &quot;code&quot; from the &quot;scene&quot;. For example, EToys lets us draw a character and attach script blocks to make it move and react; but we can also attach script blocks to those script blocks; and so on. I find this more powerful, and reduces the barrier for &quot;graduating&quot; from block-based programming to &quot;real&quot; programming (EToys lets us mix and match scripting blocks with real Smalltalk code).')
