I grew up using Pascal and am currently teaching C++ for undergrads; I often realize that some errors done by the students could have been prevented, had they used Pascal.<p>It&#x27;s not only a matter of clarity in using an asymmetric := for assigning the <i>right</i> side to the <i>left</i> side (the &quot;=&quot; symbol suggests that left and right side play the same role). The biggest problem is rather the fact that it&#x27;s so common for newbies to write &quot;=&quot; when they want to express equality. (I teach in a physics department, and the mathematical background of my students is extremely solid.)')
