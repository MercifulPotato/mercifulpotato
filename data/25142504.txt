For example, I wrote the app (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;russnewcomer&#x2F;SeventyTwo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;russnewcomer&#x2F;SeventyTwo</a>) for my friend to solve the problem (somewhat specific to the culture they work in) where they don&#x27;t have a clinic site or really the ability to make appointments but instead travel to homes or communities to do their work, and they have to cart around all their binders full of records.  My simple app works for their use case, but this also feels like a spot where there are more opportunities to help.<p>Anyway, I definitely support open source EMR efforts, wherever they may lead, and I thank and applaud you for your service!')
