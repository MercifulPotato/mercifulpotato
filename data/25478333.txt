No one is going to pick where they go to college based on the taxes on the ultra-rich unless they are obsessed with money. Once rich, are you going to uproot yourself entirely from any family, friends, and connections in the US? You have to consider that rational economic behavior still has to consider what the point of it all is, and money for the sake of money doesn&#x27;t tend to be the answer even among the hyper-rich.<p>What these people will come to terms with is a pretty age-old lesson - there are things more important than just how rich you are, and most of those are human. So long as they can maintain their lifestyle, I think many will want to stay. Needing to find 20K in a couch cushion to pay for your 5M in assets each year that you make 300K on won&#x27;t be the thing that makes you move.<p>Of course, the rich today also have many legal shields and layers that will protect them from real french revolution violence. But I think anyone can feel the shift right now. Go on Tiktok and see just how many young people are getting real into eating the rich :)')
