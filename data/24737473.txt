However if we&#x27;re targeting an audience that feels comfortable with terminals, then ANSI interfaces are well-standardized, widely supported, and work great. One good example of an app written in such a way is the redbean web server (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;redbean&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.storage.googleapis.com&#x2F;redbean&#x2F;index.html</a>) where your web gui can be bundled inside an executable zip file and the user just launches it locally via chrome, and it can access  any native things you need.')
