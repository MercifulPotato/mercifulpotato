Which is a shame because is seems like it has some nice features, but without checking this very important prerequisite box, I unfortunately will not even consider it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vivaldi.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vivaldi.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;</a> exists but only releasing tarballs is pretty lame, there&#x27;s no source repository where I can browse&#x2F;fork, no public bug tracker where I can contribute to issue reports. A conventional, permissive, free-software license is not in use, as far as I can tell.<p>Vivaldi wouldn&#x27;t behave like any of the other software that runs on my computer. That&#x27;s not good.<p>I understand and appreciate that Vivaldi is different from Chrom(e|ium). That just doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me.')
