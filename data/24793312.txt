The helper script runs a pod in the (potentially) remote Kubernetes cluster that takes the container build context as stdin, then runs img to build the image, and then imports it into the host&#x27;s containerd instance. It also maps in the right host volumes so that the image build is cached between subsequent runs.<p>I was surprised to be unable to otherwise find a good local &#x2F; remote container development workflow, but this was built to replace what we were previously doing, which is setting DOCKER_HOST to point to the remote (single-node) cluster&#x27;s Docker daemon (over SSH), so that docker CLI commands would execute on that remote box.<p>In both cases, you&#x27;ll still want to take steps to minimize the size of your container image build context, but the size of the images doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;d fit your needs or not, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genuinetools&#x2F;img" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;genuinetools&#x2F;img</a>')
