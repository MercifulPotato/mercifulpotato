I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve personally trusted Telegram&#x27;s unencrypted, third-party system to store messages intended for children, though.<p>I&#x27;ve theorised about such a system myself, though I&#x27;d go with live voice-chat through something like a private SIP server (with multiple channels and&#x2F;or a broadcast mode). With a bit of setup, you could probably integrate Android&#x27;s native SIP dialer and the various other desktop SIP tools into the system and connect to a channel remotely.')
