Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=[24808935], score=None, time=1602894817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805957, text='Yep:) At a previous job, we also did Jira&#x2F;Confluence&#x2F;BitBucket self-hosted, running on what should have been nice hardware, and spent <i>months</i> chasing performance issues, including a charming issue that was so bad that it broke jira for the entire company every... Monday, I think? When you have a well-used standard operating procedure for restarting Jira just to unfreeze it, you have a problem. We were pretty sure it was somebody running a weekly report with some monstrous query, but 1. not even Atlassian support could seem to tell us how to <i>find</i> such an event, and 2. I don&#x27;t really care how bad the query is - if you can run a query and take down the system for the whole company, then the software is bad. And honestly, even &quot;normal&quot; performance was poor - I seem to recall that it at least acted like the web UI was the slow part; running a local CLI client against the API was faster.')
