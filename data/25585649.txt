Item(by='brandmeyer', descendants=None, kids=[25587321], score=None, time=1609359843, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25585364, text='&gt; even google themselves don&#x27;t use it in many of their software<p>Citation needed.  Granted its a big company, so its certainly possible that some teams I&#x27;m unaware of were using it.  But I never ran into one.<p>Besides, nanopb doesn&#x27;t answer the critique of the article.  Nanopb cuts down on heap traffic by statically allocating flat buffers large enough to hold maximums set by the application.  It solves the two-pass problem by the simple expediency of actually running two passes, storing the size info on the ordinary call stack.  In effect, it trades malloc&#x2F;free traffic for higher peak memory utilization.<p>At the largest scales, big G suffers from total memory pressure more than it suffers from lack of arithmetic.  Nanopb isn&#x27;t a good trade for them.  It is a good trade for my current (hard realtime, embedded) application.')
