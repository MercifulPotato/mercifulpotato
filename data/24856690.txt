And far too many are configured to screw up ICMP too.<p>So new protocols MUST use TCP or UDP as their base layer instead of raw IP.<p>So yes, QUIC uses UDP, but that should be considered an implementation detail. A hack for the lack of IP support on the Internet.<p>HTTP&#x2F;3 uses QUIC like HTTP&#x2F;1 and HTTP&#x2F;2 use TCP + TLS, but QUIC is not limited to use by HTTP&#x2F;3.<p>QUIC&#x27;s development has been, basically, paused while HTTP&#x2F;3 is finalised and then the IETF will pick up where it left off and work out how other higher-layer protocols will work using QUIC as the transport layer.')
