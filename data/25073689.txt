We are psychologically primed to think we&#x27;ve got it figured out (takes more energy to improve than continue what we&#x27;re doing and animals are about minimal energy usage). But you have to come at it from the mentality of &quot;Everything I do is wrong, but I can make it less wrong.&quot; There&#x27;s also different levels of wrong[0] and that&#x27;s key. It is about converging on the correct answer (perfection is unobtainable). Being wrong doesn&#x27;t mean 100% wrong, but when someone tells us we&#x27;re doing something wrong we treat it like a discrete binary condition instead of a spectral one. So when someone says you&#x27;re wrong, reframe it in your head as &quot;this is how I can <i>improve</i>.&quot; And help others out by instead of calling them wrong, say that they can <i>improve</i> by x,y,z. I&#x27;ve found that this is a constant challenge though and while I&#x27;ve been trying to convince myself to think like this for a decade now, I&#x27;m far from being there. But hey, I think I&#x27;m stepping in the gradient direction, so that&#x27;s converging to the solution, right? :)<p>[0] Relativity of Wrong by Isaac Asimov: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chem.tufts.edu&#x2F;AnswersInScience&#x2F;RelativityofWrong.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chem.tufts.edu&#x2F;AnswersInScience&#x2F;RelativityofWrong.ht...</a>')
