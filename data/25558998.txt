I didn&#x27;t say they were wrong, I said facts are being misinterpreted. That means that even if we assume the facts in the article are true, the interpretation of those facts isn&#x27;t being done objectively.\n2. If you are going to talk quantitative, please start with a concrete definition of the KPI and how you calculate utility and cost.<p>If you are looking for concrete examples of how you are being manipulated by the article, then to name just a few example:<p>- The article drops analytical rigor just at the exact moment when it benefits their narrative. For example, the 2020 goal of the initiative was a projection based on certain assumptions. To say if the project has failed or not according to those projections, the assumptions must hold. Funnily enough the article doesn&#x27;t list those assumptions anywhere or address whether those assumption still hold true, or even if they were valid to begin with.<p>- The article uses language to imply malice, where there is none. For example: &quot;Moreover, freedom of choice is restricted: in AGRA projects in Kenya, small-scale farmers are not allowed to decide for themselves which corn seed they plant and which fertilizers and pesticides they use on their fields.&quot; Gasp, horror. An investor wants you to follow their rules. How dare they. Jacobin should be on the barricades that VCs don&#x27;t allow you to spend their money on a new Porsche, because that limits your startups freedom of choice!<p>- The article talks about agroecology as if it&#x27;s as of now a viable alternative. Unless there&#x27;s tons of investor capital lined up behind it, it really isn&#x27;t. In fact, these aren&#x27;t even comparable things.')
