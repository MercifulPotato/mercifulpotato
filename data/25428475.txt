Defer doesn&#x27;t give you anything that you can&#x27;t already do.</i><p>Well, that&#x27;s the whole point of syntactic sugar.<p>Not that it gives you something you can&#x27;t already do, but that it gives you a succint and better way to do it.<p>&gt;<i>Language features should be orthogonal. A new language feature should add something that is not possible or extremely painful to do with the existing language features.</i><p>I beg to differ, based on your definition of &quot;extremely painful&quot;. Many kinds of syntactic sugar are welcome, even when the previous native solution wasn&#x27;t &quot;extremely painful&quot; but e.g. just tedious or error prone.')
