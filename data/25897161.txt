I think Michael is interested in status <i>mostly</i> as a path to connection. The dreams he talks about, if I remember correctly, center around having a family and a nice life, not prestige or power or winning. That&#x27;s part of why I think the &quot;Michael Scott&quot; analogy is such an awkward fit for the middle ladder proposed in the article. My recollection of the series is that Michael is actually pretty satisfied with his status in society, but not his status relative to the people around him. If Michael dreams of writing an op-ed in the New York Times, it&#x27;s because he hopes it will make Oscar like him or something.')
