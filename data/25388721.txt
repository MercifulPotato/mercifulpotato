Waldemar then designed &quot;JS2&quot; aka &quot;ur-ES4&quot; (my term) which is still archived:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20010119185300&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;js&#x2F;language&#x2F;js20&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20010119185300&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozill...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20001206082000&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozilla.org&#x2F;js&#x2F;language&#x2F;es4&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20001206082000&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mozill...</a><p>Believe it or not, Microsoft on the ASP.NET side got excited about this ur-ES4 work and did their own version, shipped server side as JScript.NET around 2001:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drdobbs.com&#x2F;a-talk-with-andrew-clinick-on-microsofts&#x2F;184404923" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drdobbs.com&#x2F;a-talk-with-andrew-clinick-on-micros...</a><p>The team at Macromedia I was in touch with after Firefox 1.0, mainly Gary Grossman, Edwin Smith, and Jeff Dyer, were trying to do a successor to Gary&#x27;s ActionScript work (which was based on JS). They tried to license Sun&#x27;s small footprint Java VM, for full Flash (not FlashLite) on mobile devices, but when Sun learned it was going to run ActionScript 3, not Java, they denied a license.<p>So Ed whipped up a proof of concept that the Macromedia folks could do it themselves, and this led to AVM2 (open sourced as Tamarin with Mozilla; alas the team got pulled back to work on a doomed Flash for mobile play, so Tamarin was in practical terms abandoned).<p>My work with Macromedians was a high point of early Firefox era standards rebooting. Jeff and I went to Geneva in spring 2005 to meet with Ecma and Microsoft folks to restart JS standards work in TC39. When Adobe bought Macromedia, we saw a path to ES4 as a standard. This ended only partly in tears, as AS3 was too static and different (namespaces!), but the good parts got into ES6.<p>But immutable classes originated with Waldemar&#x27;s JS2&#x2F;ur-ES4 work in the very late &#x27;90s.')
