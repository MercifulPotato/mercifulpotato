We need a 3BR place to stay sane because we need two offices. Compared to the south bay, we are saving &gt;3000&#x2F;m in rent. At a high compensation, marginal tax rates in CA approach 50%. So that 36000 saved is worth 72000 in TC difference.<p>It gets more dramatic if you pay for childcare. Childcare in the bay area can easily run 20000 more than it might cost in a lower cost of living area. A family of four that has two kids in day care might save 60000 just off rent and childcare differences.<p>On the other hand, for single people who would have a 1BR wherever they chose to live, the rent difference may only be 20000 and the rest of expenses don&#x27;t change much and then suddenly dropping 20% on your 200,000 TC ends up being a bad deal.')
