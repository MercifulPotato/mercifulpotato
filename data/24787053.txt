There can be, and often is, two competing theories.  It is often consensus as to which one is accepted as mainstream.<p>I got back to my Alzheimer’s example.  It’s the general consensus that the amyloid hypothesis is wrong.  However, there are those that hold onto it and it’s not because they don’t grasp the data.  There are still enough unknowns to firmly put it to rest.<p>The bacterial hypothesis is another good example.  The data supported that stress and diet was the cause of stomach ulcers.  That was the “scientific truth”.  It was wrong.<p>Consensus is nothing more than “what is the best interpretation of the data based on our current understanding”.  Current understanding being defined by “what do most scientists think?”.')
