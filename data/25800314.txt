If anything, I think it has the opposite effect of losing the forest in search of trees, or making phrases unnecessarily more &quot;exotic&quot; than they originally are.<p>E.g., if I say in Korean that I&#x27;ve become &quot;green onion kimchi&quot;, I&#x27;m not picturing green onion kimchi in my mind.  (I don&#x27;t even particularly like green onion kimchi.)  I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m dead tired.  When I say &quot;my nose is three feet&quot;, I&#x27;m not picturing my face being deformed like Pinocchio - I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m in no situation to help another.')
