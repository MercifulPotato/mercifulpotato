I have started few months ago working on an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) to help startups avoid hiring mistakes by introducing a process which will create the job description, create a hiring pipeline, parse CVs and even show some examples of what to ask and how to prepare for the interview as interviewer.<p>My original idea for generating job descriptions was using templates based on job title.<p>While brain storming, I thought what if I try generating job descriptions using GPT-3? Long story short, I received my access around mid December and started playing around with GPT-3 and was really impressed by it.<p>At this point, I thought, ok instead of waiting for months until I finish the ATS; how about creating this tiny service just to generate job descriptions?<p>I was lucky to find jobdescription.ai is available! So I registered the domain and started building. Three weeks later I have finished the app and thought of sharing it to get feedback and happy to answer your questions.')
