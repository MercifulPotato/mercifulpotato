Temperature has already risen a little so obviously you can&#x27;t change the past. Too late for some vague &quot;catastrophe&quot; is the implication. But science already tells us it won&#x27;t be extinction, and the best estimate they have (that I&#x27;ve seen) is as many deaths per year in 2100 due to warming as we currently have due to car crashes. So it might be no big deal or it might be something nobody knows. Just like the future always is.')
