It&#x27;s not because the idea is unworkable at a national level; it&#x27;s because you can&#x27;t do it state-by-state.<p>How do you figure? This is exactly how Canada&#x27;s single payer system came about: province-by-province. Saskatchewan was the first Province to offer single payer in 1947, followed by Alberta in 1951, etc. By 1961, all Provinces had some form of a single payer healthcare system. To this day, Canada&#x27;s single-payer system is Provincial, not Federal.')
