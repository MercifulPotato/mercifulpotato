Item(by='BenoitP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610919514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25815033, text='&gt; put carbon taxes on BTC&#x2F;fiat exchanges<p>Almost the best solution that preserves bitcoin, which is: put a tax on BTC mining.<p>The Bitcoin consensus rules rely on miners proving their faith in Bitcoin up to the amount of resources they are prepared to (provably) burn. Since this is about &#x27;wasting&#x27; resources, having it taxed 99% globally would let the faith proof stay intact while the environmental cost would go down by 100x. You do can  &#x27;burn&#x27; resources by giving it to your local government. And it would actually benefit the local population.<p>Caveat: it has to be global, and at about the same rate everywhere. Can it happen without a world government? I don&#x27;t know. But governments could start to trace transaction compositions up to a distribution over block rewards; and back-collect a tax on them accordingly. That is if they can control transactions; but governments do have a fair amount of leverage over the average joe&#x27;s daily activity.<p>But all this presupposes that Bitcoin has gone mainstream and is used in the daily life, and we&#x27;re definitely not quite there yet.<p>----<p>On another note, it is a bit sad the article does not mention halvings, which are quite relevant to that topic.')
