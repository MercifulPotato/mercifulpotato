It was registered December 2019, just a few months before he released. Did OP do some domain searches in December while musing about the idea?<p>I remember a similar experience with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net&#x2F;</a> - I joked on Twitter about making &#x27;thiswaifudoesnotexist.<i>com</i>&#x27; and a few hours later, I decided it was a funny enough idea I ought to actually make it... And I discovered the domain had <i>just</i> been registered. I can only assume there are domain squatters who pay for Twitter feeds, look up all domains, and purchase unregistered ones either to harvest traffic or to sell to loose-lipped people like myself. (Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t need that TLD, so I refused to pay the danegeld and registered the .net instead.)')
