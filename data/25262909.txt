The people who used to pay for it (the investors) no longer pay, the remaining good quality web is just a sidekick for their actual business.<p>This is such a baffling take, and undermines your entire post. There&#x27;s more money changing hands than <i>ever</i> on the web, and plenty of people lining up to do so. And moreover, the &quot;open&quot; web was never paid for by investors, it was almost always paid for by volunteers and people taking donations. And there are tons of truly open projects being created and maintained this way - I can think of a dozen off the top of my head, and the success of patreon speaks for itself.')
