It’s just math, not “an excuse”.<p>So your theory is that masks worked <i>then</i>, but stopped working <i>now</i>?<p>Convenient!<p>&gt; You’ll never see the data for how many cases would have been recorded without the measures in place.<p>Well, yes, exactly...these are <i>uncontrolled</i> studies. Which is why they’re such garbage.<p>You can see that in the title of the paper you posted: “a <i>synthetic control study</i>”. That means they didn’t have a control. Which means all they can do is squint at correlations and try to claim they prove cause.<p>(oh also: the WaPo “data” is from a <i>phone survey</i>...so yeah: people who say they wear masks a lot claim they have fewer “symptoms”. Whatever that means.)')
