Trump&#x27;s desire is a good example. If you avoid controversial figures, you avoid using the prize as a motivator exactly where you need it.<p>For example, Begin&#x2F;Sadaat and Arafat&#x2F;Rabin. The first peace worked out. The second one didn&#x27;t. But, all four of these people led a pretty violent life as militaristic and nationalistic leaders. They&#x27;re all extremely controversial in the middle east, and in their own countries.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think avoiding divisive political figures is a good. thing. That said, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s earned one.')
