Item(by='oldie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607727851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25392039, text='I suggest that Western culture&#x27;s understanding of risk is immature.  Is it the case that driving at the speed limit is safe and driving 5% faster is dangerous?  Of course not.  Driving at any speed carries risk; driving faster, on a given road, in given conditions, is usually more dangerous; and society needs to decide the degree of risk it will accept.  (This applies especially in cases such as driving, where the benefit of speeding accrues to the driver, but much of the risk is imposed on others without their consent.)<p>A better approach to the safety of the vaccine is to ask whether it&#x27;s safer to take it or to abstain, and who bears the risk in each case.  I accept that the numbers won&#x27;t be the same for everyone: they depend on age, sex, gregariousness, medical condition, culture, job, and perhaps  (I don&#x27;t know) ethnicity.  However, people I know who&#x27;ve had Covid-19 say it&#x27;s brutal: even if it doesn&#x27;t kill you, it can give you a really rough time.  I know of four friends of friends who&#x27;ve died of it, including one in his twenties.  And let&#x27;s not forget long Covid, which can strike at any age.  Set against that the clinical trials that the vaccine has undergone, with trials halted if even one person became seriously ill.  Finally, there seems to be at least a reasonable possibility that being vaccinated will reduce a person&#x27;s ability to infect others.<p>All in all, any of the leading vaccines available in the West look like a better bet, for me and the people around me, than just crossing my fingers and hoping.<p>Should I take it now or wait?  There seems little doubt that vaccines will be refined over the coming years.  A vaccine taken in 2023 will probably be safer, and certainly better understood, than one taken in 2021.  But someone who waits two years has endured two extra years&#x27; risk of suffering, spreading and possibly dying from Covid.  You would have to think that vaccines are much more dangerous than I do for that to be a reasonable trade-off.')
