I think I do not have internal monologue, but this is especially hard to describe.<p>Perhaps there is some crossover between people who can&#x27;t visualize and those who do not experience internal monologue.<p>Another aspect I&#x27;ve known for a long time is that I have bad &quot;situational&quot; memory. I have good trivia&#x2F;history memory but very bad memory about personal situations or events. I am not sure about faces, I didn&#x27;t really notice myself struggling with it but hard to really judge.')
