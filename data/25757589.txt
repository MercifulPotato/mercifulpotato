I use it, I like it, I pay for it, you could too.<p>Also, as far as I can tell, the whole system is free&#x2F;libre software, so the scalability question doesn&#x27;t really apply here. &quot;Scalability&quot; matters to corporations that want to keep everything centralized behind the walled garden. Here, one could technically just grab that whole server stack and run their own server. [This is somewhat of a generalization; if anyone has better insights in this regard, please share.]<p>Your question also has somewhat of an implicit statement &quot;I won&#x27;t pay for this, so who will?&quot; There ain&#x27;t no free lunch buddy. These guys are at the top of their game with e2e encryption technology. If you think that and your privacy&#x2F;security is worth it, then feel free to chip in. The non-profit structure also prevents sellouts to corporations, so you also have that sort of guarantee.')
