And people over here were giving this argument in support, but now seem to be outraged.<p>&gt; It has gotten to the point that these giant corporations are able to influence elections in whatever direction they think is &quot;right&quot;, they are able to shut down speech, on what is now a de facto town square, and they are able to deplatform their own competition based on accusations of harbouring &quot;hate speech activists&quot;.<p>I agree 100%. Twitter&#x2F;FB&#x2F;Google are too big, they are monopolies. They must be held to a higher standard or be broken up. Either become &quot;public squares&quot; where my freedom is protected or get broken up into 100 different networks.')
