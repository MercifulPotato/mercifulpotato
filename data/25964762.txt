Item(by='jpetso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611967245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955585, text='To add to &quot;it&#x27;s a trade-off&quot;: LPDDR4X is not replaceable and allows only 16GB max instead of 32GB for DDR4. However, LPDDR4X also requires half the voltage (0.6V vs. 1.2V) and can offer up to 4267 MT&#x2F;s of transfer speed instead of DDR4&#x27;s max of 3200 MT&#x2F;s.<p>So yeah, not being able to repair&#x2F;upgrade the RAM sucks balls. But if you can live without it, soldered LPDDR4X sucks less battery power and lets especially the integrated GPU do its best work. For the kind of device they&#x27;re selling, it sort of seems like the right choice.')
