Oh right, because they don&#x27;t have anywhere else to go.<p>For the last several years, I&#x27;ve gotten my mobile service through an MVNO named Ting. On the rare occasion that I&#x27;ve needed to call support, there&#x27;s no IVR, just a human who typically answers on the second ring. They speak native English, and have never failed to solve my problem either immediately or with one prompt escalation.<p>They&#x27;re so jarringly competent I wonder how they still exist, if being obnoxiously incompetent is apparently a business requirement.')
