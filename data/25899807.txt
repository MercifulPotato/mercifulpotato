The last decade saw a massive adoption of computers of all shapes and sizes in India. In the decade before that (2000 - 2010) computers were limited within labs, and offices. But smart phone changed all that. From booking train tickets to access medical health check reports to paying push-cart vendors through mobile wallet, consumers are now using computers in all sorts of ways.<p>As you rightly said, I just can&#x27;t think of a domain that&#x27;s untouched by computers.<p>Even in the fundamental science it&#x27;s now impossible to do anything without massive data crunching machines.
