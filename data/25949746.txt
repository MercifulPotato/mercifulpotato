If you think it&#x27;s a good thing for only cops and the military to have guns, you probably think that the government tends to be a pretty good deal. If you think they should be balanced by an armed populace, you probably think that it tends to be an oppressive force.<p>I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s another factor: belief in the stability (and friendliness) of the status quo.  If you believe &quot;the cops and the military&quot; will always be on your side (whether through genuine belief or lack of imagination), then I think you&#x27;ll be more receptive to gun control.  If you don&#x27;t take that as a given, then you&#x27;ll be less receptive.<p>Personally, I think the election of Donald Trump <i>should</i> cause Democrats  and cultural liberals to question their assumptions about gun control.  It&#x27;s not inconceivable to me that a right-wing authoritarian leader could tip the police and military towards being politicized forces with a little finesse (take an small existing bias, expand it through controversial actions around &quot;the line&quot; to trigger principled resignations, then cement control through purges and ideological recruitment). Add to that the fact that right-wing civilians are better armed and have proven to be receptive to a cult-of-personality.  Such a leader could potentially win a civil war without firing a shot.<p>America was lucky Trump wasn&#x27;t a &quot;hide your strength and bide your time,&quot; kind of leader.')
