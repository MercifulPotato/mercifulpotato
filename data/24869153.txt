Not saying it isn&#x27;t completely the case but you have some serious pink glasses on.<p>The money from tourism goes to elite few locals who own most of it, and it eventually slightly trickles down the rest of folks living there, the income disparity is on a level we simply don&#x27;t see in the west.
