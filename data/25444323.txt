Quality is very much the same, and the output is rather good. I don&#x27;t have anything to show you from my own work as a comparison, but there is plenty of reference material on reddit and photo blogs about the process.<p>Time wise, the speed of snapping a photo is also mostly outweighted by the time needed to post process the image (neg invert, white balance, colour correct) versus the slow scanning speed of a flatbed negative scanner. Never used the cheaper 35mm scanners you can buy, but from what Iâ€™ve seen they&#x27;re just the dslr approach without the quality.<p>I think it comes down to two questions. \n1: Do you own a dslr with a macro lens?\n2: Do you know how to use raw editors like lightroom or darktable?<p>If yes to both, then dslr scanning is easily the cheaper of the two and is most likely the best route to go to test the process.')
