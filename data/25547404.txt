I went to I&#x2F;O every year as well, and toyed with the idea of making a better Exchange&lt;--&gt;Wave connector.  Glad I didn&#x27;t.<p>Also have a prototype for what at the time was an improved Outlook to Google Calendar sync (e.g. it maintained coloring by converting color categories in Outlook to Google subcalendars of matching colors) but was hesitant to productize it one reason being I wasn&#x27;t sure if Google Calendar would live long enough to make it worthwhile.<p>I wonder if a reputation for prematurely killing their products is harming Google&#x27;s ecosystem-building efforts.')
