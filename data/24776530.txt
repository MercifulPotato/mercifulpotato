If that is 1 hour, or 100 hours, that is ok. But stopping unexpectedly halfway through is bad.<p>An easy way for netflix to help is to say &quot;every story on Netflix has an ending.&quot; Which has marketing value and still allows creative freedom, and actually would appeal to creators more.<p>In practice, this means &quot;you can&#x27;t tease a next season that has not been approved yet&quot; OR &quot;you can end on a cliffhanger and is show is authorized for a 1 hour wrap up episode of the next season is cancelled&quot;.')
