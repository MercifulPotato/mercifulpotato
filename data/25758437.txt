HE WANTS A VERBATIM TRANSLATION OF THE &quot;SPACE&quot; MESSAGE AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE TRANSMITTER FROM WHICH IT CAME.  YOUR ATTENTION IS CALLED TO [ILLEGIBLE]-ETTER TO DAVIDSON FROM WALLACE W ELWOOD X WALLACE W ELWOOD, CAPTAIN, USAF X USAF, ATIC X ATIC, DATED 5 X 5 AUGUST 1957 X AUGUST 1957, IN WHICH ELWOOD TELLS DAVIDSON THE MESSAGE WAS IN IDENTIFIABLE MORSE CODE AND FROM A KNOWN US X US LICENSED RADIO STATION.  THIS WAS INTENDED TO SATISFY DAVIDSON THAT HE DID NOT X NOT IN FACT HAVE A SPACE MESSAGE.  HE IS NOT X NOT SATISFIED AND EXPLAINS THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOUNDS ON THE TAPE RECORDING OF THE MESSAGE ARE NOT X NOT MORSE-TYPE.  CAN YOU OBTAIN FROM ATIC THE MESSAGE TRANSLATION, AND THE TRANSMITTER, SHORTLY:  WE&#x27;D LIKE TO DISMISS THIS MAN ONCE AND FOR ALL.  IF YOU CANNOT OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION, DAVIDSON IS GOING TO PRESSURE US FOR PERMISSION TO USE CHICAGO OFFICE LETTERHEAD AND OTHER US X US GOVERNMENT LETTERHEAD HE HAS RECEIVED IN THIS MATTER IN AN ARTICLE FOR SOME SPACE MAGAZINE.  WE ARE SENDING BY BUCKSLIP THIS DATE A PUBLICATION OF DAVIDSON&#x27;S CRITICIZING THE AIR FORCE FOR CONCEALMENT OF INFORMATION ON FLYING SAUCERS.  INCIDENTALLY, DAVIDSON IS NO X NO FOOL AND IT APPEARS THAT ATIC IS TREATING HIM AS ONE IF THEY THINK HE CAN BE SATISFIED WITH A SOP SUCH AS CAPTAIN ELWOOD&#x27;S.&quot;<p>My take: Davidson got hold of a recording of an unknown morse code message, and started claiming it was aliens. The air force just doesn&#x27;t want to deal with him, so someone sends him an official letter that says &quot;It&#x27;s not aliens.&quot; He doesn&#x27;t believe them and says he can tell by the &quot;characteristics&quot; of his recording that it isn&#x27;t a morse code type machine. He asks for the official identifying information of the source of the signal, and further, pressures them that if they don&#x27;t respond, he will use some official letterhead he has to fabricate something for a magazine story. The recipient of the message here is being asked to give Davidson that information, if possible. They further indicate they will attach with the letter a story (&quot;buckslip&quot; is a magazine insert, like an ad) of Davidson&#x27;s, criticizing the air force for hiding UFOs. At the end, the ATIC is admonished for not sending Davidson the full information up front, as he &quot;is no (I repeat, no) fool,&quot; and that the previous sop (a concession of no great value in an attempt to appease someone while not satisfying their actual requests) should not have been attempted at all, because it just made him more suspicious.<p>Furthermore, after reading about Davidson [0], apparently he never believed it was aliens at all, he was trying to uncover secret CIA experimental aircraft.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leon_Davidson#Personal_life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Leon_Davidson#Personal_life</a>')
