Opened an account to host a new project.<p>Went to login the next week to create the instances and launch the projects. Couldn&#x27;t login because the Hetzner console was broken for 2 days. Yes you heard right, everything was broken and unusable for 2 days. Imagine the AWS console down for 2 days for comparison, that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Few days later when the service was restored. I found out the account was banned. It seems they ban new accounts automatically because they&#x27;re afraid of bitcoin miners or something. It&#x27;s not uncommon among cloud providers to ask for an ID or something to verify the account, only problem, Hetzner banned the account but didn&#x27;t ask for anything.<p>Couldn&#x27;t raise a ticket to have the account unlocked because the only way to raise a ticket is to open the account and raise a ticket, that&#x27;s not possible with the account locked.<p>Tried to contact support through the provided support email on their site. They never replied. Tried to contact again. They never replied.<p>At that point the project launch was 2 weeks late. Had to have horrific meetings to explain why everything was late with my reputation on the line, all the fault of Hetzner. Will never use again.')
