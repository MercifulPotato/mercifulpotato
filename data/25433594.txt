For instance, Einstein&#x27;s Special Theory of Relatively is a common example. Ask the average person on the street what it means and they&#x27;d say, &quot;Well of course I know what it means, after all, it means that everything is relative.&quot;<p>Well obviously that&#x27;s not what it means. What it means is that the speed of light is rather impossibly constant. Likewise, economics has this same issue. &quot;Free Market&quot; does not mean everyone has complete free will and has total immunity to persuasion. &quot;Free Markets&quot; defines a philosophy of trade where individuals can own and sell property. Whether or not people are &#x27;easily affected by suggestion&#x27; as you put it, has got no impact on the concept of free markets.')
