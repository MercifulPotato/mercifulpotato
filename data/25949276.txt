Item(by='LatteLazy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611868324, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948920, text='I think it&#x27;s dodgy as fuck that Robinhood are pulling\\baring orders.<p>That said, I think we&#x27;re conflating 2 different ideas here.<p>The first is that market makers in general are unhappy, as claimed in the original comment.  That may or may not be the case, but as I said market makers can withdraw from the market but they don&#x27;t have a legal right to order some brokers to stop trading.  And there are a lot of market makers so if one withdrew it would not stop the others.  And if they all withdrew, there would likely still be at least some sellers.<p>The second idea here is that Citadel ordered Robinhood to do it because they&#x27;re Robinhood&#x27;s biggest customer (&quot;if you&#x27;re not paying you&#x27;re the product&quot; etc).<p>I am sympathetic to that idea, no one pisses off their number 1 customer.  But there are 2 issues with it IMHO.  The first is that it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me that it&#x27;s for Citadel <i>the market maker</i>.  Citadel the market maker don&#x27;t have any real position in GME, they&#x27;re a market marker.  Big trading volumes are good for them and they make their money by keeping any positions as close to zero as possible.<p>That just leaves the rest of Citadel Inc (LLC actually).  Maybe the non-market-making parts are unhappy.  But again, there is an issue:  if they lent on the Market-Maker team to lean on Robinhood, that would be massively illegal.<p>There are really strict rules on the divide between market making and investment banking parts of businesses.  1 phone call (and they&#x27;re all recorded), 1 email, 1 fax, 1 note-via-carrier pigeon from Citadel (market maker or other divisions) to Robinhood and everyone in both teams is looking at serious jail time.  And given the enormous amount of attention GME is getting and the (predictable) blowback on Robinhood for refusing orders, that would be found.<p>So this is either a many-person, very obvious, easily proven, deliberate fraud, or something else is going on.  I don&#x27;t see people taking such a huge risk or being so blatant myself.')
