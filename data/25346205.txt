Soleimani was commander of the Quds Force, one of five branches of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Four Iranian and five Iraqi nationals were killed along with Soleimani, including the deputy chairman of Iraq&#x27;s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed Kata&#x27;ib Hezbollah militia, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis â€“ a person designated as a terrorist by the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</i><p>Indeed the variables (and values of those variables) are not identical between the two scenarios (of which the Soleimani incident is just one example from a very long historic list), but anyone who interprets such concerns about geopolitical relations with China as &quot;crazy&quot; might want to turn their critical lens on themselves and see if anything appears (and while doing so, one should keep in front of mind that seeing faults in one&#x27;s own thinking is far more difficult than seeing it in the thinking of others).<p>To me, those who enthusiastically and confidently underweight risk are a bigger danger than those who overweight it, and from an aggregate societal perspective, there are a hell of a lot more of the former than the latter.  At the end of the day, the amount of actual risk in the system, is the amount of actual risk in the system, which is distinctly different than how most people perceive it, which seems to be roughly that the amount of risk in the system is <i>that which someone says</i> is in the system (aka: <i>an opinion</i>).  Reality is risky&#x2F;problematic enough as it is - layering on this unnecessary phenomenon of completely mistaking our [opinions of X] for [actual X] (and getting angry and anyone who dares to disagree) exacerbates the problem.')
