Whatever brand it is and whoever owns it you can put it near your demarcation point<p>Do you have a reference for that? I have FTTH in France from SFR and I suspect there&#x27;s some funny business going on where you have to jump through hoops in order to replace the provided router. Not only won&#x27;t they provide a DHCP lease if you don&#x27;t ask with the right options, but lately the dhcp server seems to actually stop providing anything at all once it saw an un recognized request. Support has to intervene to make it work again and the issue doesn&#x27;t seem common because it usually takes them a week to find out what&#x27;s up. They would even try replacing the router at your house...<p>Edit: found the EU regulation : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;?uri=CELEX:32015R2120&amp;from=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;?uri=CELE...</a><p>Indeed, it states that the providers should not impose restrictions on the use of terminal equipments, and that users should be free to chose them.
