Most politicians have nothing in common with what Trump is being banned for.<p>Politicians are some of the people most engaged with politics, and I don&#x27;t think such a large chilling effect fully across the subject of politics would be good for people. There are policies and changes from the status quo that I think are very important to improve society (healthcare for all, addressing climate change) and I don&#x27;t think removing the most influential voices discussing and pushing these would be good for these kinds of goals, or improve sites like Twitter.')
