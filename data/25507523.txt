As for collections of answers or old tests, those have always been around and generally aren&#x27;t considered cheating. In fact they&#x27;re good preparation for allowing students to get familiar with the testing environment.<p>But there&#x27;s no excuse for lazy professors&#x2F;instructors and each new test should be distinct. Re-using an old test or old test questions is questionable behavior by a professor.<p>I agree with what Veen posted earlier: the cheating students should be expelled.')
