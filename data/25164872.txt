When I <i>have</i> to use Windows or OS X I&#x27;m always at pains to get some shit that should be basic working:<p>-No package manager. You have to download and install third party stuff like chocolatey (resp. brew). Unless you mean scoop (resp. macports)? In any case you have to commit to one and they&#x27;re much less complete than Debian repos or the AUR so you <i>still</i> end up downloading stuff manually. A thing I don&#x27;t miss from my teenage years is having to remember unchecking all the crap adware from installation wizards.<p>-No &quot;open in terminal&quot; option in file managers. Wtf?<p>-Windows &quot;administrator mode&quot; is incredibly bad and clunky to use. OS X&#x27;s is better but sometimes you have to use sudo even though everyone tells you it&#x27;s bad because nothing else works anyway.<p>-You can&#x27;t just &quot;upgrade everything&quot; - package manager upgrades are distinct from system upgrades because, as said before, package managers are not builtin. Not only is this very clunky, you&#x27;re also completely at the mercy of Microsoft and Apple.<p>-No shortcuts for basic stuff like &quot;open terminal on ~&quot; or &quot;bring up app list with fuzzy search prompt&quot;, &quot;hide all windows and bring desktop to the foreground&quot; - windows used to have them but axed them for some reason? doesn&#x27;t work anymore last time I tested anyway<p>-OS X file system is case insensitive. wtf? Windows still as really weird quirk where they won&#x27;t let you easily browse to the WSL directory from the Explorer file browser, some directories can&#x27;t be easily accessed and some files can&#x27;t be created due to some backward compatibility behavior from 1974. <i>wtf?</i><p>-lots of hardware won&#x27;t work on Windows out of the box, especially drives with more exotic filesystems. never had a problem with Linux<p>Maybe all this stuff is duck syndrome but the same could be said about your &quot;little issues&quot;')
