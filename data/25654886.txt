But it <i>also</i> means that your transmissions are causing less interference for your neighbor(s), and as a result your neighbor&#x27;s equipment will not have to send as many <i>re</i>transmissions that potentially interfere with your own communications. It&#x27;s a second-order effect, but also one that&#x27;s proportional to how many neighbors you have in range that are trying to use the same slice of spectrum. So it&#x27;s entirely possible that by unilaterally shouting less, you cause a significant reduction in wasted airtime that benefits both sides (though probably benefiting your neighbors more than you, depending on where your priorities lie between throughput and latency). It&#x27;s not always a zero-sum game.<p>In general (at least for WiFi), it&#x27;s better to worry about airtime as the scarce resource rather than focusing on bytes per second. For fixed-rate wired networking, transmit time and bytes delivered are exactly proportional, but a variable-rate shared wireless medium decouples the two.')
