You are not allowed to donate to political campaigns.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve often suggested that the real solution is this. Elections and the electoral system are in the public interest, so why not fund it 100% publicly? The FEC sets aside a budget for anyone who gets a certain number of signatures of endorsement.
