Peel back and peer at the CPU and they all look and work much the same.  The CISC implementations typically convert to their own simplified instruction subset internally, and the RISC crowd keep adding fatter and fatter CISC-like instructions.<p>So its not really an x86 instruction set problem.  The legacy that Intel (and, a lesser extent, AMD) seem to struggle to overhaul is in their architecture, not the instruction set itself.<p>This is proven by the M1 doing binary translation of x86 and still being faster than the Intel chips.')
