In principle Texas or California could allocate their delegates proportional to the popular vote of the people in that state.<p>Which might be in the interests of the people in that state, because then candidates would actually bother to solicit votes there. But you&#x27;d have to convince a local government controlled by one party to give about a third of the state&#x27;s electoral college delegates to the other party.')
