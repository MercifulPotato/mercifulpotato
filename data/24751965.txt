Mine will last about 1250 miles with a 250W Bosch CX motor. If I run it unrestricted then it&#x27;s even worse.<p>The front chain ring needs replacing with the chain although I think that is a quirk of the Bosch CX. I can get away with reversing it to extend the life.<p>I haven&#x27;t needed to replace the cassette yet.<p>This is on a well maintained bike, I don&#x27;t see any difference between summer and winter riding.')
