Just little things that, in of themselves, aren&#x27;t bad, but they add up to make everything more difficult.<p>Once an IC is designed, the datasheet doesn&#x27;t substantially change. It isn&#x27;t a computer program that gets continuous updates every couple of months. They might add some errata for some corner cases or clarification. What happens when the IC is discontinued? I still need the datasheet, so I can understand the circuit when finding a replacement IC.')
