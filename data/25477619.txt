AFAIK C# does have some limited type inference (when using LINQ), but it’s nowhere near as powerful and ubiquitous as F#, where the following is completely valid:<p><pre><code>  let Add a b = a + b\n</code></pre>\nand it will be inferred as:<p><pre><code>  let Add (a:int) (b:int) : int = a + b\n</code></pre>\nThis also works in more complicated cases like when you’re accessing a property on a record, for instance.')
