I&#x27;m willing to bet that if someone such as yourself (who is motivated to learn C) started with a weak&#x2F;duck typed language, you would have maintained motivation, and later moved onto something like C, feeling grateful to be learning C. i.e. who you fundamentally are is not altered by the language you first start learning.<p>Now take the reverse. If someone who is not motivated to learn C started out in Python, they&#x27;re more likely to stay motivated, perhaps never learning strong typing. If you start them on C, they lose interest and the field loses a valuable addition.<p>Not everybody has to learn C or static typing or pointers. It&#x27;s okay for people to have a narrow programming&#x2F;comp sci scope and still enjoy the field.')
