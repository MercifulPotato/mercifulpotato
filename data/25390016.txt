For my two year old Airpods they would charge 55€ per pod + another 55€ for the battery in the case, which means that getting new batteries costs as much as the Airpods cost in the first place. (Prices in Austria) I hope my second pair lasts longer.<p>For the Airpods Max they currently list a price of 87€, but as far as I understand there&#x27;s only one battery to swap. But 87€ every few years is still a high maintenance price, hoping they don&#x27;t increase that price.<p>Also, Apple only offers service for a few years. I have a few bloated Macs that would need a new battery but Apple just doesn&#x27;t service them anymore.<p>For many devices you can get replacement batteries from 3rd party sellers, but quality is hit or miss -- there&#x27;s no guarantee the replacement battery is going to last (but in my experience Apple&#x27;s replacement batteries are also unreliable sometimes).<p>Most of my Hifi gear is more than 15 years old. I doubt any of Apple&#x27;s new audio products will last that long.')
