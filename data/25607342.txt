But even interpreting &quot;surface area&quot; to mean &quot;ground area&quot;, it&#x27;s only right in dense areas without open land. The reason schools are built the way they are is to optimize for cost.<p>Some of that&#x27;s land, but some is also the design and construction. You&#x27;re probably hiring a design firm that specializes in building efficient brick box schools and similar institutional projects, maybe with a big glass atrium to have one showcase area, and they&#x27;ve got that design patten pretty well nailed down.<p>When you have space, you get sprawling flat schools. Still probably a brick box, but not a tall one. My school had large portions that were only one floor tall, and one area that stacked two floors. They&#x27;ve since knocked it down and replaced it with a 3-story building, because now they need more capacity and no longer had space to keep tacking additions on.<p>Would it have used a smaller footprint to stack it taller to begin with? Sure, but the building lot wasn&#x27;t the liming factor, budget was.')
