But to be fair, this discussion doesn&#x27;t exist in vacuum. Requesting that Google publish private keys is inherently politically loaded, given recent events. (and it&#x27;s was neither goal or anti-goal in DKIM design, so it&#x27;s not that there is mistake in protocol or something).<p>If some provider decides to implement this proposal, I don&#x27;t think they should do it retroactively and publish old keys.  It would be just inviting additional political shitstorm.')
