I tend to have decision paralysis when searching for information online -- is this method for learning X the best one?  what else do I need to know about X?  Am I ready to learn about X?  Before starting X, what should I know?  In the end, I&#x27;ll end up reading all about the history of Y on Wikipedia, and never even begin with X.<p>So, recently when I get interested in a random topic, I&#x27;ll read some book reviews online and pull the trigger on a used book for under $20.  I know that one day, I&#x27;ll get that spark of curiosity again; when it happens, I know I have a solid book there, waiting for me.')
