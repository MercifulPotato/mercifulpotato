Nor is their word gospel.<p>I say that because I see such supposed &quot;deep&quot; quotes all the time, as if a simplistic proverb-like statement settles a complex real world situation...<p>Not to mention that the quote is used out of context [1].<p>Safety is always temporary -- there are no long term guarantees in history. And we all give up all kinds of essential liberties for safety - that&#x27;s part of living in a society. We pay taxes, we allow ourselves to be taken to prison if we break one of 1000000 laws, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;390245038&#x2F;ben-franklins-famous-liberty-safety-quote-lost-its-context-in-21st-century#:~:text=Benjamin%20Franklin%20once%20said%3A%20%22Those,and%20concerns%20about%20government%20surveillance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;390245038&#x2F;ben-franklins-famou...</a>.')
