Your best bet would be to email DigiCert directly under BR 4.9.2 (Who can requst revocation) at revoke@digicert.com [0], citing termination of the contract between you as the Domain Name Registrant and the Subscriber (i.e. 4.9.1.1 pt 4 as mentioned in the parent comment).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;problemreport.digicert.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;problemreport.digicert.com&#x2F;</a>')
