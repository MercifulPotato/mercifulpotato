Pretty much all constitutional democracies over the last 150 years looked at the US Constitution and said “yeah that part doesnt make sense scratch that, patch this, keep the rest”.<p>The Swiss patched theirs after a comparatively small physical fight for direct democracy at the federal level.<p>The US contains representative democracy over concerns about the speed of communication over a long distance, even though they were referring to 13 states on the east coast in 1780 (admittedly the western borders of those states were practically infinite), Switzerland is not that large and would fit inside of Pennsylvania so the rationale against direct democracy could not be maintained, but as they learned, representative democracy is too convenient for a central organization to relinquish and direct democracy is a threat to it. The people of Switzerland won though, and good for them.<p>The federal government in Switzerland does grow, but very slowly and the loose confederation has an understanding that any canton can make a law and it is honored simultaneously by all the other cantons and inherits the brand of Switzerland. It could get complicated with conflicts of law but it doesnt because the reality is not that much happens.<p>Feel free to correct anything inaccurate.')
