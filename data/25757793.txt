I believe COVID-19 has revealed how dependent we are on China for even the most basic of supplies. America’s inability to domestically manufacture simple things such as masks is deeply worrisome. Think about it. We are unable to manufacture basic things at scale to fulfill basic needs of the country. We are no longer self-dependent. America’s generals have voiced concerns for years about how the majority of rare earth metals are derived from China. Metals of which are used in all of our sophisticated technology, such as computers, missiles, jets, satellites, etc. But COVID has revealed that these concerns span far greater than just technology and weapon systems. Similar to how the tech conglomerates can unilaterally erase the president of the United States in one fell swoop, China can also pull the rug from under us when it comes to supply chain. It’s a national security issue. We shouldn’t make ourselves so vulnerable.')
