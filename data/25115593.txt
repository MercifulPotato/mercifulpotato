In order for your PRNG to have a large enough state space to cover all possible permutations, it needs O(n log n) bits.<p>In the Turing machine model of computation, algorithms that use O(1) space are theoretically equivalent to finite state machines (potentially with a very large number of states). Logarithmic space is where things start to get interesting, because it&#x27;s enough to store a constant number of <i>pointers</i> into an arbitrarily large input.')
