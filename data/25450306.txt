Item(by='notsureaboutpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608162080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447401, text='&gt;Marriage rates are historic lows. Birth rates are historic lows. Women having careers is certainly the current belief why these are so low.<p>In the olden days women had careers also, just only those ones in the upper-class. While women may not have had jobs like we think of them today, they also weren&#x27;t at home taking care of households and chores and caring for children (they had an army of servants to do that for them) and so they pursued many of the same things upper-class men did.<p>Birth rates and marriage rates are low now because our society doesn&#x27;t value marriage and birth as much as previous ones. We no longer attach a person&#x27;s worth to their marital status (and that has had many benefits, don&#x27;t get me wrong). There are ongoing efforts to not see the point of marriage or a family as having and raising children (for now, it&#x27;s still the first thing that comes to people&#x27;s minds though).<p>When that value isn&#x27;t there socially, people won&#x27;t struggle to attain that value. Instead we value material things a lot more (no way for me to prove that but it feels so clear when you read a bit of history or books from back then vs. now), and the best way to attain material things quickly is to not pursue things of declining social value (like babies and marriage).')
