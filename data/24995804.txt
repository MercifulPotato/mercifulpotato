They aren&#x27;t just slightly wrong, they are extremely wrong in not just the overall picture, but in state after state and race after race, in multiple election cycles to the degree that if it happened in any other country, the UN would intervene.<p>The magnitude of their errors are shocking, stunning, and increasing over time. I can&#x27;t understand how anyone can ever look at these again without a canister of salt. If Trump won in a landslide after they predicted Biden up by a landslide but assigned it some kind of probability you&#x27;re going to give them a pass? Of course not.<p>The fact that there are so many polls and they are all wrong means that there is something foul at play at the heart of this entire enterprise. The most charitable thing I could say is that they are completely useless, a toy metric for amusements.')
