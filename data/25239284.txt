Reminds me of Asian business practices (especially in Japan). Yet that should be a warning, not a model to imitate (remember how Japanese tech took over American one? I don&#x27;t either).<p>He&#x27;s right that a company should hire folks that care about their work and the company. The way to do that is with a stock comp. I still see tier 2 markets complaining they are getting tier 2 devs that don&#x27;t care. But when I ask about stock comp they suddenly get defensive.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t brag too much about &quot;working harder than Google&quot;. Because that invites the comparison between the two companies at an equal stage in their respective growth (time, number of employee or funding rounds) and that doesn&#x27;t really make Scale look good. He&#x27;s really bragging that what Google can get out of an engineer in 5 hours, he has to do in 10+.')
