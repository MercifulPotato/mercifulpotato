Everything it does, newer languages do better. Nobody writes new systems in it.<p>C++ on the other hand allows you to do things that other languages simply don’t, so of course it’s still alive. New C++ projects are started every day.<p>A lot of actively developed languages have their niche. Python looks very elegant to mathematicians and engineers, and has fast math libraries. Java has an unmatched ecosystem. And so on.<p>I think PHP&#x27;s niche is low barrier to entry.
