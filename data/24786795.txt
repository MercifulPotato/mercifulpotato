Determination of whether a behavior is anti-competitive is specifically not something a software engineer is trained in. They aren&#x27;t lawyers. The law on this topic is huge, nuanced, and deeply technical.<p>This is ultimately an ethical question, not a legal one.<p>But I guess if you come in with the mindset of &quot;might makes right&quot; then you won&#x27;t see the distinction.<p>&gt; Google isn&#x27;t comfortable with individual untrained software engineers speculating on law for the same reason it isn&#x27;t comfortable with the lawyers getting it and modifying the privacy coding---<p>Surely the equivalent would be lawyers weighing in on the spec of what the &quot;privacy coding&quot; should do. Which is very much something that they ought to do?<p>&gt; people are trained in disciplines that they are highly skilled in, and it&#x27;s important to let them do their jobs.<p>This whole discussion is a perfect example of why this silo mentality is fucking toxic.
