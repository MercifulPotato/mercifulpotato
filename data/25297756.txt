But I also want to restrict children as little as possible, so they can learn to deal with freedom and self responsibility as soon as possible.<p>Up to the point, that they fully take responsibility over their body and life. I don&#x27;t think that this automatically happens at 18 or 21.\nSome are ready at 14. Some never will.<p>&quot;but you will increase the amount of addicts and regular users including users who start using at childhood. &quot;<p>And this is not a fact and not covered by statistics of ares that did legalisation&#x2F;decriminalisation.<p>Because avaiability is very high today already with the illegal status. Take away the temptation of the taboo for rebelling teens and you get even lower numbers. And you can more easily help those who still fall for it.')
