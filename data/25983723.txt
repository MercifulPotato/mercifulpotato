The general language “deal in” and some of the example verbs, especially “use”, point toward a patent license, albeit a very unclear one.<p>I think this is a very carefully couched way of saying &quot;the MIT license doesn&#x27;t protect the licensee from being sued by the licensor for patent violation.&quot;  If person A has a patent on algorithm X, and he wrote open source code which implements X, and he licenses this code to person B under the MIT (or BSD) license, and B uses the code, it&#x27;s feasible for A to sue B for patent violation.<p>For this reason alone, I think MIT and BSD are awful, archaic licenses that should be avoided at all costs.  The Apache 2.0 license is a great substitute.')
