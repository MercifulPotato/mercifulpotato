Item(by='tgsovlerkhgsel', descendants=None, kids=[25053386], score=None, time=1604994712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041967, text='Having seen such failures in Germany, I think the key reason is that government IT contracting requires two very different skills: Government contracting, and IT. And &quot;contracting&quot; skills are much more important than the latter: It doesn&#x27;t matter how good your IT skills are, if you aren&#x27;t good at contracting, you aren&#x27;t getting the job, but if you&#x27;re good at contracting, you can get the job, deliver a shitty product, and still make money.<p>Good IT firms are busy working on free-market projects where they have to deal with 10% of the bureaucracy. It&#x27;s not worth competing against established players who know how to play the government contractor game much better than you, especially if bidding rules may force the government to pick a contractor that they <i>know</i> will deliver a subpar product because it&#x27;s cheaper&#x2F;because their bid is written by someone who knows exactly how to write them.<p>I suspect that if you want to compete in the market, you need to have a &quot;bureaucracy&quot; team that&#x27;s at least as big, if not significantly bigger than, your actual software development team. Even in an ideal market that&#x27;s going to drive prices up.<p>Edit: It seems like in this case, this quagmire was avoided by having the government build a skilled team in-house, avoiding all the overhead of an army of government bureaucrats interfacing with an army of contractor bureaucrats (which is necessary due to the processes that ensure fair contract awards).')
