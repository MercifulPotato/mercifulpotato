Reading WaPo, Bloomberg, and even NYT (though I think NYT has a slight edge here) report on technical issues make me cringe. You can tell they&#x27;re trying to hardest to understand and to explain it in a comprehensible way but it&#x27;s just so bad. Then I think to myself, if that&#x27;s the way it is for computing, what about other technical&#x2F;STEM&#x2F;specialized fields? I trust them for their reporting on those but what if they have missing the important nuances there too?')
