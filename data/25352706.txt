Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25354532], score=None, time=1607468307, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351247, text='1) The article clearly makes a distinction between the types of warrants.<p>Serving warrants in general dangerous, point blank - and even &#x27;white collar criminals&#x27; who don&#x27;t answer the door are giving indication that something may be up.<p>It&#x27;s 100% reasonable for the police to have their weapons upholstered at that point and well within reasonable SOP.<p>2) There&#x27;s no evidence of corruption on behalf of the officials in Florida - this is the continued misrepresentation of some in the press, and  easy echo-chamber populism.<p>There as an argument over how data should be represented; disagreeing with your employer is not &#x27;whistleblowing&#x27;.<p>Again - Florida releases considerably more detailed information than they do in any province in Canada and somehow, everyone seems to think that we are doing &#x27;such a great job in governance&#x27;.<p>The overall level of wilful ignorance on these nuanced incidents in shameful. Even so-called smart people believe what their emotional triggers and biases want them to believe.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing what the courts have to say about it.')
