We had teams that were using all kinds of different collaborative tools. A LOT of teams were using Slack.<p>About four months ago, the edict came down, everybody was being moved to Teams. Usually you hear a lot of grumbling and lots of internal postings about how much better Slack or other tools are, this is a stupid move, etc.<p>This time? Exact opposite. People liked the integrating of most of their MS tools in once place. The transition was pretty smooth and people were happy about moving to Teams. Now, instead of using several different tools, I basically just use Teams now for most of my daily workflow.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how the move went at other companies, but it went a lot smoother than I thought it would here.')
