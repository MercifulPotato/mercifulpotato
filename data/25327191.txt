For those who don&#x27;t know, Cloudflare Workers is their service that answers web queries by running server-side javascript that you&#x27;ve uploaded. It also comes with Workers KV, a very fast key-value storage database (like redis) that the server-side javascript can query.<p>So then, they said why not just upload your static site into the KV database, where the key might be &quot;&#x2F;index.html&quot; and the value is the html content of that page. Then have a short javascript that reads from that KV and returns the requested page. They wrote some client-side scripts to simplify the uploading, and Workers Sites was born!<p>I love how your content is automatically replicated to all of their datacenters and loads super-fast from everywhere in the world. I also love that it&#x27;s really cheap.<p>But the downside is how some features in Cloudflare&#x27;s control panel don&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re hosting your static site this way. For example, I wanted to use the Page Rules to redirect &#x2F;page1.html to &#x2F;page2.html. I also wanted to use Page Rules to set browser caching for *.jpg files. But it turns out that Cloudflare Workers execute code before the Page Rules feature does, so it doesn&#x27;t work! I had to solve both issues by changing their default javascript to build in redirects and browser caching manually. Not too hard, but annoying.')
