Open or concealed doesn&#x27;t matter when it&#x27;s for armed employment - the license from BSIS is what&#x27;s needed. So it seems this was for personal CCW.<p>Edit: Never mind. CA is super stupid and requires a state license to carry a firearm for employment but would then also require a license from the sheriff to conceal it.')
