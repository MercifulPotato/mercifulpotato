I would love to be able to set this device up for my younger kids, allowing them to play Minecraft and Oregon Trail-style edu-tainment type games while leaving the device open for exploration and tinkering.  The walled gardens from the major players are blocked off, and distro-based package managers aren&#x27;t really suitable.  IMHO, one of the best solutions to the fragility of storage would be cloud install&#x2F;save.  Maybe the ecosystem is too fragmented, but hopefully something pops up.')
