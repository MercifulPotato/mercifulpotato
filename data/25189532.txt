When you go through these lists (and <i>especially</i> lists of &quot;unicorns&quot; from the states) you see a few major trends. Many &quot;unicorns&quot; have several of these:<p>- Price dumping and market grabbing through losses subsidised by infinite investor money<p>- Price dumping and market grabbing by aggressively turning everything into gig economy (usually, losses subsidised by overworked underpaid couriers)<p>- Financial market. No one has any savings to speak of, so managing credit is quite a lucrative business indeed.<p>- Outright lies and vaporware: flying cars, innovative vehicles, fantastical medical devices etc. Once again, losses subsidised by infinite investor money<p>And among this humongous pile of outright crap there are just a few companies that actually do something. And out of those may be one actual innovator.')
