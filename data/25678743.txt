Some boy-genius expat?!&quot; because George is a common first name here and (fun fact) Hotz means &quot;thief&quot;. Actually it is written hoț but Romanian teens sometimes write tz instead of ț. He was meant to be a key thief, I guess.<p>I still wonder if they got to examine the video in the courtroom...')
