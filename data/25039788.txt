Item(by='kencausey', descendants=None, kids=[25040670], score=None, time=1604955395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039362, text='I&#x27;m going to push back a little regarding Epson, although I&#x27;m hoping someone with direct experience will reply with useful feedback.<p>The &#x27;ultra-high capacity&#x27; black ink bottle (T542) used by many of these printers is only 127ml.  Further, from the user guide it appears that Epson recommends using the entire bottle to refill the printer (truthfully, I have not been able to find specs on the actual ink capacity of any of the ecotank or supertank printers) and does not recommend storing the bottle after having been opened.  This doesn&#x27;t really seem like bulk ink to me.')
