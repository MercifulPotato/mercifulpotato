One need only look at crashmapper.org to see how often ‘speeding’ is a contributing factor in the few hundred thousand crashes that happen annually in NYC alone.<p>Driver knowledge(and vision, and reaction time) is extremely important, and I completely agree that the USA is too lax in regards to licensing — One need only look at Georgia, where they ‘paused’ the need to pass a road test to be licensed[0].<p>But again, that’s only one piece to the puzzle. What we need is simply a change in how much a driver should be responsible for, as it’s clear that we can’t expect drivers to react in time to prevent crashes, and the shortest stopping distance in the world still wouldn’t make much of a difference in most serious crashes.<p>In many cities in the Netherlands and Sweden for example, they’ve mostly addressed the ‘people problem’ by designing roads to minimize conflicts between different modes of transport by default. On the other hand, in places like NYC, The DOT designs bike lanes with ‘mixing zones’ as the defacto standard. It goes completely against the primary idea of ‘Vision Zero’, which is understanding that humans make mistakes, and designing infrastructure to reduce the likelihood that mistake kills or injures someone.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;georgia-drivers-license-road-test-trnd&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;georgia-drivers-license-ro...</a>')
