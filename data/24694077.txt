My pain to a large extent went away when I stopped staying so still. Now I change my posture on the regular, from leaning against the backrest to sitting away from it to taking little breaks to pace around a bit.<p>I&#x27;m a big guy, 6&#x27;4&quot;, and fidgety. Being tall, I learned early on good posture is crucial for a pain free back, as is strong back muscles. Between that and being always moving, I don&#x27;t deal with a fraction of the body issues a lot of office workers seem to. The worst is long flights, because getting up and walking around at least once an hour is something I don&#x27;t even have to think about, so planes aren&#x27;t great for that. On planes I understand why people want comfort at their desk.')
