A side effect of this is that however much RAM you put in your machine (within reasonable limits), it always looks as though you&#x27;re using the majority of it once you&#x27;re running a few apps. Hence the large number of people who think that they &quot;need&quot; 16GB of RAM when in fact they are just getting a small to medium performance boost from it.<p>You can see a concrete example of this here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PP1_4wek4nI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PP1_4wek4nI</a> The 16GB Macbook Pro is &quot;using&quot; more memory than the 8GB model to run the exact same tasks.')
