Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609436150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593971, text='But replace the last line with 3+j[&quot;foo&quot;] in python (and respectively, echo (3+j[&quot;foo&quot;]) in Nim), and the Python prints 45 whereas the Nim compiler greets you with ~40 lines of output asking you what exactly you meant.<p>Just to clarify: I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;m happy that the compiler bugs you to do 3+int(j[&quot;foo&quot;]) if you&#x27;re going to treat it as an int. But I don&#x27;t consider Nim a statically typed Python.<p>(Also: am a very satisfied owner of a dead-tree version of the Nim book. Thanks! Highly recommended. And dom96 is awesome in general)')
