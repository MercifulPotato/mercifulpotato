I should have qualified.<p>ETH is an excellent school—I&#x27;d be happy to have an ETH degree! They produce tons of good research in computer science (especially geospatial), material science, and others. I think Google is especially there because of the geospatial workforce (and generally highly qualified technologists).<p>By &quot;cutting technical edge&quot;, I specifically meant 1) large numbers of smart people solving important problems in startups  and 2) large numbers of smart people pushing practical technology forward in novel ways. In general, most dev jobs in CH are C++ or Java. I know of a handful of good startups, but not too many. The mentality is generally quite conservative, so most companies do standard technology solutions for standard companies—nothing wrong with that, but I wouldn&#x27;t say you can compare Zürich to Berlin, Barcelona, London, Tallinn, or any of the US startup hubs (and it&#x27;s not just attributable to population size).')
