Is it especially common for Italian coffee shops to use different milk for each, or am I just misunderstanding your comment?<p>On the (admittedly off topic) note of you getting downvotes: I suspect some of it probably has to do with your English writing skills, unfortunately. I would suggest giving a service like Grammarly a shot to try to make your writing a little more professional, because a lot of folks will dismiss comments outright that look poorly written without even considering the underlying thoughts being expressed. It definitely sucks when you&#x27;re trying to communicate in a language other than your primary language.')
