Did you notice how I offered no prescriptive nor normative statements?  I&#x27;m just observing that there are tradeoffs involved--there are some beneficial properties that emerge as the number of choices decrease (along with a bunch of detrimental ones).  Pretending like those don&#x27;t exist does nobody any favors.<p>Since you asked, my opinion is that there&#x27;s a healthy tension between too many choices and not enough choices, and we should strive to maintain that tension.  Which requires an objective understanding of the tradeoffs, instead of knee-jerk reactions to the phrase &quot;vendor lock-in&quot;.')
