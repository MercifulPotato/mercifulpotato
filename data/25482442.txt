I am asking since I am not sure it this is aligned with some of my childhood memory. Back in my days as a pupil in China, I don&#x27;t have to bind the book but still need to buy two things for each new textbook:<p>1. A plastic separate &quot;binder&quot; like thing, which can be attached to the glued together side of the book. Since the textbook are glued together in factory, this additional binder makes the book more solid.\n2. A plastic protect wrap to cover the book back&#x2F;front covers. I used to hand-make these wraps from a very large paper as well, since it looks more &quot;personalized&quot; and cheaper.')
