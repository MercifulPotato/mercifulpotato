From my understanding the fed has been buying corporate bonds and ETFs directly</i><p>The Fed has been buying bond ETFs as a way to buy bonds. (Bonds are illiquid, and a whale like the Fed buying them individually can create artefacts.)<p>When the Fed buys it puts the asset on its balance sheet and gives the seller money. That money can then be spent or re-invested. Spoiler: it&#x27;s been getting re-invested. That is the transmission channel from the Fed&#x27;s buying to other asset prices, <i>e.g.</i> stocks and non-target bonds and Bitcoin and beanie babies.')
