You&#x27;re fighting against a level of double standards that we haven&#x27;t seen since the peak of the Cold War. At best you&#x27;ll be accused of whataboutism.<p>But this is pervasive in some cultures so it&#x27;s taken for granted as a valid approach, look at judges even in free, democratic societies who punish people based on color rather than the crime. It&#x27;s a similar problem albeit with different motives behind it.')
