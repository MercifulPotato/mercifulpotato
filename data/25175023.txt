Anyone whose hands can reach an octave (read: everyone) can become the greatest pianist of all time. The assumption that large hands are needed for great piano play is one made by those who have never heard La Campanella or Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody. My piano teacher could scarcely reach an octave and one additional note and was still able to play any piece she wished to nearly perfectly.<p>Edit: y’all wanna see the real sexism of today? It’s comments like this that make women feel like they can’t reach the skill ceiling of a given activity.')
