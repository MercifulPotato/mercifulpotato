CentOS was my &quot;go to&quot; distribution which I used by default if RAM was enough (it has surprisingly high requirements to install). I know it well. I&#x27;m using RHEL on my home server with developer license, but that allows only for a single instance, and I have more hosts.<p>My ideal outcome would be if they would allow using real RHEL for any hobby projects and for commercial projects with income below some threshold, so I can start and grow with RHEL and then switch to paid option when I&#x27;d have enough income to warrant it.<p>But it&#x27;s IBM, so probably I&#x27;ll have to switch to Debian which is good enough, but I&#x27;d miss SELinux, better systemd integration and more polished packages.')
