(OP here) I&#x27;m using a combination of the Twitter API, RSS, and Puppeteer to put the data together. RSS is nice but not always complete, and some blogs don&#x27;t have it :)<p>Glad you enjoy it, and yes, the goal is to make it easier to find blogs from individuals. I don&#x27;t reject sites hosted on 3rd party platforms, but I do encourage people to post their own domain name when possible.<p>Cheers!')
