There are big fat cores in GPUs but each core can process the same instruction stream 32 or 64 times but with different data. If there is only one core but two branches have to be taken it is obvious that the core has to process one branch after the other.<p>Your &quot;there are cores inside my cores&quot; explanation is what&#x27;s causing the confusion.')
