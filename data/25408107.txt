Good to know it is not slime.<p>Also the physics of the microdroplets above the hot tea is super interesting.<p>If you like this, check out antibubbles[0]. I discovered them for myself as a kid, playing around with soap water &amp; pipettes. If you make a glass of water with half salt-water at the bottom, and inject a solution with intermediate density, the antibubbles will settle at the interface between the layers. They can last for several minutes.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cosjx9fGuPY?t=176" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cosjx9fGuPY?t=176</a>')
