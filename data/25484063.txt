There is a reason GPUs have their own memory bus -- contention. CPU&#x2F;GPUs fighting over access to memory causes massive disruption to very parallel computation.<p>Not sure I totally agree with this.<p>Game console have unified memory architecture and it’s a beloved feature. It greatly simplifies things and allows the CPU to far more easily use results computed by the GPU with complicated sync commands or frame delays.<p>Maybe unified architecture is less valuable for non-interactive programs. I’m not sure. This is a fair bit outside of my wheelhouse.<p>Memory access is definitely one of the biggest bottlenecks. So I fully agree with the general concern. And you may even be right that the unified architecture isn’t that interesting. But I’m not so sure it’s the problem you think it is.')
