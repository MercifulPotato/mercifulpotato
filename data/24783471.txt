If Facebook bans 419 scams, and Twitter bans 419 scams, and Reddit bans 419 scams, and Craigslist bans 419 scams, a fake Nigerian prince shouldn&#x27;t be able to lobby Congress for a Constitutional right to force these private companies to host his content. They&#x27;re allowed to be &quot;collusive&quot; in establishing shared, society-wide norms - that&#x27;s how society works.<p>(Or we could conclude that we cannot make the free market so fair as to fairly represent all of society, but as far as the Overton window in the US is concerned, that&#x27;s an absurdum, and so one of our propositions must be wrong.)')
