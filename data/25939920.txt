There&#x27;s a lot more involved. That&#x27;s what Rails&#x2F;Django&#x2F;Symfony give you a solution for. I agree Next.js could have a faster startup for a landing page. But as soon as you need the most minimal backend, you are way, way, way further to get something robust working if not using one of the full stack frameworks.')
