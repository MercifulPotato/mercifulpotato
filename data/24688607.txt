It should be pretty easy I&#x27;d think. You can measure the traffic volume when nobody is there + 8 hours or so and when you&#x27;re having lively conversation + 8 hours or so (in case there&#x27;s some kind of delay)<p>I know lack of evidence doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist, but if that came up empty then it&#x27;d be hiding pretty good.<p>Although honestly I&#x27;d delay transmission until user interaction and then hide in that noise - it&#x27;d be the first thing I do.<p>Eh, look at the traffic anyway')
