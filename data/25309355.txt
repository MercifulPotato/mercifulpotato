It is the core of the market economics = exploitation argument.<p>Profit is simply value extracted from workers.<p>As opposed to the arbitrage of the subjective preferences of multiple actors. The modern interpretation of how value can just appear.<p>Those workers who got a return on capital delayed consumption now, for more consumption later. That&#x27;s a preference. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a bad thing. But you can see how over a long time it can generate massive inequality.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the fundamental mechanisms of how this occured is particularly exploitive.<p>Where as LTV pretty much just says it your just stealing value.')
