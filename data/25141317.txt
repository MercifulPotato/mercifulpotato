My impression is that hardware has become  a lot more capable even relative to its tasks. With high iops memory, many cores and obscene amounts of RAM, I would expect companies of a much larger scale (in $, FTEs, or most other metrics) can be served by one 4HE machine, or by one rack, or by one room. Thus I would expect the knowledge of how to handle 5000 hard drives to become more obscure, naturally, but the skill to run a decently sized web application to remain almost constant.<p>Does this math work out, or have the tasks become more demanding at the same speed that hardware has improved?')
