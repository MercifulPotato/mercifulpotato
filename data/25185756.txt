On average people will sell to a certain amount of companies, that&#x27;s what will be factored in. Perhaps you can get a slightly better deal selling to twice as many companies, though of course this gives you extra hassle as well (which has a cost). The benefits you will receive are in any case marginal, of necessity. I do not deny they can be bigger than the company&#x27;s benefits in individual cases.')
