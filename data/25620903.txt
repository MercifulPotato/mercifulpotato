Is your car&#x27;s ECU readily programmable?<p>Because the way I see it and the way Apple markets the iDevices, they&#x27;re not general computing devices.\nThey&#x27;re not computers in the Wozniak, IBM, Stallman, Torvalds sense.\nThey&#x27;re not DIY devices.\nThe DIY tinkerer friendly computers exist and are sold as of today with various levels of DIY-ness -- and their user friendliness and security often suck because of their very nature.<p>It&#x27;s literally because of the openness and customizability that the Linux desktop experience sucks HARD for any kind of non-programmer professional usage. (And before you hit that reply button, i KNOW that YOUR i3 no-mouse vim emacs org-mode Arch setup works just fine.
