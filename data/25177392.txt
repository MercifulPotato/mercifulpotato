All locked overnight in January with no explanation or response to emails from their support dept[0].<p>It took 6  months and a formal GDPR complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner before Twitter finally unlocked the accounts and admitted they&#x27;d made a mistake[1]:<p><pre><code>  &gt;Hello,\n\n  &gt;We’re writing to let you know that we’ve unsuspended your \n  &gt;accounts. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to see you \n  &gt;back on Twitter soon.\n\n  &gt;A little background: we have systems that find and remove \n  &gt;multiple automated spam accounts in bulk, and yours was flagged \n  &gt;as spam by mistake. Please note that it may take an hour or so \n  &gt;for your follower and following numbers to return to normal\n</code></pre>\nSo yes. It does happen and, when it does, you have little to no chance of actually getting hold of a real human being to talk to, or who can give you any explanation as to why it occurred.<p>Thankfully in my case, it was just some shitty Twitter accounts and I&#x27;m actually quite glad it happened now as it gave me the impetus excise another pointless moronic social network from my online life.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stiobhart.net&#x2F;2020-03-18-twittergdpr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stiobhart.net&#x2F;2020-03-18-twittergdpr&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stiobhart.net&#x2F;2020-06-14-twatter-revisited&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stiobhart.net&#x2F;2020-06-14-twatter-revisited&#x2F;</a>')
