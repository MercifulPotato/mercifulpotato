Only if you&#x27;re VERY active in trading (many trades every month) should you consider IB. But yes, they&#x27;re very premium service, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re for typical investors (who might only trade once or twice a month).<p>Your standard brokerage firms all work: E-Trade, TD Ameritrace, Schwab, Fidelity etc. etc. Stocks are easy, they all got them covered. It really doesn&#x27;t matter who you go with for stocks.<p>Fidelity is a bit better with bond offerings. TD Ameritrade is known for their nicer interface (Think or Swim), especially for options trading. E-Trade IIRC has some good international offerings but still has a pay-per-trade business model.<p>It depends on what you want. But... stocks are real easy, everyone does stocks just fine. Its more about asking what your secondary investments are going to be: Forex, Options, Bonds, and the like')
