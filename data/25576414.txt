We are very much seeing a rapidly collapsing overton window, where any inquiry or worse the person that is at odds with a very particular liberal belief is immediately cancelled. It largely asks that ad-hominem attacks and slippery slope arguments be avoided and discourse around heated topics be civil.<p>Tech has largely jumped head first, siding with the hyper-liberal wing of politics in American discourse. This is when the conclusions reached by the said political groups are heatedly argued in both political, academic and societal spheres. I myself feel the air of fear and the prescription of though at my BigN workplace. The argument that it is indeed stifling tech+research at large is entirely reasonable.<p>Yann LeCun got chased away from twitter by Gebru. Anima Anand kumar&#x27;s tweet displayed an active participation in cancelling and chasing out anyone who does not fall in line with a very narrow definition of equality in society.<p>There is immense value in exploring the effects of tech and progress on society. There is immense value in commitment to being fair and accountable. It is incredibly important for the people with the power to wield such a hammer, be most level headed, civil and create policies based on consensus. There is a reason that supreme court justices are lawyers and not activists. As of now, the bearers of power display none of those properties.<p>The open letter merely points that out and asks for equal representation of ideas without threat of being fired or sidelined in entirity.<p>&gt; We support discussion of policies aimed at a more diverse and inclusive society; a range of opinions is natural. We condemn all attempts to coerce<p>It is bizzare to see people of science fall in line with claims that don&#x27;t satisfy even the basic requirements of rigor. Scepticism and inquiry are the foundations of this entire field. As of now I see a very political section of the community making &#x27;extra ordinary claims&#x27;. As is customary around these parts, it isn&#x27;t unreasonable to ask for &quot;extraordinary evidence.&quot;')
