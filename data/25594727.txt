But the carrier that delivers it is insuring against the person it&#x27;s delivered to.<p>So for example.<p>I get a robo-call, I report it and my carrier pays me $5.<p>They then can collect that $5 from the carrier that delivered that call to them, who can collect it from the  carrier that routed it to them who can collect it from the end user.  And if at some point you can&#x27;t collect you&#x27;re stuck paying the $5.')
