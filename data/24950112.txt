And I felt that feature gives motivation for its user to contribute more and more.\nThen, I came up with an idea to build a personal task manager app that shows the user activities in a similar way. Then, during the development, the feature list has been grown more and more.And I named the app Tinido with a slogan: &quot;Do tiny things&quot;. I hope that this app can manage small tasks and encourage users to complete these smalls steps continuously.<p>I am so happy that the first version has just been released on App Store. I wrote this post to introduce the app and look for your valuable feedback. \nBesides, if you have any questions related to technical things, I am happy to share my experience related to iOS programming, or backend-less development using Amazon Amplify.<p>Thank you.')
