In fact, I think it&#x27;s inadvertently makes an important side point.<p>When you&#x27;re making music, you should make stuff you ACTUALLY like, instead of something some theoretical person would like. If you like it, at least a few other people will too. If you don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no guarantees anyone will. It&#x27;s awesome finding music that expresses something you only think you feel, or has some weird jokes that you find hilarious, or is made by some nerds who slip in a subtle pun or something.
