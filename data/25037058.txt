I&#x27;ve had a cheap laser printer for about 6 years now, and I only think about it once or twice a year when I need to print something.<p>I don&#x27;t do any maintenance, and I don&#x27;t worry about the ink drying out.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t take a one-time payment of $70 in exchange for having to do regular printer ink maintenance for 6 years, so it makes sense to pay an extra $70 to avoid that. Paying the extra $70 makes even more sense if you factor in the fact that I&#x27;d actually have saved $72 in monthly payments over that time period.')
