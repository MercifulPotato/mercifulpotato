Do they pull up a list of symptoms and ask what they would test&#x2F;try next? Do they show them x-rays and ask them to spot the coronavirus?<p>Seriously? Or do they look at your degree and experience and conclude that if you worked at General Hospital in Atlanta for 5 years you can work at Metro Hospital in Philadelphia?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know how other professional industries hire industry-hires (not college grads&#x2F;interns) but I only hear about quizzes and riddles and online tests and shit like that in programming.<p>Hell, do they do the same shit for electrical engineers? Chemical engineers?<p>I really want to know if they do and if not, how is it Boeing can hire a EE without a whiteboard puzzle but can&#x27;t hire a CE without that bullshit?')
