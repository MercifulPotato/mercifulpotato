Then, what was the median salary in the US in 1980 vs 2020. Thats the real comparison.<p>Per the St. Louis Fed [1], the median American home price in 1980 was ~65k. The median American home price in 2019 was ~320k. That&#x27;s an approximately 4.9x increase. Also from the St. Louis Fed, the 1980 median American family income was ~21k, and the 2019 median American family income was ~86k. That&#x27;s an approximately 4.1x increase. So it looks like median house price has increased about 20% more than median salary.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MSPUS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MSPUS</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEFAINUSA646N" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fred.stlouisfed.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;MEFAINUSA646N</a>')
