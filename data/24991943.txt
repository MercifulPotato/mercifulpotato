The stock images are more or less fool proof if you pick USB radio receivers that are on the supported list.  I had wired a GPS to it too at one point - but had an incident with a model airplane and a lake, so continue to use the external Dual.  I&#x27;ve never gotten around to putting it in a one unit case.. basically end up tossing it in the back seat dangling everywhere.<p>I replaced our Stratus (guess where the project name originated from) with the homemade one.  On the recommended hardware, it is solid.  I was also able to (usually) make it work on non-certified (if you can call this hand rolled combination certifiable) hardware like the pi zero.  Hit and miss with the newer stuff.  Need to pick up one of the newer pis to help out with the porting.  By far, my biggest issue was making sure the battery pack was charged.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sportys.com&#x2F;stratus-3-ads-b-receiver.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sportys.com&#x2F;stratus-3-ads-b-receiver.html</a>')
