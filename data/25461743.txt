I always planned on running my own businesses and as such, have been through a handful since graduation. I learn more and more with each &quot;failure&quot;, and get farther on the next venture each time as a result.<p>However... These days, I find it very difficult to not only go through the usual routines of checking+responding to email, nonetheless actually improving or finishing my projects to see what could result (success?).<p>With the latest venture, my cofounders are attempting to leave me with nothing despite investing low 6-figures in capital and having legal share ownership (per a contract we all signed).<p>I can tell in my blood that entrepreneurship is what I want to do. I feel as though if I had a mentor who could use a (no self-brag intended) ambitious software engineer and thinker to build&#x2F;empower projects, and we support each other in some way, that would be the dream. I know I’m capable of much bigger things than current, but clearly need mental repositioning and perhaps even a complete switch on what I’m working on.<p>Given the above, do you have any advice for a 20-something (nearing 30) that is tired and has been betrayed more than once in the startup game? A long read, I know. Have been trying to figure out my future path for many weeks now honestly. I greatly appreciate it.')
