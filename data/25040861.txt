Anyone who actually takes a look at the photos of what the &quot;clock&quot; looks like will immediately think it looks like a bomb. Now imagine ANYone, literally anyone, doesn&#x27;t matter what race or what skin color, taking that around school and showing it off to teachers or other random people who won&#x27;t know any better when they see it and get spooked, and for good reason. It could&#x27;ve been the last thing they ever see. They are lucky it was just some kid&#x27;s joke clock this time.')
