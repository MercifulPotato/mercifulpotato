Item(by='pkrumins', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610492972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25751808, text='Twist (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twist.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twist.com</a>) solves this problem entirely. Instead of chat rooms where everyone chats about everything, it organizes discussions around tasks. Each task gets its own chat room. When you work on task X, you chat in task X&#x27;s chat room. If you work on multiple tasks, you have multiple rooms, one per task. When you come back to a task, you just open the task&#x27;s room and continue where you finished. When the task is finished, that conversation is pretty much over. It&#x27;s a get things done product. No useless chatting and conversations don&#x27;t overlap. Go use Twist!')
