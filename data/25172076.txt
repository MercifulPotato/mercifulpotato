In development variability is both desirable (it&#x27;s how we innovate) and quite large, so we must obsess about maximising our use of feedback to guide our designs.<p>There&#x27;s more on the perspective in Reinertsen&#x27;s book on the <i>Principles of Product Development Flow</i>. I highly recommend it for anyone, but particularly someone who knows a bit about manufacturing but wants to effectively translate this knowledge to product development.')
