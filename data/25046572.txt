It has descriptorheaps that are bit different. This extension basically makes them quite similar. First of all the descriptors can be stored into the same place (In Vulkan the descriptors are strongly typed.). With this an image or buffer etc can use same descriptor in a set, like DX12. In addition the CPU only heap is exposed in this, allowing the platform to directly implement DX12 heaps with desc sets.<p>Don’t really think this would help with DX11 at all. But it would make the mess that is DX12 binding model more tolerable to emulate.<p>Still not sure how would they emulate the root parameters to their full extent though.')
