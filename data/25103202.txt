I think market forces are important, but sometimes, when the situation warrants it (global emergency), you have to use the regulatory stick. We’ve run out of time for the Imaginary Hand to save us.<p>During World War 2, the US gov didn’t go to manufactures and kindly ask them to retool for the war effort. They demanded it. Similar situation, similar (but not quite as draconian) implementation. “You will build only EVs now, retool accordingly”.<p>Governments are even willing to invest in manufacturing and charging network costs, and green&#x2F;central banks are coming with easy money. I’m unsure what other support you can provide at this point to make the transition smoother, considering petroleum consumption externalities are already unpaid for by the entire supply chain.')
