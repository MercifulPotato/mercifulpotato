I could get a lot more bang for my buck and build a system that was specced exactly the way I want.<p>The rub for me is that I <i>really dislike</i> Windows. I use it for work - I have to - but it&#x27;s not an OS I&#x27;d choose for myself[0]. I <i>like</i> OSX but the problem there is that, unless you go down the Hackintosh route (which soon I suspect won&#x27;t really be a viable option anyway with the move to ARM), you have to buy preconfigured Apple hardware.<p>And then there&#x27;s desktop Linux, which fills me with dread simply because I&#x27;ve not had great experiences in the past. Moreover, some key software that I need simply won&#x27;t run on it. Notably Ableton Live. (I know Linux-compatible DAWs exist, but I <i>really like</i> Live and don&#x27;t want to have to give it up.)<p>A decade ago, for me, buying a Mac was unequivocally the best option. Now that&#x27;s perhaps no longer the case and, worse, there aren&#x27;t any other great options that I can see. I&#x27;d be glad to be proven wrong though.<p><i>EDIT: Actually, maybe what I could do is dual-boot Windows and Linux. Use Linux for software development and most everything else (even Office 365 will run on Linux under Wine nowadays, apparently), then use Windows for Ableton Live and games. With UEFI it might not be the worst thing in the world to set up and maintain either.</i><p>[0] The main beef I have with Windows is that it just doesn&#x27;t get out of the damn way. It really wants you to know it&#x27;s there, from the dreadful multi-DPI multi-monitor support[1], gimpily inconsistent UI, the shitty 10 second dance all your desktops and windows do when you plug in another monitor[2], and crappy update mechanism, to the driver issues, WiFi connectivity issues, ropey audio support, instability and blue screens. And there&#x27;s always, <i>always</i>, ALWAYS some random thing or other sucking CPU and running the fans. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: every problem that bothers me on Windows also bothers me on OSX. It&#x27;s just that on Windows these problems bother me several times per day, whereas on OSX I&#x27;m bothered by <i>one</i> of these issues maybe once a month. The upgrade to Catalina was initially painful and enraging but after the first couple of weeks, having upgraded everything, all was well again and remained so.<p>[1] Granted, likely to be less of an issue with a desktop system where you&#x27;re likely to purchase monitors with identical DPIs and resolutions.<p>[2] Also less likely to be an issue with a desktop system, unless you need to use a KVM so you can share your desktop displays with your work laptop.')
