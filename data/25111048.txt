I don&#x27;t think it would be practical to come up with perfectly precise rules for what is appropriate, only guidelines. Even <i>never throw an exception</i> seems too strong, as you might want to do range checks. <i>Never block</i> would complicate logging.<p>&gt; If the syntax sugar isn&#x27;t your cup of tea but you agree with using methods over fields<p>Yes, I think that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m going with this. The advantages  of avoiding public fields seem clear enough, we just disagree about the merits of properties.')
