Heck, they&#x27;ve branched out into creating content now with TV+ and to a lesser extent Fitness+ and their Radio offerings.<p>A car though? How does that mesh&#x2F; integrate with my phone&#x2F; laptop in such a way where it really makes it a super appealing offering. Apple&#x27;s satellite devices sell well because they integrate with other Apple devices super well.<p>Do we care if our car is integrated with our phone? In particular, do we care enough to pay a premium?<p>EVs are essentially giant batteries, a few motors, and a computer with seats bolted on. Apple is good at computers and maybe batteries. I just don&#x27;t see how Apple is going to bring together a machine which is appealing enough to really take off.')
