Since both are there though, that does make it unnecessary in this particular example.<p>However, there is one thing that could be done with &quot;if&quot;:  in arturo, it&#x27;s documented to always return null, however in rebol it returns the value of the evaluated block, making &quot;if&#x2F;else&quot; and &quot;either&quot; work as a ternary (and just &quot;if&quot; returns a none! if it was false).')
