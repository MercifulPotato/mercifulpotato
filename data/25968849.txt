It&#x27;s maths descriptions of the items&#x2F;abilities + the lol formula. So the vast majority of the builds are novel. (Some of them happen to line up with what is currently played.)<p>Are they effective is a good question, basically that needs lots of play testing by real players. I&#x27;ve added guides so people can tell other people about good builds they have found.<p>So when developing it, I took some existing builds from the internet and I broke them down into a ratio of stats aka (1 damage: 1.5 cooldown (now AH): 1.2 late game health) and then had the GA reconstruct those builds from the ratios.<p>On the builds being played by the pros created by professional analysts, I got back very similar looking builds. On random builds from site like mobafire I got back completely different builds.<p>Thinking back, when Cloak of Agility was briefly buffed last year, it came back with the exact amount of them to spam and exactly when to do it.
