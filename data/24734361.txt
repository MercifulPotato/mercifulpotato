Item(by='dublin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602277085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24727474, text='In opposition to both the article and the comment above, Usenet (actually uucp) bang-paths are VERY different from domain names, in that they don&#x27;t represent any kind of organizational (in this case, naming) hierarchy at all, but rather a source-routed <i>path</i> of how to get there.  For instance, a uucp email address might look like:<p>well-known-host!next-host!third-host!fourth-host!mailhost!username<p>(another syntax for the last 2 nodes above might be username@mailhost, depending - this became popular later on...)<p>Although this might work just as well:\nwell-known-host!other-host!mailserverhost!username<p>Note that each hostname in such an address is a short, local hostname, not an FQDN.  As shown, the first host was usually a &quot;well-known&quot; host in the uucp world, something like say, ucbvax.  While uucp addresses were sometimes rewritten (some intermediate hosts tended to get hammered, and remember, this was back when bits weren&#x27;t free), this was frowned upon for obvious reasons.')
