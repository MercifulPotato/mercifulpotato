You do that on that F because it is roughly in the middle of the range of the instrument meaning you&#x27;ll be off the minimum on the other notes. If you tuned it on the highest or lowest note the other end would be off considerably.<p>The sax is a wonderful instrument but it is definitely a finicky one, I&#x27;ve never found one that had all the notes in tune when played without corrective measures, and I&#x27;m not even sure that it could be done, the flexibility you get in making it go sharp or flat on purpose comes with the price of having to correct almost every note you play.')
