It lets you define rules or &quot;checks&quot; for your spreadsheet and will then send you a notification when they match via Email, Slack or Teams. Google used to have a similar thing built in directly but decided to remove it, there still seems to be demand for such a thing so I&#x27;ve been working on something that adds that functionality back.<p>The add-on runs primarily in Google&#x27;s Apps Script environment which is essentially like Lambda&#x2F;Cloud Functions although it&#x27;s been around for way longer. In terms of the tech stack the frontend is a fairly simple Vue app and the backend is written in TypeScript.
