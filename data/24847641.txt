I can&#x27;t talk about specifics but I&#x27;ve worked several places where GPL code was forbidden, particularly in products we built that were installed on premise, and LGPL regarded with suspicion.<p>(IANAL) LGPL isn&#x27;t generally a problem (from my reading of it), but it gets grey the moment you include a library (even unmodified) that is released under GPL. And this is where everyone starts getting nervous, regardless of whether it&#x27;s OK to do that without handing over your source code or not.<p>That confusion, if it is an invalid concern, suggests that at the very least the GPL does not do a good job of explaining itself.')
