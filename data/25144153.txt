Years ago I used to be able to find almost anything, no matter how obscure it was, if I tried hard enough. Today I most often just give up, because it sometimes seems like you can&#x27;t find the answers to even really basic questions. I don&#x27;t know what they did, but every search engine is now a complete garbage. They&#x27;re now basically just shortcuts to the actual search features on websites that everyone already knows, when you&#x27;re too lazy to type in the URL or click on a bookmark to the actual website.')
