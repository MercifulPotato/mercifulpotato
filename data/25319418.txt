One, their motives are because they want slaves that can&#x27;t rat them out to illegal activites.  Two, they &quot;remit most of their paycheck out of the country. Three, if everyone  had to travel to the other side of the planet to get a job, that would be fucking insane for everyone.  Four, their managers are foreign gangsters who don&#x27;t give a fuck about this country.<p>Facebook already has offices over there.  Everywhere.  They could hire tomorrow.  They want slaves and slavery is what this shit is about.<p>This is how it works.  Foreign manager bribes a US based VP and gets a inter-company transfer.  Automatic L1 visa no questions ask.  Then they start selling 200-500k jobs to people they know back in their home country.  Those people pay a cut, maybe $50k maybe $150k to their trafficker in order to come to the US  as a SDE away from their &quot;shithole&quot; country and make $50k.<p>They don&#x27;t know what they are doing.  Doesn&#x27;t matter, SDE, manager, director, VP are all from the same country and are a fucking GANG')
