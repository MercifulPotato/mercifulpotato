At 23:10 he says no to annotations because he thinks one day the tools will be smart enough to give you the same guarantees&#x2F;diagnostics without them, so at 24:50 he concludes that he doesn&#x27;t want to have to remove annotations when that comes to pass.<p>(don&#x27;t shoot the messenger! I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with these conclusions...)<p>(edit: tried to make the summary clearer)')
