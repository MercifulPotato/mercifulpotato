Plus there&#x27;s the possibility of using EVs as a distributed battery system, and lots of other clever ideas like that.<p>But it&#x27;s not enough. We hit a record load this summer, and expect another record this year.<p>Add on the extra burden of regulation that enforces green energy production, and we&#x27;re edging toward not being able to meet customers&#x27; needs. (Green energy is a worthy cause, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but far more costly and time-consuming to build out the infrastructure.)<p>TLDR; We&#x27;re struggling. Real bad.<p>(Edited to add: I should define &quot;struggling.&quot; We strive to keep prices as low as possible, and also to fund low-income assistance programs. We keep having to raise prices, are looking at jacking them up even more this year, and are struggling to fund our low-income programs.<p>Our community is deeply hurting from these changes, and are making their voices heard.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m very pro green energy. But the effects of green regulation needs to be seriously studied and the negative impacts mitigated.)')
