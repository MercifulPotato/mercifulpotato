Technical skills are probably weakly correlated -- that&#x27;s my prior, it would be good to see a study.<p>I did find a paper examining the performance of TopCoder participants: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10664-019-09755-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s10664-019-09755-0</a>')
