While I&#x27;m also against cherry picking journalism, oh well, they cant be targeted either.<p>If you&#x27;re in one hand with a camera and the other hand a rock or molotov cocktail, you&#x27;re not a journalist. Too many folks are claiming to be journalists when they&#x27;re not and for me, that ain&#x27;t right. This leads to governments being allowed to be authoritarian with, sadly, very good reason that will convince mass populations to vote against the freedom of the press.<p>How these two types of individuals are being confused, that&#x27;s beyond me. Again, I think we should all just go back to being hunter gatherers and fight bears for blueberries at this rate.')
