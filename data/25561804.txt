ERCOT operates an auction to match the supply of electricity to demand at any given moment. In PJM, they have an energy market, but there&#x27;s also capacity markets, where people can get paid by being ready to generate on demand. The idea being that the capacity market will reduce some of the price volatility that happens in ERCOT, where sometimes energy goes for thousands of dollars per MHw.<p>The PJM and ERCOT markets, where any independent operator can interconnect and start trying to make money, are in stark contrast to a lot regulated utilities in the US. Under the regulated utility model, the utility tries to maximize profits under the constraints of what the regulator will let them get away with, and what the regulator will let the utility bill to the customer. Often, the regulator&#x27;s rules tend to make the utility want to build lots of transmission, because that&#x27;s a guaranteed 20% profit. Whereas if the utility adds lots of cheaper new generation, they are at risk of putting old assets out of business, which means lost capital investments.<p>So when we want to find out what the true costs of electricity are, we should look to where investors are putting their money in PJM and ERCOT, and ignore anybody who works for a regulated utility. The motives are completely different.')
