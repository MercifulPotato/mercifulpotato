Item(by='Andrex', descendants=None, kids=[25442801, 25442840, 25443904], score=None, time=1608127133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441885, text='&gt; At a buck or two each, that adds up quick.<p>Does it? That honestly seems like a waste of time unless you&#x27;re doing 500+ a &quot;job&quot;, and the time&#x2F;energy needed to steal 500+ pallets seems like a negative return on investment. And who has 500+ pallets sitting around unguarded in one place? Enough to make pallet stealing profitable? I&#x27;m unsure.<p>If recycling a pallet was more in the $10-15 range each, I could maybe see the argument.')
