The Pulumi docs on making a custom resource are just extending a class. Making a <i>good</i> one I&#x27;m sure is fraught with peril but it&#x27;s so much easier than trying to extend terraform as far as I can see, I&#x27;m glad that Pulumi has done this for me.<p>&gt; Moreover, you&#x27;re entrusting your entire production stack to an ultra-aggressive, hypergrowth, early stage startup...<p>Source code is Apache 2.0 and available[0]... I&#x27;m not against them trying to profit, but they&#x27;ve created a useful thing that is licensed very permissively (they could have gone with BSL or whatever else)...<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pulumi&#x2F;pulumi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pulumi&#x2F;pulumi</a>')
