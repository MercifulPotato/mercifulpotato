It looks like LibreOffice may handle complex graphics better than wmf2svg.  You can do batch conversion with it, too.<p><pre><code>  libreoffice --headless --convert-to svg Popular&#x2F;tennis.wmf\n</code></pre>\nHowever, I haven&#x27;t found a way to preserve the original canvas size.  It seems you need to crop the image separately.<p><pre><code>  inkscape --with-gui --verb FitCanvasToDrawing --verb FileSave --verb FileQuit tennis.svg\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll try this method and upload the LibreOffice conversions in their own archive if they look good.<p>Edit: They look good so far.  I&#x27;ll upload them as SVG-LibreOffice.zip when they are done.')
