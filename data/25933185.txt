One of my minor claims to fame in life is that I worked with a guy who was a test pilot, and actually flew in this aircraft.<p>Of course, your larger point stands however, and general there&#x27;s no &quot;type conversion&quot; craft like you see in other two-seaters for this purpose. That said, if you had a solid flight background in other types of aircraft, it&#x27;d be unlikely that you&#x27;d have issues in the A-10. It&#x27;s reportedly an easy craft to fly, there&#x27;s little peculiarities that would give a pilot issues like you see in some high-performance craft. Straight wing, low landing speed, no built-in aerodynamic instabilities or anything like that.')
