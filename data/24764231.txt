The list of ways grows...<p>My &quot;favorite&quot; is if you once had a spare FB account for playing some game, and later FB has blocked that account (for inactivity, or being obviously fake _after_ they instituted the real name policy)... but you still get occasional emails from FB begging you to come back and login - your friends miss you!  Of course you cannot login, and you cannot stop the fucking emails from FB.  There&#x27;s no process for dealing with this, so you ultimately have to write a custom filter to process these zombie FB emails.<p>I urge everyone, no matter what your &quot;need&quot; to have an account on FB is, to just stop logging in.  Don&#x27;t delete the account... just never login again.<p>Facebook will continue as a bad and irresponsible actor of global proportions until we collectively send it the way of MySpace.')
