But this is really a distinction without a difference, as they achieve the same goal, which is to put an idea in the mind of the listener&#x2F;reader which the speaker&#x2F;writer knows to be false. After all, lying isn&#x27;t what got us into the current era of a post-truth public discourse. What got us here is a historical and ongoing toleration of journos and politicians who are careful truth tellers in a technical sense, but liars in practice.<p>In my opinion, these liars-in-practice are far more pernicious than the liars-in-fact. It&#x27;s easy to disprove a fact, whereas it takes time, effort, and some analytical ability to unpack a carefully worded untruth.<p>Apologies for the rant.')
