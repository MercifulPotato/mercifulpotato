The point is not that dependencies exist, or even that a package might have many dependencies.<p>The point is, Rust (and NPM) I have found many times dont care or even consider the impact of a large amount of dependencies, and often take no steps to mitigate or reduce that number.<p>As others said, some features could be split off into other crates. Maybe someone only needs HTTP, or maybe they need HTTPS but no Async. Or maybe they dont need logging. With Hyper and others you just have to build everything whether you want it or not.')
