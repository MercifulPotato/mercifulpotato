And would take a lot less energy to run that heat-pump than to actually heat that something to 61C.<p>What I&#x27;ve become interested in, is how easy it is to &#x27;abuse&#x27; heat pumps like this. Could you take a heat-pump and this 60C water to heat a boiler to the point you can run a steam-turbine that produces more energy than it takes to run the heat-pump?<p>If not at 60C water, does this work at any temperature? There remains free energy in the temperature differential between an ambient 21C and the temperature of warmer water. It seems to me this should be harvest able. There are significant limits here from the Carnot theory, but they don&#x27;t say this is impossible.')
