The fact that you&#x27;re digging through my comments and trying to attack me personally is why I say this. But I&#x27;ll play along for argument&#x27;s sake:<p>Yes, I pay extra for grocery delivery or pickup, only order at places that do curbside or occasionally delivery, ordered a lot more than normal on Amazon and avoided public transit because yes, I can afford it. <i>Would you rather I increase the population on the bus, in the grocery store and in restaurants even though I don&#x27;t need to?</i> Would you rather I keep the delivery fee I&#x27;d otherwise pay to my grocer &amp; have them <i>not</i> employ extra people right now?<p>Yes, anyone who can afford to should be ordering pickup, delivery, etc. because it is less circulation of people and therefor reduces spread of the virus. This is the responsible thing to do. Less people circulating means less virus, and <i>this is good for everyone, rich and poor alike.</i> Not to mention all my extra spending on delivery directly from my butcher, grocer, etc. is injecting more money into my local economy and creating more opportunities for employment in the service sector which is currently being savaged by the pandemic.<p>I am sympathetic to your frustration, but I don&#x27;t understand your lashing out at me over it. Do you want to share what frustrates you about this? Or hell, go ahead and give me advice if you want: What do you think I should be doing differently, in your opinion?')
