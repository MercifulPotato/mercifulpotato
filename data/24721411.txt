I almost always view every discussion board I&#x27;m on as wide open as possible in order to see taboo-breaking or uncomfortable opinions and to get an idea of where the population of readers is leaning on a topic and tags by other users would also be useful.  It&#x27;s more information about why people like or dislike things, which I find almost as interesting as the comments themselves.')
