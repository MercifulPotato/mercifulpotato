You can come up with lots of strategies with arbitrary conditions that would have given you great returns throughout the past century, but completely fail after you implement them. I don&#x27;t see why dollar cost averaging is any different.<p>&gt; it’s statistics<p>Exactly. And nothing in statistics is guaranteed. The fact that it&#x27;s worked well 100% of the time in the past does not imply that it will work 100% of the time in the future. Does it seem highly unlikely that DCA will stop being an effective investment strategy in the foreseeable future? Yes. But I take issue with the &quot;100% guaranteed&quot; claim, and everyone should realize that <i>no</i> investment strategy is completely risk-free.')
