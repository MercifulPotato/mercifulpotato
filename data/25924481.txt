Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=[25924610, 25924901], score=None, time=1611723611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924096, text='&gt;supporting restrictions on speech and privacy violations<p>That&#x27;s a confusing phrase. It took me a while to realize you meant &quot;supporting privacy violations&quot; rather than &quot;supporting restrictions on privacy violations&quot;. You seem to be lumping speech restrictions and privacy violations into the same bucket, but I see them as very different, often even opposed to each other. The US elevates free speech higher than privacy. Europe elevates privacy higher than free speech. In many European countries the press isn&#x27;t allowed to report the names or faces of suspects. In many European countries you can&#x27;t take pictures of people walking on the street.<p>Doxing is a clear case where free speech is directly opposed to privacy. Same with right to be forgotten.')
