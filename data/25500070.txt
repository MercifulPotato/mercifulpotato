It feels like you&#x27;re in the same physical room as someone else.<p>I think Pop is interesting as a bridging solution until VR becomes the main platform for social, because it gives you more of a social presence feel than pure 2D video calls.<p>I&#x27;ll for sure try it out in the future with calls and see how it goes. Best of luck with this!<p>Edit: Typos, it&#x27;s bed time :D')
