I have a Canon EOS 450D (Rebel XSi, 2008 model year) with a few lenses that I used to love, but haven&#x27;t really used for years now. Its low light performance sucks, it&#x27;s almost impossible to photograph people at night. My phone does a much better job of that. Yes, the DSLR&#x27;s optics run circles around any phone, but the sensor really does show its age. And since you specifically mention the autofocus, I just want to add that I find it <i>infuriating</i>. It&#x27;s awful compared to my phone! It reliably focuses on the wrong thing and is really rather slow. At night, it barely works.<p>To me, the old DSLR is simply not worth the weight of lugging it around any more. It&#x27;s funny how we have such different perceptions of our old DSLRs.')
