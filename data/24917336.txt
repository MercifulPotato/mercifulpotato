It’s an almost canonical example of the Bayesian error: given a reverse probability (if you’re sick =&gt; you’re 80% likely to have deficiency), people make a reverse conclusion (if you’re deficient =&gt; you’re 80% sick)<p>In reality (due to Bayes theorem), we need to compute the probability of being sick when having deficiency as population_with_covid (1&#x2F;47 for Spain) * 80% &#x2F; population_with_deficiency. If, say, there’s 60% vitamin D deficient people in Spain, it’d give us 2% chance of getting a disease if you have deficiency. Not much!')
