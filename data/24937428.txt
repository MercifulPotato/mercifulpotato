If the device company doesn&#x27;t provide a driver but the hardware is popular, somebody else reverse engineers the chip and eventually the same result obtains. Likewise for the network controller, the GPU and so on.<p>Typical ARM devices like cellphones are beleaguered by some kind of shameful omnishambles whereby that doesn&#x27;t work. The device maker provides a hideous binary blob with the device, it only works with that specific kernel version and everything is terrible. The exact source of the tragedy is the part I&#x27;m not quite clear on.<p>But making whatever that is not apply to RISC-V boards would be highly satisfactory.')
