Over half of them have&#x2F;had various issues: overheating, constant power&#x2F;thermal throttling, sleep issues, trackpad issues, charging issues, HDMI issues, keyboard issues. One had its board replaced three times!!!. And we don&#x27;t even stress them, just windows, IDEs and terminals, no rendering, no gaming.<p>The warranty experience was great as a tech would always come to our office to perform replacements but I don&#x27;t get how Dell makes any money on those with so much RMAs.<p>If their QA is so bad on their most premium line, I shudder to think what the experience must be like with their cheaper devices.')
