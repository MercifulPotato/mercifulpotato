The money supply contracted sharply because of the collapse of the banking system in 1930-31, and the gold standard was too inflexible to allow rapidly expanding the money supply.  The economic contraction for each country right around when the country went off the gold standard.<p>In 2008, governments prevented the banking system from collapsing, and were able to rapidly expand the money supply because there&#x27;s no gold standard.  The US was the epicenter of the crisis, but recovered faster than Europe because it was more aggressive.  In 2020, the response was even more aggressive, and the recovery faster.<p>The US hasn&#x27;t pursued the ideal policy, but the policy it has pursued has made recessions shorter than they would be, otherwise.  If anything, the lesson of 2020 is that governments should follow the advice of macroeconomists more than they already do.')
