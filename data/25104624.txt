No one on the dev side stands up and says &quot;but that&#x27;ll lag like mad&quot; - they just implement the bloated slow mess to spec; and god knows performance is never in spec.<p>So yea, i might agree with the GP comment - i do prefer &quot;modern&quot; look over that of Sourcehuts.. <i></i>if it worked<i></i>. But as it stands, Sourcehut&#x27;s UI is faster than every modern UI i deal with, and i want things that work - first and foremost. Fast.<p>Modern pages suffer here.')
