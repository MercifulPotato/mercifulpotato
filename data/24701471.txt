You&#x27;ve seen other situations where this type of process nails it. You have a strong desire to know the answer, and that biases you toward believing that you do. The idea that something so important is unknown is unpleasant, so you reject it.<p>About the difficult of grasping the basic concept, if you&#x27;ve ever seen the TV show Card Sharks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Card_Sharks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Card_Sharks</a>), a key part of the game is that contestants see a card which is face up, and they have to make bets based on whether the next card drawn is higher or lower. In that context, they have no trouble understanding that if the face-up card is a 5, the next card is <i>probably</i> higher (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) but it could also be lower (2, 3, 4).<p>Essentially, I think people can understand that unlikely things happen, but where they have difficulty is seeing&#x2F;admitting that this is one of those situations.')
