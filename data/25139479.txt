Getting home at 6:30 pm plus homework means that school-related things are a 12+ hour day. That&#x27;s a pretty rough schedule for anyone.<p>Imagine if you had a 12 hour work schedule every day. Now imagine what you would feel, if you didn&#x27;t have a choice to be there. You <i>had</i> to be there whether you liked it or not. That&#x27;s what school is like for a lot of kids. Making it extra long probably doesn&#x27;t help. Many adults would probably turn to worse vices to cope with a schedule like that - alcohol, drugs etc. Extended phone use seems much more minor in comparison.')
