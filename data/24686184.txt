Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24686227], score=None, time=1601892060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686095, text='&gt;&gt;Shouldn&#x27;t you be instead waiting on a condition that gets set when work is queued? Like an event object, or an I&#x2F;O completion port, or something that indicates work is ready? Instead of polling for the condition?<p>Again, as I said multiple times - the WaitForObject won&#x27;t wake up any sooner than Sleep(1) will. Only a real proper hardware interrupt could wake up quicker - but that requires special hardware that just wasn&#x27;t available in that scenario. If it&#x27;s easier to think about that way, then please assume I said that WaitForObject &quot;sleeps&quot; way more than necessary due to the low timer resolution on Windows.<p>&gt;&gt;Aren&#x27;t you contradicting yourself here? If you&#x27;re doing audio don&#x27;t you want periodic multimedia timers?<p>No, because like I said at the very beginning, I was writing a server application processing audio coming in from the clients. So essentially every time packets came in from client machines they had to be processed and sent back - that&#x27;s why I had multiple threads &quot;waiting&quot; for work and they had to pick it up as soon as possible, with no guarantee how often that work was going to appear. It&#x27;s not the same as picking up audio from a hardware device on a client machine which yes, has to be done periodically. It&#x27;s a simple producer&#x2F;consumer queue problem, but with it being audio data, 16ms wait times to process packets was not acceptable - pretty much no other work is <i>that</i> time sensitive(except for video I guess), yet it wasn&#x27;t the kind of work that has to be done on a specific periodic timer.')
