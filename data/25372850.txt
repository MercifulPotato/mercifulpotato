Item(by='bierjunge', descendants=None, kids=[25374711], score=None, time=1607602479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371373, text='$30k is a significant amount, especially in academic environment, I don&#x27;t deny it. But it&#x27;s not much for &gt; 100 servers. In my previous job, I had licenses which were about 15kâ‚¬ for one server (thanks Oracle...) and the Windows Server licenses were also pretty expensive.\n$300-500 per server&#x2F;year is not much more than a Photoshop license for one designer. And if we talk big business (1000&#x27;s of servers and even more), you will get very special pricing anyway.')
