There were some side effects from swine-flu in Sweden around 2010 that were certainly major and those affected 1&#x2F;12.000 people. I would guess that is an upper bound for side effect, but as I said, guessing probabilities of an unknown with sample size one is hard.<p>BioNtech has been developing mRNA vaccines for cancer patients for some time, so I would not expect any really large long term (in the range of 2-4 years) side-effects for fractions of the population larger than 20% based on that alone.')
