Without ventilation, these people would have died with almost 100% certainty (that what “last resort” means BTW), so without ventilation we would have around 3 times more death. Furthermore, in the 19th century, they had no access to antibiotics, so a significant amount of the deaths has probably be caused by bacterial infection on top of the viral one (like what happened with the Spanish flu).<p>On the other hand, the world population was way younger at that time, so Covid19 would have caused fewer sever cases back then.')
