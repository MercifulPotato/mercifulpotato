You don&#x27;t really want to routinize that level of medical surveillance, due to the classical Bayesian predictive power problem.  When you come in with a complaint, it changes the prior and is additional evidence to revise the diagnosis on top of the screening information.<p>What you do want out of AI is to flag areas of interest in imaging for example and help identify when records are at risk of being incorrectly normalized.  Ideally, even if the end effect is marginal (say bumping accuracy from 80% to 90%), if it enables a workflow that decreases the exhaustion and frustration of the doctor you will want that in place.<p>Of course it could just as well be used as an excuse by management to increase any given doctor&#x27;s throughput, so it might not work as you would want.')
