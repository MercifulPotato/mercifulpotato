We don&#x27;t know if the LZW patent would have survived post-Alice, but from the above link it looks like it would have been on thin ice:<p>&quot;At least one commentator has questioned that, however, because encryption largely consists of mathematical operations using modular arithmetic and theorems of Euler.[41] Yet, as the commentator points out, in the Flook case the Supreme Court said: &quot;As the CCPA has explained, &#x27;if a claim is directed essentially to a method of calculating, using a mathematical formula, even if the solution is for a specific purpose, the claimed method is nonstatutory [patent ineligible].&#x27; &quot; Furthermore, in July 2014, just after the Alice decision came down, a Federal Circuit panel held a patent ineligible, quoting Flook and adding: &quot;Without additional limitations, a process that employs mathematical algorithms to manipulate existing information to generate additional information is not patent eligible.&quot;[42] Judge Bryson&#x27;s comments, quoted above, may therefore be more predictive of the likely outcomes of future software-related patent cases, including encryption ones, than counsel&#x27;s assurances during oral argument in the Alice case.&quot;')
