Consider a flat 10% income tax applied evenly regardless of socio-economic status. If you made 1M, then you pay $100K. If you made $10K, you pay $1K. If you made $0 or less, you pay 0. That&#x27;s it.<p>In some senses that is very fair - everyone pays 10% of their income, no exceptions. It&#x27;s this ultra-convoluted labyrinthine system of laws&#x2F;exceptions that has allowed the wealthy people and companies to find so many loopholes. In my mind, just like simple software code is harder to exploit than spaghetti code, so simple laws are harder to exploit than spaghetti laws.')
