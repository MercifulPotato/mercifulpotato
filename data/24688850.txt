Generally speaking with current technology there is no power cheaper than nuclear power. In that sense it is the most competitive power there is.<p>But not for private investment funds looking to own power generation and secure huge returns in relatively short term. They&#x27;d rather see more expensive inferior dirtier climate-changing power generation they can profit from, not government owned nuclear they can&#x27;t ever compete with. And in that sense no project with long term investments in science, education, infrastructure will ever be competitive for capitalists. So does it really matter then?<p>Luckily not everyone is fond of capitalists. Ukraine, for example, recently decided to go against certain capitalist run countries pushing it to limit nuclear and finish building new reactors, because other power is not actually economically competitive. If Ukraine can, surely most of the world can do it too.')
