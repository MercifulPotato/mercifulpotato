Stateful firewalls must also keep track connections to allow the responses for outbound requests that would not otherwise be allowed into the network. E.g. when you make a request to<p>www.example.com:443<p>From source port 12345, and you or your isp has a firewall that blocks everything that isn&#x27;t explicitly allowed (this is common in corporate networks), the response could be allowed using firewall rules such as<p>iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT<p>This has the benefit of being general, but the drawback is that the firewall now needs to track the connection, with similar consequences to the NAT example you have.<p>It&#x27;s also more likely for the firewalls to time out connections rather than use some kind of LRU scheme. In my opinion the time-based eviction is more predictable, so I prefer it. (Of course once you run out of memory you still need to evict &quot;live&quot; connections)')
