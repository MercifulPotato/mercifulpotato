I can usually get things to work well in matlab&#x2F;octave, but it takes a lot of time thinking about how to restructure a calculation as vectorized. What I&#x27;m hearing is that with Julia I can probably just write what I mean directly and skip the pondering&#x2F;iterating about how to vectorize. So I think I&#x27;ll try it. Thanks!')
