While being homeless and staying at cheap AirBnBs in a foreign country (because the country I lived in before did not have any jobs for me because I didn&#x27;t speak the language and my previous employer stopped giving me freelance work and none of the recruiters would answer my emails because of my foreign mobile number so I had to move to a different country and use my dwindling funds to buy a sim card).<p>Being a white male and nerdy-looking makes it even worse because everyone assumes that you&#x27;re a spoiled brat and they give preference to other people who fit the typical &#x27;disadvantaged&#x27; mold.')
