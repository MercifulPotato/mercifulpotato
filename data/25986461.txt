It opens one up for manipulation. You feel <i>this</i> way and Spotify will suggest you something that makes you feel rather <i>that</i> way.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s one or more songs meant to support these feelings or counter them, I don&#x27;t think this is a good for people in the long run. That&#x27;s not even considering the fact that they want to basically spy on people.')
