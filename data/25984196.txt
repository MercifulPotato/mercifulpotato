But probably less so given the wider non-dev audiences who would consume this stuff: They&#x27;ll trust MS over GH.<p>-- B2B: This already covers cloud apps. I see GH as one of the bigger advantages Microsoft has over Amazon + Google as server software moves more and more to a &#x27;shift left&#x27; world. AFAICT, this is less of a question of &#x27;if&#x27; and more of &#x27;when&#x27;. Unfortunately for everyone, MS is historically slow here. A surprise push here may end up being Teams.<p>Consumer seems a lot harder, but maybe:<p>- Desktop: MS has a big consumer games division (XBox..). Doing MS Desktop Games via a MS App Desktop Store, similar to Google Play for driving Android marketplace, may work for pushing regular consumer apps as well. They can already do for Windows (if they haven&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t follow), and maybe  compelling enough for Apple to want to bring to OS X?<p>- Mobile: This is about Microsoft&#x27;s ability to win over or open Apple, Google, and the top 10 Android vendor for fairly controlled mobile experience.. which is historically unlikely..')
