The article documents these misstatements, implores him to correct the record, and he does not. These misstatements are clearly presented and cited.<p>It would be problematic for a medical doctor to disseminate medically incorrect information to the public and not correct or clarify it. Similarly, it is problematic for a scientist to disseminate scientifically incorrect information and not correct or clarify it. It would be a simple thing for him to simply tweet, &quot;On x date I tweeted y. The evidence now suggests that this statement was incorrect.&quot; The science on this continues to evolve, acknowledging that sometimes we are wrong is not a stain on one&#x27;s reputation. It is the mark of a scientist who is pursuing evidence rather than a narrative. Dr. Levitt is pursuing narrative over evidence, and his actions have consequences.')
