Item(by='apohn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608313988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467256, text='&gt; I did have to do engineering and got the hard technical questions all day long. It&#x27;s not your run of the mill sales job, the sales person used me as their tech arm. It was mentally exhausting.<p>I had a role similar to what you are describing at one point.  I got to the point where I was basically mentally exhausted and short-tempered all the time.  I had a lot of in-person meetings and strongly preferred web meetings.  With web meetings you only put on your game face for the length of the meeting.  With in-person meetings you travel to, you need to put on your game face for much longer, including before and after the actual meetings.<p>IMO the way to not destroy yourself in PSE roles is to basically be the type of person who is okay with having a very superficial technical understanding of the wide range of things you see at customers.  Otherwise there are an infinite number of technical things you can become an expert on, and other people in your team and sales people will absolutely crush you under the weight of all the different questions your customers have.<p>At least for me, I was an technical expert in a bunch of enterprise level technologies and duct tape stuff that basically translated into nothing if I moved a bit out of the software I was responsible for.  Some people are okay with that.  I was not and it really crushed my mental state after a few years.')
