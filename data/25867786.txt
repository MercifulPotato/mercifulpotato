You asked that question as if he&#x2F;she (will just cal her&#x2F;him X) is talking about the Big Foot so I couldn’t help myself.<p>As for the information warfare part. The media on opposite sides tend to sensationalize their titles to manipulate the discourse for their benefit.<p>In X’s comment, we can summarize information warfare as lies. So X thought that “Trump is going to pardon himself” titles are part of the informational warfare and Trump won’t actually do that. But now that X saw this HN thread, X said “was he even going to do that? Do we actually have a proof that he intends to do that? Or was it just a lie to shape public opinion further” Like the time Pelosi asks US generals if they keep Trump in check so that he can’t launch nuclear weapons. [0] Implying to the public that Trump is so crazy he can start a nuclear war. These type of things, shape public opinion over time. It is the same with Fox News shaping conservatives’ opinions about Biden. Or the NYT shopping global issues from a pool for Americans to get concerned with. It is standard propaganda and has been happening for decades.<p>That’s why I think X’s skepticism is healthy and warranted.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;donald-trump-politics-nancy-pelosi-nuclear-weapons-26a9ddefe652ef413951110cc67bf10a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;donald-trump-politics-nancy-pelos...</a>')
