Sangoma seems to own most of the cards nowadays, and they’re awfully expensive and just awful in general. The only remotely affordable line for me was the Digium line and the documentation for their DAHDI driver outside the brief read me is basically telling you to contact support. And unless you’re using them for an Asterisk setup (I’m not) community support seems to be useless. I ended up paying around $500 for a single port Digium card which I’m not even sure will be able to do what I want now. Other than the expensive Sangoma lines, I was able to find what seemed like a perfect option from GL, except I was quoted $10k, which wasn’t happening. Only other manufacturer I could remotely find was a company making PRI cards that wanted you to fax or email your credit card info. Nice to know there’s another option now.')
