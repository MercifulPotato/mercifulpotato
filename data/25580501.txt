This is a logical fallacy and a strawman argument.<p>You do not put forward any argument to my previous comment, and in fact illustrates my point.<p>At the moment there is an economic crisis due to the covid pandemic. This is a specific, time-limited issue and welfare has stepped up to help people, at an extreme cost. This is not sustainable and only considered because it is an emergency in nature.<p>If jobs dry up due to automation then there will indeed be scope to discuss UBI based on taxing &#x27;robots&#x27; (so a clear and plausible way of financing it) . This is not what UBI as proposed now is about.<p>No-one has claimed that the poor deserve to be poor and&#x2F;or do not deserve help. There are plenty of welfare schemes in Europe and quite a few of them  result in effective UBI, but only for the poorer who actually need it.')
