They&#x27;ve worked in the woods for at least 3 generations that I know of. There is a story (quite true, not a legend- people who were there attest to it) that when the elder woodsman had an accident and sliced his forearm open (a clean slice, not sure how it happened) he went to his truck, cleaned it, and stitched it up with fishing line.<p>And went back to work.')
