That&#x27;s almost literally what was said:<p>&gt; Yes, folks, if you don&#x27;t like the idea of a corporation taking your (&quot;software-as-a-service&quot;) code and using it to create and sell proprietary products, then maybe don&#x27;t license your code under the MIT License (or any of the others which explicitly allow exactly that)!<p>As for:<p>&gt; In copyright, the default is that no one has rights to your creations but you. In licensing it as open source, you&#x27;re broadening what others can do with it. It&#x27;s an active choice. If granting someone X could result in them doing X where they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t, and you&#x27;d be uncomfortable with that, then don&#x27;t go out and invite people to do X.<p>Well, I don&#x27;t think giving people a legal grant to do X is inviting them to do X, especially in the context of permissive licenses or public domain dedications. Otherwise, you could accuse me of inviting people to do X for any value of X, no matter how pernicious.')
