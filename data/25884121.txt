The government should be highly motivated to spur transition to EVs for carbon emissions, and what is holding back almost everyone except Tesla is charging infrastructure.<p>Cities where concentrated apartments reside have the double whammy of pointless carbon emissions in traffic jams and smog.<p>Identifying lobbying groups with common interest in this would lead me to the mainline auto industry, especially GM and Ford. They need a charging infrastructure build pronto to compete with Tesla and its Supercharger network. This would probably be related, since city drivers are younger and more likely to buy an EV.<p>Such is American Politics that you have to lobby the lobbying groups to get anything done.')
