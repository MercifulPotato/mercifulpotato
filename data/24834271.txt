On one hand, HN is great because it&#x27;s more like a &quot;fun things to read&quot; aggregator to me so I don&#x27;t want HN to become like a psuedo reddit. On the other hand, I feel like I have missed a lot of fun conversations because I didn&#x27;t know someone replied to me and missed the window to reply since the other person wouldn&#x27;t know about my response either.')
