You also want a historical record of what you did.<p>But obviously you will occasionally save and share things you didn&#x27;t mean to. Like your Python virtual environment, like a bunch of pictures in their binary format, etc.<p>A sane version control would provide a point-and-click way to make these disappear from history (though with adequate security protections to make sure that only authorized people can do it).')
