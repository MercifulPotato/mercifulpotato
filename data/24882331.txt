Specifically, copyright supports some businesses where the cost to create the first item (e.g., book, music, video game) is very high, but the cost required to replicate the item is very low.<p>Copyright law gives options to rights holders that they can consider using to enforce their rights. In cases where infringers are clearly interfering with their business (e.g., selling or giving away copies of their work), then the rights holder may choose to sue for infringement. In the case of streamers on Twitch where the infringement may lead to increased interest in their product, they may choose to do nothing.')
