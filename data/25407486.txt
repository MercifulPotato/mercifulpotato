It is quirky.  Its weirder with MPI, as you get lots of debug windows.<p>For dynamic languages, Perl Python and others, I use komodo from ActiveState.  Been a customer of theirs since 2007 or so.  Excellent tool, though with a few quirks as well.<p>Julia has&#x2F;had a native debugger, and an atom plugin, but seems to be moving towards vscode.  Vscode is many things, and is highly opinionated.  I&#x27;ve gotten the debugger to &quot;work&quot;, albeit not being helpful for the Julia I was working on.  I tried the C&#x2F;Fortran plugins for it and was disappointed.<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware that totalview went OSS.  I thought it was closed.')
