I worked at Apple for four years, and the most successful (promoted) managers all tried to emulate the managerial attributes <i>they believed</i> Steve embodied: Hard nosed, demanding, callous, ridiculing failure, and they all thought they had his product sense too. They attempted to be Steve-clones all the way up the chain to Craig (who was actually a really decent guy, and didn&#x27;t, at least to me, act like a Steve-clone himself). They were consistently rewarded for this behavior, so that kind of behavior became known as the way to go places at Apple. I remember having [careful] conversations with my manager where I essentially asked, &quot;Do I have to be a raging asshole to get rewarded here? Because that&#x27;s all I see--raging assholes get the promotions and equity refreshes.&quot;<p>There were other managers who were not toxic, and knew how to develop a team and reward&#x2F;motivate them, but most of them stagnated and never went anywhere promotion-wise.<p>I also found the place very clique-y. There was definitely a small in-group, with the rest in the out-group, and it seemed to have nothing to do with tenure, seniority, or level. They would have their own private off-sites to do who knows what. I think they called it Top-100 or something while I was there. Everything was siloed and secret so you could never be sure.<p>EDIT: Reading the article, I see the cliques were specifically mentioned. I have no doubt the author is for real.')
