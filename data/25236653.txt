Half &amp; half, milk, coconut cream are okay. Almond milk and oat milk are terrible. Soy milk is a crime.<p>I also use a lot of cinnamon, because I once read it does something for glycemic response. And I&#x27;ve grown to like it. Ditto turmeric.<p>Soy milk and Yerba mate is pretty good. Soy milk steamers  (fresh ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg) are delicious.<p>--<p>From my brief googling, I understand that oat milk needs an enzyme. That&#x27;s what Oatly does. You can buy some enzyme packets for home use, which I&#x27;ve never done.<p>I&#x27;ve read that honey and bananas also have an enzyme that works on oats. I already use both in my smoothies, so that&#x27;s what I do.<p>Also, most howtos I&#x27;ve read say to filter the bulk. But I want the dietary fiber, the more the better, so don&#x27;t filter.<p>I also use chia seeds, which makes the oat milk creamy like yoghurt. Someone smarter than me will replicate what I do, add misc tasty fruit, freeze it, and call it vegan ice cream.')
