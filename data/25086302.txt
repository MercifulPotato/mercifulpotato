Good on you ( assuming that is a healthy amount to lose).  From my own point of view, I have grown to like a quality salad, and they are very easy to make quickly.  Some fresh variety of greens from the store, half an avocado sliced, cubes of roasted golden beet, add roasted&#x2F;salted pistachio nuts or sunflower seeds, layer a few chunks of roasted chicken on top, add olive oil and your choice of tasty vinegar (e.g., balsamic), and a dash of salt and mix.  5 minutes to prep if you have all the ingredients.
