I don&#x27;t mean what do you use it for, the many uses are obvious, but why has a company (Microsoft) made it and released it for free.<p>Reading the license I assume it may change at some future version to require money to use it, and that a new version will install and then say please pay us to continue using? Or probably just this product is no longer available? Note these are not things I am thinking will happen but rather my theoretical assumptions to try to answer the question of why has Microsoft, a for profit company, made this closed source, free tool that I think might be pretty useful for a lot of people.')
