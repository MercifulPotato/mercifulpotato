I have no idea where the owner gets the info from - probably scraped off of remote corners of the web (non-english posts), but a few times a year someone sends me a link to this site and something inevitably blows my mind. A lot of times very good concepts are abandoned due to a technology gap (e.g. control computers, materials limits, etc.) that no longer exist.<p>I think our industry likely owes a great deal of debt to the site owner for helping to consolidate and document this history so we don&#x27;t waste time&#x2F;money reinventing the wheel (saving us from iterative condemnation).')
