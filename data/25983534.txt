I worked with hundreds of people in Pac 12 academia. The brightest and even less bright people I knew&#x2F;know from my time at those reputable institutions aren&#x27;t members of that AFAIK.

(Roommates or people I ran into randomly in public.)<p>Personally, I would never join because it seems to confer no advantageous signal or merit.
