Adding the part that caught my attention below:<p>___<p>Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) is a policy framework that defines how the economic primitive of data can be freed up so that individuals and businesses can choose how to best protect it and use it for their own gain. This innovation, which is presently being rolled out in the financial services industry, has its philosophical roots in a piece of impending legislation known as the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP).<p>According to this bill, Indians will (for the first time) get a litany of new rights pertaining to their data. Specifically, they will get the following rights:<p>The right to data confirmation: The right to know what data is being stored about them, how it has been processed, and who else it might have been shared with<p>The right to data correction or erasure: The right to update their data stored with a service provider, in order to make corrections, edits, and omissions of data that is no longer relevant<p>The right to be forgotten: The right to have their data deleted from a service providerâ€™s database should they withdraw their consent to its continued storage<p>The right to data portability: The right to obtain and share their data in a structured and machine-readable format')
