I don&#x27;t think so, but who am I? What&#x27;s a little bothersome is the new administration is more likely to push for the impossible backdoor into encryption. Swiss companies are under an MLAT, so yes, they will cooperate with American government agencies if they request information. CTemplar looks promising, but in a way, all of these &quot;secure&quot; email hosting companies are really pushing security theater.\nIt&#x27;s difficult to trust third parties with your data, even if you are not a dissident, journalist, or someone who actually needs to protect their life.<p>I&#x27;m not looking forward to this upcoming administration&#x27;s tactics as regards big tech. I didn&#x27;t like Trump&#x27;s administration much (what there was of it). Biden is looking to put Eric Schmidt somewhere up high as relates tech. He&#x27;s buried into the American military industrial complex already and just purchased Cypriot citizenship. Conflict of interest? I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t at least more concerned over the Democrats and their view of encryption&#x2F;back doors and company compliance. Why can&#x27;t we have a transparent government like Finland?')
