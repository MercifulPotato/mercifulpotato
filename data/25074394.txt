If you increase your status suddenly you&#x27;ll have more options in the dating market.<p>It seems petty shallow from both sides and there are some women who don&#x27;t care that much about status and some men who don&#x27;t care that much about looks, but generally it holds true remarkably well.<p>It&#x27;s also terrible for women who enjoy their peak power in their twenties in a way all but the very highest status men will never know, but then youth and beauty fade and it&#x27;s all downhill from there. On the other side, low status men in middle age are basically persona non grata, but men always theoretically have something under their control to improve their lot.<p>In both cases hopefully the relationship becomes less about what attracted you in the first place and more about the friendship and shared life.')
