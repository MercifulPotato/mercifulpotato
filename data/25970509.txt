You loose 25 years of stateless hardware offloads done by the NIC.<p>Measuring the workload that I care about (Netflix CDN serving static videos), loosing TSO, LRO, and software kTLS,  like you would with QUIC, takes a server from serving 90Gb&#x2F;s @ 62% CPU to serving 35Gb&#x2F;s and CPU limited.  So we&#x27;d need essentially 3x as many servers to serve via QUIC as we do to serve via TCP.  That has real environmental costs.<p>And these are old numbers, from servers that don&#x27;t support hardware kTLS, so the impact of loosing hardware kTLS would make things even worse.')
