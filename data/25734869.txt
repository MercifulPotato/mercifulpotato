We may be headed towards a world in which private companies exert a great deal of control over what an individual can say. Not only by controlling communication platforms, but also by withholding employment from people who say certain things.<p>I don&#x27;t want to join the argument about whether that&#x27;s good or bad, but I think it&#x27;s a huge mistake to simply say &quot;It&#x27;s consistent with the 1st amendment, therefore it&#x27;s OK.&quot; If we&#x27;re going to let private corporations use their market power to police individual speech, we need to have a real debate about what that means.')
