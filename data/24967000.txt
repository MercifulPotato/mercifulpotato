First time I lost 40 pounds or so over a period of 6 months. After a few years, my weight slowly started to rise up a bit, so I had another period of caloric restriction. I lost 25 pounds over two months.<p>I think the most important part is simply counting your calories. You can&#x27;t manage what you can&#x27;t measure. You&#x27;d be surprised just how quickly you can get to your daily caloric limit with a few snacks and one large meal.<p>Now days I don&#x27;t stress too much about my eating. I still try to keep a caloric balance, but I also know exactly how to lose the weight again if it starts to go up too much.')
