That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so dominant.<p>The average third-party ad networks are junk, rife with fraud (ads that are never actually seen or clicked by a human), poor targeting, poor measurement, limited brand safety, and opaque billing.<p>First-party ad tech provides much better control over these factors and can generally be offered cheaper because they can more effectively allocate their clients&#x27; budgets. In what other industries are the superior products cheaper than the junk? (not rhetorical - I&#x27;m curious if this exists in other industries)<p>G and FB are the biggest first-party ad sellers, given that their total addressable audience covers most of the free world, with Amazon rapidly gaining ground. TikTok, Pinterest, and Snapchat are building clones of G&#x2F;FB&#x27;s ad tech by poaching a lot of their engineers (karma for G&#x2F;FB cloning their consumer products...) and are also showing strong growth as first-party sellers.<p>If you&#x27;re a website&#x2F;app that monetizes through a third-party network (including Google Adsense and Facebook Audience Network), you&#x27;re going to see your revenues plummet in the coming months.')
