Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25519209], score=None, time=1608739936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518876, text='Any researcher who thought they could publish research about &#x27;race and gender&#x27; and not have it reviewed by a corporate sponsor is incredibly naive.<p>It&#x27;s an extensively sensitive subject and particularly in a field with such vague and &#x27;subject to interpretation&#x27; results, the sponsor corp. is going to want to have a look. Considerably more so if the research is about the institution itself.<p>There was a specific case recently where the researcher criticized Google for something, but Google asked the researcher to include truthful information about the changes the company has already made to the system in question wherein it&#x27;s been improved etc. This is a perfectly fair request by the sponsor, I think.<p>It&#x27;s also naive for us to consider that what people chose to research, how they approach it, the results they are looking for isn&#x27;t somehow altered by the researchers own biases. In fact, it&#x27;s hugely arrogant for researchers to believe that they have some special access to the truth in this regard.')
