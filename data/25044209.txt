Maybe it&#x27;s just that we get this feeling because of the people we usually talk to, the people in our close circle of connections who are likely to be like us in terms of this kind of rasoning&#x2F;thinking. I think most people may not be aware of it.<p>&gt; <i>They had little short-term interest in doing so</i><p>I just want to add a possible scenario here and I would like to hear opinions about it:<p>As we all know, people really tend to buy products with 4.5+ stars and we think twice if the product has 3 or even 4 stars. On the other hand, let&#x27;s suppose that since everyone is selling on Amazon now, worse products are likely to be put on sale, so the average scores start to decrease.<p>Having said the above, if I, as a user, periodically look for products on Amazon, I will probably start seeing&#x2F;finding bad products, so it may be that in a long period of time, I will start looking for alternatives other than Amazon and may attribute the image of &quot;not high quality products&quot; to Amazon as an e-commerce.<p>[Edit]: So if my two previous scenarios are correct, if you follow the money, they actually have some long-term interest in allowing some fake(good) reviews and eliminating some real bad ones.  In the end, most people will not be aware of these fake reviews and the quality of the products will be perceived as higher, resulting in more sales and in a better reputation of Amazon products, thus avoiding the scenario discussed in the second answer.')
