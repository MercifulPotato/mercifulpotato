Instead, it refers to an overproduction of <i>nobility</i>, individuals who  extract income but who do not perform useful work.<p>For example, France during the population boom of the high middle ages overproduced knights and minor nobles from 1200-1300. The nobility increased from around 2% to 4% of the population, while the incomes of the richest nobles soared. Eventually, peasants could no longer produce enough to feed themselves and provide income for all the nobles: this was a contributing factor to the famines and wars of 1350-1400.<p>The most straightforward modern equivalent to Turchin&#x27;s &quot;elite&quot; nobility would not be people with advanced degrees: it would be investors who do not work for wages. (Not to say there is no overlap between those groups.)<p>[1] Turchin, Peter. War and peace and war: The life cycles of imperial nations. Pi, 2005.')
