In an attempt to show how &quot;double standard&quot; GP&#x27;s opinion was I just repurposed the argument that one party failing to counteract an opponent which has more power than them, being dominated instead, is entirely the fault of the weaker party. I replaced &quot;the EU&quot; with &quot;the Chinese people&quot;. To my surprise GP went on to confirm even this exaggerated interpretation of mine, later adding that allowing them to make the mistake and implicitly paying for it is the only way the weaker party will learn to be strong. Such opinions are far too cynical and extremist for my taste.')
