For ergonomics though, http + json is fine for many&#x2F;most applications and there is a lot more widely available tooling for it than there is for grpc.<p>It&#x27;s very possible that will change over time<p>(My implicit assumption here is that a project like Arrow Flight wants a cross-language, widely used foundation for their protocol, and there&#x27;s not a ton of things that fit that bill. But depending on your application&#x27;s needs, implementing a language-specific rpc system is perfectly acceptable, and may have even better ergonomics. Rust and Python both have a plethora of mono-lingual rpc frameworks)')
