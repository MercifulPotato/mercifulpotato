It&#x27;s brand marketing 101. You never trust what a company says or portrays itself as, because doing so is just another tool to get customer attention. Instead, only assume that they&#x27;re a corporation whose sole incentive is increasing profits. Then, extrapolate their actions from that axiom.<p>Growth hacking does not damage their brand value and in fact might increase it, if they&#x27;re successful. If more people use them, that&#x27;s much more useful to their enduring brand value than whatever they&#x27;d have lost by spamming.')
