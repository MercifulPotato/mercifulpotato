Nobody wants yuan from a crippled regime.<p>- if Trump is re-elected, he will bill China $6 million to $10 million per corona death. That&#x27;s $1 trillion to $2 trillion to date.<p>In case you don&#x27;t understand the genocide against religious minorities in China, the goal is to wear them down over one to two generations. Birth rates are aleady down 90% in some communities, so it&#x27;s working as planned.<p>Women have a short reproductive window, so shuffling them in and out of prisons for a few years or forcing IUDs on them is all it takes to destroy the nuclear family.')
