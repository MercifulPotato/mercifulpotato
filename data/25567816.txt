But I decided to turn away from it. Using just the nix packagemanager on a distribution feels off and doesn’t bring you all the benefits. On macOS it can be very frustrating to find a programm that is in the mix packages but not available for macOS. Plus some tools tend to be very outdated and use very general compile settings (light theme etc). I also have issues how libraries etc are linked. I have a rust project that for the love of god I could not compile on a arch installation with nix package manager managing all tools (rustup, git, etc). It was failing with some error around a standard c lib. It was working fine on a popOS installation with nix so I have no clue what went wrong where. The rabbit hole is very deep with nix. It is very very awesome but you also leave behind the conventional way of Linux when going all in. I played around with nixOS and really loved the idea and how easy it is to reconfigure the system from a single config. But if you don‘t want to write custom package overrides and dable with nix-expressions I would not use it as a dotfilemanager. If anyone knows a good way to integrate nix with arch that does not feel like a strapped on solution I‘m all open.')
