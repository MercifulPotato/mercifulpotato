In my humble opinion the rust typing system is more interesting than what typescript can offer.<p>The main advantage for me is the monad. Sure you could use monads in typescript or even vanilla javascript but in Rust, everything uses monads.<p>The vast javascript ecosystem is available to rust in the browser too. Server side it&#x27;s not as big and I agree javascript has a point there. But now, if you look at the ecosystem of libraries with proper and up-to-date typescript definitions, well it&#x27;s not that great.')
