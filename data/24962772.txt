All of the UI is rendered in a canvas element. This would break most existing screen readers and accessibility tools which rely on properly marked up and parseable HTML. I would suppose that the Flutter devs could provide some sort of bridge that would allow this to work (although I&#x27;m not sure how, unless the webkit team also steps in), but seems like an incredible amount of work and IMO with Google&#x27;s history more likely to be abandoned than actually implemented.')
