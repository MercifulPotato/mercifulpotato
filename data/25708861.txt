Indeed, you can design an amplifier to have a pronounced sonic signature, which is common in the guitar amplifier world.<p>A more precise statement might be that two amplifiers with the same transfer function should sound alike, but this needs additional clarification, namely a specified margin of error. Finding out that margin of error has been a pursuit of acoustics research, and is the original motivation for the ABX test. For instance, I read that when Sony developed their MiniDisc recorder, the data compression scheme was subjected to extensive ABX testing.')
