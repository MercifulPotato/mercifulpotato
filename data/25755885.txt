In this case I believe you&#x27;re an outlier, guidelines are usually structured for the general case.  Should you specifically treat every cold like it could be COVID? Maybe not, but should somebody else who gets sick only 1-3 times a year treat every cold like it could be COVID?  That seems a lot more reasonable.<p>Not to mention it is wise and courteous to stay home and avoid exposing yourself to lots of people when you are sick regardless of if its COVID or not.')
