This has been established by all major news outlets, even Fox News.<p>Therefore it is debunked.<p>Now, some totally separate other evidence may show something different. That is irrelevant. The claim is about what <i>these</i> emails affirmatively prove or corroborate. If someone were to say these emails suggest impropriety by Joe Biden, that claim is totally debunked.')
