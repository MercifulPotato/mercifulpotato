Does this device provide any way of verifying that a bitstream loaded onto the device during development is the same one being run when it&#x27;s actually in use in the field?  That would be the simplest way to compromise it.  It would be detectable of course but anyone going to these lengths  can compromise the unprotected device programmer hardware or workstation that reads the bitstream back out too.')
