When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.<p>Many teams are hiring at Square, but I am the hiring manager for the Channels and Fulfillment team. Note that the job post says &quot;Canada&quot; but we&#x27;re open to folks in both Canada and US for this remote position. Please start your message with &quot;[HN]&quot; when you apply.
