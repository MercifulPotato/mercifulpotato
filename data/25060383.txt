Nuclear is held to an absurd different standard to all other forms of energy generation.<p>If we consider damage to wildlife:  fossil fuels, in particular oil, kills millions of birds and fish.  Nuclear?  Zero as makes no difference.  If anything, nature is thriving around Chernobyl.  Wind farms routinely kill birds, and no outcry, but cover the birds in a bit of oil, and it&#x27;s front page.<p>Deaths mining uranium again, practically zero since such little is needed, vs the thousands of deaths mining coal, or drilling for oil.<p>Deaths through breathing in pollution?  Fossil fuel plants have and are killing millions of people, and quite literally, the planet.<p>I believe Chernobyl + Fukushima accidents combined have directly killed less than 100 people.  Greenpeace would have you believe that millions will die from cancer, but that&#x27;s strongly disputed.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_disaster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deaths_due_to_the_Chernobyl_di...</a>')
