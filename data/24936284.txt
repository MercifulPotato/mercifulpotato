It covers a lot of ground, but the media censorship parts seem incontrovertible, and the parts specifically critical of Biden seem pretty balanced to me. He seems to hedge a lot of what he says and provides many perspectives and sources.<p>We should be very careful about disinformation, but another form of information warfare and &quot;active measures&quot; which I&#x27;m sure Russian intelligence is and has been deploying is the spread of skepticism of true information and belief that any or all information could be disinformation. Division, discord, fear, uncertainty, and doubt are the goals; not just falsehoods. All of these erode a sense of shared reality. Just as any claims about a political figure need support, so do claims of disinformation.<p>So, I think it&#x27;s diatribe time. Could you quote the parts of the article (with full context) that seem like disinformation?')
