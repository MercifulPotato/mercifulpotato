Yes, you have to learn it through experiencing it, because you need to map it to your motors. Animal has instincts, they are able to trace water, for example, without teaching. It is also knowledge, but for our discussion, knowledge is what we obtained after birth, not something encoded in our DNA. This knowledge is stored in the format of language. Apparently some believes that that language is part of our DNA. That&#x27;s why you can have Tazan, but not an animal can speak human language even if a human raise it since it was born because language cannot be learnt without support in code in DNA.')
