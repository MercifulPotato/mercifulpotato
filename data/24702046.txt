So are the cars on the sideways looking out of the window. All big firms.<p>Large firms are quite literally who built all the complicated stuff at huge scale that pretty much everyone relies on all the time. I actually have to search around  before I find something that was made by a small business.<p>And that&#x27;s not because of some conspiracy, it&#x27;s because they happen to make the best stuff cheap, which is a consequence of their scale. It&#x27;s not a myth, you can literally confirm that by I suppose checking who makes the stuff you voluntarily buy each day.')
