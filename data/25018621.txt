How do you decide who is right? How do you decide truth?<p>I think there is a difference between ‘right vs wrong’ and ‘factually correct vs incorrect’.<p>Platforms like Twitter will rarely be in a position to decide right&#x2F;wrong, because in many opposed discussion both sides will use the platform.<p>On the factual correctness, platforms can more easily take a stance in high impact cases. I would assume that they’d have out the same warnings on Biden’s Twitter if he had said ‘I won’ on Tuesday.<p>That leaves a challenge: how do you decide what’s a fact? For example on the vote count. Most outlets say the reported figures are fact, but it implies trusting the process of counting and reporting. Removing that implied trust means others can take ‘there is fraud!’ as fact just as well.<p>Twitter seems to use the mainstream media (eg AP predicting the election outcome) as a base of trust (and so do I). But I’ve come to realize that once you don’t trust the media, it is easy to believe in another set of facts (that are true for you), and suddenly (to you) it seems Twitter is censoring.<p>I hope people will find and trust each other again.')
