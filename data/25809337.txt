Item(by='maweki', descendants=None, kids=[25809724], score=None, time=1610874681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808947, text='&gt; The steps are basic CPU operations such as load&#x2F;store<p>Only if you consider the result of a comparison as a &quot;store&quot; into the register. But again, comparing two objects might not be constant. The compiler I develop for my PhD, for example, uses (written in Haskell) somewhat nested sets and quite a few operations are dominated by the equality check.<p>&gt; It is only confusing when you confuse basic CPU operations with basic python instructions<p>But the author did exactly that, when they considered addition to be constant, which is a good approximation for small integers, but wrong in python. And really, you do have to consider those intricacies, that&#x27;s why I chose this example, as sets and maps in python are basically hashmaps, you can assume constant lookup, for example, if your hash function works in constant time. And again, this begs the question what the n is. Usually we would set n as the number of items in a collection for its retrieval operation. But you actually also have to consider the item being retrieved.')
