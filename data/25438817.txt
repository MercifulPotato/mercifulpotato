But the only thermostat that can drive it is a crappy Trane 1050<p>The remote thermostats can only be averaged and not switched (eg Measure Bedroom at night, Living Room &amp; Office during day)<p>There’s only 4 time blocks per day<p>There’s no adjustment of start time based on outside temp.  In fact, no way to say: Be at 72 at 8am when I get up<p>There’s a ”quiet mode” to reduce speed (and noise) at night, but clearly this is on an internal timer.  It will come on at 67% for up to a minute before the timed Quiet Mode Function notices and scales it back to the pre-set maximum.  Sadly, I’m already awake by then.<p>(Also, the default values at install are wrong - they have Day and Night switched)<p>Since this is the smartest thermostat they do for this, can they at least open up the API so I can have a chance to get back the features I liked about my Ecobee?<p>For so much money, there is so little “smart”<p>I think I can use what APIs I have to implement the OP solution without mechanical switches, but I can not control the compressor speed directly for Quiet Mode to work')
