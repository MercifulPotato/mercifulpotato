The harmonic series is a physical phenomena at the root of all musical cultural behavior, and is a completely rigorous subject.<p>The diatonic scale isn&#x27;t derived by stacking fifths, since that would be tautological: a &quot;fifth&quot; is a concept taken from the diatonic scale. What you likely meant was &quot;derivation of the diatonic scale by stacking key integer ratios between frequencies, particularly the ratio 3:2)&quot;<p>That already elides the whole concept that dissonance and consonance correspond to the presence or absence of non-integer ratios between frequencies with notable energy. It also skips over the admittedly subjective way in which introducing more dissonance by way of &quot;odd&quot; ratios can still be perceived as musically interesting (though almost always in culturally determined ways).<p>[1] this isn&#x27;t pure MST, but it&#x27;s a great place to start even if it is limited to 12TET tuning: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianring.com&#x2F;musictheory&#x2F;scales&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ianring.com&#x2F;musictheory&#x2F;scales&#x2F;</a>')
