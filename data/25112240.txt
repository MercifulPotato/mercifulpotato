Stop trying to make me change what works for me because you believe it would somehow be better.<p>On a personal level, I completely agree with this sentiment. If grandma wants to use windows, macOS, or whatever, she should do so!<p>When a Windows update fails halfway through and can&#x27;t boot to Windows, or when macOS can&#x27;t connect to it&#x27;s all powerful binary validation server and her system becomes unusable, she&#x27;s going to call me. Okay, fine, I&#x27;ll play tech support for my relatives because they&#x27;ve chosen to use an unstable system. Same as if my junker car broke down, I&#x27;d call my uncle, because he&#x27;s a mechanic, and he&#x27;d berate me for not having a reliable car, then fix it. What&#x27;s family for.<p>However, my workplace is Windows only. I&#x27;ve wasted literally hundreds of hours fighting against Windows to make firewall and server settings correct (and fixed them again when it updates and borks the settings) for network applications that I&#x27;ve wrote. Something that would take about an hour to write a bash script for, push it to all the computers if they were Linux, and they&#x27;d never ever fail after that. It&#x27;s just mind boggling that people accept this kind of behavior, and it&#x27;s very damaging in the workplace. So I&#x27;m gonna keep pushing for Linux as standard at the workplace, and run whatever you want at home.')
