I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to learn that half the people in this thread who think they really want that hour of light at the end of the day wouldn&#x27;t function much better if they got more sleep in the morning.<p>There&#x27;s also the asymmetry where people who are early risers want that extra hour of light in the evening -- at the cost of the late sleepers suffering chronic sleep deprivation and all the related health costs (&quot;I want an extra hour of light, and you dying early of a heart attack is a small cost to pay for that&quot;).')
