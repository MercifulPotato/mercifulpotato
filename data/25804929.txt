Just look at nutrition science - we&#x27;ve gone from fats are bad, to no carbs are bad, to no wine is actually good. The expectation that the scientific community would find consensus on a novel virus in a matter of months is unreasonable. Personally I&#x27;ve taken @nntaleb reasoning on it - whether or not masks work with certainty is irrelevant; we have good enough data to suggest it works so we take the insurance and wear them. There is nothing wrong with a healthy amount of skepticism; and claims are often muddied through the low pass filter that is Twitter (ex. <i>experts</i> warned that singling out China was racist when American cases came from Italy; we needed far more policy than single out the Chinese).<p>That said, there a mountainous gap between &quot;we are unsure if masks work&quot; to &quot;the president is fighting an underground shadow cabal of pedophiles and blood drinkers.&quot; COVID deniers aren&#x27;t suggesting we don&#x27;t take vaccines because they are unsure of the effectiveness of vaccines - they are suggesting we don&#x27;t take vaccines because <i>they are actually microchips by Bill Gates designed to track us</i>.<p>There is a clear difference between misinformation and just plain being wrong - there&#x27;s a difference between telling me LeBron James is going to win a championship next year and telling me LeBron is actually an alien from Mars who came here to trick us into watching basketball so they could steal all our water. If the President was wrong about LeBron James winning, he would be wrong. If the President was trying to convince me of the latter, then I think that is misinformation.')
