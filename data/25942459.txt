And I tend to refrain from contributing to projects that have a CLA, although it might not be reasonable: there&#x27;s little difference with licensing your contribution under MIT, I think.<p>However, if you license your project under AGPL, you probably deemed AGPL comfortable for your needs. I did too, so licensing my contribution under something else feels a bit uncomfortable, especially if it is substantial.')
