Whatever motivation, good or evil or inbetween, you&#x27;d like to ascribe to their actions is besides the point; let&#x27;s assume that they&#x27;re doing this out of pure greed or a nefarious long-term goal -- it&#x27;s still a win for users and their control of their own data. Users can still choose to share everything with Facebook if they so desire -- they&#x27;ll just be presented with a choice.<p>You avoided saying &quot;their devices&quot; because you believe that when you buy a device you should own it, so I assume you similarly believe that your personal data should be yours to own and control. Facebook is fighting really hard against being forced to even <i>tell</i> customers what information they&#x27;re gathering, much less be forced to let them choose to not share it. The position that Apple shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to limit <i>Facebook&#x27;s</i> freedom to take away <i>your</i> freedom to choose doesn&#x27;t seem to align.<p>We don&#x27;t have to agree with <i>everything</i> Apple is doing in order to agree with this <i>one particular thing</i> that they&#x27;re doing.')
