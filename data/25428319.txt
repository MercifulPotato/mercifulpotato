There is no evidence at all of a general trend toward planned obsolescence. This is another layman&#x27;s talking point.<p>All incentives in capitalism encourages quick cyclic consumption, and corporations spend vast amounts of resources to various forms of obsolescence. This can&#x27;t just be ignored even if you would like it, because it blatantly shows how wasteful the current system is.<p>&gt; You didn&#x27;t even address what I provided about Pareto Efficiency<p>&quot;I ignored your questioned and posted something else, now please answer what I posted meanwhile I keep ignoring my question&quot;.<p>&gt; Yes it is alleging a conspiracy, and you&#x27;re claiming Economics in general has been coopted by it. This is no different than anti-vaxxerism.<p>A field of study with so close connections to power and wealth must be seen with skepticism. It&#x27;s like not questioning the upper-classes theories of society of old. There&#x27;s a lot of examples of theories justifying their privileges.<p>There&#x27;s also an important distinction to be made. It&#x27;s true that capitalism&#x2F;free-market produces alot of stuff. But it&#x27;s certainly not true that it produces freedom, happiness, and justice for all. The problem is that you will take the former to justify the latter injustices. That&#x27;s obvious bias.')
