I don&#x27;t know the current policies, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I know the rationale for requiring address verification, because I doubt it&#x27;s changed much.<p>This comment explains half of it - it&#x27;s basically an antispam measure, akin to online services verifying using phone numbers.  It&#x27;s not perfect but it ups the bar for generating fake listings. \n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;smallbusiness&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kivs8k&#x2F;is_google_my_business_becoming_like_yelp_in_their&#x2F;ggthaio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;smallbusiness&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kivs8k&#x2F;is_go...</a><p>The second reason is that it helps prevent listings hijacking.  Since any user can suggest changes to a listing, it&#x27;s fairly difficult to distinguish between the owner updating to a new phone number&#x2F;website, or a competitor changing them to point to their own business instead.  Postcard verification allows the owner to claim their listing and have more control about whether their business information gets changed.  I think it also lets them do things like respond to reviews, and probably their own edits go through faster as well.<p>In theory it&#x27;s possible to hide your business address and only show up on Google Maps as a &quot;service area&quot; business.  No idea how user friendly that flow is these days.')
