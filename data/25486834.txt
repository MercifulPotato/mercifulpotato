In part that&#x27;s ok: &quot;modern living standards&quot; involve more services and products than what we used to have in the past, and many are actually positive for our lives. This &quot;inflation&quot; in beneficial goods and services requires new jobs, specialization, etc. That&#x27;s perfectly fine. There&#x27;s a lot of work we actually need and makes our lives better.<p>But we also have many more useless services and products born from the very own mechanics of the economic system we live in, which continually pushes for increased efficiency and economic movement. If coronavirus hits and economic activity is slowed down, it doesn&#x27;t matter that our basic needs are covered and food is available, the system won&#x27;t tolerate this nicely. Why do we accept this? People suffering not due to a lack of basic goods, but rather due to the poor behavior of our economic system? So naive, thinking we were working to be able to cover our needs! A lot of the work we do is not to improve the world we live in, but to sustain the very own needs of our current iteration of capitalism. This is the kind of work that needs to be abolished.<p>Then we can start to think about what to do with the remaining work. And that can also be done much better, but that&#x27;s for another chapter of the story.')
