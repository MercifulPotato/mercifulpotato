The actual transportation and handling costs vary with the weight and distance, of course, but this standard rate simplifies things for postal customers, who don’t need a scale or zone charts, or to worry about insufficient postage, and for the USPS, which doesn’t have to collect postage due from recipients.<p>It also provides a cross-subsidy: there’s no discount for sending a package in the same city, nor a surcharge for delivery by air to Guam or by mule train to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. This reflects a political decision that the people in those places are Americans, too, who deserve access to mail services at affordable prices.')
