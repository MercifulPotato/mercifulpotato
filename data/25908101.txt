Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=[25908244], score=None, time=1611605387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906513, text='There are two different explanations that I&#x27;ve read over the last few months for why we didn&#x27;t see laser links on previous rounds of Starlink satelites.<p>First, that the unit pricing was too high. SpaceX is targeting an extremely (absurdly) low price of $250,000 BOM per satelite, and it was theorized that the laser links were blowing the budget. Estimated that it would cost ~$100k for the lasers, targeting, and electrical systems to add the links.<p>Second, I&#x27;ve read that they had issues guaranteeing that all the components of the laser system would fully burn up in the atmosphere. One of the conditions of launching low-orbit satellites is that they will fully burn up on re-entry (therefore not posing any risk when they fall back down to earth). Apparently some of the optics components had a chance of survival and ultimately possible land-impact.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if we can say that this launch indicates that the cost issue has been solved. It could be worth blowing out the BOM to get some operational experience having a few birds with the lasers, so perhaps they haven&#x27;t fully solved the pricing issue unless we start seeing lasers on every subsequent launch.<p>TFA has a great animation of a polar orbit. It&#x27;s basically a longitudinal orbit, so it will absolutely pass over land for a lot of the time, so clearly they must have at least solved the burn-up issue, if in fact that actually was ever an issue in the first place.<p>Also, FYI, there was a scheduled attempt to launch SN9 today, but it just got scrubbed a minute ago due to winds. They will be trying again tomorrow! reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;spacex is a good place to watch for updates: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;spacex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;krllbt&#x2F;starship_sn9_test_no_1_high_altitude_launch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;spacex&#x2F;comments&#x2F;krllbt&#x2F;starship_sn9...</a>')
