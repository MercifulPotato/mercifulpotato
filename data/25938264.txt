Not only are they morphologically different specimens, but they are culturally&#x2F;behaviorally different as well.<p>I’m not being sarcastic, I’m being strict about what constitutes a basis for a valid generalization.<p>&gt; Is this really more sus than a cell bio paper? Are the conclusions so weak that it&#x27;s not real science?<p>Its not necessarily that its more suspect or weaker, but that it is in a different epistemological category. Its a different kind of evidence. When you inject particles into a cloud chamber, you believe with very high confidence that those particles have fundamentally identical properties as the other particles of the same kind. We know that humans are not alike each other in the same way as particles. Therefore we are not permitted to treat them that way.')
