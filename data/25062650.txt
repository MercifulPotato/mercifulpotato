I&#x27;d be curious if anyone has updated benchmarks between the libraries.  I suppose I ought to run some in my copious amount of free time.<p>Sadly, the factorization I personally need the most is a sparse QR factorization and PETSc doesn&#x27;t really support that according to their documentation [1].  Or, really, if anyone knows a good rank-revealing factorization of A A&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t really need Q in the QR factorization, but I do need the rank-revealing feature.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcs.anl.gov&#x2F;petsc&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;linearsolvertable.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcs.anl.gov&#x2F;petsc&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;linearsolvertabl...</a>')
