Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607983409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25422079, text='&gt; Most big fansubbing groups hated CR back in the days when CR started, since CR took their fansunbs to fuel their business.<p>I mean, Dattebayo definitely criticized CR at first. But by the time Dattebayo closed shop, they were highly supportive of CR. That&#x27;s why its important to remember the names of these groups. Do you remember the large-fansub group and&#x2F;or which anime you&#x27;re talking about?<p>Its hard for me to think of a bigger group than Dattebayo back then. Dattebayo covered Naruto and Bleach subs, as well as a bunch of lesser known anime.')
