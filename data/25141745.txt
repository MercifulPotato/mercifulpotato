So when we say that induction is possible, we say so because we &quot;like best&quot; that theory of causality, rather than my alternate theory that when you finish reading this sentence, all physics will cease to function and the universe will end.<p>It didn&#x27;t happen, but we had no reason to know so ahead of time deductively. However, it is still reasonable (in my view) to believe in induction.<p>So sure, it&#x27;s perhaps &#x27;unsolvable&#x27;, but if a plausible explanation comes around that is consistent with modern physics that seems good to me.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;induction-problem&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;induction-problem&#x2F;</a>')
