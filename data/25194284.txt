I wanted to make sure I knew how much of a liability I was taking on by moving ahead before knowing about insurance. I was told the insurance was going to be billed $150k, but if they didn&#x27;t pay, they would only charge me $15k as the cash price. I was ok with that since the surgery was important and insurance did pay, but that type of pricing variation is why healthcare is so expensive in the US.')
