This has been brewing for a few years, and is starting to get ready. Here&#x27;s a list of some of the things I&#x27;m most excited about:<p>- Celody uses a new form of music that includes bidirectional playing, web api embedding, and token generation.<p>- Streams can be forked, merged, and&#x2F;or configured like software (~similar to forking or merging a github repo).<p>- Streams are composed in real-time using open source modules with web api connections. This enables the music to adjust to external data (e.g. drive faster in a car -&gt; the music&#x27;s tempo gets faster).<p>- Listening to music generates tokens which then powers a digital world. Tokens are currently used for voting on elections, voting on laws, playing games, artist rewards, chatting with digital people, editing digital people&#x27;s data, mating digital people and more. [1]<p>- Two digital people can mate (using the token) and produce a child inside of Celody. This process occurs through music.
