That&#x27;s the part of what you said that makes no sense to me.<p>Because the vast majority of antifa&#x2F;anarco-anticapitalists hate Joe Biden just as much as they hate Trump. The Democratic party has been putting their weight behind defund the police, BLM and the radical left, but if you actually interview them and talk to them, they are not going to let up if Biden is in charge.<p>Look at the Hunter Biden stuff. Joe&#x27;s connections and influence by foreign powers far exceeded anything alleged against Trump. The corruption in the establishment runs very deep.<p>They&#x27;re going to riot no matter what. If Trump pulls out of this, they&#x27;ll have the backing of tons of useful idiots to help them light cities on fire again. If Biden gets confirmed, they loose a lot of those people, but the momentum is strong and they will continue with fewer people.<p>It&#x27;s very likely the democratic powers are going to have to reign these people back in, and we&#x27;ll see massive funding increases to PDs, massive arrests, large level incarcerations and the democratic desperately try to put the genie back in the bottle, and nobody in the main stream media will cover it .. or they&#x27;ll spin it to make it seem like it&#x27;s all right-wingers.<p>Here&#x27;s a good example, that guy who wanted to kidnap the governor of Michigan: right wing or left wing? Look into his history. The news would make him sound right-wing. He openly supporter Bernie Sanders.')
