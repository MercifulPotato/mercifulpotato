I wonder if this might have to do with school starting in autumn and kids born in autumn might then be more likely to start the year after - instead pushing themselves in for an early start this very year when they&#x27;re legally able to start school. it would be obvious if kids that are actually a year older then the classmates had more time to be ready for school than their peers. Otherwise it would also be interesting to see this repeated in the Southern hemisphere where autumn is actually spring.</i><p>That is indeed the typically proffered explanation: they are older than their peers when being taught anything.<p>&gt; <i>Many Japanese I know would laugh at Astrology but are 100% convinced that blood-type affects personality.</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting from my frame of reference, that Japanese fictional characters often defy any plausible racial ph√¶notype, but are carefully designed around the stereotypes of their stated blood type.')
