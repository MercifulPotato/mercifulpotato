And far more time will take to significantly terraform (at the level of being able to stay outside any tightly closed construction) any other planet.<p>And if we will live in a totally manufactured environment, the space itself (around Earth or Sun). Asteroids may provide the base materials for that kind of space habitats.<p>But, again, we might have run out of time already. Survival in a world with diminishing food (because compromised agriculture or fish resources by global warming and environmental destruction) will become a priority, and the civilization may not be able to sustain a strong enough space program able to do that kind of colonizations. We must try to fix what happens here before thinking in going (in such scale, at least) elsewhere.')
