Which, again, last I checked, means no Electron for anything that &#x27;crucial&#x27;.<p>(I think it&#x27;s fair enough for maintainers of these things to defer to Electron on config locatio, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that Electron decided what &#x27;platform standard locations&#x27; are irrespective of what the tool is, whether $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is explicitly set, and what other tools do or user preference is.)')
