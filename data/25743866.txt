Item(by='happythomist', descendants=None, kids=[25746134], score=None, time=1610439955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743559, text='&gt; If we could understand human thought at a similar level, we MIGHT find out that &quot;the feeling of red&quot; is not fundamentally different than &quot;the understanding that 1 + 1 = 2&quot;, and we could come up with quantifications of it in different ways, from the physical representation in the brain to a certain &quot;bit pattern&quot; in the abstract model of the human brain computer.<p>I guess the idea is that an abstract concept like &quot;the understanding that 1 + 1 = 2&quot; would be easier to &quot;quantify&quot; in the relevant sense than &quot;the feeling of red&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.<p>The very concept of a representation presumes an intellect in which that representation is mapped to the underlying concept. No particular physical state objectively signifies some abstract concept any more than the word &quot;dog&quot; objectively signifies that particular type of animal. But our mental states must be able to do so, because denying this would be denying our ability to engage in coherent reasoning and therefore self-defeating. So those mental states can&#x27;t be &quot;implemented&quot; solely using physical states.<p>This argument was actually proposed by the late philosopher James Ross and developed in greater detail by Edward Feser. [1] A similar argument -- though he didn&#x27;t take it as far -- was made by John Searle (of Chinese Room fame). [2]<p>But in any event, I would reject the notion that any representation of &quot;the feeling of red&quot; is equivalent to the sensation itself.<p>&gt; Note that the argument for qualia is not one that proves the existence of qualia - it is essentially only a definition. We have no reason to believe that the thing which the term qualia describes actually exists in the world, beyond our own personal experience, which is circular in a way.<p>Well, I think it is self-evident that qualia exist for me, and that those same qualia demonstrate that there are physical correlates of qualia. I also think there is good reason to think that qualia exist in others because we share the same physical correlates.<p>Can I completely prove or disprove that others have qualia? No -- not you, not a rock, not an AGI. But I still have the physical correlates, which gives me some basis to draw conclusions.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;edwardfeser.blogspot.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;revisiting-ross-on-immateriality-of.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;edwardfeser.blogspot.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;01&#x2F;revisiting-ross-on-i...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosophy.as.uky.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Is%20the%20Brain%20a%20Digital%20Computer%20-%20John%20R.%20Searle.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosophy.as.uky.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Is%20the%2...</a>')
