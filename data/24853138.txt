Honestly, you&#x27;ve got to be mad to be dealing with paypal. I&#x27;ve read anecdotes from people, losing access to their accounts, locked up money in paypal, etc... It all seemed to be just stories, seemed rare, circumstances unclear. Until one day this summer, out of the blue, paypal demanded ID of my spouse (for her account), and then after reviewing it, &quot;permanently limited&quot; the account, gloriously exclaiming:&quot; Aha, we got your information, now you won&#x27;t be able to use your current account nor open a new one!&quot;<p>Trying to get to the customer support is yet another saga, and I will spare your time, but the net result is nil. Nobody in the support knows why the ban happened (there was no real reason to ban a paypal customer with over 8+ years, buying some random stuff on ebay), nobody can revert it, nobody really cares and there are no appeals.<p>Receiving a note from paypal today regarding crypto looked like a bad, really dumb joke to me and an insult for my spouse.\nYou gotta be completely clueless or insane to trust this shitty company with your crypto. One of the key points for crypto is the lack of &quot;deplatforming&quot;, which the sinister paypal does left and right, at the same time not even being able to explain its actions, nor comprehend consequences.<p>Paypal - never!')
