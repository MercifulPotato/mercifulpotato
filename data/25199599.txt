For a company to have wired connections they typically need to be on the telephone poles. But, there are very restrictive laws in most states on who can even put things on there. For example, where I live it&#x27;s utilities, telephone, cable, and municipalities. An internet only company can&#x27;t get on the pole. This is very limiting.<p>Data caps are going to get easier to go over as we get more 4k streaming. Comcast offers their own streaming service that doesn&#x27;t count against the cap. This provides them a major advantage and 4k causes more cap issues for typical people.<p>I don&#x27;t personally notice the cap I have (I have comcast due to no real competition where I live). I&#x27;ve had a cap for years. I&#x27;ve hit the cap when I setup a new backup solution and it goes crazy doing uploads to a remote location. Otherwise I&#x27;ve not gotten into trouble. But, the more 4k shows we watch the more I see my house coming closer to it.<p>What we need is more competitive situations and laws that enable that.')
