In practice the sales drones who handle these transactions have never heard of this and will treat you like you&#x27;re trying to scam them out of a car somehow.<p>Also the title is never physically at the location where the car is sold from; the processing of titles for dealers has been outsourced to a handful of large companies who effectively act as warehouses for the physical title documents.  Even if the sales drone wanted to go along and had enough clout to make it happen, it would still take an overnight-shipping delay to get the title to the buyer.')
