You need to keep using the same tools and patterns so that you have cohesion in your code base.<p>The worst thing about new architects on long lived projects is you typically get 2-4 ways of doing the same thing.  If you&#x27;re going to do that it needs to be so good that you don&#x27;t mix and match.<p>If you are going to mix and match, you need to have a solid approach to splitting your dependencies, one way I&#x27;d have looked at doing this is by splitting this into multiple sub SPA applications and each mini project would be able to conform to it&#x27;s own standard as long as it could interface with the glue application, this is by no means foolproof, but it gets you a lot closer to a maintainable situation from my experience.<p>Why I like this approach is that I saw a comment from someone saying they&#x27;d hate to be on a team with a uniform style.  I completely get that, innovation is super important, but you have to build boundary layers between the different styles so you don&#x27;t end up building such a hodgepodge of dependencies that you can&#x27;t get things to work anymore.  It also keeps your build times down and reduces time to get started working on your module.<p>Again same comment you made, I&#x27;ve made mistakes, trying to learn from them, maybe my current approach is bad too and there&#x27;s a better way.')
