Most said yes and paid the fee. This is literally what tax is in the most simplistic form (let&#x27;s pool our money to get something we couldn&#x27;t otherwise have - military, roads, other infrastructure).<p>Unfortunately, now we live in a world where we just talk about taxation for the sake of putting money into the pot and have no real idea or influence over how that pot of money is spent. A government that can move towards this Benjamin Franklin kind of simplicity of taxes would make its country such a better place.')
