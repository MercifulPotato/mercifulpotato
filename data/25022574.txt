Even if you do look down you&#x27;d need to move your hands out of the way to see which key is glowing.<p>For me, backlit keys are useful to set my hands in the right place, and then I stop looking at them. When I have them change color, it&#x27;s a reminder of which keys in my fn-layer are bound to other functions like volume up&#x2F;down and previous&#x2F;play+pause&#x2F;next.')
