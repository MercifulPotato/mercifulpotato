The psychotic reactions of the Unabomber are a direct result of his torture at the tender age of 16 while at Harvard, as part of project MKUltra. I would like to see what ethics review board approved that &quot;research&quot; (on a minor btw) and why the freak who conducted this torture was not only never held accountable, he went on to become one of the 20th century&#x27;s most respected psychologists.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_Murray" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Henry_Murray</a><p>&quot;...Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 â€“ June 23, 1988) was an American psychologist at Harvard University, where from 1959 to 1962 he conducted a series of psychologically-damaging experiments on undergraduate students, one of whom was Ted Kaczynski, later known as the Unabomber.&quot;<p>&quot;...Kaczynski&#x27;s lawyers later attributed his hostility towards mind control techniques to his participation in Murray&#x27;s study.[26] Some sources have suggested that Murray&#x27;s experiments were part of Project MKUltra, the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s research into mind control.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impromptu-man&#x2F;201205&#x2F;harvards-experiment-the-unabomber-class-62" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;impromptu-man&#x2F;201205...</a><p>&quot;...The experiment involved psychological torment and humiliation...The Harvard study aimed at psychic deconstruction by humiliating undergraduates and thereby causing them to experience severe stress.&quot;')
