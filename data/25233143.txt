We found something that needed doing, got financing for it and then decided to release it open source. It is not a big thing in the open source community, but it has helped a lot of people who don’t even use software. Among other things we have helped communities, NGOs and governments map rural water supply where this isn’t a sure thing to exist or be safe to drink, for more than 100 million people. Then this data is used to support investments at country or regional level to improve the situation.')
