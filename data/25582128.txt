I once reordered some toothbrush heads that I liked only to find a completely different, inferior product. It turned out that the product page had been completely redone since my initial order, but it kept all the old reviews. I reported it to Amazon and they did nothing for months. I think the page changed yet again and was no longer even selling toothbrush heads while still keeping the old reviews. After I reported it a few ore times Amazon finally removed the old reviews.')
