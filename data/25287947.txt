The plane was <i>supposed to</i> show an alert when the two sensors disagreed, but Boing made a mistake and that alert only showed when the airline had purchased an additional add-on package to show the sensor <i>value</i> in the pilot display. Boing discovered this in 2017, but did not consider this a safety-critical defect and thus didn&#x27;t inform anyone or prioritize a fix, despite internally also assuming that the pilot realizing the issue within seconds was the redundancy for correcting MCAS.')
