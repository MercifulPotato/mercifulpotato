(Hundreds of storage tanks get sucked in for every pressure vessel failure.)<p>In the 1980s it was determined that the most likely failure mode was a power outage at the station which would prevent it from cooling the reactor after a shutdown.<p>Had there been some spare diesel generators staged inland,  these could have been helicoptered in and the damage greatly reduced if not eliminated.  Post 911 there was a safety review of nuke plants that introduced this and other reforms.')
