Item(by='Larrikin', descendants=None, kids=[25491570], score=None, time=1608515439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490442, text='&gt;&gt;they wouldn&#x27;t need to do porn.<p>Why is it such an extremely hard to believe fact that maybe there are people out there that aren&#x27;t doing it because they are desperate sluts that are failures of society and are actually doing it because its work that they enjoy.<p>Why is working at an injection molding plant making car parts such a better job? Seems extremely boring in comparison. The only real argument to make for it is that there are people out there who feel the need to shame people doing that kind of work and don&#x27;t feel the need to do that for the person making auto parts.<p>The real comparison is also not the factory job, but the jobs that are like musicians and artists. Most of them know after a certain age they aren&#x27;t going to get rich doing it but its work they enjoy. Some people get a little older and eventually decide to go for a different line of work but theres people that will shame the sex worker directing or doing scenes on the side (possibly even fire them from their job) but will praise the guy being in a Bob Dylan cover band with a couple of his friends.<p>Theres exploitation in the system that needs to be fixed but it seems like sites like OnlyFans giving the content creators choice are making steps towards that, as opposed to the others entrenched in the industry that are happy to take advantage of young people, something common in a lot of industries. Politicians, tech companies, other aspects of the entertainment idustry, have been happy to exploit unpaid and underpaid interns straight out of college. Nobody deserves to be exploited because they are young.')
