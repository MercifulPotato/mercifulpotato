Let&#x27;s say in 1980 I was flipping burgers for $3 an hour and making $10 for the company. Let&#x27;s (just for the sake of argument, ignore inflation) say in 2020 I&#x27;m making $20 for the company. For my pay to keep pace with productivity gains I&#x27;d be making $6 an hour, leaving my employer $7 better off (they were making $7, now $14). My pay would&#x27;ve kept pace with productvity - it doubled, my pay doubled.<p>When people say that &quot;wages kept pace with productivity growth&quot; that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re saying - that a 10% increase in productivity resulted ina  10% increase in pay, not a $10 increase in productivity resulted ina $10 increase in pay.')
