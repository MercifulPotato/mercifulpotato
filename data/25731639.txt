For example, if you use their Steam app for 2FA and you need to move it to a new phone your account gets put into a restricted mode and you cannot use the Community Market for 15 days. This restriction also gets applied to any item you touch, so if you trade an item to someone else, the store restriction moves with the item.<p>They also strong-arm you into using the app. If you log into a new device (or Steam thinks it&#x27;s a new device since you cleared cookies) and you don&#x27;t use their app for 2FA, then the device will not be able to trade or use the market for 7 days. They only waive this restriction if you use their app for 2FA and it has been active for at least 7 days.<p>It&#x27;s a bit frustrating since the Community Market&#x2F;Trading is  likely only used by a minority of users, but seemingly a ton of login limitations are imposed because of it.')
