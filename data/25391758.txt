I personally can&#x27;t measure developer productivity at a fine-grained level until requirements are stabilized, and I personally cannot stabilize requirements unless the domain is so well known the data store is standardized. I had hoped SAP would lead the charge through empirically iterating towards standards, but they left out the huge small and mid-size business markets with what they use today. And what they use today is still far from industries&#x27; standards.<p>We&#x27;re no closer to standardization than when I started in software decades ago. We don&#x27;t even have standard means of storing, transforming, displaying and tracking metadata upon calendars, addresses, phone numbers, names, and lots of other ephemera I can rattle off, within a single stakeholder industry, not to speak of within the software industry in general. There have certainly been efforts to standardize like Silverston&#x27;s, but they haven&#x27;t caught traction.<p>I&#x27;d sure like to see that happen, because it would short-circuit a lot of the discussions I engage with stakeholders to only the site-specific requirements, where I really add business value. Instead, I have to derive the data model from intricate discussion of their requirements, since they themselves have not agreed upon the parts that are common across their respective industries, so I end up at the start of dicussions with all sorts of little twisty pieces of a data model, all alike.')
