It might not happen, but you can&#x27;t count on it being exclusive forever, especially if it&#x27;s actually lucrative.<p>Amazing.  I think capitalism wouldn&#x27;t be hurt if occasionally companies made the choice to end themselves &quot;get out while you&#x27;re no top&quot; and distribute their wealth to the stakeholders, ideally with some sort of bonus to the terminal employees.  Of course, the employees might not like that, but it is an attitude of entitlement (if an understandable one) to think that you should have a job for life.')
