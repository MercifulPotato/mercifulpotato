What makes this one deserving of a pass?<p>The issues that interview covers have been widely discussed.  Surely there&#x27;s someone with an agenda other than &quot;give this guy batting practice pitches right over the plate&quot; that has asked him his opinion.  This guy is a politician, being in the media, answering questions and talking about his opinion is part of his job.  He&#x27;s certainly done more interviews than just this one.<p>Furthermore, a friendly interview is much less informative than a neutral or hostile interview.  Anyone can hit batting practice pitches.  Anyone can answer questions from a friendly interviewer.  A politician&#x27;s answer to tough questions or to having their answers questioned is far more informative.  Jacobin interviewing a leftist&#x2F;socialist is like Tucker Carlson interviewing some ardent &quot;muh religion and family values&quot; type right winger.  It&#x27;s just a forum for the interviewee to pontificate mostly unchallenged.')
