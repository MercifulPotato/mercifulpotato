Apart from OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP model, Firebase (Auth, Storage, Hosting, Firestore), Docker, and AWS Lambda we used the following tools:<p>* Parade[6] (YC S20) - a brand-generation tool. It was dead simple to answer some questions and receive back a customized brand identity including our fonts, colors, UI styling, and social media profile photos&#x2F;regalia. Plus having this all in one place meant less coordinating amongst ourselves as we were tackling different parts of the project in parallel.<p>Supabase[7] (YC S20) - an open source Firebase alternative. We originally planned to use Supabase as the primary backend for the app but we needed several features that are on the roadmap but not quite baked yet. But we are using them to power the leaderboards; this is a feature that is not really plausible to create with Firebase&#x27;s document store because the only way to get a count of rows is to pull them all down (which is both slow and expensive). Supabase is backed by an actual Postgres database so it really shines here. It&#x27;s replacing RDS as my new SQL-hosting of choice going forward and I can see expanding our use as their Storage and Functions products come online.<p>LiterallyCanvas[8] - this made the drawing UI really easy to add so we could focus on the more novel bits.<p>All in all it was a pretty fun weekend. We were able to build something in a weekend that wouldn&#x27;t have been possible in any amount of time two weeks ago. Excited to see what other things we discover about the model as more people experiment with it! Be sure to catalog any interesting findings below.<p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getparade.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getparade.com</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supabase.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supabase.io</a><p>[8] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;literallycanvas.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;literallycanvas.com</a>')
