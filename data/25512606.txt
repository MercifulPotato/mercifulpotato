You&#x27;re discussing shares being exchanged for arbitrary random values. In a regulated market prices will always be at the marginal level where buyers and sellers exchange at the equilibrium price.<p>Market cap is only meaningless if the participants in the market are trading at random prices, which they&#x27;re not.<p>To validate this theory, just look at M&amp;A. Companies get bought at close to or above their market capitalisation every day of the week.')
