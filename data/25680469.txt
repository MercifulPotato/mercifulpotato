Fwiw, there&#x27;s a bit too much of it, but it&#x27;s not even close to the offendingly huge margins of some modern UIs (not arguing there&#x27;s no place for this UI style at all).<p>The main window on the first shot from the site is about 620px wide and I feel I could write some code not even resizing it.
