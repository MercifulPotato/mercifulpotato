I realise a lot of people will pay for individual Twitch subscriptions, YouTube memberships, and Patreon memberships, but it can be quite a hard sell in comparison to some of the things you list above.<p>I wish there was a better funding model as those creators. I&#x27;d like to direct more money to that category of creator. However paying one person (or team of people) around as much a year as I pay for my TV Licence just cannot compare in terms of value to me as a consumer.<p>YouTube Premium is apparently a reasonable compromise from what I&#x27;ve seen some channels report (a decent bump in income for them for each premium view and for the end-user a decent enhancement in experience across the platform), but I wish there was a similar scheme for more niche web&#x2F;news publications (Apple News+ looks reasonable, but has a limited catalogue in the UK).')
