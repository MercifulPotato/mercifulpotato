Item(by='pwdisswordfish4', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603058642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820388, text='&gt; that&#x27;s you who don&#x27;t understand<p>Because your comments are incomprehensible.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve shown particular code that is error prone in JS but is ok in other languages.<p>It&#x27;s not OK in Java.  It&#x27;s not OK in C.  It&#x27;s not OK in C++.  Because you can&#x27;t even do that in any of those languages.<p>&gt; still you claim &quot;you don&#x27;t need this&quot;<p>Look at the languages I listed above.  Think about the program you&#x27;re trying to write.  Do you think it&#x27;s impossible to write the program you want to write in those languages, where you are not even allowed to to do your clever tricks?<p>Look at the underscores in the name __proto__.  That&#x27;s a huge, massive sign in your face that means, &quot;If you find yourself touching this a lot, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re doing something wrong.&quot;  How could it be clearer?  Imagine it were called __proto$do_not_use$__ instead.  But you use it anyway.  And then you ask, &quot;why is this so difficult?&quot;.  Where&#x27;s the surprise?<p>Think about this whole thread.  You&#x27;re doing something, experiencing pain, and then complaining about the pain that you feel.  Yes, of course you feel the pain.  Every time you mention the pain, you are actually giving an argument against yourself: it&#x27;s not the right thing.  So stop doing it.  The fact that you got instanceof wrong is further evidence that you&#x27;re not the best person to tell us which road to take to get to the party--you don&#x27;t know the city.<p>(As for the code snippet you wrote in this comment, it&#x27;s not clear at all what you&#x27;re even trying to say.  Once again: incomprehensible.)')
