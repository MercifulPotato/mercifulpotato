Or Debian packages even. How else would you do it ???<p>So, with Nix (and probably Guix), one can configure the live CD the same way they&#x27;d configure a real installation. I think this gives us a way to improve the definition:<p>1. A distribution where all packages can be built from source or downloaded pre-built<p>2. installation media can be configured just like the regular installs<p>3. Customized installer media and reproduce augmented configuration packages in installations without network access<p>Nix and Guix satisfy all 3 parts of that revised definition.')
