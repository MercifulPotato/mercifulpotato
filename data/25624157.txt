Aliasing is why many numeric kernels are written in Fortran, a much older language that also enforces strict aliasing as it simply doesn&#x27;t allow overlapping references.<p>There are probably others as well, but this is the advantage I&#x27;m familiar with. C&#x27;s ambiguity makes it harder to achieve some optimizations that can really matter on modern CPUs.')
