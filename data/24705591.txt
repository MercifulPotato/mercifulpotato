There is no announ inc immigration intent with a wink. It&#x27;s literally written into the law that it is ok to do so. I won&#x27;t argue whether that&#x27;s a good thing or a bad thing but simply saying it&#x27;s a temporary work visa and leaving it at that is inaccurate at best and disingenuous at worst.')
