The temperance &#x2F; prohibition movement wasn&#x27;t made up of crazy people who just wanted to ban good clean fun between consenting adults. The problems they saw &amp; wished to fix were very real.<p>I&#x27;m just surprised how seldom this connection gets mentioned. It seems that, having repealed prohibition and decided that it didn&#x27;t work, we to place it in the &quot;bad things&quot; column, and are very happy to tie it to other bad things (like the mafia). While suffrage of course lives in the &quot;good things&quot; column. But forcing things into black &amp; white doesn&#x27;t help us see clearly, and the reality of temperance &#x2F; prohibition was much more complicated.')
