I built it because my wife and I love to travel but my assortment of spreadsheets was a little intimidating to her. I wanted a platform that let us both participate in the planning process. Unfortunately, due to COVID, people aren&#x27;t traveling so I haven&#x27;t really put any money into marketing it or done any more development on it. I might revisit it once things get back to normal. I don&#x27;t plan to do much more development until I get user feedback, though')
