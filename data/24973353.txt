Other systems, even ones in the US, run upwards of 30 trains per hour. For example, the Red Line in Chicago runs every two minutes during rush hour and that is capped due to the Belmont junction. It has the same terminal station layout at 95th street as Hudson Yards.<p>For 2.5 billion dollars, I bet they could have extended the system, not built some insane labyrinth 150 feet underground and improved signaling to run 30 trains per hour and maybe even built that 2nd station they had to cut due to cost.')
