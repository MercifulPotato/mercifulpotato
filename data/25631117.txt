There are several large Japanese companies that located to this area about 30 years ago, and a few Japanese suppliers have sprung up around them. In dealing with them on side jobs and through friends, it&#x27;s become very apparent that they are FAR less willing to spend money on IT than American companies. (One supplier, doing many millions of dollars a year in sales, is still running their company on Excel spreadsheets.) Which is a shame, because, from what I&#x27;ve seen, they&#x27;re so far behind, they&#x27;re smack-dab in the middle of the biggest-bang-for-buck area of the IT spending curve.')
