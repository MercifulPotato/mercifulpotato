Claim residency in another state or country. Voila your personal income tax for the property disappears and you can live in the home for one day less than six months out of the year. This proposal would be a vacation home rebate. In fact, just keep buying vacation homes. The people stuck living there year round would be screwed.<p>Another hack. Buy the biggest parcel you can find. Then you can build a huge home and pay the same taxes as the 800 square foot bungalow. Build a bunch of huge vacation homes. The help have to pay for the services. You don’t.<p>Yet another hack. Build a house and rent it out on AirBnB. That way you only pay the parcel tax and NO ONE pays the income tax. Genius. It’s a discount to run an AirBnB. Better raise the hotel tax to compensate.')
