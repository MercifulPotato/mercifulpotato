But now I feel I&#x27;m in a kind of Spotify-created rut of listening to static groups of artists. I have mostly stopped listening to my daily mixes because of this.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to theorize about &quot;big media&quot; controlling what I listen to, so I still feel the need to do my own exploring, even when I&#x27;m getting recommended good fresh stuff.')
