A lot of these videos are saying things that cannot reasonably be classified as anything other than misinformation. For example, they typically refer to things like mail-in voting as &quot;fraud&quot; to begin with. They also make up vague but scary claims about large numbers of illegal immigrants having voted, etc. All of this has a chilling effect on democracy and people exercising their lawful right to vote by post.<p>More Senators (from both parties) <i>should</i> be joining the named ones about cracking down on misinformation.')
