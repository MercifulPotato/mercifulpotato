You raised the issue, you questioned the integrity of the researchers, so it&#x27;s your burden to show that there was cherry picking.<p>Actually, here, let me spoon feed you even more.  Here are the first 2 paragraphs of the methods section:<p>&gt; We conducted a literature search to identify papers published prior to the early‐1990s that include climate\nmodel outputs containing both a time series of projected future GMST (with a minimum of two points in\ntime) and future forcings (including both a publication date and future projected atmospheric CO2 concentrations, at a minimum). Eleven papers with 14 distinct projections were identified that fit these criteria.\nStarting in the mid‐1990s, climate modeling efforts were primarily undertaken in conjunction with the\nIPCC process (and later, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects, CMIPs), and model projections were\ntaken from models featured in the IPCC FAR (1990), Second Assessment Report (SAR‐IPCC, 1996), Third\nAssessment Report (TAR‐IPCC, 2001), and Fourth Assessment Report (AR4‐IPCC, 2007).<p>&gt; The specific models projections evaluated were Manabe, 1970 (hereafter Ma70), Mitchell, 1970 (Mi70),\nBenson, 1970 (B70), Rasool &amp; Schneider, 1971 (RS71), Sawyer, 1972 (S72), Broecker, 1975 (B75), Nordhaus,\n1977 (N77), Schneider &amp; Thompson, 1981 (ST81), Hansen et al., 1981 (H81), Hansen et al., 1988 (H88), and\nManabe &amp; Stouffer, 1993 (MS93). The energy balance model projections featured in the main text of the\nFAR, SAR, and TAR were examined, while the CMIP3 multimodel mean (and spread) was examined for\nthe AR4 (multimodel means were not used as the primary IPCC projections featured in the main text prior\nto the AR4). Details about how each individual model projection was digitized and analyzed as well as assessments of individual models included in the first three IPCC reports can be found in the supporting information<p>Do you still want to accuse these researchers of bad faith?')
