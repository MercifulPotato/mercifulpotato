Were you commuting, competing, mountain biking, what? Is the weather bad?<p>Maybe my serious accident is waiting for me still, but the only close call I had was due to my own recklessness. Just riding a bike going from A to B? I can see how one could get injured, but not THAT seriously, unless it&#x27;s due to a collision with a vehicle. Or it&#x27;s something involving the head.<p>I don&#x27;t know anyone that got seriously injured in bike accidents. I&#x27;m trying to understand if I&#x27;m just naive (and lucky) or if there&#x27;s something I should avoid.')
