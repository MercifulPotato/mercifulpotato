To be clear, I&#x27;m about as far from &quot;right wing&quot; as one can get. I wasn&#x27;t aware that standing up for the First Amendment rights of others was a partisan issue, though.<p>Now, I realize that -- in today&#x27;s divided society -- I&#x27;m supposed to be completely on board with silencing those who hold different opinions or disagree with &quot;our&quot; beliefs (&quot;canceling&quot;, I think it&#x27;s called?) but, well, it just don&#x27;t work like that.<p>See, I&#x27;m from the rural midwest (a self-proclaimed &quot;country boy&quot;), I drive a big 4WD truck, I ride a loud ass Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and there&#x27;s three or four times as many guns in this house are there are people. My hometown, my family, my friends, and my acquaintances are all overwhelmingly Republicans -- including some of the people that I love and care for the most in this world -- yet, somehow, I&#x27;ve been a Democrat for my entire adult life.<p>Contrary to what some folks in &quot;my&quot; party seem to think, however, <i>EVERYONE</i> (still) has the right to their own beliefs and opinions -- and to express them -- no matter how ignorant, ill-informed, asinine, outright stupid, or batshit crazy they may be!<p>We have a saying around here in &quot;my neck of the woods&quot;: I may not agree with what you say but I will fight for and defend to my death your absolute right to say it.<p>For the record, the only time I&#x27;ve even come close to attempting to &quot;silence&quot; someone or prevent them from exercising their rights has been at funerals -- as a (proud) member of the Patriot Guard Riders.')
