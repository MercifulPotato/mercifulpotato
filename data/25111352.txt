The amount of functionality stuffed into such a simple device is beautiful. Also, turning multiplication&#x2F;division into addition&#x2F;subtraction with logarithmic scales felt like a genius level hack when I first learned about it, like the fast inverse square.<p>On a mildly related note, does anyone know if it&#x27;s possible to construct a logarithmic scale from simple tools? A demonstration I&#x27;ve always wanted to try is building a slide rule &quot;from scratch&quot;<p>EDIT: by &quot;simple tools&quot; I mean no computers. Pen and paper, compass and straight edge, that sort of thing. I would assume in real life it was made via trial and error on a very large scale and shrunk down optically for a screen print, but I wonder if there&#x27;s a &quot;precise&quot; way')
