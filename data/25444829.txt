It also specifically addresses this issue:<p>&gt; The major threat to the internal validity of our findings is that surgeons may selectively operate on sicker and more complex patients on their birthday, perhaps because those patients cannot have their procedures delayed. However, this is unlikely to explain our findings because we found that patients who underwent surgery on the surgeon’s birthday were similar in all observable characteristics to patients who underwent surgery on other days. Furthermore, severity of illness as measured by predicted mortality, and the number of procedures performed per surgeon, also did not differ based on whether a surgery occurred on a surgeon’s birthday compared with other days.<p>It seems to me that the analysis is quite carefully done:<p>&gt; Findings were qualitatively unaffected by: using in-hospital mortality instead of 30 day mortality;\nadditionally adjusting for the timing of the surgery; including both hospital and surgeon fixed effects in the same regression models; excluding potentially outlier surgeons with the highest mortality; using logistic regression models instead of linear probability models: using random effects models instead of fixed effects models; restricting our analysis to surgeons who performed procedures on their birthdays; additionally adjusting for the day of the year; or excluding surgeons who were born on the outlier birthdays (supplementary eTables 5-13).\n[...]\nThe study findings were qualitatively unaffected when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality or to patients with the highest severity of illness (supplementary eTables 16 and 17).')
