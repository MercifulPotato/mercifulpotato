Whereas anti-cheat companies seek to prevent code execution or introspection in a certain context (the game) by a user that already has full privileges over the machine, other mitigations seek to prevent privilege escalation or initial access. For example (simplification), a remote exploit that relies on a specific address to work would now have to find an additional information leak. Similarly, code running in usermode cannot simply* know the addresses of objects in the kernel.<p>* In practice this isn&#x27;t really true, and there are many ways to bypass KASLR')
