Just to pick a few:<p>- Force mic mute on all participants except the presenter, disallow enabling without presenter permission<p>- Webinars for thousands of people (handful of presenters with video, multiple non-video listen-only participants)<p>- 50+ people with video streams enabled in one meeting<p>- Smart background replace with optional green screen support<p>Then there are all the features for education, split rooms etc. But just those four - to my knowledge - exist only in Zoom. Some competitors might have 1-3 of those, none of them have all four.<p>We don&#x27;t use Zoom because we especially love them, we use Zoom because it&#x27;s the only one with the features we need.')
