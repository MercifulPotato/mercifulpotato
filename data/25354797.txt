If you&#x27;ve heard a drone fly nearby before, you may be inclined to agree, those things are <i>loud</i>. Until there&#x27;s a way to fly drones around silently, I see no sensible path to mass market drones.<p>This isn&#x27;t an endorsement for or against delivery drones at all, personally I think it would be amazingly convenient, but I also think building densely around transit stations as convenient too, yet NIMBYism in the Bay has all but put a stop to that.')
