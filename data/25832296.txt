Item(by='candiodari', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611055048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829341, text='There are a number of studies that point this out. This is the biggest by far:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;aer.97.5.1583" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sci-hub.se&#x2F;10.1257&#x2F;aer.97.5.1583</a><p>&gt; As for the idea that &quot;even a single CPS placement&quot; is worse than being left with violent parents - I&#x27;ve never seen anything supporting this but if you have some I&#x27;d love to read it.<p>Well, reactive attachment syndrome is the expected outcome for something like 60% of placements, and 80%+ of kids that are placed more than once. These multiple replacements are not exactly rare. Apparently there is a small group where the first placement remains stable for a long time which has reasonable results, and there is a large group that keep getting placed again and again where the outcomes are terrible.<p>The vast majority of parents aren&#x27;t violent but neglectful. And even then, our standards of neglect have moved quite a bit. These days some interventions are done because of &quot;bad&quot; food in lunch boxes (think: mars bars, not sandwiches).<p>The long term consequences of neglect and violence that isn&#x27;t random are &quot;parentification. TLDR: kids start acting like adults at a very young age, and obviously with less than ideal success. Think 7 year olds that make sure the rent is paid and their little sister sees a doctor once a year, or when she&#x27;s ill. These kids will fight for their independence, for obvious reasons, at a <i>very</i> young age. This can, and does, lead to depression and less than ideal school results (because in that situation the kids don&#x27;t consider school very important and of course caring for others takes time that can&#x27;t be spent on homework or hobbies or even actually going to class when there&#x27;s a crisis). The worst outcomes are observed where the kid takes total control of the home situation and the KID abuses this power. But even that is nothing compared to even mild attachment syndrome.<p>The worse cases of reactive attachment disorder, well, from Wikipedia: &quot;Actions that otherwise would be classified as conduct disorder, such as mutilating animals, harming siblings or other family, or harming themselves intentionally&quot;<p>And of course, it is anecdotal and probably lacks validity but if you look up mass murderers, whilst diagnosis is missing their family background is really quite common and are the sort of circumstances that you&#x27;d expect to generate RAD. Obviously, that outcome is <i>very</i> rare, but does exist.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parentification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parentification</a><p>I would say, read both entries and judge for yourself which is the worse one. But I don&#x27;t think there will be much disagreement.')
