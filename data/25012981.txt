Again StarCraft is effectively deterministic, there isn’t any kind of clicking an ability and wondering what will happen phase.<p>As to being twitch or not, again that’s from a gameplay standpoint.  Slow down Starcraft dramatically and it’s still real-time, but eventuality APM stops being a meaningful factor.')
