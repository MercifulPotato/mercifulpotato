Graham meant when they said:<p>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine&quot;<p>It’s such a cryptic phrase, that I never quite understood it for the longest time, until I came to understand the price insanity of TSLA and Bitcoin. And now GME.<p>My layman’s explanation is:<p>People get together to buy a stock, because they believe in it, even against all odds. This gives the stock its value to this nebulous group of people. They are the true believers. They are the voters.<p>Then the stock price runs high, and has a very high market capitalization. Like TSLA, Bitcoin, and now GME. This is the weighing machine part. This means that over time, the company must deliver on its value, in order to justify that its market capitalization is worth its weight in gold.<p>So, Tesla the company, has been delivering electric cars and new technology, that helps to justify its lofty valuation.<p>Bitcoin, has brought the Blockchain idea to the masses. Although I’m not quite sure yet how it maintains its weighing part of the valuation. Maybe its Blockchain system becomes the underlying mechanism of other electronic commerce systems.<p>And GameStop, if they survive this, can cash out at $1000, issue new shares, and take the money to build itself into a giant e-Sports Gaming company. Or maybe it can even build its own GameStation video game system, to justify its lofty market capitalization.<p>Or something like that. And also, the initial investors are probably just hoping to ride a rocket ship to riches, and then they hold on for the long term.')
