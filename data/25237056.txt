It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve looked so details are a little hazy, but I know the Mill architecture had an answer to this. I believe they were using effectively two-pass compilation. The first compiled against an abstract version of the architecture, and this is what was distributed. Then this could be further specialized on the user&#x27;s machine as at that point the limits of the hardware would be known.<p>I don&#x27;t recall if they had an idea for SMT as well or not. It&#x27;s possible they wrote it off entirely, particularly after  Spectre and all that.')
