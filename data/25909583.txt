His question was about escaping the grind with an &quot;idea&quot; which kinda implies building a business.<p>I intentionally use the word business, not product as a lot of people (including you it seems) conflate. I&#x27;m not trying to be an asshole, I&#x27;m trying to save you from a lot of potential pain, as I&#x27;ve been also through that and am trying to get you to reflect a bit.<p>I&#x27;m now almost 3 years in running a vc funded startup and things are not going so well because I didn&#x27;t start off with the right fundamentals and have been focusing on product. I&#x27;ve had a look at the list of your startup ideas and I am almost certain you yourself, let alone many other people, don&#x27;t pay for these types of things, and they don&#x27;t seem to have network effects in order to scale up quickly and dominate a market.<p>It&#x27;s not only about hunkering down and building things, it&#x27;s about understanding what makes a viable business, where your potential customers congregate, which language they&#x27;re using, is it really a problem for them that you&#x27;re solving, how can you reach them in a scalable way, who are the technical&#x2F;economical decision makers in b2b, or how do you achieve some kind of network effect if b2c... (obviously i&#x27;m generalising a bit, but it&#x27;s a fascinating multidimensional problem and I feel this advice of grinding it out is repeated everywhere and is super harmful)<p>as far as ideas go, I can guarantee you that in your 15 years of professional experience you&#x27;ve seen many potential business problems that you just didn&#x27;t recognise. Any repetitive annoying process you&#x27;ve seen somebody using a patched up excel sheet is potentially a business. if you&#x27;re launching a cycling app without already having built an audience and a brand in the community, it&#x27;s most likely going to be a painful experience. Really not trying to be an asshole, btw')
