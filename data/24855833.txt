I had a look for travelling for the weekend of Nov 20th (it&#x27;s a month from this weekend) on Friday and back Monday, leaving after 8:30am both days. Trainline is quoting me £190 return. Easyjet is £60.<p>As an aside, the train schedule and prices seem substantially cheaper than this time last year. I don&#x27;t ever recall there being availability on the super off peak trains if travelling within a week or so.')
