Phew.<p>Grindr is particularly bad at security. It was fairly easy to triangulate users locations until fairly recently and some users were being harassed, and grindr ignored their reports for a long time.<p>It was also fairly easy to use fake locations until fairly recently which was also causing problems for non-users.<p>Grindr regularly shuts down accounts with no process. It&#x27;s very easy to lose your contacts.<p>Grindr lies about what information they retain. They claim to hold very little information, which they provide when your account is shut down. However they must retain a list of your blocks and favorites in order to function. They lie and say they don&#x27;t retain this info.<p>Because of the nature of their service, they should be on top of all this stuff, but they are really bad at it.')
