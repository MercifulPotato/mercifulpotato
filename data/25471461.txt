Usually startups will value your options in an offer using preferred, so they might say you have 100k options at a $1 value each, with a 5 cent strike. But the reality is even if you manage to get liquidity, perhaps through a secondary, you probably won&#x27;t be able to sell at the preferred price! If you wait until IPO then common equals preferred and it doesn&#x27;t matter, but it always felt wrong that the value of your options was only true if the company IPOs, versus taking in to account an appropriate discount.')
