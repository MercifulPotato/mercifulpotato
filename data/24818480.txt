I live alone right now but I wonder how many women, if they were to live with me (in a relationship), would be ok with it.<p>BTW the biggest win in getting a good sleep for me has been making sure my bedroom is properly ventilated, so that I have low levels of CO2. Since I started doing that, my sleeping issues have been reduced to practically nothing - i.e. I almost never wake up feeling drowsy, which was something that happened to me a couple days a month before I started monitoring CO2.')
