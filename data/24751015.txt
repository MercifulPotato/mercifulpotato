Windows 9x, Windows 2000&#x2F;XP, Windows Vista&#x2F;7&#x2F;10 all had different graphic driver models and were incompatible. Same with various releases of OS X&#x2F;macOS.<p>Of course I’m not implying that the driver interfaces have a guarantee or will not change, especially with the rolling release model of Linux. However, you can be pretty certain within a major point release that there won’t be significant breaking changes. Thus the “pretty stable”. It’s not a pro nor a con, it’s just the style that works for that open source project.')
