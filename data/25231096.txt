The laptop seems pretty wonderful by all accounts. Low power draw, amazing battery life, great OS (I’m still a fan), great mouse, I like the keyboards (blasphemy I know)...<p>So, if I like all those things, but I can’t build a docker image locally (for now), why not just do something that will potentially improve my development experience in addition to allowing me to use this machine?<p>I mean, folks should do what they want. But, I’d say calling this recommendation bizarre to be a bit over the top :)')
