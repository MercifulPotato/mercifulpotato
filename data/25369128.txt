Given the amount you read, it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll exhaust the list of books that are highly rated and happen to be in your domain of interest. Since I read about 2 books a month ~ 25 books a year, I haven&#x27;t faced this problem.<p>I suggest you look into English translations of books that are highly rated in other languages. Lots of hidden gems to be found this way.')
