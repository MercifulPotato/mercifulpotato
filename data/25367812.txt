I think freedoms are universal in that they apply to all people.  I don&#x27;t think they are universal in that they would apply in every situation.  I have given you plenty of examples of situations in which people can be reasonably deprived of freedom of speech.<p>Governments get their power from the people.  That is the foundation of the US political thinking.  The larger the percentage of the population that supports overturning this election, the more pressure elected officials will feel to comply.  Therefore allowing this misinformation to spread increases the odds that my right to vote will be infringed.  Is it an immediate and direct relationship like in some of the other examples we have discussed? Obviously not.  However there is a clear causal line from someone advocating that my rights be taken away to the potential of my rights actually be taken away.')
