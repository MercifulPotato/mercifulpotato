It&#x27;s pretty clear that an experienced developer is going to understand parenthesis matching. But regardless of how many years of experience you have in Javascript, the first time you see a Python list comprehension you are likely to scratch your head for a bit. Python lambdas are also quite alien if you aren&#x27;t familiar with them.<p>FWIW, I was a professional developer for 10+ years before I knew learned Big O notation. I know a fair number of junior and even senior developers who don&#x27;t know Big O notation even now. I knew how to avoid Big O type problems long before I knew the terminology.')
