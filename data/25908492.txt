Facebook knows this, it&#x27;s why they are so pissed off at Apple and have taken such an aggressive public stance against Apple. Google knows it, it&#x27;s why they haven&#x27;t published an update to any of the iPhone apps since Apple started requiring their apps report what end user data they collect.<p>Google and Facebook are sure... not sure anyone else is more qualified on this.<p>&gt; If companies could anonymously track users, and still maintain the marketing backbone of the internet I think most people would be fine with it -- in fact, prefer it.<p>If this were true, why doesn&#x27;t Google, Facebook, and others give us straight-forward ways to opt out? If people would prefer it, why exactly is Facebook trying so damned hard to prevent Apple from giving people a simple opt out?')
