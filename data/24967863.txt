My youngest, 12, attempted to sign in from a Windows PC in our house and was told that they could not verify that it was her.<p>Keep in mind, this is the same public IP address that we&#x27;ve had for ages.  I am the recovery contact for the account since she is a minor, and have filled out the forms several times now, even giving the exact date and the &quot;verification code&quot; from when the account was created.  We are now stuck in an endless loop.<p>She can still access her account from a macbook and from a linux desktop, but I fear once she is signed out that she will be locked out forever.<p>All of my important stuff (finance, etc) is in protonmail  now, and I&#x27;m happy that I made that move.')
