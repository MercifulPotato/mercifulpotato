Load&#x2F;store asymmetry, Subvector execution, 1024 vGPRs (!!!!), unlimited sGPRs (not quite, but no longer shared at least), etc. etc.<p>Based on the ISA alone, I&#x27;d prefer compute-applications to move to RDNA frankly. Its clearly a better designed architecture.<p>------------<p>I can&#x27;t find any public information on CDNA. I&#x27;ve even emailed ORNL for information, but they responded back saying that NDAs prevent them from saying anything.<p>Whether CDNA is based on NAVI or Vega will be a big question as Frontier launches next year. I hope its Navi based, I really do, because its just better. But I&#x27;d &quot;understand&quot; if ROCm can&#x27;t be ported easily to Wave32 or other issues (RDNA is a huge architectural change).')
