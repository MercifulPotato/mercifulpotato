This time I&#x27;m on my own domain though so they can close my account all they want, I&#x27;d just setup email with another domain on the same address . Would lose my emails in the process, but that&#x27;s secondary concern.<p>I&#x27;ve used a secondary Protonmail account lately and it seems decent. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to make a fair comparison but if you only gave me 5 seconds to choose I&#x27;d instantly choose Protonmail over Fastmail. Same pricing (with custom domain) IIRC.<p>Edit: Then again as a paying customer I might not be as easily locked out compared to a regular Gmail account? No idea.')
