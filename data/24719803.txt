Item(by='candiodari', descendants=None, kids=[24719970], score=None, time=1602169849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719679, text='&gt; Enough people think like that, and there&#x27;s no pressure to make this practice illegal, no pressure from the public to get laws passed because while some people look at this practice and see their lives being made worse, many people look at this and see themselves being protected from bad guys.<p>Why do you assume this will ever be put to popular vote? I mean you see this as if it&#x27;s a choice from the people in a democratic republic and then your statement might be right or wrong.<p>But reality is: the boss of public prosecutor office realises that they need more power to get the numbers they&#x27;re judged on: &quot;bad guys&quot; put away. Whether they&#x27;re actually bad is not taken into account by the people evaluating them ... So what&#x27;s this person to do?<p>And they&#x27;re not even bad people, they certainly try to get the bad guys. And, sure, being vilified in the press for going after people is undesirable, but beyond that ... and of course this leads to them pinning everything on poor (ex-)criminals who don&#x27;t really have a choice, and who are judged by investigators to be &quot;bad people&quot;.<p>Especially in youth law this is bad. Because proof is not required to convict anyone (technically, after all, &quot;they&#x27;re not convicted&quot;, just incarcerated for years), they just catch the first &quot;bad apple&quot; near a crime, and if there is no crime they&#x27;ll just make one up. Of course the net result is <i>more</i> criminals when these kids lose faith in society protecting them.<p>People do what they&#x27;re paid to do. In the case of public prosecutors and investigators that&#x27;s putting people (all kinds) behind bars.<p>Also: what does sus mean ?')
