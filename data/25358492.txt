In that sense they act somewhat similarly to Certification Authorities, in that I as a user will not blindly trust a self-signed certificate but will trust a certificate that was vetted by this third-party.<p>I have no idea why anybody trusts CA&#x27;s in the first place. People seem to imagine that there&#x27;s some gate in play where Mr. D. Badguy doesn&#x27;t get certs signed by Verisign. He absolutely does.<p>This has been an issue that &quot;Web of Trust&quot; doesn&#x27;t really do anything to solve, and the delegation of worrying about this crypto non-sense going to Admins instead of users themselves just kicks the can down the road. Random code on the net is exactly like buying a blackbox in a Bazaar somewhere, If you don&#x27;t have the skills to run&#x2F;vet&#x2F;sandbox it safely, no amount of Web of Trust nonsense will save you from it.<p>All it does is piss off users, devs, and admins alike when something goes wrong with certs, and gives a centralized authority a lever to pull to screw with you. Another brick in the monopolistic wall.')
