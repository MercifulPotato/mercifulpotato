Even with tmux and using resurrect it&#x27;s not a seamless experience. This is an issue even with a few second turn around time on the dual boot itself.<p>Around 8 or 9 years ago I used to dual boot, then I transitioned to a Linux VM with Unity mode (vmware workstation&#x27;s seamless mode to run apps in their own floating window) then to WSL 1 and now WSL 2. The only way I think things will get better is going native Linux with a GPU pass through KVM based VM running Windows to play games from Linux at native speeds without dual booting but it&#x27;s a huge pain to set this up properly.')
