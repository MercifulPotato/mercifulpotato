Between the electoral college and each state (no matter how many people live in that state) having 2 senators it&#x27;s an archaic system that&#x27;s way overdue for an update. However, the system is built in such a way as to make updates very, very difficult so, unfortunately, don&#x27;t expect any significant changes anytime soon.<p>In the meantime, one party has managed to exploit the weaknesses of our system to override the will of the majority on many issues (healthcare, climate change, racial justice, gun control... etc.)')
