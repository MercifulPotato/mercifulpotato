Please don&#x27;t automate the process of choosing and running algorithms on a single sample of data, it&#x27;s unsound experimental design that undermines your results. If you insist on doing it anyway, at minimum you will need to automate an initial assessment of the sample data to determine if it has a suitable size and distribution to allow you to adjust the significance of results for the number of tests you&#x27;re running, and partition the data into smaller subsamples.')
