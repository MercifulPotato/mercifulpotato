Ironically, given past positions of the Supreme Court[1], I really don&#x27;t see private companies being forced to host whatever content people what them to being a thing at any point in the near future, so it seems as though they&#x27;d probably be against anything conservatives have been demanding for as of recent.<p>This might be the rye talking at this point, but one of the preceding events to the civil war was violence in the house of congress[2]. Don&#x27;t need to tell anyone about Wednesday&#x27;s violence, but that did cause us to miss the almost-fist-fight on Tuesday[3]. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re headed towards civil war yet, but I think how the people that instigated the recent events are handled, by the public and criminally, will dictate that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;amazon-parler-suspension&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;amazon-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colora...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;charles-sumner-caning-cilley-duel-congressional-violence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;charles-sumner-caning-cilley-du...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;congress-fistfight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;nation&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;congress-fi...</a>')
