I have none of these certs (I have no security certs at all). The OSCP is the only certification in this list that I&#x27;ve ever even heard of being part of hiring discussions, and even then I&#x27;ve really only ever seen it required&#x2F;desired in penetration testing roles.<p>In fact, this article is very narrowly focused on penetration testing-type roles. There are a whole host of other security roles that require all kinds of different skillsets which aren&#x27;t even mentioned here.<p>If you <i>do</i> want a penetration testing role, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this roadmap other than the fact that it over-emphasizes the need for certs. Like all other types of roles, some hiring managers might be part of the &quot;certification chaser&quot; crowd and might require certs for candidates, but IME most don&#x27;t care and someone not having a cert has never stopped me from hiring them, and quite frankly if someone <i>does</i> have certs it doesn&#x27;t make me any more inclined to hire them.')
