It&#x27;s important to distinguish between efficiency and effectiveness.<p>There&#x27;s been times where I&#x27;ve spent weeks or even months going down a path that has ultimately proven fruitless, including spending really long hours on it. That certainly counts as work, but if it results in no meaningful value being produced, then what&#x27;s the point?<p>There&#x27;s been other times when I&#x27;ve gone on holiday and come back refreshed and incredibly motivated, having realised the solution to a problem that I&#x27;d been struggling with because I gave my subconscious mind time to do its thing without interruption. Does spending time at the beach, exploring ancient towns in Italy, or even just taking a shower count as work? Most people would say no, but that&#x27;s when I&#x27;ve had some of my best ideas.<p>Sometimes in a meeting I&#x27;ll be having a discussion with a colleague and we&#x27;ll come up with a solution for something we&#x27;ve been trying do that requires zero changes to the our codebase, something we refer to as a &quot;no-code&quot; solution. Those can shave off weeks of time. Technically, that meeting counted as two hours of work; is that less productive than spending a ton of time implementing a feature that turned out to be unnecessary because there was a way to avoid the need for it?<p>As far as when I actually sitting at my desk focusing on work, I value reading and thinking much more than implementation. Coding is the easy part; once the solution is clear, getting it into the computer is fairly straightforward, albeit quite tedious. I&#x27;ve spent lots of time coding the wrong thing, which with a bit more thought and research could have been avoided. I consider that time mostly wasted, except perhaps for the learning experience.<p>Judge your productivity by what you achieve, not how long it takes you to do it.<p>Edit: A thought experiment I&#x27;d like to add. Imagine you give two people the same task and ask them to complete it in one week. One person works on it four hours a day, the other six. They both get it done on time, at the same level of quality. The first person was actually _more_ productive than the second.')
