Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=[25279958, 25278598], score=None, time=1606928108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277223, text='&gt; will not buy laptops priced $ 1,000+<p>The iPhone and iPad are using up a lot more of TSMC&#x27;s capacity than the Mac. Also most sub $1k laptops and lower end phones not getting chips with the latest TSMC silicon in them. They are getting older 14nm Qualcomm, AMD, or Intel CPUs.<p>EDIT: I previously implied <i>all</i> sub $1k laptops had 14nm CPUs which isn&#x27;t true.')
