Not so. JPA is. It is complicated, has lots of implicit behaviour, has a really bad query language and is horrible to optimize.\nIt is why you never hear &#x27;ORMs are horrible&#x27; from ruby on rails or elixir developers: they have a proper ORM!\nActually Java has too, and probably several - Ebean, for example, solves all of the complexity problems, adds a query creation tool that stays very close to SQL and allows very simple object fetching, allows for simple batch operations, and requires a proper explicit save instead of the complicated implicit JPA one.')
