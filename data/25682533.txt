Rolling a kayak back up when underwater in bad conditions, I&#x27;ve twice had that sensation of thinking about particular technical steps instead of executing the maneuver as a whole and failed miserably when it would have been really, really great to not be swimming. In trap, the pressure of the last shot or two when a score is tied, I can observe my brain saying things like &#x27;remember to lead it&#x27;, &#x27;remember not to overthink it&#x27;, etc., it&#x27;s somewhat humorous to watch the sabotage in action.')
