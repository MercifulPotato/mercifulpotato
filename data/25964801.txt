So far, it just seems like we&#x27;re following &quot;vaccinate healthcare workers and the most vulnerable&quot; and that, on the surface, seems intuitive. But is there some other sort of algorithm that can determine the best way to reduce overall transmission the fastest? Random vaccinations? Targeted groups in different regions? Double shots for vulnerable before single shots for others? Mobile vaccination services?')
