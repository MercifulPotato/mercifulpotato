An example of the very tiny shell script that I use for VNC-over-SSH to a remote machine.<p>In which the VNC daemon on the remote machine only listens on its own localhost, and I use ssh to form the tunnel then use the vnc client on my workstation to connect to localhost:5902 to access it.<p>ssh -v -L 5902:127.0.0.1:5901 -C -N -f -l myusername -i ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;my_ssh_id remotehostname.net<p>echo &quot;localhost port 5902 for the VNC client to remotehostname.net&quot;<p>I actually think this is better because for a very small open source project like barrier, that might literally be developed by one person, the workload and time&#x2F;effort to be ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN you&#x27;ve implemented the crypto libraries correctly is a lot of work and worry.<p>Whereas if you use ssh you can be fairly certain that it&#x27;s been battle tested by a huge number of people who have a lot more time and resources than yourself.')
