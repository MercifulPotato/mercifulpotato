Electronic cash, i.e. bitcoin work better than the traditional ways of payment when there is a necessity for crowdfunding a little bit of money less than a penny, a 1&#x2F;10 of a penny or 1&#x2F;100, or 1&#x2F;1000, from thousands of users. The reason bitcoin works better in that case, is because bitcoin is absolutely automated while in traditional payment systems a human is required to oversee the payments in case there is a fraud somewhere. That means a human is required to be paid, and humans are expensive to employ. That increases the cost of every transaction, as well as increases the minimal amount of the transferable value.')
