I can&#x27;t imagine what they&#x27;d look like if they got fired out of a rail gun.<p>In real terms, I&#x27;m doubtful that the majority of people&#x27;s goods would withstand that kind of rapid acceleration. Consumer electronics frequently break from hitting the floor, a rail gun would probably shred them. You could accelerate more slowly, but then you need more runway, and you might end up building a skyscraper anyways to get a delivery radius that&#x27;s more than half a mile.')
