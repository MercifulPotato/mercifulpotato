Item(by='solatic', descendants=None, kids=[25684935], score=None, time=1610087827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679125, text='&gt; I actually really like the anti overtime policy (half your hourly rate after 20h &#x2F; week)... I suspect that scares off workaholics.<p>I suspect that anti-overtime policy, at scale, is somewhat like a salaried position. When you earn a salary, your salary is guaranteed regardless of how many hours that you put in. Why work more than 40 hours a week? But in the real world, gains and promotion often go to people who &quot;bleed&quot; for the company. If salaried positions, which offer <i>zero</i> overtime pay, end up promoting overwork, why would offering a partial reward of half-pay factor in at all into whether the company has an overwork culture problem or not (particularly if reporting hours is the responsibility of the employee and the employee can simply decide not to report the overtime hours)?')
