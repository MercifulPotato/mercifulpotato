I just recently upgraded to the family plan at $17.99&#x2F;month so I could add two of my friends.<p>That&#x27;s ~$6 per month to enjoy YouTube completely ad free, allows you to download YouTube videos to your phone for offline viewing, allows background play, _and_ gets you YouTube Music Premium(I still am using Google Play Music, but this is basically a &quot;free&quot; Spotify subscription) as well.<p>Its such a good value for me and I think it&#x27;d be a great value to a lot of other people as well but every time I mention it I feel like people have never heard of it.')
