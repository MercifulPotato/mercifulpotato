And as for copper - at the speeds you listed thunderbolt and USB3&#x2F;C are limited to severely short cables, a measly 0.5 meters for 40Gb. Though 20Gb can do 1 or 2m, 2m being the longest thunderbolt cable you can use.<p>As for power, that devil is in the interface details. I see no reason why multi-gigabit Ethernet can&#x27;t be pushed over a similarly designed low power differential copper serial transceiver.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, Ethernet is more mature than USB could ever dream of being.')
