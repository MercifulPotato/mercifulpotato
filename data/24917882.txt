It could be that you are within a group that has little growth, and does not need a new EM. Some political reasons. Maybe your manager is terrible and does not seek opportunities for you. etc...<p>In this case, my advice would be to join a mid size company which has growth, and you join as a senior engineer. Startups can be another way (that&#x27;s how I did it), but that&#x27;s more difficult to plan. I certainly did not plan it this way myself.')
