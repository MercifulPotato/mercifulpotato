The GDPR only says that you have to ask users for their consent if you want to use their data in a way that is not strictly required for the service they request from you. If you stop tracking your users, then you don&#x27;t need to have stupid popups and modals, most of which are probably illegal anyway, since the default action tends to be the one that allows all the tracking cookies. The problem with GDPR is that it&#x27;s not really being enforced much.')
