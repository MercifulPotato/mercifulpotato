Women-for-equal-pay have not been observed cleaning and oiling their rifles menacingly, and yet the law was mended in their favor. And I don&#x27;t think Irish or Jewish terrorism was a problem in the US, but their persecution has ended all the same. You&#x27;re only looking at things that became explosive, so quite naturally you will not find things that were resolved peacefully and&#x2F;or timely. They still exist though, in fact they may be dominant.<p>It&#x27;s a great comment otherwise, I enjoyed the trip down the memory lane. Looking forward to seeing you again.')
