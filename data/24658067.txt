It is hard for me to imagine a physics instructor at any level introducing new mathematical techniques and more or less leaving the student on his or her own to decipher the runes required. The important part is the physics and the relationships of the quantities; not how they&#x27;re represented on paper. It&#x27;s kind of sad that CS doesn&#x27;t seem to have a similar view.')
