If you don&#x27;t try to move your hand at all, the water (time) has seemingly no affect on you. In this analogy the water itself is space and time is the measurement of movement resistance.<p>Of course there are nice little things to explore with this, like moving through running water, currents (localized loops), deep water (dense space), resistance on small vs large things, etc.<p>If we imagine on the small enough scale where we&#x27;re looking at single water molecules, resistance (time) doesn&#x27;t even mean too much. As long as your water is liquid, your little molecules are bouncing around in all directions, only tending towards a given direction with some probability. Otherwise each direction is near and damnit equally easy to travel in.<p>That&#x27;s my two cents anyway.')
