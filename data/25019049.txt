The link you provide is indicating there was no voter fraud in the 2016 election not the, 2020 election.<p>2. As for &quot;widespread&quot; I think we are disagreeing on what it means, in this case you seem to indicate I am talking just about 1000s of people going out and voting multiple times, there are also concerns around counters through some means, providing a different number for the counted whether by introducing false ballots, lying about the number they counted, etc.<p>For example there was a machine in Detroit that read in 8,000 votes that were listed for Trump as votes for Biden [0] now that could very well be a simple technical error but it indicates how easy it is cause voting totals to not match the reality of the voting.<p>As for the final rejoinder, I think maybe we are having different opinions in mind as to what we are discussing. For me I fully support having many polling places that are easy to get to for many people in multiple locations and that on election day we should make it as easy as possible for people to vote; however I also think there should be tighter integrity checks on who is voting and on the counting of votes itself.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freep.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;antrim-county-vote-glitch-software-update&#x2F;6194745002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freep.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;elections&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;...</a>')
