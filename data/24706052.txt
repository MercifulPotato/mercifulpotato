It&#x27;s a new privacy orientated search engine. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an alternative to Google and a direct competitor of DuckDuckGo.<p>Now, when you prefix your search on Runnaroo with &quot;related:&quot;, the results will be provided by SaaSHub. With this in place, this new search engine can provide better results than both Google and DuckDuckGo. For example, you could check the top related results for &quot;Hacker News&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runnaroo.com&#x2F;search?term=related%3A+hackers+news" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.runnaroo.com&#x2F;search?term=related%3A+hackers+news</a>.<p>(disclosure: I&#x27;m working at SaaSHub)')
