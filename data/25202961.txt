Item(by='baryphonic', descendants=None, kids=[25204308], score=None, time=1606251697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25202763, text='The problem with monopsony in theory is that it reduces the actual wage below the market-clearing wage, which results in a lower quantity of labor supplied. A better arrangement in such cases is usually a bilateral monopoly (think of how sports leagues negotiate with players&#x27; unions), which results in wages and labor supplied much closer to market clearing amounts (again, in theory).<p>In many ways, the US already has a soft form of monopsony, given the total dominance of CMMS in determining everything from reimbursements to billing codes to proper medical procedures. We shouldn&#x27;t be surprised by the already significant shortages within US medical professions given this situation. CMMS regulation has also resulted in large hospital groups absorbing private practices such that most physicians now work for some large hospital group, and most of the rest work for larger companies focused on one or a few specialities.')
