Suppose there were 100 possible futures. In 90 of them, Alice wins, by a little or a lot. In 8 of them, Bob <i>barely</i> wins, and in 2, Bob wins comfortably. Maybe this is determined by rigged dice or something, to make it strictly mechanical: there&#x27;s 100 possibilities, and we know what they are and how they&#x27;re distributed.<p>Just because you end up in the 9&#x2F;100 future doesn&#x27;t mean that the &quot;real&quot; probability was 50%. It&#x27;s weak evidence that Bob&#x27;s win scenarios mostly didn&#x27;t involve blowouts.<p>It&#x27;s like barely winning a sprint against Usain Bolt: maybe he had an injury midway through. Doesn&#x27;t mean that he and I were equally likely to win.')
