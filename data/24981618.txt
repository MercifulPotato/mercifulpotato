I wonder what those people have to say now.<p>Right now I am neither arguing whether it is or isn&#x27;t a national security concern. I just want to highlight that people&#x27;s general understanding of how things work in China is very poor, and that one should be careful with speculations like that. At the very least I think more people should recognize that the Chinese government and the CCP are not monoliths, and that the distance between &quot;the boss of the company is a CCP member&quot; and &quot;the company is state-controlled&quot; is larger than what many think.')
