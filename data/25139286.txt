It seems the website has not posted a full update since the week of Mar 9, 2020 - Mar 16, 2020.  Given that, can anyone recommend another resource for finding new books that would likely appeal to the HN community (tech, business, science, etc.)?  Are there any other websites that parse HN discussions for book titles?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackernewsbooks.com')
