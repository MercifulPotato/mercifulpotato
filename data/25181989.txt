People say that if you don&#x27;t cycle them occasionally they can swell and be a fire hazard. I&#x27;d rather not deal with that. Will &quot;any laptop from ebay from the past decade&quot; run without batteries in it?<p>Yes, at least the ones with removable batteries that I&#x27;ve seen.<p>&gt;* Running closed. I&#x27;ve also heard that laptops are designed to be used open for heat reasons. Will running it closed cause problems?<p>What use case would cause significant heat generation? Worst case you can get a $15 laptop stand with fans.')
