In essence you can run the previous, current and next major versions, and for each of those we have the latest 5 builds. We make a new major version typically every month.<p>This means that a lot of bugs can be worked around by simply running an older build or major version. Show-stoppers thus become inconvenient instead. Also it&#x27;s easier to tell customers their super important feature will come in the next release in a month, rather than having the feature be backported, avoiding the &quot;partial slow&quot; scheme mentioned in the talk.<p>The main issue here is the database, which of course can&#x27;t be rolled back easily. So we don&#x27;t, and write our code with that in mind.<p>This has been a great change from when customers would stick on a version for over a year at a time. Upgrading often meant lots of time spent by support for assisting with testing, and by the time the testing was done (not a high priority with the customers) the version that was deemed ready was already hopelessly out of date.')
