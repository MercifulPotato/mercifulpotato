Rxjs is such a better async pattern than anything else in the javascript ecosystem. The front end shouldn&#x27;t care what node is doing, especially since not everyone&#x27;s front end uses node. What I don&#x27;t like about async await is it changes the pattern you are seeing, intermingling synchronous and asynchronous code based on the correct placement of a keyword, then using try catch blocks to catch errors are just so ugly. Passing my data through a stream of pure functions that transform the data into what I need just feels pleasant to work with, but I do agree it takes awhile to be proficient in it.')
