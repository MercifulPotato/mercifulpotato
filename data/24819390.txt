I can walk to my nearest polling place. It just won’t change the outcome in my state and I really don’t care that much.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no way the Republican party would ever win a fair, easy-to-vote, EU-style, election.<p>What is an “easy-to-vote, EU-style election?” The voting system in Georgia isn’t that different from say France.
