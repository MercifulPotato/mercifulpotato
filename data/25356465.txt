Of those stocks only the growth of AMD is justified because it was starting off from a small base anyway and it is in the process of replacing Intel entirely so creeping up to Intel&#x27;s market cap is not surprising.<p>Tesla makes absolutely no sense to me. Etsy is just an online shop and it sells a lot of crap. Pton is probably just a corona fad.<p>AAPL is slightly encouraging because it obviously has some well justified growth left in it but it&#x27;s not overhyped to the extreme extent as the other stocks.<p>All stocks are still growing way too quickly in my opinion though.')
