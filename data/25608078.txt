Item(by='someonehere', descendants=None, kids=[25610695], score=None, time=1609541239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604862, text='What works for me as a manager overseeing a few direct reports:<p>- Stand ups for 15-30 minutes in the morning.<p>- I screen share a Google form I made that asks three questions and I fill out for the team to see what each response is.<p>- What did you do yesterday? What are you doing today? Anything blocking you?<p>- The answers get put into a spreadsheet that myself or upper management can review progress on performance and services.<p>- If I’m unavailable to hold the daily check in, my team fills out the form on their own. If they don’t fill it out for the day, there’s a record they didn’t spend the five minutes to fill it out.<p>- I have weekly 1 to 1 meetings with the individuals to check in on how they’re doing with work, career development, anything they want to talk about, and how personal life is going.<p>It’s working out well for me. I also schedule a once a week meeting on Jira tickets to see where status is at on any lingering issues the team can’t address.<p>Overall I put enough in front of my team that I can track progress and ensure they’re doing their part while working from home. This way I avoid needing to be on zoom all day. I do leave the option open for my team to Zoom me if they urgently need me to help.')
