It&#x27;s not really relevant except to people who start from a normal perspective and are considering the anti-inductivist hypothesis (usually either because they&#x27;re studying philosophy or because someone else brought philosophy into the discussion, which is what happened here).<p>For those people, it <i>is</i> important to realize that anti-inductivism can&#x27;t be defeated on its own terms.  By usual standards (for some definition of &quot;usual&quot;), the space of possible observations one could make is enormous, and the fact that they keep very, very consistently being in accord with the laws of physics as we&#x27;ve discovered them—often to many decimal places—is immense evidence in favor of &quot;physics as we&#x27;ve discovered it&quot; as compared to &quot;anything might happen&quot;.  Any viable competing theory would have to be reasonably simple (i.e. not include &quot;billions of specific items that explain all prior observations&quot; as axioms) and would have to make almost exactly the same predictions.<p>(&quot;Newtonian mechanics&quot; is reasonably simple and makes similar predictions at the level most people can see, but with specialized equipment and experiments it has been disproven.  &quot;God did it&quot; sounds simple, but either the word &quot;God&quot; smuggles in the extremely non-simple &quot;God is a being whose psychological makeup led him to make the following billions of specific decisions that explain all prior observations&quot;, or it amounts to &quot;God is a being who chooses to run the universe according to something approximating Einsteinian mechanics&quot;; in that case, it is <i>possible</i> that God might decide to intervene and do something physics would say is impossible, but if you want to say that God will do any specific intervention, you would have to make a less-simple theory that explains why God would do that particular thing and not anything else, and the longer time passes without any verified physically-impossible miracles, the more unlikely most such theories get.  &quot;Intelligent beings vaguely like us arose, and decided to simulate our universe, following rules that approximate Einsteinian mechanics&quot; is also possible—not much different from the God-based class of theories.)')
