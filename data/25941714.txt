This would allow me to focus on the project goals as I see fit, but rely on the community to bug test and update the additional features. It would offload the work of maintenance without the need to split the codebase for every single individual feature request.<p>Curious if something like this is used for any larger projects! I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t always work but maybe on certain types of projects it could.')
