Microsoft&#x27;s current strategy on ARM seems pretty unlikely to succeed though.<p>&gt; In any case, if it can be done -- i.e. if there aren&#x27;t locked down specs -- you can bet Linux will be ported to M1 Macs.<p>I&#x27;m confident (and hopeful) we will see an M series Linux port. How good it will be without support from Apple is questionable. The current state of Linux on Mac doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire hope.')
