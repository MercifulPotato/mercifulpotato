SRAM is routinely the MOST optimized and MOST worried-over aspect of silicon layout.  SRAM cell architectures get hand-optimized carefully years in advance of any process improvements.  They aren&#x27;t just logic that gets spit out of generic tooling.<p>So while it would make sense that a new process would have new design rule that didn&#x27;t map well to older EDA tooling, it&#x27;s harder to see that argument holding for SRAM.  If SRAM isn&#x27;t scaling, why is general logic?')
