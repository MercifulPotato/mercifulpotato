He&#x27;s basically a man who has been paid for at bare minimum the last 8 years of his life, probably longer, to write needlessly aggressive rants about the most trivial of things (In his past sportswriter life it was The St. Louis Cardinals), or anecdotes about his daily life that people care about a whole lot less than he thinks they do. He&#x27;s a one trick pony, and his one trick isn&#x27;t actually good.<p>I appreciate OP for putting his name in the title so I would know enough not to click the link, not that anything written by him belongs on this site in the first place. It&#x27;s the equivalent intellectual stimulation of an Adam Sandler comedy.')
