To go one step further, what stops a bunch of libraries from pooling their digitized collections together and making it available to sister libraries. I think there is nothing in current law that stops it or is there?<p>What in the law allows e-book publishers to make distinction between physical copies of books owned by libraries and digital books? Seems to me like they are holding libraries hostage over a barrel because they can.')
