It has very little to do with SoC or specialized instructions -- it&#x27;s fast on general purpose code.<p>The main reasons appear to be that it&#x27;s a solid design, i.e. competitive with what x86-64 processors are offering, and on top of that has some specific characteristics that x86-64 processors don&#x27;t currently have (but obviously could). It&#x27;s built on TSMC 5nm, which is possibly the most power efficient process in the world right now. It&#x27;s using memory which is faster than the DDR4 currently used by the competition. It&#x27;s a big.LITTLE design, which is more power efficient, because you get strong single thread performance from the big cores and higher efficiency on threaded code from the little cores.<p>It&#x27;s not magic. It&#x27;s engineering.')
