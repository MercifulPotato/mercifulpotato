If open source truly offered a replacement, then these costly programs would die. But there just isn&#x27;t anything close for most work.<p>Matlab is used for massive amounts of precise numerical engineering design, modeling, and running systems. So while Python is good for some tasks, for the places Matlab shines Python is no where near usable. And before Python catches up in this space, I&#x27;d expect Julia to get there faster.')
