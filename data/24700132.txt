But, if you love Italian food and hate Chinese, then maybe that&#x27;s a trade you&#x27;re (not you specifically) willing to make.<p>I can see the access to nature as a reasonable trade off, if you&#x27;re out hiking every weekend then maybe that could make the M-F in the smaller town more liveable<p>It definitely is an interesting situation')
