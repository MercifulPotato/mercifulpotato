Either assume progress is linear (which seems to be the instinctive default most people use if they don&#x27;t know much about a particular field) or assume it&#x27;s non-linear. In case of the latter, you can choose between assuming exponential progress to apply or a step-wise, non-continuous kind of progress. It&#x27;s a bad idea to not assume one of these to be the case if you want to make a prediction, because it&#x27;s not possible to predict anything without that assumption.<p>I mean, you can of course refrain from making any predictions. But I have never met a single person who could resist the instinctive urge to extrapolate current developments into the future. It is as much a core part of being human to do this as it is to breathe air.')
