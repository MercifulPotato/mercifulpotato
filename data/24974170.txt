Imo it&#x27;s far quieter than a highway or even an arterial road. The problem is concrete supports are a lot more expensive and take more time to build than cheap creaky squeaky steel girders that you see in chicago and nyc. Plus, somehow, people were still pissed as hell about that train in LA and managed to dilute the plan from being a fully grade separated line into a mixed grade mess, where it might take you 15 minutes to travel through certain 2 mile stretches (on a train capable of 75mph).')
