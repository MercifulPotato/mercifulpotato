Sure, most programmers out there would rather express things in terms of try&#x2F;catch. But the idea is not to have continuations <i>replace</i> try&#x2F;catch, but to have try&#x2F;catch expressible in terms of continuations. Then it becomes a library you load and depend on, and theoretically runnable in any Scheme implementation that supports the continuation mechanism the try&#x2F;catch library uses.')
