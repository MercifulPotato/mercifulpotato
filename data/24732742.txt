In my experience, the person venting about how a tool sucks will 15-20 minutes later realize &quot;oh. that&#x27;s why.&quot;, or otherwise head off to roll their own implementation and 15 working days later realize &quot;oh. that&#x27;s why.&quot; or get into production and cause an outage from missing several edge cases.<p>On the macOS topic, it is odd that the root user no longer functions as one would expect in the Unix model (for example, cli tools which can no longer list OS processes, which haven&#x27;t had any issues during the amount of time I&#x27;ve used them). It is frustrating that a wide variety of tools no longer work correctly as a result of some of these changes as well; for example, emacs can no longer navigate my filesystem. All said and done, my day to day work has been via Linux workstations for nearly all of the past 15 years, which is partly why some of those effects are more jarring than others to me.<p>Again, thanks for your input!')
