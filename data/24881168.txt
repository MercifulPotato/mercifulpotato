Item(by='xtiansimon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603565605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24860113, text='&gt; &quot;You may be able to get somewhere, but if it takes several connections and a transit time of over 1 hr, you&#x27;re not likely to do it frequently.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s exactly my experience living on North Shore of Nassau County, Long Island, NY. I don&#x27;t have a car.<p>A primary factor which permits me to live without a car is in-town taxi service (not Uber). Shopping, laundry, etc. are all within 20 minute walk. The town is compact, unlike most suburban sprawl.<p>Previous to COVID I commuted 4 days to Midtown by rail, which was ~1.25h one way. Now I work from home.<p>I consider the Ami an ideal vehicle to fit my lifestyle, and would be much more desired if the in town taxi service were 2+ times more expensive, if I needed to go out more, and if the weather was more reliably rainy or cold and icy, and if needed to wear &#x27;adult clothes&#x27; which I didn&#x27;t wish to ruin walking in dirty streets.')
