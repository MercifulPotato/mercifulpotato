If you have losses then you pay dearly if there&#x27;s latency. The latency itself doesn&#x27;t present a problem, the TCP window size increases and takes care of that. The problem is packet losses, because (even with &#x27;intelligent&#x27; retransmission) there&#x27;s a lot of (the buffered) window to retransmit and then the performance dies. When the packet losses stay low, say, 0.001%, the latency is not an issue.<p>(At work I did months of testing on TCP performance for a 900ms rtt high-speed link)<p>But yes, upload speed is more important than ever. For my work-from-home setup I need to transfer lots of data both ways. And for my &quot;cloud&quot; backup etc. I need to push large amounts of data out of the house. And with fiber I get that, fortunately.')
