I&#x27;m assuming that these reviews didn&#x27;t appear recently, suddenly or something.<p>They did appear recently. The latest pre-today copy of the page at archive.org [1] had it at 166469 reviews (average a tad over 4 stars). That was from 2020-11-17.<p>The next copy there was at 14:06 today (2021-01-28) [2]. It&#x27;s up to 196808 reviews (average 2.5 stars). They captured it several mores times today. Here&#x27;s a table.<p><pre><code>  14:06  196808\n  17:17  295104\n  18:24  306315\n  19:17  327577\n  20:22  330648\n  21:02  319501\n  21:36  246084\n  22:25  202305\n</code></pre>\nand they have two captures from tomorrow:<p><pre><code>  00:24  180490\n  02:23  178221\n</code></pre>\nIf we play it safe and assume that all the reviews as of 14:06 today were old reviews, there was a minimum of 133840 reviews today, which would have been 40% of the total reviews. More realistically, if we go with about 170k old reviews, it&#x27;s more like 160k reviews today representing almost 50% of all reviews.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201117224019&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.robinhood.android" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201117224019&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.goog...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201117224019&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.robinhood.android" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201117224019&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.goog...</a>')
