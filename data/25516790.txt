That&#x27;s not a statement about me; I know a few people who could run it BETTER than myself or Gates. The problem is finding them and the no checks-and-balances bit.<p>Beyond a founder&#x2F;donor, no checks-and-balances is a really bad way to run an organization because although MANY people would do a great job, MOST people wouldn&#x27;t. A good dictatorship beats a good democracy, but a typical democracy beats a typical dictatorship.<p>The sorts of arbitrary decisions &quot;Let&#x27;s dump a billion dollars into making a vaccine for COVID19 economical&quot; become impossible once the founder of a foundation goes away, unless you are willing to accept that whomever comes into control might just as well say &quot;Let&#x27;s dump a billion dollars into buying paintings of myself at 10x markup.&quot; You move into competitive processes.<p>Competitive processes mean people apply for grants under standard criteria.<p>If grants have a strongly positive ROI, you have more people applying to the program, and if a negative ROI, fewer people. This means grant-funded organizations will spend a significant portion of their time applying for grants; grants become thin-margin beasts.<p>And the people who do run late foundations? They&#x27;re connected people good at climbing corporate ladders.')
