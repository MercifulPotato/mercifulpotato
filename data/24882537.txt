There was a huge investment by the government with an interest to build weapons. Some of it spilled over to energy plants. Once the government got what it wanted and had enough bombs funding was pulled.  Nuclear power plants did ok for a while. Then decades passed and just a skeleton crew remains. Restarting the momentum is only possible through massive cost overruns.')
