Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604918705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031972, text='Having regulations around electrical wiring or plumbing or medicine or whatever is a group decision to have a public body that provides such certifications that anyone can join. This is very very different from your architect saying that the only person who can ever provide electrical wiring for your home is them, because they designed your building and having someone else modify the wiring would be an unsafe violation of the terms of service on your home. Like, the argument here is kind of ridiculous as it means that you sometimes can&#x27;t even get safe software because the one company authorized to provide software decided to lock everyone else out and then just didn&#x27;t care. FWIW, I am actually very very PRO regulation of the software industry... but I&#x27;m very very ANTI companies deciding that they, alone, get to decide what everyone can do, whether it be build new features, fix bugs, or introspect behavior... in fact, I think that&#x27;s one of the most important things that should be regulated AGAINST: everyone should have a right to repair, maintain, and understand the things they buy, and that right should allow them to outsource that to a third party (so they can hire a repairperson, a developer, or a security researcher).')
