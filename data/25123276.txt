It gives me a clear understanding of everything, allows me to manage branches easily, gives me access to every command I need, and even allows a great diff view between any commits.<p>Merge conflicts are easy to solve now and I never get lost in the complexity.<p>I use cli tools for almost everything, but Git Graph and vscode solves git for me. The only command I run in git cli is git clone or git unit.')
