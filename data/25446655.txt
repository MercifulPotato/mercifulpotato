And, for me, this is removing one of the main, core advantages of Lisp.<p>Dispensing with the interactive programming features is, IMO, a step backwards in the state-of-the-art. Common Lisp <i>ADDED</i> all the improvements in the state of the art: Interactive programming from Smalltalk, lexical scoping from Scheme, various high performance&#x2F;low level features from StarLisp and ZetaLisp, a very powerful OOP system, etc. And then, thanks to it being highly extensive, almost any feature can be added to it.<p>Clojure features like threading macros, immutable seqences, software transactional memory, and others, are already available in Common Lisp by just importing (loading) the respective library.<p>One of Clojure&#x27;s main advantage is to be able to call Java libraries. But, surprise, you can do this in Common Lisp too, easily, by using the Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) implementation. Which runs on the JVM too and makes the process of calling Java libs really, really easy. I have made a working example here, calling all the Swing UI library (java) from lisp:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;defunkydrummer&#x2F;abcl-jazz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;defunkydrummer&#x2F;abcl-jazz</a><p>It&#x27;s true that Clojure has more widespread adoption in the industry and more libraries. However the library ecosystem on Common Lisp is decent.<p>&gt;and you can get actual work done in it which is an advantage over some of the other options<p>This implies you can&#x27;t do &quot;actual work&quot; in, for example, Common lisp. Which is not true, since there are companies that, in this very moment, are doing well paid, critical commercial work using Common Lisp.')
