But this is a cultural concept. You could also have a cultural concept that only things inside your house reflect on you, and the sidewalk is... just a random part of universe. Then there is no reason why you should go and clean up a random part of universe.<p>You probably don&#x27;t feel that it is your duty to go and clean up garbage everywhere in your city. At some distance, it&#x27;s simply not your problem anymore. This is the same, but the distance ends at the threshold of your house.<p>Any norm makes sense, internally, if you know that this is the norm others will use to judge you. Most people don&#x27;t go beyond what is required of them.')
