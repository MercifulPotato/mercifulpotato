You can bet people withdraw with the 10% penalty all the time to spend that money on whatever they want, not college.<p>The state also runs its own investment accounts, like this individual does, and spends it on many totally worthy concerns, like paying pensions that are used by beneficiaries to pay for housing, food and indeed, sometimes education, so maybe that&#x27;s the more appropriate comparison.<p>&gt; they could just as easily gifted their grandkids that much money, tax free (federally, at least)<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, and your information appears to be the result of doing Google searches on SEO&#x27;d tax and accounting law partnership pages.<p>It seems like there a lot of misunderstandings anyway about how this stuff works. Can they reduce the taxes they would otherwise pay on the lotto income? Of course, creating 14 529 plans (as opposed to say, 1, or 0) is an important part of that strategy. Then there are so called experts working in finance chiming in, which if I could point to anyone being a complete waste of money for baby boomers in the last 20 years, it’s CFAs collecting 1.0-1.5% AUM every year on top of mutual fund fees that all underperformed low cost indices. The kind of assholes who, in the absence of any normative measure, have finally settled on justifying their high fees as “not answering the phone when you want to panic sell.”<p>It’s infuriating, honestly, the lack of any sophistication whatsoever and the trust put into total leeches like CFAs. And here we are, getting lost in the tax details, from people who would balk at paying a retainer for an ongoing professional opinion instead of a management fee - when those opinions could save them literally millions over the lifetime of a windfall like this - and wind up on SEO’d advice pages googling stuff themselves instead.<p>A bunch of temporary embarrassed billionaires Googling, shitting on how the state spends money, voting in tax cuts for people much richer than them. I don’t have expertise either, I’m not a lawyer or an accountant ,but consider paying one the pathetically small fee it would cost to get an answer to these questions that make sense for you and your situation.')
