A lot of people that listen to music don&#x27;t have any interest in discovering new music, or finding music that is a distinct match for their unique personality. They&#x27;re just happy to listen to what is shoved in front of them. But if you change your approach away from what is good for each listener, and more toward what is good for a healthy culture, then maybe that starts suggesting some paths. I&#x27;d personally like it to be more of a combination of aggressively introducing people to new music, making hard not to rank&#x2F;react to music, and heavily rewarding artists of new music that yield positive response. I also think there should be a form of progressive redistribution of the power law. Just because there&#x27;s a power low doesn&#x27;t mean the slope can&#x27;t be flattened a bit.')
