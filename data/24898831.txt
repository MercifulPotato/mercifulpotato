If I&#x27;m understanding your current setup and needs correctly, it sounds like we may be able to solve what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>You can get started with our no-code templates or build your own using Python&#x2F;Bash. We&#x27;re higher level than Airflow, with visual workflow editors and a web-accessible platform (no hosting required), but still lower level than Zapier by enabling you to run heavy-duty custom scripts as needed.<p>On the off-chance that you&#x27;re looking for tools that create workflows that require more manual intervention... you might want to look into Formstack, Quickbase, or Microsoft Power Automate alongside Kissflow.')
