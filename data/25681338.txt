Within the niche that Jetbrains occupies it is one of the most well known players out there, and so it truly is not obscure. It was an unfair characterization. Furthermore, the reporting provides no evidence to support its very damaging claim. To those of us who are familiar with configuring these types of systems, we know very well how easy it is to leave a single permission unattended to. The damage done by this type of irresponsible reporting is serious. Personally, I hope they get their pants sued off for their complete lack of discretion and disregard for journalistic integrity.')
