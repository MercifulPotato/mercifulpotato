It’s the only lay-person example here, not a shell or programming language for technical people. Showing a Google query back to a user, I might speculate, has an important function of allowing users to see spelling errors they didn’t know they typed. I can imagine other reasons as well, and I’d be willing to bet that Google has tried both and decided on repeating the output. The other thing not discussed is the Google output is organized hierarchically, separating the error from the tips, and bolding the search query. Those two things could dramatically improve the PowerShell output, for example, without removing any text. No other example had style formatting, and good styling and layout can be as effective as silence.')
