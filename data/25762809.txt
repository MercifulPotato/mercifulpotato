Regarding the time, it is and has been the time for this since lisp emanated. But C is not the place, IMO. I don&#x27;t want to be left to wonder about sizeof(anything) in C.<p>&quot;Lisp Programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing.&quot;<p>C programmers ought to know the cost and sizeof everything...<p>I hope the committee sees it like this as well.<p>I also believe the feature (auto) makes sense for C++ with its verbose and lengthy types nobody but your compiler cares about (say, e.g., multimap::equal_range). For C? Get out of here..<p>this passes, and suddenly zig becomes a whole lot more interesting ;)\n(but zig also has type inference you say? Well, it&#x27;s a consistent proposition, and not a tacked-on &quot;feature&quot;.)')
