There are a few a year where there is a serious debate. Certainly plenty of people dislike the rules, but that isn’t the same as Apple just throwing away good apps.<p>I think the statement that hundreds of good apps are being thrown into the abyss is bullshit.<p>You are using the <i>absence of evidence</i> to support a strong claim.<p>We really don’t know whether there is any truth to it or not.<p>Given how many people seem to think this is such a problem, I’m surprised nobody has aggregated the stories.')
