I remember discussing with people just a few days ago here on HN about how the Delphi compiler used to be blazing fast due to being written in Assembly[1]. It&#x27;s kind of nice to see that others are taking full advantage of LLVM at an official capacity at least, making it much more tried and tested, not that it wasn&#x27;t already tried and tested before. I think Rust &#x2F; Swift as well don&#x27;t hurt. It would be nice to see Kotlin Native taken a lot more seriously by JetBrains on the other hand.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docwiki.embarcadero.com&#x2F;RADStudio&#x2F;Sydney&#x2F;en&#x2F;LLVM-based_Delphi_Compilers" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docwiki.embarcadero.com&#x2F;RADStudio&#x2F;Sydney&#x2F;en&#x2F;LLVM-base...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24735969" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24735969</a>')
