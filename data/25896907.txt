That&#x27;s why I chose MIT and other permissive licenses.<p>That said, what I had in mind when I licensed my code were start-ups and small+medium businesses. It didn&#x27;t occur to me that behemoths like Amazon might stripmine open source and fail to contribute back. Even though the permissive licenses permit this kind of behavior, it seems exploitative.<p>Additionally, as the GP mentions, we&#x27;re at the point where it&#x27;s primarily massive tech companies who can afford to develop ambitious open source projects.<p>Far more importantly, it also failed to occur to me that tech companies would become the new railroads -- massive monopolies that dominate society, the economy, culture, politics, etc. When I started in open source, Microsoft had recently been slapped down by antitrust regulators, there was no social media, and the tech ecosystem - particularly the open source ecosystem - was much, much different. It was more democratic, egalitarian, and balanced.<p>Granted, as far as I know, it <i>has</i> been small and medium sized companies that have used my own open source code. I&#x27;m not aware of any of the Big 5 using it (my most popular libaries have been superceded by newer&#x2F;better projects anyway).<p>Nonetheless, I would have been more wary of philosophically supporting permissive licenses had I fully realized the implications.')
