Most transmission will be from the drone to the operator in that case. If you intend to do active control, you should be ready to move since your position is exposed.<p>The more autonomous the drone is, the less transmission you&#x27;ll need. If you are looking for a specific type of vehicle for example, it should be easy to have the drone do it autonomously and not even transmit anything itself until it finds it (and possibly never - it could keep the footage until it returns to the operator). A drone (or a dozen of them) asked to find enemy armor within a map area with zero commincation either to or from the drone would be extremely difficult to hide from. This is a capability that has existed for years with large drones or satellites but they have been expensive, limited use in bad weather, and most importantly not available to individual soldiers on the ground without needing to coordinate that support.<p>&gt; launching a projectile to take it out<p>The problem with anti-drone weapons is that so long as the projectile is heavier&#x2F;larger&#x2F;more expensive than the drone, the drone is winning even when taken out. It&#x27;s  an active area of research but other than another drone, the only viable BVR counter-drone I have seen so far is a trained bird...')
