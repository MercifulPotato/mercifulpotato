The gal or guy coming by your desk to &quot;check in&quot; or &quot;see how your weekend was&quot; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.<p>You have got to be kidding me.. You are at work because you have a contract to fulfil. You are not there to find your soulmate , stop saying things like &quot;we are a family&quot; , the second you get fired your coworkers will ignore you. Out of 99% of my interactions at work, maybe at best 1% of them even keep in touch with me, never mind actually building a deep connection.<p>Further if you are praising being in stuck for hours in traffic for a sense of &quot;normalcy&quot; , you clearly have no idea how frustrating and time consuming it is. I&#x27;ve been driving to office for years and the exhausting dread of wasting 3+ hours of commute time in traffic gives my anxiety.<p>Finally, your home is your sanctuary, if you are escaping from home, you have deeper problems, going to the office is not the solution.<p>Stop normalizing inefficient office-busy-work over actually being productive, getting decent sleep, having more free time to spend with your family and friends which are huge advantages of remote work.')
