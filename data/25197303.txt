They make big money with their own work, and he delivered a very tiny gear in that. It&#x27;s not like he made some genious unreplaceable part which is worth billions on it&#x27;s own. It just happend to be there and fullfil a demand they had. They can acknowledge it and give him something extra, or just follow the lizense and mention what&#x27;s neccessary. It&#x27;s up to them and how much value his work has for them.')
