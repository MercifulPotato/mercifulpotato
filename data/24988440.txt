It looked very familiar, and behold, it is a rebranded Samsung SL-M2070w that I have in the office.<p>Hardware-wise, it is actually a nice printer. Software-wise... It works in Linux, but you have to install the binary-only uld driver. For MacOS it is more interesting: printing is not a problem, scanning in B&#x2F;w is also OK, but scanning in Image Capture&#x2F;Preview in color into PDF produces garbage output. What works is scanning in color into TIFF, then stitching and reexporting into PDF manually. The alternative, the EasyScan Samsung software no longer works in Catalina, it has 32-bit components.<p>Edit: from the ppds in the driver package, they are:<p>* HP Laser 10x Series<p>* HP Laser MFP 13x Series<p>* HP Color Laser 15x Series<p>* HP Color MFP 17x Series')
