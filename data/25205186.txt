If you&#x27;ve completed the CPU-bound operations and are just starting disk-bound operations, it&#x27;s totally fair to say &quot;50% complete&quot;, even if you expect one to take much longer than the other.<p>Alternatively you could use multiple bars - one showing the number of distinct tasks to complete, and the other showing the estimated time progression of the current task. Ideally chuck an expandible debug log underneath it. You probably want to be implementing a debug log while developing to test the thing anyway, just leave it in there! A lot of installers use this kind of progress bar and I&#x27;ve always found them to be the most user-friendly.')
