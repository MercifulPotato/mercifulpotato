I&#x27;m far from an Apple zealot, but Tim Cook added $1.7 Trillion to apple&#x27;s market cap since taking over as chief executive. He certainly isn&#x27;t the product visionary that Jobs was, but a rare few are. IMO Cook may have even been a better executer than Jobs, even if his decisions are more risk averse. And he has still taken a few notable ones â€“ e.g. Apple&#x27;s recent shift to services revenue (news, music, card, etc) was a surprisingly smooth &amp; fast success. Barring some huge future misstep, I&#x27;d be surprised if he didn&#x27;t go down as one of history&#x27;s most successful company leaders in his own right.')
