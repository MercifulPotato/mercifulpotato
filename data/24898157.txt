Western Union, in comparison, was a flat 10%, making it bitcoin at the time almost pointless.<p>When there isn&#x27;t enough volume HFT strategies tend to not run, and so to give an example, my first time trading options was an iron condor on &#x2F;GC (gold).  I bought at a reasonable price, but when I went to sell, where I would have netted a cool 50%, because of low volume and I didn&#x27;t know to set a limit order, I lost about 50%, so even if my trade was &quot;successful&quot; I lost.  If there was a bit more volume HFT could step in and we could have normalized prices where limit orders are not required.  On the other end, without HFT, it&#x27;s easy to play that game and setup orders of opportunity where someone else might mess up and you can make a pretty penny, not that I&#x27;ve personally tried this.')
