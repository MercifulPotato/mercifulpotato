And theres no practical way to determine whether the customer is “trying it out” or running a key part of their business on any particular resource.<p>This could be ameliorated by using namespacing techniques to separate prod from dev resources. For example, GCP uses projects to namespace your resources. And you can delete everything in a project in one operation that is impossible to fail by just shutting down the project (no &quot;you can&#x27;t delete x, because y references it&quot; messages).<p>Aggressive billing alerts and events, that delete services when thresholds are met, could be used only in the development namespace. That way, fun little projects can be shut down and prod traffic can be free to use a bit more billing when it needs to.')
