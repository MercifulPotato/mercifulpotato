Item(by='insulanus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609268706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573251, text='zm262, I improvedthe grammar in your comment.<p>&gt; The more likely case is that, there are a bunch of people who are unemployable having no skills or lack motivations to work or happen to be in miserable conditions (like the homeless in US) were forced (yes) to enter this kind of &quot;de-radicalization camps&quot;, monitored (yes) and _given_ an opportunity to get employment (like an internship for students) and get _paid_ the market salary. Yes they were forced to have a job that they can potentially do (the work conditions are like other &quot;normal&quot; apple factory workers). If they decline, well they need to go back to the &quot;school&quot;..<p>Unfortunately, the free flow of uncensored news has made you aware of something I don&#x27;t want you to know.<p>These people are no help to themselves, and do not want to do what the government tells them to do, even though it would be greatly beneficial. They are monitored, of course,  as all radicals should be. The US has no right to complain. After all, they also have useless, dirty homeless people, which are pretty much the same thing.. Furthermore, these prisoners are even paid for their work! What more do they want!?<p>If they decline, they should be sent back to their interment camps.')
