Item(by='Twirrim', descendants=None, kids=[24750868], score=None, time=1602464055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747986, text='As another ex-Amazon... there&#x27;s a whole bunch of NIH going on there too.  The way I saw it, it tended to be split three ways:<p>1) NIH.  Almost always the problems that need solved are interesting, and engineers are naturally chomping at the bit to solve them.  Added bonus you can potentially make a name for yourself.  This happens way more than it should, in cases that don&#x27;t meet the other two ways I saw.  Solving problems that have already been solved very effectively and efficiently, in a mature low friction fashion.<p>2) It doesn&#x27;t scale to needs.  A lot of software just doesn&#x27;t scale to the requirements of the platform.  It&#x27;s hard to understate just how much traffic and work a lot of Amazon infrastructure has to handle.  Most software doesn&#x27;t scale that well because it&#x27;s not run in so big an environment.  We&#x27;re using some well known commercial software at my current employers (because it works, has a good reputation, and did everything we need), that is experiencing major scaling issues because we&#x27;re literally orders of magnitude larger than any of their other customers.  We&#x27;re seeing stuff they&#x27;ve never had to deal with before.  We&#x27;re not even close to Amazon&#x27;s scale for this particular type of software.<p>3) Need to control the entire software stack, have the ability to drastically modify it to meet the changing demands placed on it.  A lot of public software is written to meet one need, and it rarely changes that drastically over time.  That&#x27;s not what the consumers want, even though needs change over time.  Change your software too much and you&#x27;ll lose your existing users that fundamentally need what the software is providing.  You can see the boom and fall of it all with so many projects.  Take a look at what&#x27;s happened with Chef and Puppet, for a quick off-the-top-of-my-head example.')
