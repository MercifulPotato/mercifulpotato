He will always choose a goat. If you switch, you have a 100% chance of losing. (1&#x2F;3) * (1&#x2F;1) = 1&#x2F;3 chance of losing if you switch.<p>Assume you choose a goat (2&#x2F;3). There is a 50% chance that he opens a goat if he chooses randomly. If this happens, there&#x27;s a 100% chance that you win if you switch. (2&#x2F;3) * (1&#x2F;2) * 100% = 1&#x2F;3 chance that you win if you switch.<p>The remaining 1&#x2F;3 chance is voided because we&#x27;ve conditioned the game on him randomly choosing a goat, and not a car. So the probability of winning if you switch is (1&#x2F;3) &#x2F; ((1&#x2F;3) + (1&#x2F;3)) = (1&#x2F;2)<p>exactly 50&#x2F;50.<p>In the traditional monty hall, switching gives a 2&#x2F;3 chance of winning. This is still true in the random variant but only if you&#x27;re allowed to choose the car door in monty opens that one by chance.')
