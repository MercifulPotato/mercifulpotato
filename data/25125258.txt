Yes, it solves <i>that</i> problem, but how is it not also defeating the entire premise? If you had a DNS server from an adversarial network operator, they could just resolve the canary. So it means the browser&#x27;s DoH is only secure if you can trust your network operator&#x27;s DNS, at which point, what was its purpose supposed to be?<p>And the fear is that at some point someone is going to try to &quot;correct&quot; that by removing the check for the canary.')
