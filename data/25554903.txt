The best you can hope for is a library of  stimulating reference works, exploratory processes, personal habits and muses to assist. It has been said with some truth that successful design tends to iterate between broader and highly specific contexts, and utilizes an iterative approach to solutions rather than attempting to successfully anticipate all requirements with one initial design. The author of this piece seems to be using &quot;systems design&quot; as a synonym for the broader perspective design thinking, both at the level of emergent system properties and commercial implications, and while he raises some good points it seems a bit shotgun in focus and the long-form article format a mismatch for the subject matter. I have a library of largely design-related fortunes which I start my terminal with, they are useful to me for design thinking stimulation purposes and are optimized for brevity. Many are derived from books or papers. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;globalcitizen&#x2F;taoup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;globalcitizen&#x2F;taoup</a>')
