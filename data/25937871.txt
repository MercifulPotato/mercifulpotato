One of my favorite aphorisms is:<p>&gt;Don&#x27;t put your faith in revolutions. They always come around again. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re called revolutions.<p>What happened to Georges Danton, the thunderous voice of the early French Revolution? How about Toussaint L&#x27;ouverture, avenger of the New World? Even Simon Bolivar and Manuela Saenz left behind a fractious group of nation-states.<p>The US is kind of an aberration in that regard, but even Ben Franklin cautioned that &quot;the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.&quot;<p>The funny thing is, if you extend that metaphor to big tech companies like FAANGs, then they would be the early revolutionaries who are about to get devoured. And that metaphor would fall apart quickly, because those companies have never professed to be revolutionary harbingers of a new and improved world.')
