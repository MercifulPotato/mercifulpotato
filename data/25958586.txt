GPU bitcoin mining had taken off and GPUs were in high demand, but I don&#x27;t think many people realised GPU compute would take off the way it did: everyone I knew in ML was still using clusters and most of them were using Matlab.<p>Even if you took it for granted that GPU-powered deep learning was the next big thing, it wasn&#x27;t obvious that NVIDIA would be the dominant player. CUDA made GPGPU programming easy at the time, but any other manufacturer could have released something better. It just didn&#x27;t play out that way.<p>Alexnet was 2012 by the way.
