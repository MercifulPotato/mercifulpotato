It&#x27;s super easy now-days to swap in a local lightweight database like sqlite which is 99.9% compatible with your production database, and use this for even tiny unit tests.<p>I actually see it as more &quot;modern&quot; to use an <i>actual database</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve been around long enough to have seen trends going from database -&gt; mocks -&gt; fake -&gt; back to databases again!<p>Mocking is fine for some cases, as are fakes (e.g. lightweight SQLite wrapper you mention), but for anything non-trivial, such solutions often have &quot;blind spots&quot; - such as foreign keys, or unsupported data types. At the same time Docker was becoming a thing, I (and others) were growing tired of seeing issues related to these limitations.<p>At some point, it pays to have integration tests that just hit a real database. And with Docker, you can do that trivially - it takes only a few seconds to spin up and populate a fresh Postgres instance. I haven&#x27;t looked back since.')
