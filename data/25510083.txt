The client ends up with more business functionality which helps in faster rendering, faster response. The application server&#x27;s primary responsibility gets relegated to access control.<p>The other aspect of technology that&#x27;s gradually coming to the fore is real-time communication. This enables even more business logic (in terms of access control) to be pushed to the client. Essentially, as game_the0ry mentioned, the server application gets relegated to a thin CRUD layer. And soon, maybe that CRUD layer will also go away, because the client knows excactly what is allowed and what isnt&#x27;t.<p>As the world gets more bandwidth, more connectivity, clients become more stateful.<p>Conversly, this also proves that business rules are really are not that critical for businesses to function, rather it&#x27;s the data behind them.')
