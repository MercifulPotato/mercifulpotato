Cyclists run stop signs, red lights, etc. all the time.  Pedestrians run out in to traffic from behind parked cars.  If they get hit when they do that it&#x27;s their own fault.<p>What everyone needs to understand in every mixed traffic environment is that sharing the road goes both ways.  Drivers have a responsibility to look out for cyclists, but cyclists have a responsibility to make themselves able to be seen.  Everyone has a responsibility act in a way that allows their actions to be predicted by other users of the road, you never want to be surprising people.<p>If your actions cause someone to have to hit their brakes or make evasive maneuvers and you had a reasonable choice to not do those things, you&#x27;re the one in the wrong even if you&#x27;re legally right.')
