I think we should review all of them and hold those responsible for their actions.<p>However, drone strikes have &quot;collatoral damage&quot; and unintended side effects like this (not saying this makes them good and they should continue) especially when they&#x27;re deployed in areas openly holding people who are in active conflict against people in their own countries and there is military deployed. Again, this doesn&#x27;t make it right.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between that and a lone citizen applying for a marriage VISA, in another country entirely, being kidnapped and murdered due to his writing against the regime. And, due to the nature of the relationship between the US and SA it has been nearly covered up.')
