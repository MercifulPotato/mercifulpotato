I&#x27;m sure there are individuals that have higher &quot;efficiency&quot; but in aggregate all employees are much less productive.<p>Tons of people are saying &quot;oh all that other non-coding stuf stuff is productivity too&quot; but I think they&#x27;re missing the broader context. Sure, Software engineers can write emails and status updates, but it&#x27;s definitely not the most productive use of their time. We could also have engineers serve food at the cafe and empty out the garbage cans, but we don&#x27;t because others can do that. It turns out many of the &quot;work&quot; things that are socially accepted can also be done by others. The one non-code thing I&#x27;m in favor of engineers doing is talking to customers and doing research. Most of that should be done by a PM, but for added context it&#x27;s always useful to get some firsthand experience too.')
