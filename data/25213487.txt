I&#x27;m intrigued that it didn&#x27;t come across, so thank you for the feedback. My app is fundamentally a text chat client like slack -- with markdown support, reactions, channels, DMs, and at some point threads and bots.<p>It just also allows you to speak via audio, and captures that audio inline with the chat, in both audio and text form, which is the key selling point. It is visually and in terms of day to day use very similar to Slack, or IRC. My desire to build heysync is literally borne out of frustration that this featureset is not possible within Slack itself, which I use daily.')
