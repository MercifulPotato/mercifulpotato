Airbnb, Uber, and the like benefited by basically ignoring the law.  People were free to run hotels without any of the oversight or become cab drivers without having the proper insurance.  If something went wrong, the financial and legal liability often rested with some other party besides these companies.<p>That is one of the primary differences between the easy and hard mode categories that were defined here.  Booking.com only had so much inventory because it was operating within the legal definition of travel destinations.  Airbnb invented new inventory by lowering the barrier to entry by giving people the freedom to ignore the law.<p>I am not even necessarily saying that is a bad thing or that these laws were just, but it is clear that lots of laws were broken in Airbnb&#x27;s path to their eventual IPO.')
