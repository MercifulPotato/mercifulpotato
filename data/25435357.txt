Mainstream American liberals are quite conservative by the measure of most developed countries’ political distributions, opposing things that the right wing in European countries generally respects (various welfare floors, universal healthcare, worker protections, etc). Although there’s a lot of blood spilt over narrow identitarian and culture war issues, the distinction between the two group is more that of center right vs. far right.<p>I would say it’s plainly obvious that Hacker News is predominantly center right, reflecting the biases of well-paid professional class workers. Just go lookup a thread about the need for unions in tech to demonstrate this. It will be filled with most blatant right wing canards that would seem absurd to your average European with and experience of unions or the worker protections they provide.')
