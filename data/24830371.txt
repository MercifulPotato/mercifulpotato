Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[24831591], score=None, time=1603137990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830120, text='&quot;Ridiculous&quot; was a joke, taking the fantastical claims about FORTRAN as true (thus it&#x27;s &quot;ridiculous&quot; to imagine the problem going away in a decade when it has already been solved for over 60 years).<p>I first saw this claim 20 years after that (in the late 70s) and have seen it pretty regularly since.<p>FORTRAN <i>did</i> expand the set of people able to write code, but it still required as much rigor as before.  And the claim has always been true in trivial cases: famously secretaries who &quot;couldn&#x27;t program&quot; were writing Emacs macros at MIT in the 70s.  Visicalc and now Excel allow people who don&#x27;t believe they can program to write reasonably complex programs, but it quickly becomes unmanageable, undebuggable spaghetti.<p>IDEs have long been touted as programming-eliminators, but the code they generate has always been brittle and limited, and in the end...can do only trivial things.<p>Sure, at some point many scriptable or programmable objects may be composable by people without training, but we will need human programmers until machines themselves are at least as smart as humans.')
