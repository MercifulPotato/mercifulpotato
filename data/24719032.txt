In fact the number of overdose deaths have increased in Portugal since that policy has been implemented. Another flaw of this policy is that when users don&#x27;t have to spend money on paraphernalia, they will have more money to spend on drugs. So I would say this is not about safety of the consumers, but to protect Portugal&#x27;s healthcare system. It is easier and cheaper to deal with a dead overdosed consumer than a consumer who caught HIV.')
