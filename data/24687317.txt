Item(by='dredmorbius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601902619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24684826, text='&quot;Regulation&quot;, &quot;NIMBYism&quot; and &quot;not a normal market&quot; (it <i>is</i> a typical market, for assets --- the confusion is thinking that housing&#x2F;real estate behave as supply-elastic commodities) generally are behaviours resulting from the dynamics I&#x27;ve described.<p>Of the various corrective measures, a land value tax (tax on the <i>unimproved</i> value of property) is likely the most widely known, understood, and accepted by economists.  Other issues are more difficult to address (see e.g., Mancur Olsen&#x27;s <i>Logic of Collective Action</i>), but also arise and create dysfunctions through economic logic giving rise to pathologies.<p>A reading of Adam Smith&#x27;s sections on prices of various economic products and services suggests a set of differentiable behaviours by types:<p>1. Commodity goods.<p>2. Labour wages and services.  Extended to include pleasantness, skill, training, constancy, success probability, and trust.<p>3. Natural resources (developed further by Ricardo, Grey, and Hotelling, though still fundamentally flawed).<p>4. Returns to stock.<p>5. Rents: monopoly and network services.<p>6. Assets and money (to Smith:  gold and silver).<p>7. Interest.<p>8. Public goods.<p>9. Taxes.<p>Each has distinct behavious, much explained by later concepts of the marginalists and political theorists (class and power), though these are suggested by Smith.<p>There&#x27;s some likely consolidation of these (rents, assets, and interest, say).  Commodity goods follow laws of supply and demand as commonly understood, but only where goods are undifferentiated (no &quot;luxury&quot; branding, monopoly, or lock-in effects).  Many of the others, for confounding reasons, deviate markedly some or much of the time.  Smith was largely addressing these failures under merchantilism and politically-influential monopolists and classes.')
