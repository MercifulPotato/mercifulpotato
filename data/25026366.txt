I&#x27;ve been using Ubooquity instead and it&#x27;s pretty drop-dead simple to use and I like the web-reader more, especially on tablets.<p>1) Start the application<p>2) Tell it where your stuff is<p>3) Wait while it indexes it (it does <i>not</i> replicate your content into a book index just grabs front pages for thumbnails)<p>4) Go to the server address:port with whatever browser.<p>It really works well if you organize your reading material by folders as Ubooquity simply uses that in the application.<p>It works <i>really</i> brilliantly on the kinds of full-page-image books you might find on the Internet Archive.')
