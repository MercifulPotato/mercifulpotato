It still allows you to iterate over an entire collection, however the order is left undefined so that certain performance characteristics can be exposed to the underlying implementation.<p>This is the kind of tool you&#x27;d reach for if you don&#x27;t care about the order of a collection, but you do care about performance, and probably care about the entire collection.<p>For example _pairs_ from Lua, used to iterate over key&#x2F;values in tables, is a random-access iterator.<p>Traversal of the collection is still happening.')
