Closeups. Set replacements, destruction, the works.<p>You don’t have a shot breakdown or camera list.<p>You’ve got 6 months of pre production to support 1000 shots. Once in production you will be the only texture artist supporting 30 TDS.<p>How do you spend your 6 months to make sure production runs smoothly?<p>I’m kinda interested in your experience of this stuff as the numbers you’re quoting for 2k work are, in my experience, waaaaaay off and are closer to how a high end games asset would currently be textured.<p>I don’t disagree with you that the numbers involved are crazy when taken in isolation but it is (or at least was 5 years ago) a very common workflow at ILM, Weta, Dneg, DD, R&amp;H Framestore etc etc. The quoted high numbers are the very upper end but many thousands of assets on hundreds of productions have been textured at what I believe you would consider “insane” detail levels.')
