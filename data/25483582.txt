Item(by='wwweston', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608434679, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483135, text='&gt; There are a few fundamental differences between these languages, but it&#x27;s just plain wrong to say that any of them are not &quot;structured.&quot; Did OP mean &quot;schema-less&quot; instead?<p>I read him as referencing what people would have called &quot;structured programming&quot; in the 1980s, and pointing out that we have these settings&#x2F;metadata&#x2F;control files in languages that have no capacity for &quot;structure&quot; in the sense that, say, Pascal or C would have over BASIC or assembly, that is, thin-to-no factoring or abstraction capacity. Hence the contrast with &quot;Configuration as Code.&quot;<p>Now, depending on your personality and experience, you might find the idea of using a complete language as config an opportunity for someone to do something non-obvious or horrifying, and the closer to the &quot;settings&quot; end of the setting&#x2F;metadata&#x2F;control spectrum you&#x27;re on the more plausible that position is. When you get to a level of complexity that&#x27;s the other end I&#x27;m not so sure and horizontally scaling systems might well be arriving there.')
