I live mostly in the java world, and libraries throwing 3 or so required to catch exceptions are common.<p>I&#x27;d agree that 90pct is doable for your own  algorithmic code.  Glue code for libraries, commonly not very well thought out, requires a very different style.   Defensive up to the paranoid, and catching every gremlin at the source. It&#x27;s not uncommon to have more than half of the code dedocated to exception handling. Dumping said libraries is rarely an option, unfortunately.<p>I&#x27;m not necesarily disagreeing with you, but maybe we live in different code worlds.')
