That&#x27;s how many?<p>While my own anecdotal evidence of our family would corroborate what you&#x27;re saying, the article gives some pretty good anecdotal counter evidence of &quot;the long-term shift to SUVs and pickup trucks doesn&#x27;t help&quot;, which I am definitely seeing with friends and colleagues. There are so many people that don&#x27;t actually know what their car costs them, because all they look for is the weekly payment. Sure, it&#x27;s just a hundred bucks or something. But it&#x27;s per week. Over 96 months. For a used car off a 3 year lease. That is effing expensive!<p>So if we assume that the article is actually based on a much much larger sample I would tend to believe them more than our two anecdata.')
