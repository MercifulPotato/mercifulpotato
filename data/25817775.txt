Why? Perhaps I&#x27;m just a curmudgeon and grouchy old git, but most technical book humour comes across, to me, as puerile, stale, and flat. Case in point? The Little Schemer. I really wanted to like this book, but the insufferably twee cartoons and food-related jokes just annoyed me to the point where I just couldn&#x27;t go on with it. Remember &quot;This space reserved for jelly stains&quot;? Why? Why would you, as someone trying to explain a difficult technical subject, write something like that? So this book has been thrown in the &quot;sell&quot; pile, as I&#x27;ll not bother with it again.<p>The best technical books I&#x27;ve read all have a style that could be called plain, unadorned, and direct. And I believe they&#x27;re much the better for it.')
