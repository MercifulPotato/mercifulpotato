Stallman&#x27;s ideology of free for everyone doesn&#x27;t make sense in the era of big tech.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t dislike commons clause or open core - we aren&#x27;t entitled to anything, and definitions of FOSS are arbitrary and outdated at this point. At least these raise the standards of living for developers, while still allowing us to view &#x2F; modify sources.')
