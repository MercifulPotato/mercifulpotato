First, it only works if you&#x27;re measured day by day and paid day by day. I don&#x27;t get paid daily, I think it&#x27;s most common to be paid bi-weekly.<p>Second, you still wouldn&#x27;t be expected to stay late or leave early - you&#x27;d simply be paid less.<p>There&#x27;s a simple way to set that up. If you performed above the minimum set for you, you wouldn&#x27;t be fired or warned. If you consistently performed at peak productivity, you&#x27;ll get a bonus based on how much you produce.<p>We already do this.<p>&gt;I&#x27;d say its fair to say your results are more important than time but it goes both ways.<p>Why? What does the company gain by having you in your seat for more hours?')
