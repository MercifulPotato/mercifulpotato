Most EU countries exclude illegal immigrants from their universal healthcare systems, for example:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmx.news&#x2F;article&#x2F;article&#x2F;germany-should-pay-illegal-migrants-1-500-in-coronavirus-aid-and-grant-them-amnesty-demands-leftist-party-mps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmx.news&#x2F;article&#x2F;article&#x2F;germany-should-pay-illegal-...</a><p>Giving government benefits to illegal immigrants is a tough issue. On one hand, its rightfully an unpopular policy and risks creating incentives to immigrate illegally. On the other hand, denying benefits risks creating a permanent underclass of people who are prevented from integrating. I tend to believe the best approach is to rigorously enforce immigration restrictions, while including those who the country isn&#x27;t willing to exclude or deport within the welfare system. But these should be viewed as policy choices, not in terms of &quot;hostility&quot; or some such silliness.')
