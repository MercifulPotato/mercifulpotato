Item(by='tomcam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608249177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459240, text='&gt; in some sense she is quite brave.<p>IMHO she&#x27;s an unethical ethicist, rude, and presumptuous at best. She has no idea what kind of depredations may have gone on in the lives of people she calls &quot;privileged&quot;. I look like a typical fat white bald businessguy. I have been thrown into jail unjustly, raped, beaten, kicked out of schools and shunned from my social group for things I didn&#x27;t do and would never do, rejected by multiple girlfriends&#x27; families because I was not in the right minority group, and more.<p>She has no idea what&#x27;s gone on in their lives. They on the other hand appear to be treating her with as much public kindness as she is dishing out hatred (publicly).')
