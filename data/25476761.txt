I enjoy passing my time as much as possible with art (literature, film, music) and travel. As my social circle entered its 30s and 40s, my friends have mainly had children that leave them with little freedom for those things, and they are less willing to &quot;pass the time&quot; with me. While sharing those experiences with other people would be great and all, I still feel that these pastimes are wholly fulfilling if I enjoy them on my own. I feel fortunate to have this personality, it has really helped me get through lockdown.')
