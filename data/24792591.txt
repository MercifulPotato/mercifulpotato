That&#x27;s it.<p>It&#x27;s called market rate because hiring is a market, which is governed by supply and demand. Better negotiating skills can help you distort that market a bit to your advantage, while sub-par negotiating skills will put you at a disadvantage. But it all pivots around market rate, supply and demand, and the minimum cost to prevent you from leaving the company.')
