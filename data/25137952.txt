I&#x27;m pretty sure just getting people to reflect on this stuff would bring huge improvements.<p>On this I agree. And even just putting out a single, simple, effective method, while mentioning there are other ways would be fine. Those that are curious should be able to ask after lecture as to what those ways are.<p>I do resent I was never formally taught any sort of study skills in high school, and I feel this falls under that same banner. But I still stand by my assertion that people shouldn&#x27;t be punished for deviating from a &quot;one true way&quot;, unless those deviations are objectively harmful.')
