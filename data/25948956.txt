They did what &quot;the pros&quot; constantly do, which is pool resources and make moves collectively. That is not &quot;manipulation&quot; in the legal form of the word. Not like shutting down trading, in one direction only, for retail only.\nSince it is individual users on a public forum winning, instead of the guild of hedge fund bros, the power player (Citadel) is forcing the shutdown.<p>Whether or not pumped up stocks are wise is irrelevant. The fact that something that happens constantly gets axed because the wrong people are winning is the issue.')
