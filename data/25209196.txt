Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606312312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209004, text='&gt; Stop putting so damn much sugar and salt into processed food<p>I can&#x27;t express how discouraging this is, at least in the United States.  The high school I graduated from had a well meaning principal that believed milk was good for you and soft drinks were bad for you.  By her reasoning, chocolate milk would at least encourage the students to drink milk, and the benefits of milk would outweigh the costs of having a ton of sugar.  All of the soft drinks were taken out of the vending machines and replaced with &quot;Vitamin Water&quot;.  So our cafeteria was stocked with chocolate milk, orange juice, and vitamin water.  The general public seems to be completely ignorant to why this is a problem.  People I care deeply about are having health problems that I can&#x27;t help but feel would be alleviated if they stopped drinking diet caffeine-free soft drinks as if it were an acceptable substitute for water.')
