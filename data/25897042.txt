As in, in this author&#x27;s conception of class based language, what&#x27;s an example of &quot;straight talk&quot;? How do the elites &quot;babytalk&quot; to the Michael Scott-gentry middle class? Most interestingly, what would &quot;powertalk&quot; be in this conception of class? Would it be raw datasets and financial spreadsheets? Because that seems at odds with the &quot;barbarians&quot; he posits via Church are at the top of the elite ladder. Or are the &quot;barbarians&quot; ruthless state-leaders who only speak in intelligence reports and legal&#x2F;military briefs and those types of documents are &quot;powertalk&quot;?<p>Interesting classifications nonetheless...')
