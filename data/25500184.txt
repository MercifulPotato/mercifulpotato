This is just my opinion.<p>I personally think they <i>will</i> be allowing some production use of free RHEL (assuming we get free RHEL. I expect we will but don&#x27;t want to count chickens before they hatch).  Enterprise production I don&#x27;t know, but personal production or prod for non profits and&#x2F;or open source projects, I could totally see that being an option.  I&#x27;m personally excited for the announcement.  I hope they get it out soon.')
