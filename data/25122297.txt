I don&#x27;t think that view of free will is compatible with agents being non-random consistent beings. For a decision to be mine it must be determined by my memories, preferences, personality, skills, experiences, etc. The decision must be determined by my state, or the decision does not come from me. But if the decision comes from my state, then given my current state I could not do otherwise.<p>To me that&#x27;s just a trivial statement that I am a consistent being with characteristics that persist over time, and that I am responsible for my deliberate, considered actions. If I, this person and my current state, do not determine my actions in a straightforward cause and effect way, how can I be responsible for them? So I certainly hope my actions are determined.')
