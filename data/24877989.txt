It&#x27;s gonna require work. It&#x27;s going to not only be opportunity cost, but require us to do stuff. This is what it means to have climate change as a priority. It&#x27;s a priority above money, above GDP growth, above even the standard of living.<p>It is clear that climate change is an emergency. However, the amount of resources, including money, to address that emergency is finite, so it would be illogical (or even unethical) not to use resources in the most economical way possible.<p>New nuclear power plants have a cost of, for example, \nover 90 Â£ &#x2F; MWh. New solar and wind energy can deliver at less than half that price:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_...</a><p>There is also another motication to build nuclear power plants - they subsidize military use of nuclear weapons. To cite from the article above: &quot;On 12 October 2017, The Guardian reported that researchers informed MPs that the UK government was using the expensive Hinkley Point C project to cross-subsidise the UK military&#x27;s nuclear-related activity by maintaining nuclear skills. The researchers from the University of Sussex, Prof. Andy Stirling and Dr. Phil Johnstone, stated that the costs of the Trident nuclear submarine programme would be prohibitive without &quot;an effective subsidy from electricity consumers to military nuclear infrastructure&quot;.[97]&quot;<p>(The linked reference [97] is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oct&#x2F;12&#x2F;electricity-consumers-to-fund-nuclear-weapons-through-hinkley-point-c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;2017&#x2F;oct&#x2F;12&#x2F;electricity-...</a>)<p>On top of that, such plants, even with very conventional nuclear technology, take more than a decade to build. To address climate change, we need big and radical changes in energy production in the next twenty years. Building new nuclear energy is very clearly too slow to achieve that.<p>So, at that point, using nuclear to address climate change is merely a distraction. There are much better ways to address this problem.')
