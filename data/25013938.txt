I suspect they are often getting paid to develop features for subcontracting and other times they want to &quot;modernize&quot; the toolkit and they just write a new API with additional features. We have seen this during DBus introduction, GSettings, Clutter etc... etc... Plus GTK+ is C plus lots of boil plate code to make it &quot;object oriented&quot; which turns to be even a bigger pain when pure GTK+ apps need to update their APIs to catch up with the latest.<p>But imo this is a general trend on Linux except for the Kernel where Linus and co do a great job to prevent API breakage. The others not so much.')
