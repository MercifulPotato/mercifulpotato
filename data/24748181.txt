I was navigating in an unfamiliar area of SF once and directed to turn right one street before what turned out to be a major street, then make a left turn onto another major street.  The directed left turn was from a stop sign onto a street with poor visibility and cross-traffic not stopping.  If I had gone one street further before the right, there would have been a stoplight.<p>Basically if you have data on the type of an intersection, favoring nearby controlled intersections for difficult turns would probably be helfpul, especially in hilly areas.')
