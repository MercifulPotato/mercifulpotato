It&#x27;s great Assange won, but this ruling is not at all support for freedom of expression. This is the one part the judge agreed with the defense on as far as I can tell:<p>&gt; 363. I find that the mental condition of Mr. Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America.<p>For <i>anyone</i> not suffering from severe mental health problems that want to expose secrets this ruling in scary as hell.')
