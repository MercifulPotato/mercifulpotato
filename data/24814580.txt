It’s possible for a fictional TV show or video game to manipulate you, but it’s harder because you know what  you’re experiencing isn’t real.<p>Social media is more dangerous because it can warp your perception of reality: what is happening in the world, what people think and care about in your neighborhood and your country; what is a scientific fact and what is up for debate; which politician is trustworthy and which isn’t.
