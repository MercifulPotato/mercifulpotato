Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25458159, 25459686], score=None, time=1608226595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25455638, text='Their API is good but I hope they let you configure webhook API versions from their UI or even tie them into the API version used to trigger the webhook because webhooks do not respect the API version you used to call an API endpoint that triggered the webhook at the moment.<p>It will use the API version you defined when you created the webhook endpoint, but the UI to create the webhook endpoint also doesn&#x27;t let you pick a specific API version. It will use their latest API version.<p>It&#x27;s really non-intuitive because it means you have to set webhook endpoints using Stripe&#x27;s API because only then the API version is configurable, but it also makes deploying Stripe API changes kind of complicated because you need to create multiple webhook endpoints in parallel to not throw exceptions due to your code expecting webhooks with different properties based on API differences.<p>I emailed Stripe about this once and support had to forward the request to someone higher up but ultimately my feedback got put into the &quot;Dear valued customer, thanks for the feedback&quot; bucket which means nothing will probably come of it.<p>I wish I knew the technical details on why webhooks aren&#x27;t sent using the same API version that was used to call the API endpoint that triggered it. Stripe engineers are a lot smarter than me and I can&#x27;t imagine they didn&#x27;t think of this already. Is there a technical limitation or downside to this strategy?')
