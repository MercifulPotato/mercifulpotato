It would be an ugly truth that you might have to live with but I hope you don&#x27;t close your eyes to the reality of X because of what that could mean.<p>Sorry for the overuse of X&#x2F;Y abstractions but unfortunately I think if we replaced the specifics in this case it would deter from the point I&#x27;m trying to point out which is if we think about the what outcomes follow a truth and we disagree  with the outcomes (personally invested in arguing against that) then we might choose not to look at the truth.<p>That being said, idk if it&#x27;s accurate to say the judicial system is not fair and very political')
