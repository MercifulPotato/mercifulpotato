And then anything goes.<p>Maybe you also realize the &quot;should of giants&quot; are really the shoulders of men? Capricious and agenda-driven and haphazard, if you care to zoom in with enough resolution.<p>For Christmas I got Freeman Dyson&#x27;s &quot;Disturbing the Universe&quot;. I never realized how poetic the man was. I always admired Dyson for his courage to speak out and his scientific insight, but he makes beautiful connections between poetry and science, Faust and Newton, creativity and sanity, integrity and death (he served in WW2 and died last year). A chillingly honest and humane read.')
