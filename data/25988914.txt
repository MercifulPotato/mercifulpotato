If you are running Druid, Pinot, Hadoop or anything else Big Data they generally have a ZK dependency. If you need service discovery, consensus or config storage ZK is generally great for all of those usecases too.<p>I think if you want a completely standalone distributed log for an application then it could be a good fit but it&#x27;s not going to replace Kafka as the goto for Big Data pipelines because it&#x27;s advantages aren&#x27;t worth it in this context. (i.e you are already running ZK, you are throughput and not latency bound, rest of the ecosystem is JVM anyway, etc)')
