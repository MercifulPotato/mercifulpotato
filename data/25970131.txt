For batteries, I&#x27;d say BattleBorn. They&#x27;re expensive but have a 10 year warranty and are just damn good batteries. Probably among the best you can get. They should easily last 10+ years. Will goes over everything. He tests MANY batteries, panels, inverters, etc., and goes over how to size your system based on your needs and location.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCoj6RxIAQq8kmJme-5dnN0Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UCoj6RxIAQq8kmJme-5dnN0Q</a>')
