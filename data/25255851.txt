From a systemtheoretical point of view, dynamic folding is an abstraction of static folding; solve (i.e. understand the underlying mechanisms) static folding and you can start progressing on dynamic folding, building up on your previously achieved solution.<p>Wether it&#x27;s solved or not depends on wether you mean `general folding` or the `entire spectrum of folding` when considering the problem.')
