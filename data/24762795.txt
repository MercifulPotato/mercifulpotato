I am in the application creation business. Every minute that I even have to think about modifying &#x2F;etc&#x2F;localtime in order to make sure that the instance is running in UTC is a minute I&#x27;m not being productive. Multiply that by those million little things  that you have to do in order to keep even an ec2 instance running, and it&#x27;s such a colossal waste of time and effort. Similarly, I am not in the database tuning business. I plan out my data relationships, create the required Dynamo table or tables, and I never need to worry about replication or backups or any of those ancillary tasks that keep me from being productive.')
