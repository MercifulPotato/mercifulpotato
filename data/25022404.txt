I also wish news wasn&#x27;t so driven by clicks and engagement.<p>I use 3 primary ones.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;</a>\nI find it to a pretty accurate and neutral. Covers most news of the day. I think the AP is a good option for this too but personally prefer Reuters.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectrym.news&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spectrym.news&#x2F;</a>\nThis one I discovered about a year ago and really like it. It&#x27;s an aggregator for lots of different news sites. It groups stories by subject and labels how partisan the outlet is. With it I find I catch some of the political news I might sometimes miss with Reuters and also get a better idea of what kind of news stories people on both extremes of the political spectrum are consuming. I find I can understand their perspectives a lot better when I see the way that it&#x27;s being reported by their news source of choice.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Current_events" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Portal:Current_events</a>\nThis one I added really recently and it has been great! Really boring, clear, and neutral information. I find that it covers most of the news of the day and sums it up as briefly as possible. I&#x27;ve considered making this my only news source but haven&#x27;t pulled the trigger on that yet.<p>It&#x27;s a frustrating problem. I wish there were better ways to stay informed without reading stuff that feels like it&#x27;s designed to make me as mad as possible so I forward the article and drive ad revenue.')
