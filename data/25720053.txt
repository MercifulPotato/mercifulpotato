In many jurisdictions, you are subject to liability if you collect something that was not disclosed in your privacy policy.<p>Therefor, the default is to over-report. If there&#x27;s a chance that something is collected, better to put it into the privacy policy. This is similar to the famous &quot;California Cancer Warning&quot; - the incentives to include everything, no matter the materiality, ultimately render the warnings useless.<p>Any central server will &quot;collect&quot; everything typed into a text box. If it allows registration, requires password verification, perhaps offers customer support, it will disclose collection of &quot;personally identifiable information&quot; including email, phone number, possibly computer-specific information like browser, IP, installed version info, etc. Hosting on Amazon means it&#x27;s shared with a 3rd party. And so on.<p>Also, this seems crazy to the privacy conscious, but many consumers <i>want</i> Facebook integration. They ask for social logins, and easy ways to share via social media. Once those features are enabled to satisfy their users, they&#x27;re subject to all the cruft that comes with those APIs - and need to disclose those in their privacy policies.<p>None of the above means that a site is nefariously using the data it collects. Nor does it mean they do not take privacy very seriously.<p>The interconnectedness of the web, legal requirements, litigious privacy advocates, and overarching privacy regulations (none of which are bad on their own) combine to make the Privacy Policy an almost useless signal of a company&#x27;s actual privacy posture.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s highly unfair to Ecosia for OP to so strongly imply they lie (or are, at best, misleading and hypocritical) and use your data nefariously, simply by excerpting a few lines of the Privacy Policy. The scare quotes, italicized &quot;may&quot;s, rhetorical questions, and other devices written to instill doubt and distrust makes me wonder about the agenda behind the message, frankly.<p>Privacy is extremely important, but so is customer service and a viable business model. Suggesting that any product that collects data to run the business (and properly discloses it, as Ecosia does) will &quot;do so for nefarious purposes&quot; and does not &quot;take user privacy very seriously&quot; (&quot;<i>Right.</i>&quot;) is unfair and undermines the work good people do to craft a viable balance in today&#x27;s difficult tech ecosystem.')
