UK road signs have a very clear and consistent color scheme based on the category of road. E.g., blue background for motorways, green background for A roads.<p>This scheme was (maybe still is) reflected in the color of roads on printed maps. Google Maps also used this scheme some years ago.<p>I understand their reasoning, but the day Google standardized on the current yellow &amp; white scheme was a sad day for this UK Maps user.')
