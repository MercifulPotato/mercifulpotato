It&#x27;s made to appear as if they&#x27;re transparent, but it doesn&#x27;t actually offer you anything of the sort. Additionally, we can read it and find lines like the following:<p>&gt;if and when they are included, are at the discretion of The New York Times Best-Seller List Desk editors based on standards for inclusion that encompass proprietary vetting and audit protocols, corroborative reporting<p>This seems to fit with another quote that a commenter here found for us:<p>&gt;In 1983 (as part of a legal argument) the Times stated that the list is not mathematically objective but rather editorial content.<p>On top of this, there&#x27;s likely to be biases in the information they receive:  It&#x27;s obvious that every large book store in the country (including all digital platforms) doesn&#x27;t report directly to the NYT, and it would be very unlikely for there to be no bias in which stores decide to work with the NYT or not.')
