My soon-to-be manager asked, &quot;What should I order you for a computer?&quot;<p>I responded with, &quot;Whatever you guys buy - Dell, Lenovo. A 14&quot; laptop and an external monitor would be fine.&quot;<p>He torted, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen anyone be productive on a laptop. Nobody here uses laptops. I&#x27;ll get you a desktop with 2 monitors.&quot;<p>After I started, I notice he did almost all of his work from a conference room, using a Surface Book remoted into a desktop in his office.')
