Item(by='tg3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603386571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857145, text='&gt; I really wanted to like OAuth but implementing it is a nightmare!<p>Not only is the spec itself challenging, it leaves enough ambiguity and rough edges that most providers end up extending it some way that makes it hard to standardize. Most commonly: how to get refresh tokens (`offline_access` scope, `access_type=offline` parameter?), and how&#x2F;when they expire (as soon as you get a new one? as soon as you&#x27;ve received 10 new ones? on a set schedule?)<p>And that&#x27;s not to mention how OAuth gets extended to handle organization-wide access. Anyone that&#x27;s dealt with GSuite&#x2F;Workspace Service Accounts or Microsoft Graph Application permissions knows what a pain that is.<p>This is exactly why I built [Xkit](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkit.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkit.co</a>), which abstracts away the complexity of dealing with all the different providers and gives you a single API to retrieve access tokens (or API keys) that are always valid. Not everyone should have to be an OAuth expert to build a 3rd party integration.')
