From The Hindu&#x27;s article:<p>&gt; The app features artistes such as Bhimsen Joshi, Satyasheel Deshpande, Sanjoy Bandopadhyay, Anuradha Kuber and Anupama Bhagwat. “We reached out to artistes who provided us with exclusive songs, some from private baithaks,” he says. Apart from that, he has also reached out to lesser-known artistes. “Most existing platforms chase established artistes, but there is no other platform apart from Youtube and Facebook for these yet new talents to be discovered.”<p>You don&#x27;t have to necessarily pay money. It&#x27;s a subscription app and there&#x27;s a free version that you can enjoy with limited songs.<p>&gt;India being a country of 1300 million people, only 5000+ has downloaded the app means Indians have totally rejected this app.<p>This is quite an absurd conclusion.<p>&gt;Why non of musicians is promoting this app? something is drastically wrong with this app.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong or shady about this product. Marico boss Harsh Mariwala had recommended this app to someone on Twitter. Apart from that, in my opinion, Indian classical music is nothing like your mainstream pop music where you&#x27;d expect the singer to jump and promote their app on instagram or tiktok. Classical music is much more than money or fame.')
