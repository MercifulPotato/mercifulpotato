If my client tells me he&#x27;s guilty, I can&#x27;t say he&#x27;s innocent in court. I cannot call him to give evidence that I know is false or I would be a party to his perjury.&quot;[0]<p>Of course I&#x27;m sure it does happen all the time, but you don&#x27;t need to justify a system where lawyers are lying for the benefit of their client, because that&#x27;s not the system we are meant to have.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;2006&#x2F;jan&#x2F;07&#x2F;workandcareers.careers4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;2006&#x2F;jan&#x2F;07&#x2F;workandcareers...</a>')
