All right, let me be more precise, since multiple people seem to be jumping to the conclusion that I&#x27;m some rabid anti-mask, anti-lockdown, science-hating, Trump-voting neoliberal. I was hoping to contribute fruitfully to the discussion in short form, but seems like I&#x27;ll need more words.<p>The coronavirus pandemic is a terrible natural disaster. We are right to take extreme measures to control it until proper mitigating measures become available, and we are very lucky that it did not happen ten years ago. Our societal surplus thankfully allows us to do the right thing and protect our weak and unlucky, as well as be more precautionary regarding long-term effects than others would have.<p>Reiterating my point -- if we were unable to use modern science and technology to combat the pandemic, the death toll and long-term health effects would be comparable to a minor global war. This would be a catastrophe that would be remembered for generations. It still will, but thankfully writ small.<p>Compared to other historical catastrophes -- the Black Death, the World Wars, five centuries of European warfare, Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward, it would be a mild event, mostly because the death toll would hit the elderly and the weakened hardest. It would be bad, but it would not mean sacrificing a whole generation of our most ambitious young and capable people. It would certainly not be a catastrophe that threatened societies, although political follow-on effects would have lasting impact.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that many authorities around the world have bungled the response terribly, both being ineffective in their measures and causing more economic damage than necessary. But that&#x27;s dangerous territory to discuss, since you risk being branded and shut down with the terms I mentioned above.<p>(For reference, I made a fool of myself in my social circle in early March by suggesting &#x27;extreme&#x27; quarantine measures before any Western governments did. I&#x27;ve been supportive of most science-based measures to slow and contain the pandemic, while at the same time being critical of many authorities&#x27; slow adaption of the best available science -- including lack of early mask recommendations and reluctance to consider aerosol contagion).')
