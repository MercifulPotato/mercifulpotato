They said look at Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Yugoslavia, Germany etc. And the worlds supposedly best economists produced models that legitimize this view, making it dominant in education and discourse.<p>We now gave people basically a UBI, got many people out of poverty with, but all the issues they have been saying would appear and all the false excuses they put on the table have not materialized.<p>Isn’t one very big scandal of 2020 that all of these people have been lying to the population? That we had the tools to fight poverty and create better living conditions all along but deliberately didn’t chose to do so?<p>It appears they just want to bully and abuse people by artificially creating a bad situation and then bully and shame them that the people are in a bad situation.')
