This is obviously only for other European countries, but I bet you could then extradite from such a country to extra-EU jurisdictions simply with political help.<p>So let&#x27;s say person X is wanted in the US. They get Country A to emit a warrant for them, A gets X from France, then extradites X to the US.')
