In ordinary course, such a request is improper. The FAC is plaintiff&#x27;s pleading and, within the bounds of Rule 11, it is free to allege what it wants independent of any stricture defendant wishes to impose.  The court understands, however, that plaintiff has taken discovery and that the FAC is more detailed than an ordinary verified pleading. Given that difference, the court will consider these requests.&quot;<p>The declaration filed by one of Faceook&#x27;s legal staff to support this absurd request gets absolutely skewered.<p>Regulatory officials never seem to get much truth from Facebook, but I have always thought litigation, namely its &quot;side effects&quot;, have the potential to expose truths about Facebook.')
