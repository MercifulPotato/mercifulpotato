At some point it will stop being a business model and start being a self sustaining model of raw power that strips us of our humanity.<p>Calling it &quot;complete control&quot; is absurd hyperbole ans ignores that psychological manipulation isn&#x27;t even remotely new. In fact the goddamned politicians implicitly called upon to ban this are psychological manipulators already. So were televangalists, every theocrat and strongman who suppressed dissent enough that his victims were stockholmed.<p>It cannot strip us of humanity - although it would be a good thing if it could because &quot;humanity&quot; in that context is a collection of bugs exploited for evil.')
