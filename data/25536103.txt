However the question is how much time one spends writing shell scripting code for personal use. If someone already knows Python and only occasionally writes shell scripting code then in my opinion learning a new language only for that purpose isn&#x27;t a good investment. I would say Python is good enough for that tasks.<p>In other words if someone has a good enough tool in their tool-belt for a certain area, then learning another slightly better tool in that area is not a must.<p>In my opinion it is better to be proficient in a one language than mediocre in two similar languages. If someone is bored and has time to learn both Python and Ruby then why not.')
