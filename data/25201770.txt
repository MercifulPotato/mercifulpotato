For me at least, I don&#x27;t care about the ethnicity of the woman I&#x27;m dating especially given that I&#x27;m not the majority ethnicity in the country&#x2F;city so I&#x27;ve always kept an open mind as to who I&#x27;d want to date.<p>Many of my Asian female friends had no trouble finding matches with white&#x2F;black men.

And I&#x27;m not someone who just likes super attractive women I was open to literally anyone ranging from less conventionally attractive profiles.
