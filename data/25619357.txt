Extrajudicial assassinations, the return of open-air slave markets, the deliberate overthrow of middle east governments that created the power vaccuum filled by ISIL, the inadvertant arming of ISIL through the deliberate arming of Jihadists in Syria (which is an ongoing civil war today)...<p>Edit: Just to add. Bush (really Dick Cheyney) expanded the power of the Executive with the approval of Congress. Cheyney is a monster who saw 9&#x2F;11 as a chance to consolidate executive power to the detriment of his rivals and enemies.<p>Obama extended the power of the Executive largely through legal scheming of the DOJ, the courts abdicating their responsibility, labelling everything under the sun as &quot;state secrets&quot;, and ruthlessly destroying the lives of whistleblowers. In fact, when using the secret courts set up by the Bush administration, Obama&#x27;s still violated and exceeded its authority 5% of the time.<p>There&#x27;s clearly one of these that looks more dictatorial than the other and it&#x27;s not the answer most people want.')
