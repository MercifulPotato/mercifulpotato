I park up and go for a walk round the local park then do my shopping.<p>For the rest I use Charge Place Scotland - it&#x27;s a scheme where you pay £20 a year and get free unlimited charging at various locations around Scotland, they do have some separate locations you have to pay, usually for faster charging. Certainly amongst my friends with electric vehicles it&#x27;s a point of pride to never pay for charging beyond that £20.')
