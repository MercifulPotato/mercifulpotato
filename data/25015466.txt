At the same time they invented the Relay client. This client, back then, persisted all Queries at compile time. They never had actual Queries at runtime. It&#x27;s Apollo with their Apollo client who made it popular to not follow this path. The devs at Facebook never said you must use GraphQL their way but I think if you don&#x27;t follow their best practices you&#x27;re kind of on your own. Why not follow their advice? They must have learned this lesson already.')
