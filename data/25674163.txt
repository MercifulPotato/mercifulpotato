Have you seen the videos of Capitol Police removing barriers and leading them into the buildings, or some of them taking selfies with the protestors?<p>Either the Capitol Police are fucking terrible incompetent or they wanted this to happen.<p>BLM rioters burned down a police station in Minneapolis&#x2F;St Paul. They took over 6 square blocks in Seattle and their &quot;community police&quot; shot up a Jeep killing a 14 year old boy and removed all the evidence (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.video&#x2F;videos&#x2F;watch&#x2F;9f81cd38-3ee9-4f26-bd19-44fea7966c27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;battlepenguin.video&#x2F;videos&#x2F;watch&#x2F;9f81cd38-3ee9-4f26-...</a>).<p>These people walked into a public building and everyone is upset because they walked around the sacred halls of the rich and powerful; the house of the people. It was peasants in the castle and we can&#x27;t have that.<p>Was it wrong? absolutely. That&#x27;s why the vast majority of people stayed outside.<p>Oh and a woman was shot by that incompetent Capitol Security force. It&#x27;s okay though because her life didn&#x27;t matter since she&#x27;s white. I&#x27;m pretty sure it was her fault because victim blaming is alright if the victim is a privileged air force veteran and isn&#x27;t an oppressed minority.')
