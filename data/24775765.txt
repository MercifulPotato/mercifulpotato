The turbines’ nearly 10,000-ton cylindrical bases are held in place with three taut mooring cables attached to anchors, which lie on the sea floor.<p>&gt; Currently the electricity they generate is often almost twice as expensive as near-shore wind turbines and three times that of land-based wind turbines.')
