I would rather use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thispersondoesnotexist.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thispersondoesnotexist.com&#x2F;</a> instead. I do not want to expose myself to protect myself. Please think about it, it is absurd. You do not protect your privacy by first giving up privacy by trusting total strangers with your photo. Probably could use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;generated.photos&#x2F;faces" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;generated.photos&#x2F;faces</a> as well.<p>Such an anonymizer. You probably use your IP, you upload a photo of yourself to someone&#x27;s server, and God knows what happens to all this. Just to... anonymize yourself. First step to anonymize yourself: do not upload a photo of yourself to random websites.')
