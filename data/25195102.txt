You don&#x27;t need to invent Facebook on day 1 - start with something small (probably the backend, that&#x27;s the simplest) and add new tools when you find need for them.<p>In the linked post, they mention both Django for the backend and Redis as a cache. Django has caching built-in though, so until you need more complex caching logic, you probably don&#x27;t need to reach for Redis.')
