Part of me wonders if that&#x27;s why both those companies seem more focused on releasing the same games with their decade or so of bug fixes rather than take another stab at the PR gauntlet of managing expectations of an open world game.<p>The crashing bugs in the low end consoles is unacceptable (and Sony and Microsoft are just as much to blame.  You shouldn&#x27;t be able to pass TCRs with crashing bugs, so they knew what was coming and allowed it anyway), but the progression bugs on launch like this is par for the course for the past couple decades of gaming.')
