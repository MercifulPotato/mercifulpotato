We&#x27;re now in that cash poor phase since I seem to love pre-IPO companies :) Was it worth it? To some degree, but at the same time there are some big things on the list that we will probably have to defer for a while now that we have a school-aged child, a pet, etc. All I can say is, do some of those things, and don&#x27;t fixate too badly on sacrificing everything to retire early.
