This is why we have bug bounties, certain kinds of open source - it generally benefits from &#x27;a lot of eyes, and pondering&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s probably something you might try a few versions of and not even make your mind for a bit.<p>The evidence that &#x27;it&#x27;s a big deal&#x27; is in your own response: the solution was screwed up, and Java paid a big price.<p>The fact that anyone &#x27;right or wrong&#x27; was trying to put together a solution and just &#x27;check it in&#x27; frankly is a little frightful.<p>Engineers threatening to quit, and decisions made on the basis of that are comical.<p>If this narrative is authentic, then it seems Java Security Model - and probably a bunch of other things were just &#x27;slammed together&#x27; by a bunch of smart guys passionately working on it, arguing, playing games&#x27; and we&#x27;re lucky to have what we have today I guess.<p>Imagine what we would have if there was some intelligent social deliberation there.')
