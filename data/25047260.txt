Only boots on the ground hold territory. Planes and ships are mostly equivalent.<p>Now, while it&#x27;s very true that the US has many bases in SCS, they are completely untenable without naval power. Indeed, US bases are fundamentally cut off from US productive capabilities. In a serious war, the US won&#x27;t be able to hold Guam if they cannot maintain naval control - Guam will be targeted by a large barrage of missiles, and will then be interdicted in the way we discussed earlier<p>Really, only Okinawa is left as a base, and China vs Okinawa is a win for China.<p>The truth is, the US is fundamentally a naval power. The reason why the US, like Britain before, has so many bases all around the world is because it can maintain naval dominance. Without naval dominance, US ground bases lose significant power - its still possible to supply then via air, but how do you maintain air supremacy after a missile barrage without naval dominance<p>This is evident from the makeup of the PLAAF and PLARF. If you look at most Chinese platforms, you can notice the emphasis on range. Indeed, the Chinese military trains to disable Guam without any naval usage, and without the use of tankers.<p>The US, on the flipside, cannot supply Guam sustainably without the use of naval power.<p>I think that we were living the past 40 years in a kind of military anomaly, where the US basically didn&#x27;t have to care about overextending its supply lines, and the basis of that is unpredecented total naval domination. Without that, the world completely changes, and the advantage of any given theather being close to your mainland increases significantly.<p>Now, of course, while I think China would be able to achieve its strategic objectives, the US is going to inflict incredible amounts of damage before that could be possible, which is why, unless somehow the conflict is forced, I don&#x27;t think they will attempt this until much more than five years.')
