Tribal warfare politics is ugly and uninteresting.<p>Are you religious? Shall I try to talk you out of your faith? Because that&#x27;s what discussing T is to his followers. From my vantage point (and I&#x27;m not alone in this), it&#x27;s both fascinating and horrifying but above all, frustrating, because there&#x27;s no possibility of real dialog.<p>Maybe the reason you don&#x27;t see anything positive about T where you describe is because there isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say in that regard?')
