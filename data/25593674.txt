How do you deal with added complexity and extra error handling of the MQ ?<p>Same question for integrating a new payment processor: with a different API or SDK to integrate, how would that not be the case with a MQ as stated in the article?<p>A MQ is simply a buffer when you need to scale up service consumption. But services with  APIs don&#x27;t need it, they do rate limiting and if they&#x27;re down you should better set the status on your program and stop communicating until it&#x27;s up again.<p>MQs are not automatic and this article is selling false promises and examples.')
