Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610166397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695785, text='The protected classes in Iowa are &quot;race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, religion, or disability&quot; (copied from ยง206.8(a) in the linked PDF). Political viewpoint is <i>not</i> a protected class [1]. It might qualify under &quot;creed,&quot; but the typical definition of creed is generally tied towards religious beliefs rather than political beliefs, so I would not qualify it as such without a court case to back it up with precedent.<p>Of course, that is moot since Trump is a Florida resident who is physically present in DC, and we&#x27;re talking about a service whose contract says you agree all suits will be handled in California, so Iowa does not have personal jurisdiction here.<p>[1] Political belief is not a protected class in most states, actually, including California.')
