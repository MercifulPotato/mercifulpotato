And it wouldn&#x27;t be &#x27;critical&#x27; to make the truck move, it would be a weight optimization.<p>&gt; If my truck are loading&#x2F;unloading they are probably doing it at customer facilities so charging is unlikely to be an option.<p>Lots of companies transport thing between their own facilities and lots of companies have long term costumers. Adding the charging equipment is relativity cheap and could be built to you.<p>&gt;  If they are loading&#x2F;unloading at my facility then I can swap the battery pack at the same time.<p>Go check out how complex these battery swapping robots actually are. Having those at your facility is very costly and need a lot of space. The are prone to break down because they mechanical machines are moving around heavy batteries.<p>Also, so far nobody has even demonstrated this type of battery swap device for a large truck. Current system drop the battery from under the vehicle, this however is not possible in a body-on-frame construction, and a different method would have to be found. Non of the electric truck vendors have announced or even talked about such a system.')
