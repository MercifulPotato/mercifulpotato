Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610040986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673548, text='As of 2:00 PM yesterday, the underlying context that several of his supporters are ready, willing, and able to commit sedition in his name is painfully obvious and to deny it would be willful ignorance. After all, they were in the act of committing it [1]. The statements that Trump made would almost unquestionably meet the Brandenburg v Ohio bar of incitement to &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; given that context, urging his supporters (some of whom, given the context, would be willing to <i>commit a felony</i>) to march to Congress to--I don&#x27;t recall the exact wording--tell them what they think.<p>If Trump gave that speech this morning, with full knowledge of what transpired, you would have a strong case that he incited to &quot;imminent lawless action.&quot; However, that key context isn&#x27;t necessarily present yesterday morning when Trump actually gave his speech. You can make a case that a reasonable person <i>should</i> have known that a portion of the crowd would react in &quot;imminent lawless action&quot; (which would meet the bar). Likely, the courts would have judged that it&#x27;s just &quot;politicians saying things they don&#x27;t mean&quot; and dismissed it on the side of caution. However, the knowledge that imminent lawless action <i>did</i> occur as a result may persuade some people that a reasonable person really <i>should</i> have been able to predict this outcome, and thus that the speech actually meets the bar for incitement. It definitely is not a slam-dunk violation, but the fact that it isn&#x27;t slam-dunk clear <i>really</i> should give you pause.<p>[1] 18 USC ยง2384 is the statutory definition of sedition. The mob yesterday meets all elements: &quot;two or more persons&quot; who &quot;conspire[d]&quot; to &quot;by force&quot; &quot;delay the execution of any law of the United States.&quot; It isn&#x27;t hyperbole to say that their act was sedition, it was literally sedition yesterday.')
