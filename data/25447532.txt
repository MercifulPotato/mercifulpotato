For another, if you&#x27;re only recalling stuff you&#x27;ve done in stressful situations (ahead of looking for new jobs), you&#x27;re doing a disservice to yourself.<p>I&#x27;m guessing, from your referencing of college, that you&#x27;ve been working just enough years for that reference point to still be fresh. But after a while, it&#x27;s less about &quot;tasks completed&quot; and more about &quot;what sort of value do you add?&quot;.<p>Tracking your accomplishments helps crystallize this, to yourself first, and then to others, as you pick and choose to set yourself down the path you want to carve out.')
