There is a huge Hollywood sized grain of salt needed any time you deal with: Hacking, Computers, Internet, etc.. but this movie is EXCELLENT at showing &#x27;Red Team&#x27; activities, social engineering, physical bypasses, and true historical hacking (debugging an IC to see what it does).<p>There is great comedy, action, and intrigue in this film and should be in the top 3 of any nerd movie list.')
