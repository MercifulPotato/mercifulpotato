This tool is for <i>humans</i> to read and edit data. That&#x27;s a different use case from <i>automated programs</i> exchanging data, for which I agree you should be using standardized numeric and boolean data types and not making everything a string. But how that standardized data gets determined from data that humans enter should be up to the individual application.')
