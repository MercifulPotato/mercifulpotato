[â€¦] SPARC M7 ignores the value set in this field and always operates under TSO.<p>GP may have confused SPARC and Alpha, the latter having (in)famously relaxed approach to memory ordering (uniquely reordering even dependent loads e.g. if you load a pointer then read the value at that pointer you may get stale data).')
