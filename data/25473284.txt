You build something, it seems fine, and then a month later it keels over.<p>My tiny disaster was caused by Amazon EFS. They provide a performance quota grace period of a month, during which all tests passed with flying colours. Turns out that EFS rations out IOPS per GB of stored data, and this particular application stored only a few MB at the time, because it was brand new and hadn&#x27;t accumulated anything yet. I had a very angry customer calling up asking me to please explain why they were seeing an average of 0.1 IOPS...<p>From: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;efs&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ug&#x2F;performance.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;efs&#x2F;latest&#x2F;ug&#x2F;performance.html</a><p><i>&quot;The baseline rate is 50 MiB&#x2F;s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB&#x2F;s per GiB of storage).</i><p>AWS now provides a performance floor of 1 MiB&#x2F;s, but at the time there was <i>no floor</i>. If I remember correctly, this application had something like 2 MIB of data, which was constantly being updated by various processes, so there was no quota being accumulated. The system performance went from something like 1 Gbps to 100 bytes per second instantly. It took 10 seconds for a 1 KiB I&#x2F;O to complete. Fun times, fun times...')
