Both legally and in common understanding.\n“Incites violence” is vague and takes the responsibility away from the one conducting violence, and places it on somebody else who may or may not have been promoting violence. It’s usage is not defined legally or in common usage.\n“Barney is the worst dinosaur” could be “inciting violence” if somebody attacked the purple children’s mascot.<p>Should we have to mute ourselves because crazy people might use our words as justification for their madness?\nShould others censor my opinions because in their opinion, a third party might use my words for justification for their madness?')
