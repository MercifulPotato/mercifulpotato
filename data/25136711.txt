It was awesome to have the freedom and I think most young people cherish that moment.<p>I love my family and after my father died my mother and I were forced to live with my grandparents. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but there are generational conflicts that you have to consider. That can get exhausting and my mother was relieved when we got our own apartment even if she loves her parents. We are still near each other and there is no drama in my family. But I don&#x27;t think anyone of us would like to share a house again.<p>I don&#x27;t like the popular cry for abolition of the nuclear family in favor of some comittment-less commune. But the other model to live within a family clan isn&#x27;t attractive either. And you can still handle it as you like, because nobody is forcing you in either direction.')
