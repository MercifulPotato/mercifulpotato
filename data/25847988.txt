That would’ve just been par for the course given how the year up til then had been.<p>The internet was seeing more use than ever, and digital content had become a staple for everyone in isolation. We were all tinkering in different areas of the blockchain space at the time, but met each other at Gitcoin’s KERNEL program.<p>That’s where MintGate was born, from the forges of the KERNEL cohort, came a solution allowing creators to monetize on their terms while giving their fans a way to share in their success.<p>Here’s how it works:<p>A creator uses MintGate to gate some exclusive or behind-the-scenes content. The content can live anywhere on the internet, so you aren’t locked into any single monetization scheme. As long as that content is private, the MintGate link we generate will be the only way to access it.<p>But not just anyone can click through that link to see your content.<p>So who can access it? Anyone who buys, earns, or holds your token. You can create a token in less than a minute and send it to any Twitter account immediately. Only your token holders can access your content.<p>This makes the token as valuable as the content it gates. And you get to decide whether people should buy it, earn it, or simply get it free for being the best fans ever. You monetize your content your way.<p>Gate tokens currently live on Twitter, but we’re adding more social platforms like Twitch, Instagram, and TikTok soon.<p>And if you decide you want to take your token into the crypto wilderness, you can migrate your token onto the blockchain where an entire marketplace of trading and investing is available to you.<p>If not, your token stays safely in your control on social media where it simply acts as a VIP pass to your content.<p>Create your token today, and let me know what you think!<p>For help getting started, visit us on our Discord: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;XqZNxQ6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;XqZNxQ6</a>')
