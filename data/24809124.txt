What I don’t understand is how anyone willfully using Windows can be surprised by this. Anyone with a minor amount of tech knowledge should know this is the way Windows 10 works by now. People who write technical news articles should definitely not be surprised, so I’m assuming they’re feigning surprise for the sake of writing an article about it.<p>What I’m trying to say is, if you use Windows you accept that you’re using a walled garden. If you don’t want to, use Linux, or use both. But what’s the point of driving activism towards change? There’s already options if you care, and it’s not like any of the two models are completely without flaws.')
