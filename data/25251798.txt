Item(by='hohohmm', descendants=None, kids=[25252370, 25252278, 25252286], score=None, time=1606724761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251463, text='Thanks for the information.<p>It&#x27;s nice of you to point out that 4x4 matrix is projective in nature, and I understand that GA could potentially be more performant for its more compact usage of numbers.<p>But to really make it popular and understandable, a &quot;simple&quot; version of GA that handles translation, rotation &amp; non-uniform scaling would really help, without the group thoery concepts, even better, make it in the context of a scene graph hiearchy, with a unified operator like &quot;multiply&quot;.<p>Also is it possible to collapse a series of such transforms in a single versor like you can do with matrices without going into dual quaternion stuff? In generic game developemnt, translation, rotation, and non-uniform scaling are all extremely basic things that cannot be handwaved away or &quot;too big&quot;.<p>Also, why the need o a dual(e12, e02, e01) to represent a point when in vector it&#x27;s just a (e0, e1, e2). This is just counterinuitive. This is what I mean by &quot;quickly gets complicated&quot; and it feels nearly as opaque as cross product in vector math.<p>Just explaining my experience digging in GA for a couple of weeks.')
