I was there to respond to banal questions, age, address, etc. They insisted that she answers those questions instead and yeah - it took them a while to get them in between her screams of agony and pain. I was sent to the “family room” and told not to come back until they call me. My wife really wanted me there, the whole thing was so frustrating. Of course they asked her whether I was abusing her and I sort of understand why but still, I was treated negatively and they assumed the worst. Eventually I was allowed to be present at the birth as we knew the doctor from previous visits but again..')
