If it&#x27;s the wrong grade then it&#x27;s the wrong oil, even if it says it&#x27;s &quot;high performance*&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a casual investor at best. I have some investments as savings through the bank, and use WealthSimple Trade here in Canada. It charges fees. It hasn&#x27;t gone down. I still wouldn&#x27;t trust it for any volatile action as they alert me well in advance that they have a delay of about 15 minutes. I don&#x27;t expect anything more from that. I also wouldn&#x27;t buy anything with the intention of time-critical sells there. If I cared more, I&#x27;d seek using a higher-performing platform. (Also worth noting, they never pinched any buys or sells during this fiasco. What&#x27;s the old adage: &quot;you get what you pay for&quot;. I don&#x27;t see how this situation is any different)')
