In my experience with thousands of servers with 64-512GB of ECC ram, not very many of them will have any ECC reports during use. Usually, everything works fine, but sometimes something will go wrong, and it&#x27;s nice to know.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m not paying the bills. I don&#x27;t have ECC on my home systems, because of added expense, lower performance (no XMP ECC ram when I was shopping), and extra research needed. If a consumer oriented motherboard says it supports ECC, that may mean it lets you use ECC ram, but doesn&#x27;t enable any of the reporting, which would be mostly useless; not completely useless, because used ECC ram from server retirements is sometimes very inexpensive, but it&#x27;s often fully buffered, which is less likely to work in consumer platforms.')
