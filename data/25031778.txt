I&#x27;m neither an expert on GOOD Records&#x27;s past nor seek to defend him in general. These arguments applies generally to the industry as a whole and are hardly limited to just to Kanye himself.<p>The way I came across his statements on the matter was that it was a sort of recent revelation he had. And that it&#x27;s a thing thats out in the wide open, people have been talking about it for a long time, but it&#x27;s still just the way it is. The labels have a ton of power, regardless of the changes in the industry.<p>It&#x27;s reminds me of entrenched businesses exploiting out-of-date regulatory systems. Like trying to apply the old taxi car numbers cap &#x2F; medallion model to Ubers system just doesn&#x27;t make sense at all.<p>The internet changed the music industry even more than taxis. Especially with artists becoming social media &#x27;influencers&#x27; in the process (and almost as a pre-requirement) and more of the power is going back into their hands.<p>So I support anything that gives the artists more control of their masters&#x2F;content, more say in the room about distribution since it&#x27;s not all backroom radio shows and record store deals like it used to be.<p>When you have soundcloud rappers getting famous with zero major label help its just basic logic that the old-school contracts, major parts of which are still apparently being used frequently by the big labels, will need updating.<p>Certain power dynamics have clearly changed.<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer and don&#x27;t have all the answers but it is an opportunity for more decentralized control and wealth going back to the creators and promoters more directly.')
