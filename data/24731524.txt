I think the unspoken, perhaps unrealized, context for this comment is the idea that a company must be predatory to <i>everyone</i> in order to be actually-predatory.<p>A company that is predatory to literally everyone would not survive long. Obviously any predatory company must benefit one or more groups at the expense of others, or else how could they exist?<p>I mean, I think Facebook is terrible, but clearly many people find some benefit, or Facebook wouldn&#x27;t have the billion-plus users they do. I don&#x27;t deny that some people find benefit from Facebook, I just don&#x27;t think that benefit outweighs the cost to society.<p>So Amazon is not predatory to parent commenter. In many ways, they&#x27;re not predatory directly to me, either! I order goods from them at times, I use AWS, and overall I might argue that my life is better with Amazon than without. But my personal experiences aren&#x27;t definitive. In order to benefit me, Amazon, by all reports, is preying on others. Competitors, suppliers, employees, and so on.')
