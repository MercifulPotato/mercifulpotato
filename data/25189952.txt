By making them feel like he was speaking directly to them, many Americans felt like they were given access to a greater level of transparency of government. 50 years later, Reagan and Clinton both still made regular radio addresses, but failed to control their narratives the same way FDR did. Why? Because by that time the farce was up. Most Americans knew that radio wasn’t some intimate conversation between the president and them. There was a greater cynicism about the medium, everyone knew that lying was just as easy over the radio as compared to written statements.<p>Now think about how many assumptions people make about social media. Even forums like Hackernews. You’ve engaged with me, so you probably have made several assumptions about me.<p>1. I’m an actual person and not a bot\n2. I am personally commenting my opinion and not the opinions of someone who has compelled my opinion\n3. I am arguing in good faith\n4. I am a single person, not multiple people with the same account.<p>I’ve made the same assumptions about you. But the funny thing is that NONE of these things is guaranteed to be true. And in some cases it’s not even <i>likely</i> that all of these things are true.<p>Eventually people will stop making these assumptions, and learn to mistrust the Internet to the degree that they probably should.')
