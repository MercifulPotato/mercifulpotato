Unfortunately, millions of immigrant workers who help to build, serve and feed our nation were excluded from the essential coverage and benefits in these bills.</i><p>&gt; <i>Congress is currently at work on a fourth COVID-19 bill, and it is vital this one addresses the needs of our nation’s immigrants. It should lift immigrant restrictions on emergency Medicaid testing and treatment, extend work permits for essential workers under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and temporary protected status programs, provide cash payments and other vital benefits to all taxpayers, and halt immigration policies that elevate risk in our communities.</i><p>I highly doubt that any of the anti-immigrant posters in the H1B thread would agree with <i>any</i> of those benefits being given to immigrants of any status.<p>Though that might seem superficial and only skin deep, however the AFL-CIO has been promoting immigration reform for years[2].<p>Here&#x27;s what they say about immigration on their site[3]:<p>&gt; <i>Since our nation’s founding, immigrants and refugees have enriched the fabric of our communities, our workforce and our labor movement. Like it was for generations of immigrants before, the labor movement is the natural home for new immigrants struggling to achieve economic security and win social justice, and our commitment to building an immigration system that represents the needs and interests of all working people is fierce and unwavering.</i><p>&gt; <i>The only way to stop the race to the bottom in wages and standards is for working people of all races, religions and immigration status to stand together and demand an end to policies that put profits over people. The entire workforce suffers when millions struggle to support their families without a way to speak up on the job, and ramping up fear in our workplaces only serves to increase exploitation. Instead of deporting immigrants, we need to ensure that all working people have rights on the job and are able to exercise them without fear of retaliation. Enacting meaningful immigration reform is critical to our long-term efforts to lift labor standards and empower workers, and the labor movement will continue to stand in solidarity with all working people.</i><p>&gt; <i>America&#x27;s labor movement is never backing down, not an inch, on its commitment to full immigrant rights in this country.” -Tefere Gebre</i><p>&gt; <i>$900B: The amount in lost revenue over 10 years that mass deportation would cost the federal government.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actionnetwork.org&#x2F;letters&#x2F;protect-all-workers-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;actionnetwork.org&#x2F;letters&#x2F;protect-all-workers-3</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aflcio.org&#x2F;resolution&#x2F;labor-movements-principles-comprehensive-immigration-reform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aflcio.org&#x2F;resolution&#x2F;labor-movements-principles-com...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aflcio.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;immigration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aflcio.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;immigration</a>')
