The apolitical superficial knowledge is where wikipedia excels.<p>&gt; I find it frustrating when friends say it&#x27;s unreliable&#x2F;not to be trusted.<p>In terms of depth and breadth of knowledge of topics, it is sorely lacking. And it is highly untrustworthy when it comes to anything remotely political&#x2F;historical&#x2F;economic&#x2F;etc - which are ultimately all political.<p>&gt; Of course it&#x27;s not perfect, but I&#x27;ve learned plenty enough from it to be well worth the trade-off<p>Definitely. It has it&#x27;s uses like everything. But it is extremely flawed.')
