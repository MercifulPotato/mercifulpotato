Simply adding types and omitting CPython types (which results in simpler “basic C” loops and so on) gets 100x speed ups in most situations, and Cython has an annotation mode that highlights CPython bottlenecks to make this very easy and interactive to spot.<p>With numba it can be even more dramatic. Zero code changes, solely type annotation in the decorator, and you can often get 1000x speedup over pure Python, because numba can optimize away many of the extra CPython data model features that tight loop code may occasionally not need to use.')
