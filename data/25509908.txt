I simply do not understand where they&#x27;re finding people who are willing to work &#x27;crunch&#x27; 60 to 75 hour work weeks without overtime to ship a game quicker. There is seemingly a near infinite supply of young, somewhat naive people who can be recruited by video game development studios to do so.<p>I work in a role where there is a real possibility that I might be woken up at 3am by an on-call alert. Or that I might have to work the occasional work week far past 40 hours due to an emergency. But it&#x27;s in service of a critical infrastructure project (carrier-of-carrier ISP backbone links), not a <i>video game</i>. There is no video game on the planet that is so important people can&#x27;t work a normal 40 hour work week.<p>If a video game developer can&#x27;t build, QA and ship a game with a team of people working normal office hours, then in my opinion their priorities are grossly out of whack.<p>I have lost track of the number of instances I have seen of big video game development studios treating their employees in an abusive manner.<p>And yes, I suppose I&#x27;m somewhat of a hypocrite here. I bought a used copy of Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey for $20 on ebay. I bought a copy of Fallout 4 for $18 on the xbox one game store. Am I contributing to the problem? Very likely.')
