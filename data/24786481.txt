Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=[24786655], score=None, time=1602752982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786119, text='&gt; bullshit is easier to make than truth<p>Of course, but truth wins out over the long run.<p>&gt; If normal well researched content had to compete with that, it would loose by being buried under the sheer mass of bot generated bullshit.<p>How do you stay above it all? It&#x27;s not censored now but you seem able to detect it and protect yourself.<p>&gt; A lot of conspiracy theorists aren&#x27;t above threatening violence<p>That is censorship, I&#x27;m not sure how that supports an argument for more free speech? We have laws against assault already.<p>&gt; and law suits (usually libel) against those exposing them or simply posting the truth<p>How could they win? Defamation laws, at least in the US, value truth above other considerations.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s one side being violent<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure what this has to do with a free speech argument?<p>&gt; and disrespectful to the other<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why this is relevant - it&#x27;s not nice but so what?<p>&gt; Sometimes violence comes from both sides of the debate too (ie, US politics) but that doesn&#x27;t make the amount of disrespect by people purposefully lying or spreading lies any better.<p>Violence and disrespect really are completely different ball games, I don&#x27;t see how conflating them clarifies things.<p>&gt; Free speech, as I see it, means that you can express your opinion freely without repercussions unless it&#x27;s advocating for violence against people or groups of people.<p>I agree, that&#x27;s a very good starting point.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re talking about facts, those should not fall under free speech under the simple premise that facts are either provable or you should say that you have no proof or you should expose them as the opinions they are.<p>If you could find someone who can judge such things infallibly then perhaps I would agree.')
