I loved the Chernobyl miniseries for example, but I also think it was maybe 1-2 episodes longer than it needed to be. The first and last couple were amazing, but it kind of lagged in the middle.<p>I&#x27;m reading Dune now (no spoilers please!) and I&#x27;m really surprised they&#x27;re making a movie rather than a miniseries.')
