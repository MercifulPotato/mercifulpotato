The thing that would make cars a good example would be if cars were shown to exhibit a steady increase in essential complexity.  In that case, yes, we might point to them and say, &quot;Maybe the situation for software is the same, and we&#x27;re mistaken to have any unreasonable expectations to the contrary?&quot;  But that doesn&#x27;t match reality.  Car manufacturers are as guilty as software developers of producing things that have gotten steadily complex without good engineering reasons to justify the complexification.<p>(Pre-emptive request: please do not respond to this comment as if I&#x27;m arguing that cars have not become safer or more fuel efficient.)')
