I think the lot of us are about to find we&#x27;re not much more than highly skilled mechanics.<p>Edit:<p>On reading all the comments that came after mine, I realize I&#x27;ll have a decision to make Q1 2021 when my role at my current startup becomes financially unwise to maintain (slow growth on a popular product in a very niche industry). Im a co-founder but still it will make more financial sense to put the tech product in Maintenance Mode for awhile with some offshore contractors. All the hard work has been done save for riding out the slow Change The Industry adoption curve.<p>When this day comes I&#x27;ll be back on the market myself and in considering all this I think Im going to target large F500 companies who&#x27;s core business isn&#x27;t tech or internet or whatever.

The pain around getting the offer may not be the worst part - the worst part may be after you accept and actually have to work there. Fairly simple logic might indicate that if the dating phase is this bad, the marriage can&#x27;t be much better.')
