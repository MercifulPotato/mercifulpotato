Item(by='m12k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602124105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707305, text='When you pick a door, there&#x27;s three possible scenarios: A) You picked the car door B) You picked a goat door C) You picked the other goat door. All three are equally likely. But in B and C, the host only has one goat door available to open (because you already picked the other goat door) so since he has to show you a goat, he is effectively forced to tell you where the car is, since that must be the third door that has neither been picked nor opened yet - and switching doors is how you act on that information to get the car. It&#x27;s only in scenario A that he gets a choice of which of the two doors to open. So there&#x27;s a 2&#x2F;3rds chance that he&#x27;s telling you exactly where the car is, so you&#x27;re better off acting on that info by switching.')
