Author here.<p>I created nFreezer initially for my needs, because when doing remote backups (especially on servers on which we never have physical access), it&#x27;s hard to 100% trust the destination server.<p>Being curious: how do you usually do remote backups of your important files?<p>--&gt; With usual solutions, even if you use SSH&#x2F;SFTP and an encrypted partition on destination, there will be a short time during which the data will be unencrypted on the remote server, just before being written to disk and before arriving to the encrypted filesystem layer.<p>Thus this software nFreezer: the data is <i>never</i> decrypted on the remote server.<p>How do you work with this?')
