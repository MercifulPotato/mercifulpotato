Beating the indexes by 5-6 points consistently is very good, but it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that most equities were doing really well over that period.<p>ALSO: If the numbers quoted for Melvin are before fees, it&#x27;s entirely possible that it underperformed the Nasdaq 100 over that period.<p>Either way, the money currently in there is very likely to underperform the indexes over the next 5 years (because they need to return 100% to get back to the pre-GME position).')
