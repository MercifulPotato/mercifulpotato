Beating the indexes by 5-6 points consistently is very good, but it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that most equities were doing really well over that period.<p>(Edit: It&#x27;s been reported elsewhere that these numbers are net of fees. However, it&#x27;s entirely possible that for taxable accounts, tax considerations still narrow the performance gap. And of course, the QQQ offers instant liquidity and did not drop 53% this month.)<p>Either way, the money currently in there is very likely to underperform the indexes over the next 5 years (because they need to return 100% to get back to the pre-GME position).')
