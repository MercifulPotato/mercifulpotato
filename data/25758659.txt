It&#x27;s a question of whether the expectation is reasonable<p>That’s a made up point, though. The AWS contract makes no mention of “reasonable effort” or anything like that.<p>Yes, it is worthwhile to compare moderation on Parler to that of FB etc, but it has no bearing on whether Amazon had the right to terminate Parler’s contract, which they absolutely did. Within the context of that discussion the comparison to FB and Twitter is just whataboutism. They aren’t Parler and they aren’t hosted by AWS.')
