That makes sense.<p>It seems there are perhaps three(?) options that come up:<p>1) Constrain big tech via regulation (thereby in some sense transferring the power to regulators&#x2F;government, with the hope that it would in turn be influenced by democratic processes)<p>2) Or, directly influence big tech behaviour through boycotts and other consumer action.<p>3) Or, break up big tech forcibly or again through consumer action to switch to alternatives, thereby diffusing this power.<p>And you prefer 3.
