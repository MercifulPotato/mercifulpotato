In general, you should have proper SPF, DKIM and DMARC entries in your DNS config, DMARC especially will make it easy to learn if anyone classifies your mails as SPAM.<p>Of course the transactional mailing providers want to scare you into thinking it&#x27;s not possible to just deliver mail yourself. That might be true if you operate at a large scale, but for most B2B SaaS apps it&#x27;s completely fine to send the mails yourself.')
