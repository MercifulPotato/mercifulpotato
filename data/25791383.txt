The worst of the new wave of robberies we call “humiliation robberies” (förnedringsrån, you can search with Google Translate) where the victim (mostly natives) is not only forced to withdraw from the ATM, but tortured, forced to undress, pissed upon, forced to say humiliating things, or raped (also men and boys).<p>The last of many examples to make headlines, where the perpetrators were found, was two young guys in Solna who were forced onto a church yard at night where they were beaten, raped, tortured and robbed. Mainstream media in Sweden does not publish details so I’ll link you one mainstream media article, and one independent blogger - again you might want to use a translation service to read it<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petterssonsblogg.se&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;ali-och-amin-doms-for-tortyr-och-valdtakt-pa-kyrkogard&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petterssonsblogg.se&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;07&#x2F;ali-och-amin-doms-for...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.expressen.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;solna-man-misshandlade-pa-kyrkogard&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.expressen.se&#x2F;nyheter&#x2F;solna-man-misshandlade-pa-k...</a><p>Young Swedes today know where not to walk after dark in a way their parents never thought about.<p>If my personal account, the example, or a search into “förnedringsrån” isn’t what you’re looking for, please let me know!
