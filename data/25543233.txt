We all used flex+yacc and a simplified ASM that was interpreted by some educational software which name I cant remember. The project for the year was to implement a basic compiler language: included if&#x2F;for loops, function calls, recursivity ... basic stuff but enough as starting point to build something.<p>Trying to get into LLVM, Id love to find an example done in flex+yacc vs the same done in LLVM.')
