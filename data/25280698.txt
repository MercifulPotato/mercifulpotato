(Cis) (2005). Retracing the Aurochs â€“ History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. Sofia-Moscow: Pensoft Publishers. ISBN 954-642-235-5] claims that the main predators were big cats (lions and tigers) and hyenas). Across much of the cows modern range those predators don&#x27;t exist.<p>Possibly a wolf, Siberian tiger or large brown bear would predate a cow, similiar to the predators of a moose but it doesn&#x27;t seem like they are under constant fear of predators any more. Cows are often left to pasture across vast unfenced area of basically wilderness and don&#x27;t seem particularly afraid nor at risk of predation (otherwise they&#x27;d need to be guarded).')
