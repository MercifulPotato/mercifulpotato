He was absolutely convinced that HCQ helps in moderate Covid cases, with near-immediately observable effects.<p>Thia still puzzles me, presumably he understands things like placebo effect and double-blind studies intuitively, and yet studies show no improvement.<p>On a similar note, the WHO recommendation against the use of Remdesivir is widely criticised by doctors in Poland, as based on a poorly-thought-through study. The claim is that Remdesivir helps patients only at certain stages of the disease, whereas the WHO study doesn&#x27;t differentiate between such stages.<p>On the one hand, there&#x27;s people who use the drug day-in-day-out, on the other a huge organisation which I&#x27;d think can do good-quality science. I remain confused.')
