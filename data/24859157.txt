I can always see a stealthy spy plane when standing next to it in a hangar.  But it&#x27;s purpose is to fly high above the ground.<p>If heat signatures are a sure way to identify space ships, then the value of stealth comes in at the limit of detection range.  If an enemy can only detect me at X units away, but I can detect him at X+1 units, I have an advantage.<p>If I&#x27;m spouting nonsense, I&#x27;d be legitimately delighted to hear why it can&#x27;t work.')
