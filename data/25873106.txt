But isn&#x27;t there a point where someone can act like a nazi to the degree that it becomes dishonest to not call them a nazi?<p>When trump repeatedly lies about the election being stolen, is it really that far-fetched to make that comparison?<p>I can fully understand that you dislike that people on the internet compare trump supporters to isis supporters, but using that to make the both sides are the same argument is really farfetched.<p>America has some serious problems, and it&#x27;s democracy is really flawed, but it is still a democracy.
