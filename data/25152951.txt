It is still not their content.  They will not pay contributors for content.<p>As someone who has been using the web since 1993 I can assure anyone reading that there would still be widepspread video sharing on the internet even if no company such as YouTube existed that tried to monetise the phenomenon.  Consumers pay dearly for internet connectivity and bandwidth, many of them enjoy playing around with the internet for fun and they will use the network for all manner of data sharing, including video, even in the absence of advertisers and their service partners (who are usurping a significant portion of that user-financed bandwidth).<p>Google may not be running a tax-exempt charity for the benefit of consumers, however they are running a corporate welfare program for over 75,000 people.  (Nevermind the amount the corporation pays in tax.)  This will change if and when profits start to drop.<p>With respect to this announcement, it appears Google won&#x27;t share the proceeds from ad sales unless the YouTube contributor&#x27;s video meets a certain threshhold of traffic, enough to be in the so-called &quot;Partner Program&quot;.  Many video contributors will receive nothing despite their viewers having to suffer though pre-roll and other ads interrupting their &quot;user experience&quot;.  In a way this reminds me of domain name registrars such as GoDaddy that place ads at domain names that customers fail to renew, i.e., &quot;parking&quot;.<p>I absolutely agree with this comment though.  Changes such as this are evolutionary pressure that may lead us to a better internet, one that is less commercially driven by advertising under the fiction of &quot;free&quot;.  No matter how large these websites, excuse me, &quot;platforms&quot;, have become I still believe the web and the internet are meant to be non-commercial and user-driven.  As the network has grown, most users are not corporations.<p>Add more straw.  Break the camel&#x27;s back.  What comes in the aftermath will surely be better.')
