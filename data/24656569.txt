What if a B&amp;W photo shows someone with white hair, but his hair was blonde.  Now the colorized photo is more accurate than the B&amp;W photo.  I just don&#x27;t think you can claim B&amp;W is more accurate absolutely.<p>&gt; If that person is wearing an air force uniform and you colourise it to look more like an army uniform<p>Do you understand that the typical consumer of this media cannot tell the difference between air force, and army uniforms from 100 years ago?  Get people interested in history, then worry about the little details like the color of someone&#x27;s hair or uniform.<p>Get out of your ivory tower and into the real world.  Most people&#x27;s knowledge of history is abysmal.  History is boring, as it is taught in schools today.')
