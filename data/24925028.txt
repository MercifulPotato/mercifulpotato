You should find a way to help the girls already in the club to recruit friends.<p>Another angle would be to remove your assumptions from this. Survey other girls who aren&#x27;t participating and find out <i>why</i> they didn&#x27;t join. Is it because they didn&#x27;t hear about it? Other activities they&#x27;re already doing? Disinterest in the subject?<p>I do suspect this question will ignite a cultural flame war on HN, as it is certainly possible that there are no gender barriers for that club other than genuine disinterest.')
