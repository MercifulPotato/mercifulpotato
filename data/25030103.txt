Some promising developer gets infatuated with Apple&#x27;s supposed ease of use and looks at the shiny aggregate numbers like $155 billion paid out to developers. Said developer jumps through all the hoops and builds a great app. Users love it, but since competition in the app store is insane, the developer barely makes back his&#x2F;her initial investment. Then Apple changes the APIs and rules, the app becomes unusable and&#x2F;or expensive to maintain and over time the developer burns out and gives up. Thus, there&#x27;s now an opening for the next promising developer to start building an app.<p>As long as Apple doesn&#x27;t run out of new developers happy to join the App Store, they can treat their 3rd party &quot;partners&quot; as badly as they want. It&#x27;s kind of the same power dynamic that makes sure that hair saloons all over the world treat their employees badly.')
