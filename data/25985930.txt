They want to see the game applied fairly, such that when the bets go sour, they go bankrupt and don&#x27;t get bailed out like in 2008. In the 2015 CHF forex crisis, many brokers went bankrupt overnight. That&#x27;s what should happen to Melvin, and to anyone who takes the stupid risky bets that don&#x27;t work out.<p>Hedge funds mostly invest client money, not their own.
