Item(by='saghm', descendants=None, kids=[25887795], score=None, time=1611425501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884321, text='&gt; No, the bullshit copout is showing that you are available when you are not, to give the illusion that you are working<p>I think you&#x27;re ascribing a bit too much intention to what most people just ignore as the default setting on an application. I&#x27;ve never once touched my slack status settings, and I leave a slack tab open in my browser while I work, so I assume it probably shows me as online all the time when I&#x27;m working; I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the only person like this. It never even occurred to me until reading your comment that this could somehow be interpreted as a signal that I would always be able to respond immediately to a slack message. If people started assuming that I would be able to respond immediately whenever slack showed me as offline, I would probably just configure it to show me as offline 24&#x2F;7 (even at times when I am online). Keeping a slack tab open is just a way for me to save time from having to reopen it every time I _do_ actually want to check it (the website often takes several seconds to load), not some way to send a signal to my coworkers.')
