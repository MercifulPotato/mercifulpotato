Most likely, from what I can see, we will simply change our expectations â€“ it is impossible to build a completely secure software system, so we should instead change how we use it&#x2F;what we expect it to do.</i><p>Hardening systems further would hopefully make breaches more difficult and less common, but never prevent them entirely, therefore we should instead start focusing security efforts on limiting the blast-radius of potential damage a breach can cause, resilience of organizations in the face of breaches, and mitigation and recovery from breaches.<p>There is probably a need&#x2F;niche for a security equivalent to Netflix&#x27;s Chaos Monkey that randomly breaches your own systems in order to encourage&#x2F;enforce that resilience, mitigation and recovery.')
