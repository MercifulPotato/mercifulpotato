That&#x27;s already mostly been done. If you continue with that solution you&#x27;ll have the same problem in reverseâ€”assuming X support ever gets removed from the toolkits, then in that situation you&#x27;ll get Wayland apps that depend on some Wayland functionality that doesn&#x27;t work. See what I mean?<p>(IMO we&#x27;re pretty far off from X support being removed if it ever even happens, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about that right now)<p>And I actually don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal that there are separate implementations. You can absolutely still write programs that do these things, and people do. Usually you start with targeting just one implementation and then you port it to the others. All you need is an API to abstract the custom protocols. A lot of those differences are already abstracted in the portals API which has those three separate implementations so you may not even need to do any porting if that fits. Worst case, if something isn&#x27;t in the portals API then you have some three clause switch statements when you make protocol requests. Then after you stabilize it, move those switch statements into a library and then other people can use it as an abstraction layer, and nobody needs to write the switch statements again. Yeah it&#x27;s work, but for an app developer it&#x27;s actually easier to do that than getting all the upstreams to standardize everything.')
