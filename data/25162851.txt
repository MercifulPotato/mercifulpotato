Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25162972, 25162858], score=None, time=1605894246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162498, text='&gt; This is roughly equivalent to the 5-digit DNDC option, which currently costs $3.56 - maybe slightly more because I don&#x27;t know the exact details of how China delivers to the US.<p>China the country does that, but that cost is not borne by the shipper in China.  The shipper in China just drops the item off at their post office.<p>But regardless, China then pays the US $1.90 to deliver that package for them.  You will not find any service available to a US mailer that is only $1.90.')
