I bought one 4 years ago.  Not having to rely on delivery services has been a game changer.  When my dishwasher broke and delivery was 3 weeks out I just went to the warehouse and picked it up that day.  When my hot water heater died and the plumber was a no show 3 days in a row (for which I had to take time off work each day) I finally just bought one myself at the hardware store and with the help of YouTube installed it myself for probably $1000 less anyway.  I never thought I needed a pickup but I find it helpful once a month for some task: Hauling a server rack that was donated to a non-profit, dump runs, building a tree house for the kids, towing a tractor, etc.  As an added bonus the higher ground clearance means I can get out before the snow plow comes.')
