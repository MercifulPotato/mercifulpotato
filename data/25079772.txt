I thought you were making the case for a binary distinction. I thought it was clear that I believe it is a spectrum when I started calling it fuzzy (introduced in my second comment and reinforced thereafter). I certainly think this continuum is essential to the nuance of the discussion.<p>As for Liebniz, I don&#x27;t think anything I&#x27;ve said is inconsistent with his beliefs. According to Liebniz, if an actor only has one or a small limited set of available options then they are not free (spontaneity). In the case of your dog, it depends highly upon you for its own basic needs: food, water, shelter. It also depends on you for its higher needs: companionship and a sense of purpose (or role). Because of this I do not think Liebniz would consider your dog free. It does not have much of a choice. But if we are talking about the spectrum, well your dog does have a choice to run away and attempt to survive on its own. We know it wouldn&#x27;t make it far, but it might not know that (about things like the pound, leash laws, or human civilization norms). But the dog does have some freedom because you do give it some reign. Probably moreso than the member of the cult.<p>Similarly I&#x27;d say that you are more free than your dog. You can go on vacations and travel. You can eat different food and you can choose what food. It may be influenced by others, but that is different than dictated. But still you are beholden to having a job and living in society which does limit some sense of freedom. Similarly this story is about questioning who is more free by presenting the Huxleyesk lifestyle. In A Brave New World people are able to have all their desires, so why do we not consider them free?')
