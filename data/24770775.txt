Apart from the higher price (199EUR&#x2F;year), it probably also is a good laternative to userTrack for those who can afford it.<p>Personally I tried the Matomo demo ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.matomo.org&#x2F;index.php?module=CoreHome&amp;action=index&amp;idSite=62&amp;period=day&amp;date=yesterday" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.matomo.org&#x2F;index.php?module=CoreHome&amp;action=ind...</a> ) and I was not really impressed by the usability or loading times of the platform, it feels a bit oudated and somewhat complex&#x2F;hard to use in the same way GA is when it comes to more unexperienced web users. Their platform is really mature and has a big ecosystem, but this might also be its weakness.')
