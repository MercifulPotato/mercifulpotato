Granted, for open-office plans it generally makes people feel like they can talk loudly because it&#x27;s a space full of people and that&#x27;s what you do in such spaces. But it&#x27;s still the distraction (and noise), not the space itself. The ease of moving around is not available if you put walls everywhere. But that &#x27;problem&#x27; isn&#x27;t really seen as problematic, so the comparison becomes &quot;loud office vs. quiet office&quot; instead of &quot;distracting but roamable office vs. silo&#x27;ed office&quot;. At that point we are of course trying to value one person&#x27;s wish to roam as much as another person&#x27;s wish to not be distracted.')
