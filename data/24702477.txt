Someone said that midwesterners are nice to people if they are white. Downthread you share that part of the reason you left the south is because of discrimination you experienced and I think you were pointing out that it was odd that people jumped in to defend the south.<p>It seems reasonable that people would try to more accurately describe the south and share their experiences as well.<p>Saying people are triggered seems to belittle their input. If I want more input I don’t call you triggered for feeling compelled to share info.<p>This is totally different if you think that there actually is some higher level of discrimination in the south or midwest or wherever. But I don’t think your anecdote isn’t really that helpful for tarring or exonerating a region. Despite how true or honest it may be.')
