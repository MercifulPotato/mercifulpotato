All the techniques developed by this university rely on cooperating malware on <i>both sides</i> of the airgap (and a pretty small air gap for many of them).<p>All you need to do is make sure the super AI is air-gapped in such a way that it can&#x27;t broadcast signals in a way that they can be <i>accidentally</i> interpreted as valid data, and especially not with enough bandwidth to do damage before someone notices. RF is your biggest threat here, you wouldn&#x27;t want the super AI to actually figure out a way to register on the mobile network using incidental EMI (which these researchers didn&#x27;t do, this is well beyond the level of this paper, if it&#x27;s possible at all); a Faraday cage should do it.<p>The biggest threat of a super AI is that, assuming you let humans interact with it, it&#x27;s going to convince a human to let it out, knowingly or not. Human brains are a much bigger vulnerability than any of this airgap stuff.')
