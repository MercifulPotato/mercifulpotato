Getting a SWE position was very easy (and many ex-gamedevs do it and are very successful at FAANG; many of them consider new jobs boring, but not toxic like gamedev, no crunch, a few times larger salaries, stability...), but any inquiries about anything research related to recruiter were met with &quot;you don&#x27;t have a PhD? we will not even interview you for such a position&quot;.<p>My &quot;way in&quot; was to just accept a generic offer and then later switch team to work inside Research (when you don&#x27;t need to pass N layers of &quot;recruiter abstraction&quot; and can talk with colleagues and present your past work freely it becomes much easier). But still, among my collaborators maybe 5% don&#x27;t have a PhD?<p>All of this was a surprise to me and made me question my life path and life choices. I&#x27;m originally from Poland in Eastern Europe and the only reason to consider a CS PhD would be if you wanted to teach. And I even considered it, but never occurred to me to do it for any kind of R&amp;D work - mostly because of quality of Polish academic &quot;research&quot; being very low, much worse than the industry.\nAnd I am still in lots of self-doubt and questioning if I belong in this environment. Questions like &quot;who was your advisor &#x2F; what was your grad group?&quot; when introducing yourself to new people become almost micro-aggressions. Also my focus on R&amp;D (&quot;solving unsolved problems&quot;) is very different than academic incentives (&quot;use PhD interns to do projects, then write papers and get citations&quot;).')
