A dentist prescribed me opiates (two different kinds but I can&#x27;t remember what) for wisdom tooth removal. I filled the prescription in case I needed them but ibuprofen ended up being fine.<p>Later my psychiatrist retired so I needed to find a new one. The new psychiatrist interrogated me about my use of opiates. He asked if I had taken opiates before. I answered no because I hadn&#x27;t. This was his gleeful gotcha moment where he pulls up my prescription history to find the opiate prescription and accuse me of lying about drug abuse.<p>It was a university health system and he was pushing a new medication on me. That same day I found out the manufacturer of the drug he wanted to put me on had made a $10 million donation to the university. I guess he was going to try to get me to feel like a drug abuser and like I have no choice but to take this new medication?<p>Anyway, he was successful at making me feel like I was a drug abuser so I just left and stopped taking psychiatric medications altogether. I probably didn&#x27;t need them. Also you can be labeled a seeker even if you fill the prescription instead of going back to get it.')
