So I often encounter wild specimens that are even older than Debian oldstable.<p>Right now, I&#x27;ve got a bunch of CentOS 6 servers with 2.6.32 kernels that are freshly out of support this month. I was hoping to replace them with 8, but now I&#x27;ll probably have to settle for 7. At least I can take consolation in the fact that I haven&#x27;t been called in to troubleshoot any CentOS 5 servers lately.')
