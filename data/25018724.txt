He had no history in political office, and he lost the popular vote to just about the worst candidate the Democrats could have put up. Had the Democrats put up <i>anyone</i> who was less divisive than Hillary Clinton then we are not where we are today.<p>Likewise this time around, nobody I have talked to seriously voted for Joe Biden on his own merits. They voted for him because he&#x27;s not Donald Trump. I have had people tell me they don&#x27;t care if there is fraud and cheating, it&#x27;s worth it if Trump is defeated. Put up someone with more genuine appeal and you not only get the &quot;anyone but Trump&quot; vote but you get enough undecided votes that there isn&#x27;t any room for questioning the result.<p>We need better candidates who generate real support and appeal other than just not being their opponent. Not sure how to get there.')
