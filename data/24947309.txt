That is not something a good studio does. Sure, they don&#x27;t have experience with the PC, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse the buggy release, and I&#x27;ll dare call their testing for PC garbage if it let those kinds of bugs through.<p>&gt;Also, a lot of these kind of games are also highly driven by art style. Which is really hard to capture in automated test suites. Add to that the complexity of a 3D world and all its interactions and associated math.<p>To be honest I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start testing the art stuff, but the crashes should be doable automatically relatively easily.')
