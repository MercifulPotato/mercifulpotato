I tried this on its own homepage. I didn’t find it a whole lot easier (I was asked to choose photos with boats in them), but it was a little more easier than the blurry photos on reCAPTCHA.<p>What I didn’t like: when I looked for pricing information, I saw that there’s a free tier and there’s a “Contact Sales” tier (for enterprise). There is no intermediate level if you want finer control and just want to know how much that could cost. If anyone from hCaptcha is reading this, I’d strongly recommend adding one or two more tiers or expanding the feature set of the current free tier, at least for some level of granular control.')
