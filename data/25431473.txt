I find it to be more convincing than reading the paper. It’s a doctor at Harvard who has witnessed the remission of very serious textbook schizophrenia after administration of a ketogenic diet. If you can trust anyone’s judgement, you can trust his. He swears by it. He also wrote an article in psychology today about it.<p>The ketogenic diet has many side effects and it can be very harsh. Because of this, I found myself going on and off of it frequently in the beginning. My psychotic symptoms, just as described by that doctor, came and went in perfect correlation with whether or not I was in ketosis. I would wake up in the middle of the night multiple times, getting just one or two hours of sleep. This is a textbook aspect of psychotic disorders. Then when I was in ketosis I would get a full nights sleep like a baby. It could not have been the placebo affect. There was nothing else that correlated with the changes in my symptoms. There was no ambiguity, it was extremely obvious.<p>Putting all of that together, I think it’s quite convincing.')
