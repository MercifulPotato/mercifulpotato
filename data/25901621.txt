One was due to drunk driving. The other two, I&#x27;m not privy to the full details. It could have been, but statistically I would suppose not; most are human error, I&#x27;d presume.<p>I&#x27;d further suppose that simply put, it&#x27;s easier to stop 400 deaths due to a failure to regulate than it is to change the driving habits of citizens, and that&#x27;s why --even if one is 100x worse-- it doesn&#x27;t draw the attention, and it makes me feel like my loss doesn&#x27;t matter, even though others are far more likely to experience the loss I did, rather than the main post subject, and I will admit that shaped my view entering the discussion.')
