The fundamental problem with taxation is that governments are even worse than individual billionaires like Jeff Bezos at choosing what to do with large amounts of money.<p>Another possible remedy is to reduce the power of governments, so there is less value to be captured by influencing them. IIRC pg recommended this fix in one of his (fairly early) essays.<p><i>&gt; We won&#x27;t know what&#x27;s possible until we stop letting barons write the laws.</i><p>If you think taxation stops this from happening, I have some sad news for you.')
