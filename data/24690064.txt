I feel like that article is making a bit of strawman argument from the get go by talking about 1-3% failure rate from the backend. If I had a system that flaky, I’d be taking a good hard look at myself before blaming anything on my optimistic UI :-)<p>There are other things to consider too. Like for example network failures vs backend failures. In the case of network failures you can actually notify users <i>before</i> they even try to take an action. So now you’re down to some diminishing case where your code is effectively wrong (maybe the client is too old), and again there are more elegant ways of handling that. Also, I bet you have the response back really quickly to make a call on it.<p>Having a worked on unstable networks I can say that there are parts of slack’s implementation that suck - like if you try to change a message that hasn’t synced yet, they get into broken states with the edit. But that’s not the fault of optimistic UI, it’s other technical choices at play.<p>I know you haven’t named a horse in this race, but I feel  people hating on Slack for having an optimistic UI are a bit off base. Considering that I’ve sent (apparently) 2.5k slack messages in the last 30 days and I don’t recall any going wrong, I think they’ve got it right.')
