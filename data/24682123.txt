In many fields, different notations or finding eg some graph structure, may reveal interesting aspects of the underlying structure of something (eg why do we write permutations with cycle notation not permutation notation? Eg Conway’s notation for knots).<p>Also there are issues with the lambda calculus notation using letters for variables: whenever you do a substitution you may need to rename some variables if their meaning would change. I think this can be confusing to people and is perhaps an annoying thing to have in your notation.')
