Of course there is. The fact that, for something that has a very, very small invariant mass, it might be practically difficult does not change the fundamental principle.<p>Also note that the reason it was difficult, for example, to tell whether neutrinos have mass or not is that we can&#x27;t just do the obvious and straightforward thing and find an inertial frame in which they are at rest (by, for example, taking a rocket and accelerating it in the direction of a neutrino to see if we can bring it to rest relative to the rocket). So we have to resort to indirect methods. But, again, that&#x27;s a practical limitation that doesn&#x27;t change the fundamental principle.')
