I don&#x27;t believe I deserve any of the contempt I&#x27;ve gotten over the years and I absolutely see the contempt with which I am treated as something that actively closes doors in my face and is not a consequence of my &quot;failure&quot; to contribute or something.<p>Below is something of an explanation as to why I don&#x27;t think I deserve contempt. It is not a rant, though I imagine it will be interpreted as such by some people. I&#x27;m always damned if I do and damned if I don&#x27;t here.<p>I appear to be the only openly female member to have ever spent time on the leader board of HN (under a different handle). It&#x27;s 100 names but it isn&#x27;t a stable list, so there have been more than 100 people on it over the years.<p>If my data is accurate -- and I believe it is -- that means less than one percent of those names is an openly female member and I&#x27;m it. That puts me in a &quot;league of my own.&quot;<p>For comparison purposes: I believe six percent of CEOs in the US are female and 17 percent of senior personnel (in the &quot;C suite&quot;) are female. Yet I am routinely told it is somehow my fault I don&#x27;t fit in here, my fault I am treated so badly, my fault I am poor, sexism&#x2F;classism&#x2F;etc are not a factor in my intractable poverty, etc. ad nauseum.<p>Just to be crystal clear: I am not talking trash about HN. I spend so much time here because this forum is so much better than other forums.<p>The problem is not HN. The problem is far larger than HN and this means you can&#x27;t escape it anywhere, not even on HN which is generally a bastion of virtue in my eyes.<p>And before someone leaps up with the oh-so-tired accusation that I am obsessed with meaningless, worthless internet points and having a lot of karma here means nothing: It used to be pretty common on HN for men to say to other men here &quot;You must be smart and competent because you have so much karma on HN!&quot; That seems to have died down a good bit since I began pointing out that men do that here to other men and then do nothing but malign me any time I talk about how much karma I have to try to support some point or other I am trying to make.<p>In some sense, I don&#x27;t care about karma points here. I use it as an easily referenced proxy for other things that are even harder to talk about in other ways.<p>Upvotes suggest I am deemed to be someone who &quot;adds value&quot; here. Yet no amount of adding value here comes back to me as significant professional respect, traction and -- critically -- <i>income</i>. Meanwhile, some of the men on the leader board are self-made millionaires and, in at least some cases, they got wealthy in part due to using HN to network and make professional contacts, something I very much wanted to use HN for but it has mostly been a bust for me.<p>I also don&#x27;t care to see someone jump up and volunteer that they, also, have not managed to use HN to network or make money so &quot;obviously&quot; it&#x27;s not my gender (or some other trait of mine). &quot;Stuff just happens.&quot;<p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve heard it all before. It really doesn&#x27;t hold water.<p>Not everyone uses HN that way, but some people do so successfully. It has actively been a goal of mine and I seem to make nearly zero headway on such goals.')
