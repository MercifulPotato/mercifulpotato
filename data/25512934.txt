Most of his git commits are related to V and he has been actively working on it for a couple of years, even over weekends. V may fail like many new languages, but at least the dev has paid the efforts. He has my respect.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;medvednikov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;medvednikov</a>')
