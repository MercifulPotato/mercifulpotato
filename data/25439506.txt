Item(by='least', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608097602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439442, text='&gt; The fact that you give money to people you know rather than to nonprofits suggests that your motives are not as purely altruistic as you&#x27;d like them to be.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really have to be altruistic. There&#x27;s certainly nothing in what he said that suggests he is doing it simply due to altruism, either. He has more than he needs and injects the excess into things he cares about (specifically, people he knows)<p>&gt; A good nonprofit is massively more effective per dollar, able to literally save multiple lives for the 5K you gave to your acquaintance.<p>The goal wasn&#x27;t to save lives, but to give someone they know money to help them find reliable transportation to get to job interviews. I&#x27;d reckon a nonprofit would not be able to ever perform the same service for that person, so you&#x27;re kind of off base when  you say they&#x27;re massively more effective per dollar - they aren&#x27;t helping people like his acquaintance.<p>&gt; But don&#x27;t get so high and mighty on it that you denigrate the vastly more important work that MacKenzie Bezos is doing.<p>In what way is her work vastly more important than what he is doing? Him saying he didn&#x27;t find the donations impressive in comparison to her wealth doesn&#x27;t say anything about her not doing good.')
