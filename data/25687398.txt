You can beat any friends who just happen to know the rules, but are at the very bottom tier of people who play regularly.<p>Saying that one is a 1400 player would be like someone who goes on a 5km jog around the neighborhood once or twice a week talking up their running ability. Sure, it&#x27;s nice to be in slighty-above-average shape, but it&#x27;s not really notable.')
