He immigrated from Mexico and was a migrant farmworker as a kid. He picked tomatoes in a field near 8 Mile Road in Lodi. Traveling from one town to the next picking crops.<p>One day in 1972, Hernandez&#x27;s father made sure his son watched the Apollo 17 mission. To see it clearly, Hernandez was tasked with holding the antenna to get a good picture on the tv.\n[..]\nBut, his father gave him a more important lesson one day in the family car after a day of hard work. He wanted his son to think about the difficulties of life in the fields versus getting an education.<p>&quot;He said I&#x27;m not going to force you to go to school, much less get good grades,&quot; said Hernandez. &quot;But if you&#x27;re wondering what your future is like without an education he said welcome to your future.&quot;[..]<p>In 1997, he co-developed the first, full-field digital mammography imaging system for early detection of breast cancer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He says this is his greatest accomplishment.<p>&quot;I know it has saved thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of lives,&quot; Hernandez said.[..]<p>This is the power of education. Ag robotics luddites reject automation because it would deprive jobs.<p>They fret. “What would happen to jobs!!”<p>“What would poor people do to support themselves?”<p>Well. They would get an education and do higher paying jobs suitable for humans. I don’t think any farm worker who is a parent wants their child to become a farm labourer.<p>It’s time to change Ag. And relieve people from the yoke of manual labour for minimum wage.')
