Also, AWS.<p>AWS uses the crud out of open source. They admittedly &quot;steal&quot; it in that they fork it internally, applying patches, add UI, and then sell it. They still depend highly on basically all the open source software in the world.<p>That Amazon does this is a rallying call for new licensing schemes. Large monopolistic companies such as Amazon need to be legally shut out of this type of abuse of open source software. So long as we go &quot;It&#x27;s fine. You have to allow this to truly embrace open source&quot; then we will continue to see Amazon try to shut down all &quot;open core companies&quot; that they can by outright stealing their IP.<p>Open source is not developed primarily by hobbyists or aficionados. Most open source imo comes from closed source projects being open sourced by companies in order to gain free testing, free work ( contributions ), and more market share ( exposure &#x2F; interest )<p>Heralding the death of open-source seems like nonsense just to grab attention. I agree that the large companies are trying to crush open-core companies that are small, but it is obvious they are doing this and there will be a backlash from those of us who don&#x27;t appreciate their meddling.')
