The article is about a three year trend in drug overdoses. Covid-19 is not mentioned anywhere else: just a half-sentence insinuation that it is relevant, one that couldn&#x27;t be evidenced - not even with one quote from any single medical professional (if it could be, it would be).<p>Why is Covid-19 in the headline? Only so that exactly this happens. That&#x27;s the clickbait; you fell for it.')
