This is not a deal breaker, but a significant annoyance.<p>* Major features are still lacking. E.g. No support for quantization (afaik), which for me is fundamental.<p>* Most importantly there seem to be no major community around it.<p>It feels a bit bad to say that, because clearly a lot of work went into this project, and some people have to start adopting it to drive the momentum, but from an egoistical point of view, I just don&#x27;t have the courage to deal with all the mess that comes with introducing an experimental layer in my workflow. Especially in ML where stuff can still appear to &quot;work&quot; (as in, not crashing) despite major bugs in the underlying code, leading to days or week of lost work before realizing where the issue is.')
