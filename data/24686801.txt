That would allow not only detecting, but also correcting bitrot.\nI assume that&#x27;s what Raid6 does, albeit less granular than per file, and more aimed at recovering a full file than a few bits?<p>Can anyone point me to a FS that supports it, or to the reason it&#x27;s not done?<p>As for ZFS, I think I&#x27;ll keep avoiding it until it is mainlined.
