I saw probably 8 or 10 inside school and a handful more after school at designated spots over 4 years in high school.<p>It was a suspension offense but no police or record was involved.<p>I won&#x27;t go into details about my involvement in any school fights, but there were 2 incidents with tormentors at new schools that were quickly resolved and I lived in peace thereafter nor do I regret my actions. Besides I was like 8 and 11 years old at those times.<p>I don&#x27;t think those &quot;rougher&quot; times were good and I&#x27;m glad there is less of that now. Still (and this might be personal bias), I can&#x27;t help feeling like we lost something in the sense there is a fundamental underlying biological reality and people are shocked when they find out it actually exists underneath everything and people are more balanced if they learn this at an emotional level early.<p>I think these are the conditions we evolved under (constant threat of violence and need to deal with it) so even though it&#x27;s not good and people got hurt and killed needlessly, we are somewhat adapted to that and changing the circumstances makes us a bit neurotic. Or something along those lines.')
