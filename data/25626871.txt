So you don&#x27;t have to leave the building and can just unblock the tap and refill your cup. The concrete &quot;piping&quot; is still there today. I&#x27;d say that feature alone makes it amazing.<p>Also the complex system of elevators and trap doors it had below the fake stage floor is more complex than any broadway stage today. Granted the stage floor has not survived, but plenty of the under-the-floor mechanisms are still there.')
