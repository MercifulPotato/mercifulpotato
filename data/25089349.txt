The complex issue with SaaS for big co is getting them to demonstrate a good business continuity plan and actually execute tests (your primary building was destroyed ... you own another building with connectivity , hardware just sitting around on ice ready to go right ? )\nYou have key man dependencies please asses that every 6 months and hire 35 people to cover that 1 KMD and show us your working on how you assess this. \nIf your SaaS is so killer &#x2F; think it’s a big competitive advantage big co will help you set all this up and guide you to an extent. But in this case this is your first big co and they will make sure your time is totally consumed by our mountain of lawyers , procurement officers, security , it , operations.... but at the same time finance want to check your books to make sure we are not your single customer and that you have a history of making money , check the key peoples backgrounds for any history of fiscal malaise , conflicts of interest blah blah blah.<p>The worst is when. We deal with the vendor negotiate a price the procurement people who have no idea about what it is their purchasing have a kpi on saving big co x % off every piece of paper that passes their desk so they go in at the last mile after pretty much everything is set and pull your pants down (don’t forget to leave fat for this )<p>And good luck.')
