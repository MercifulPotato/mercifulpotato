We shouldn&#x27;t forget how much time and effort fighting this kind of thing takes, and we are very lucky to have an organization who&#x27;s willing to put in the legwork from which all of us are huge beneficiaries. (<i>Edit: just donated.</i>)<p>I guess it was implied by the article, but wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear to me: does this mean that .org just stays with its current holders, ISOC? (Internet Society)<p>As much as ICANN and Ethos Capital acted maliciously in this whole debacle, it&#x27;s very possible that the most malicious actor of all was ISOC. In 2002 they were granted the management of a public good (the .org registry), with the idea that they&#x27;d administrate it responsibly and fairly. In return, they were well compensated as they managed .org registrations over all these years, which is more or less a license to print money.<p>However, it&#x27;s obvious with this attempted sales that ISOC never considered themselves to be a higher-minded steward doing anything for the greater good. To them, .org was an asset to be pumped and dumped at the first, best offer that came along. They were well aware that Ethos had plans to turn .org into a major profit center with a captive audience of all existing .org holders, to the detriment of tens of thousands of non-profits (and many others) worldwide, and enthusiastically agreed to the plan anyway. It was money in their pocket, and the money was good.<p>What would it take for the ICANN to claw back the .org registry and grant it to a more ethical caretaker? (CCOR for example [1].) It seems to me that &quot;easy come, easy go&quot; is a perfect ethos for this situation, and the ISOC shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to take another dime from .org.<p>---<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ccor.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ccor.org&#x2F;</a>')
