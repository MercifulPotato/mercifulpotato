When was the last time Google provided meaningful customer support without the customer getting some attention on Twitter&#x2F;HN? Amazon is getting mega-lazy with their shipping practices; damaged goods are pretty normal. Meanwhile Facebook keeps shoving services you don&#x27;t want in your face (Reels), pushing algorithmic feeds to the detriment of the user&#x27;s mental health, and collecting information on you whether you consent or not.
