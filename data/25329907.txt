It&#x27;s a matter of whether you know what&#x27;s happening underneath or not.  The more you try to make C completely safe, the more you slow it down and therefore remove the need to have written it in C in the first place.  Whether that&#x27;s a good thing or not is an exercise for the implementer.')
