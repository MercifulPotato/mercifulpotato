Item(by='smichel17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603293049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831605, text='&gt; I wonder if it can be solved with UX?<p>I saw a HN comment the other day, talking about the problem of popular servers in the fediverse blocking polarizing servers. It proposed a solution at the client level: make it easy to switch between identities on different servers. My addition: UX along the lines of Firefox multi-account containers, where you can have multiple tabs (here: conversations&#x2F;rooms) with different identities open alongside each other, rather than having to switch profiles.<p>I think making it easier to participate in other communities without losing access to the large one, should the large one stop federating, is a good strategy for encouraging users to vote with their feet. Otherwise, it&#x27;s hard to justify losing access to the large community, just to enable interaction with a small one.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this solution squares against combating abuse, though; encouraging multiple accounts might make this harder.')
