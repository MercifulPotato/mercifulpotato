Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605175036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25062991, text='&gt; is it a coincidence they met through online dating, or was it the cause of finding someone<p>Do you mean like... Given enough time they&#x27;d have married someone offline as well?<p>I think some of them that are more socially active offline probably, but some I could see easily going a long time without. There&#x27;s a lot of people who have really small social circles without any new face coming into it ever. And they don&#x27;t have the motivation or personality to go and seek it out in real life, but do if it&#x27;s behind a screen at home in their pijamas.<p>While back there was a stigma a bit around online dating too, which I think has gone away now.')
