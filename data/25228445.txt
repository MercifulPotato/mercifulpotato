Question from me would be, were these the  values he attributes to his business success, or discoveries after enlightenment and actualization?<p>Follow up essays, &quot;how to prevail on others when you&#x27;ve thought for yourself,&quot; and &quot;how to leverage other thinkers who just don&#x27;t fit,&quot; would be extra interesting.<p>There is a significant element of &quot;Foxes and Hedgehogs,&quot; in this, and what I talk about to business clients as &quot;indoors cats and outdoors cats,&quot; as well.<p>I like that this essay brings to mind what it means to &quot;en-courage,&quot; or to give courage-to someone. It&#x27;s not flattery or justification, it is meant to genuinely imbue people with courage.')
