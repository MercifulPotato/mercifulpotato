I’m absolutely pro vaccine and I have all my vaccines up to date.<p>But they’re vaccines that have been around for decades and for which we understand the side and long term effects pretty well.<p>I don’t feel very comfortable getting an injection developed in such a short time, for which we don’t really know the long term effects, using a completely new way of immunizing (I don’t think there are any other mRNA vaccines in use?)... and apparently the vaccine maker isn’t comfortable either if they’re looking for total liability exemption.')
