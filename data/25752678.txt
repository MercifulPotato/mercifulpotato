Or at least that&#x27;s one way to describe it, though it might also equally describe other things.<p>&gt; so how does screen do that?<p>It&#x27;s screen&#x27;s native model.<p>&#x27;C-a |&#x27; (split -v) splits side-by-side and &#x27;C-a S&#x27; (split) splits top-and-bottom.  Screen calls these &quot;regions&quot;. &#x27;C-a X&#x27; (remove) will remove the current region, letting the sibling take the entire space again.  &#x27;C-a Q&#x27; (only) will replace the entire layout with the current region.  &#x27;C-a tab&#x27; (focus) will jump to the next region (it can take directional arguments to move up, down, left, and right, as well as &#x27;prev&#x27; to go the opposite way of &#x27;next&#x27;, but these are not bound by default).<p>What tmux users would normally think of as window changing commands just switch the current region in the layout between viewing the entire pool of running commands.')
