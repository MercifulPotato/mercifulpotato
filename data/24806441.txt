I started to use it for basic text editing and for coding, just so I could practice and not feel dumb when I needed it (far too often) on a production box. I also avoided too much customization for this reason too.<p>Still use vim for as much as I can. The language is too rich, and there’s a lot of muscle memory I’ve built up.
