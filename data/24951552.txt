In theory, the role of government is to promote the will of the people, similar to the way you are describing - those unhappy people should be contacting their representatives and organizing their community.<p>Take for example school safety. There are a number of suggestions about this topic, but we&#x27;ll take the two big ones. One side wants armed guards in schools. Another side wants to remove armed guards from schools and create new gun control laws (specifics of the suggested laws vary). The goal of both sides is to make schools safer, but they have opposing views on how to do that. This is also an issue that can&#x27;t be solved without government authority (passing gun control laws or allowing armed guards in schools).')
