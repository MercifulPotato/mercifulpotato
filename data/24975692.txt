After founding one main LLC for $300, you can then created an unlimited number of LLCs under it, each with their own debts, liabilities and obligations which cannot be enforced against another series, or the original founding LLC as a whole.<p>If one series LLC gets ensnared in a legal dispute, the others can continue operating as usual.<p>You can probably guess where I&#x27;m going with this. The idea is a tech company can use this new structure to put each microservice into its own LLC and basically operate as its own company that communicates with others through a rich API and formal company communications.<p>Whats useful about this is you can use it to get around GDPR and other 21st century issues. Microservice LLCs could basically launder data among themselves, buying and selling it, and using creative hollywood style accounting. When a service gets sued for some privacy violation and threatened with a fine, it could shut down and go out of business and be replaced by a new LLC that rises mysteriously from no where. It then becomes increasingly expensive to pursue litigation. Every time you get close to levying a fine or getting justice, the target evaporates and is replaced by entirely new companies with a whole new corporate structure.')
