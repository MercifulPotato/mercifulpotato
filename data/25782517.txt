It takes up to 2 days before new youtube videos show up if you search for a video. Example a mcdonalds burned down in my city a few weeks ago so I searched for videos and photos. It did not find any videos only photos and articles. Google found a few videos including once on a dutch news website.<p>If I <i>know</i> that I am searching a YouTube video, I usually search directly on youtube.com. I use Firefox search keywords for this, I just type &quot;yt Rick Astley Never&quot; in my top bar and instantly see the results. Pretty sure Chromium et al. should have something similar...')
