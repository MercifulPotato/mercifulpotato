As of January this year, cargo and cruise ships can only use low sulfur fuels. This alone already invalidates 95% of the information out there about how pollution-intensive cruise ships are.<p>Are they still carbon-intensive? Kinda. Nowhere near as bad as flying, but worse than passenger vehicles and trains. But if we want a fair comparison, shouldn&#x27;t we also throw in the hotels and restaurants and theme parks that they replace? Because if you get rid of the cruise ships, you haven&#x27;t really gotten rid of the problem, just moved it around a little bit.')
