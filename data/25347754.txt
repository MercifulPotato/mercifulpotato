As a kid I grew up thinking that only peanut butter could cause allergic reactions. Now I know someone who has fatal reactions to dairy products, another with fatal reactions to eggs, and others with less severe reactions to mint, coconut, mango, latex, spermicide (imagine the circumstances where you discover that one)...<p>The bottom line is, if someone tells you they have an allergy to something weird, just take their word for it.')
