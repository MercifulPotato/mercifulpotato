It&#x27;s a purely mechanical computer, which means it is going to be very simple in abstract design, because doing anything even mildly complex would require an insane amount of space.<p>I can&#x27;t find design documents for this, but I can make a pretty educated guess about its design.<p>Each square has two relays, representing the number of left turns necessary to exit the square.  Each time a whisker touches a wall, a signal is sent to a mechanical adder which will add 1 to the relays in the space.  When the mouse enters a square, a &quot;register&quot; is set with a value, based on if it entered from the left, top, right, or bottom, then the mouse is turned and the register decremented until it hit 0, then the mouse attempts to walk in the indicated direction.<p>The maze ends up looking something like this:<p><pre><code>    +-----+\n    |0|1 1|\n    +-- - +\n    |1 3|0|\n    + --- +\n    |1 3|x|\n    +-- --+\n</code></pre>\nWhere the mice starts on x and turns the number of times in each square.  You can actually put the mouse down anywhere and it will exit the maze, if the walls are left unchanged.')
