Or maybe they just need a little help, such as automated reminders to get them to check for those mistakes.<p>Sadly, there are people who will not learn from either kindness and teaching, or harshness and harrassment. In the workplace, you can make an appeal to the manager, but perhaps only after discussion with coworker has failed to produce the desired results.')
