I don&#x27;t need to go to a bank, and I can send money to friends around the world without worrying about currency controls or other bullshit. It can be both. It can be one or the other. If you don&#x27;t care about these things, that&#x27;s cool. But this is a drum that&#x27;s been beaten for years... not sure how useful continual discussion of skepticism of something that&#x27;s been around for 13 years and seems to be working as expected...<p>I personally like the idea of a unit of exchange, investment vehicle, and store of value that isn&#x27;t exclusively backed by America&#x27;s fleet of destroyers and aircraft carriers and trillion dollar war-machines, and that isn&#x27;t forever devalued due to inflation. Given that a single BTC is divisible into 0.00000001 satoshis, maybe one day a BTC will be worth $100,000,000 USD per BTC. Probably not, but it&#x27;s not entirely speculative.<p>You can buy many things with BTC. People choose not to because they expect it to rise in value. People spend dollars because they either have to, or because they want to put it into cashflow generating assets.<p>The dollar has lost 7% of its value in the past year because of ongoing emergency measures by the Fed. This is great for aggregate asset inflation, but is terrible for anyone&#x27;s savings.<p>Arguing about bitcoin&#x27;s utility after the last year&#x27;s monetary policy is a little funny to me.')
