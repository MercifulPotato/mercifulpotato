The ultimate reason I 100% switched to Free OSs was because I couldn&#x27;t stand software crashing at random points in time anymore. With Windows (especially 98 like in the article) anything can crash, during boot, Explorer, Word, the Desktop, and in the past it did. Maybe part of the reason Free OSs did better at this is that they did solve things differently and didn&#x27;t implement every single feature. That said, Free OSs offer other features: focus follows mouse, configurable window behavior, virtual screens etc. I think this is why I will never be able to use Windows again because it feels just too constrained.<p>Nowadays I use macOS for Desktop though but only because they make such nice hardware. It&#x27;s only a question of time until I either install Linux or get a new Laptop with Linux.')
