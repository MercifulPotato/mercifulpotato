Will the police issue a moving violation to the driver even if the car messes up?  If so, is there case law or precedent for how one fights the ticket?  Will car manufacturers provide a service that proves the car was driving and why it performed what actions in a way that a traffic court will understand?  Will the driver accept all liability for decisions made by the car?  If the car causes enough moving violations for the drivers license to be suspended, will the driver be allowed to sit in the back seat as a passenger once cars reach the point where a driver is not legally required?')
