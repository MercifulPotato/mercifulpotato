Entire industries that will no longer be able to recover if this lasts &gt; another 6 months (and it likely will). Travel, leisure, festivals, conferences, hospitality, and all of their supply chain as well as infrastructure providers (for instance: air plane manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers) will be hard hit. This will cause a recession that it will be very hard to rebound from.')
