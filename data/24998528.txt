Apparently Doom had rather chatty netcode as well, meaning that LANs of the era could easily get bogged down if there were even two people online fragging it up.<p>Game netcode got better, and so did network infrastructure, so in time this ban got lifted. Though part of me thinks that they couldn&#x27;t actually enforce this ban without punishing half the school. Doom was that popular... at least until Quake came out.')
