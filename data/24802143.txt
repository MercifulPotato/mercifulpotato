I don&#x27;t think secularism can provide a strong enough motivation channeled into something productive. It can evoke strong emotion, but it usually ends with days of rage and such. Religion and belief in deity has pretty much always provided that (and even then there are lots of examples of that not working). I don&#x27;t think we are going to buck the lessons of thousands of years of human history and find some kind of &quot;enlightened secularism&quot; that hasn&#x27;t worked before.')
