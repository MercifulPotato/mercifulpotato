I would agree that you can&#x27;t pivot a company like Microsoft to a high-risk strategy with uncertain payoff; their existing shareholders would rebel. But if you have this strategy from the start then you only acquire shareholders who are fine with this kind of strategy, and I don&#x27;t see why that shouldn&#x27;t work out.')
