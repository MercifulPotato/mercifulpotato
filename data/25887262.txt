Calm down, would you ?<p>&gt; Your messaging habit of sending each message fragment as a new notification is the most annoying. 5 messages to communicate one thought?<p>Not 5 messages to send one thought.<p>3 different messages (each message being one full sentence) to send three distinct points that led to a fourth message being a conclusion.<p>&gt; You have no respect for other people or their attention<p>That&#x27;s a very broad statement about me based on a single specific instance of an event. Don&#x27;t do that.<p>In a fucking semi-formal heated whatsapp conversation with 5 other people messaging back and forth ? Give me a break. It doesn&#x27;t change anything to the flow.<p>Either he was reading and participating or he was not. If he was participating then it&#x27;s all the same. Different messages are equivalent to punctuation, emphasis and bullet points. If he was not participating then he simply has to turn off notifications from everyone or the whole app if he doesn&#x27;t want to be pinged. 103 messages instead of 100 is showing no respect ? As if.<p>&gt;  are so self centered that even at their explicit request you can’t use the shift key when hitting enter<p>Yeah, I won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not needed and not justified at all. One giant fucking blob of text coming after all the other messages and being out of sync with the live conversation because you were busy writing your Proust version of your advice on a Whatsapp vs XMPP ? That&#x27;s not how IRC, slack or anything ever worked. That&#x27;s what email is for.<p>Especially when two minutes later he and another were firing &quot;ok&quot; and &quot;testing&quot; messages in the same conversation. So no, I don&#x27;t take your accusation of being self-centered that well.<p>Want a practical point why it&#x27;s better to split your ideas in different messages ?<p>Because then you can hit the reply button and every other participants know that this reply will be to that particular point. Not the pedantic but carefully crafted useless train of sentences and a thousand word long comment you slap in everyone&#x27;s face. It&#x27;s a conversation not a long distance snail mail relationship.<p>&gt; You,re the type of communicator I’d have to look up Slack documentation to mute all messages. And forever more you would get no synchronous responses. And that’d be ok: you lack respect, you don’t deserve respect.<p>What&#x27;s that ghetto outlook of respect you are trying to pull now ? Respect is not something you take off the table when the other side doesn&#x27;t conform to what you think respect is. It&#x27;s basically the opposite of what you should if you ever want to come to a compromise or a mutually beneficial solution to both parties.<p>Something clearly you are not ready to do. The type of communicator and self righteous person I&#x27;d have to look up Slack documentation to  mute all messages.<p>PS: I also didn&#x27;t take well the &quot;do you know you can use shift enter ?&quot;. Jeez, I was using IRC years before that guy ever first installed messenger on his iphone.<p>PPS: now that I think about it I wonder what would happen if I replied &quot;you know there&#x27;s a built-in spelling and grammatical checker in your mail client?&quot; because not only are their email lacking formatting (they write like they are texting) but they are full of grammatical and spelling mistakes that would get them to fail their primary school exams. And not taking the time to write correctly is clearly a lack of respect and lazyness, right?')
