I bought a cheap Brother printer laserjet a few years ago. I needed the occasional B&amp;W print job and plugged in the ethernet port. It worked out of the box for Debian and Windows, no special drivers needed. (I used to have to have some strange binary, but that hasn&#x27;t been necessary anymore).<p>I don&#x27;t remember the last time I exchanged out the toner cartridge (Maybe it&#x27;s the first one? But I think I did have to exchange it at some point.), and it works reliably everytime I need to print. For $100, that isn&#x27;t bad.<p>For another reference, I also bought one for my old college lab in ~2008-2009. I went back for a visit in 2019, and it was still there and it was working fine.<p>I get what you mean though, it seems in every printer thread the Brother recommendations have popped up.')
