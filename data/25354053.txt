It&#x27;s 2020 and you still can&#x27;t transmit voice without falling back to SCO and having everything sound like a tin can. SBC is barely passable for music, and has hundreds of ms of latency. So companies have <i>already</i> hacked their own various proprietary codecs. Ever hear of AptX or LDAC? They only work with Qualcomm and Sony licensing&#x2F;devices. Imagine spending $400 on your new WH-1000XM4s only to find that LDAC doesn&#x27;t work on any desktop OS.<p>I don&#x27;t see Apple doing anything different here.')
