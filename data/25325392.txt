Matlab, SAS, Mathematica, each pushed in programs I enrolled in and students out of them are dependent so much they are guranteed buys (and set the next generation into working &#x27;ONLY&#x27; via those software). Sure they have competitors, but there is so much lock-in that practically if you learned how to do all your analysis for a particular program in one you are never leaving and totally dependent. Some like me resist. Use R! Octave! Maxima! Of course the classes would ask for things specifically not easy to do in the free versions that are nearly turn-key in the commercial ones. This form of &#x27;get-em before they know any better&#x27; should be regulated (by the university, not the government), and professors should be encouraging unique solutions, not punishing out of the box thinking. Whatever, its an empire, carved up for the industrialists and investors. Nothing to see here, move along.')
