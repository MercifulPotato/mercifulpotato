Downloads get stuck at 0%, apparently because Chrome doesn&#x27;t trust the certificates. And when I browse, Chrome tells me that the site is not secure.<p>And I was unable to transfer APKs via USB. I don&#x27;t really know why, I have developer mode and all of that enabled.<p>So, I guess it&#x27;s bricked.')
