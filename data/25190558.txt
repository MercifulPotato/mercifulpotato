The stable one moves very slowly, and because Hydra tests packages, it&#x27;s really rare to experience broken things.<p>You can also mix them and e.g. install some packages from unstable, and keep others from stable.<p>Additionally Nix and Guix provide easy total and partial rollbacks, so you should not be afraid of breaking anything.')
