It is not too dissimilar from many North-West European schools in the early 2000s banning any and all clothing of the brand Londsdale, until some courts overruled that, as the brand became a dog whistle for Nazis, as when carefully covered the lettering leads “NDSA” which is one letter short of “NDSAP”.')
