But if scientists are free to fake data until caught and to essentially be untrustworthy, it becomes impossible to make progress.<p>That someone has engaged in bad faith and bad methology previously doesn&#x27;t <i>invalidate</i> their findings. It doesn&#x27;t prove they&#x27;re wrong. But it makes people justified in ignoring them.<p>The world is full of, uh, bullshit, full of unjustified claims on this and that.
