After all, the atheist says &quot;there is no need for another uncaused cause because ...&quot; - that &quot;because&quot; serves the purpose of religion.  I would argue that one cannot be an atheist without that &quot;because&quot;.  An agnostic can act in the fashion of an atheist (presumptive atheism), but an ill-considered atheist-in-act is not an atheist in intellect.<p>In fact the branches of natural philosophy nominally used to make the determination &quot;God cannot exist&quot; by the atheist cannot speak to being and essence (because the sciences presuppose them) and cannot speak categorically to meaning and purpose (because those depend on what philosophy has determined about being and essence).  Prescriptions on how to live (i. e. what the moral response to being must be) flow from the first two and therefore also cannot flow from science alone which presupposes whatever kind of universe the scientist finds himself existing in.  &quot;Can I derive &#x27;ought&#x27; from &#x27;is&#x27;&quot; is presumed by the physicist and can only be addressed by the philosopher.<p>To put it another way, one cannot be an atheist without a religion - one can only be agnostic.<p>To put it a third way, Cicero says &quot;religion consists in offering service and ceremonial rites to a superior nature that men call divine.&quot;  The atheist says &quot;there is none to serve&quot; - but that is patently untrue, for in that case there would be no end to strive after and all atheists would perish by inaction.  Therefore, all atheists have chosen to serve some superior nature, either themselves, or some ideal (Chaos, Order, Balance, etc.).')
