Seriously, what are you looking at? That rate of expansion, if not controlled with further social modifications, will overwhelm the country in about 3 weeks.<p>(Remember that quite some number of people need to be hospitalized, that the hospitals have to refuse other patients, that it will force other lockdowns, and it eventually will trickle to the older people - who will die.)<p>2) Sweden avoided an &#x27;initial lockdown&#x27; but most countries only did a &#x27;lock down&#x27; for several weeks. Otherwise, a lot of the de-facto policies have been quite similar. As of 4 weeks ago I suggest Sweden was &#x27;on par&#x27; with the rest of the Western world.')
