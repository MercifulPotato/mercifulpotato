Keeping my apartment in acceptable condition and taking care of myself can be quite difficult at times. It can take hours for me to fold laundry, do the dishes, or cook meals because I struggle following through with tasks. I am not bound from ever feeling like a functional human, I have my good days and my bad days, same as everyone else.<p>Prior to soylent, I was ordering food multiple times a week and keeping lots of junk food in the house, in case I hyperfocused through the time that I should be cooking dinner, which was quite often.<p>I&#x27;m not here to defend the contents of Soylent, and I&#x27;m only loyal to the brand to the extent that I find it tasting not bad. But the concept of an instant meal replacement which I can prepare in a matter of seconds has had a huge positive benefit to my life.<p>If anyone else has any tips for how they managed to deal with this (besides Soylent), I&#x27;m all ears. For what it&#x27;s worth, I try to keep Soylent to one a day and always have a &quot;real&quot; meal otherwise')
