My understanding is that Python took off in a world where the other choices for languages were things like Perl and Java. Compared to Perl, Python does have a reputation of being much more readable, and compared to Java, it has the reputation of being much easier to write. People were attracted to the language initially for that, and then as the community grew, other benefits started appearing, like a rich ecosystem of third-party packages. Nowadays, other languages have appeared that offer different productivity tradeoffs, some with much better performance, so it&#x27;s possible that Python won&#x27;t be the first choice of as many people as before, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly surprising that people who have used it and been productive with it for years still continue to enjoy working in it. The experience of working in a language like Python hasn&#x27;t actually gotten worse just because something like Go exists; it&#x27;s just that some people who might have picked Go over Python 20 years ago picked Python back then because Go didn&#x27;t exist yet.')
