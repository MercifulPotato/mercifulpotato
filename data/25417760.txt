He has to &#x27;guess&#x27; instead of just read the code. For that, I guess that it is similar to the current question of accountability of decisions made with deep learning algorithms.<p>As an example of my point, I would refer to the &#x27;garbage collection&#x27; issues of a language like &#x27;java&#x27;. GC will happen at a logically defined point like &#x27;dirty mem &gt; 100m&#x27; but from the developer point of view, his logic could suddenly lag unexpectedly in a middle of a simple operation because the GC was triggered by internal magic. It is very hard for a dev to be able to determine the memory usage at different points of the code and so have a certitude of when this operation could happen.')
