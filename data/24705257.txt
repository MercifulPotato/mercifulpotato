The point I&#x27;d raise is first that you may be unaware of better alternatives because of anticompetitive behaviour by Google and second by Google&#x27;s very nature they could limit the discoverability of competitors.<p>(I have no idea whether better competitors exist or whether Google could, let alone does, hide them.)<p>Antitrust cases are hard to generalize I believe. If an airline lowers prices on a route following the entrance of a (smaller) competitor, it&#x27;s hard to know whether that is or should be illegal without knowing a whole lot of specifics.')
