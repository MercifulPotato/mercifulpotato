There&#x27;s a &quot;minus 1&quot; because Reed Solomon is over the cyclical multiplication group, not over the cyclical additive group. (TL;DR: The number 0 cannot participate in... some portion of the formulation of the polynomials)<p>GF(2^3) is over blocksize of 7. GF(2^4) is over blocksize of 15. GF(2^8) is over 255.<p>---------<p>GF(2^8) is the smallest size in practice, because most people&#x27;s data is organized into 8-bits-at-a-time today. (aka: a byte). But you&#x27;re mostly right (once you account for the off-by-one error): there&#x27;s a limit to 255 elements per block in GF(2^8) Reed Solomon.<p>But GF(2^3) or GF(2^4) are great for hand-exercises, the smaller size makes it far easier to compute calculations by hand and allow for the human to gain understanding. (aka: Octal 2^3 numbers or Hexadecimal 2^4 numbers). GF(2^2) is technically possible... but all the matrix math is over 1x1 matricies and not really a good opportunity to learn from. GF(2^1) is literally impossible for Reed Solomon to work in. So GF(2^3) is the smallest practical hand-exercise size (RS(7, 5) over GF(2^3) has a 5x7 generator matrix and a 7x2 check matrix. Small enough to do by hand though a bit tedious).<p>If you actually wanted to &quot;split symbols up&quot; so that you better detect bit-errors, then LDPC or Turbocodes are straight up superior over Reed Solomon for &quot;small symbol sets&quot;. Reed Solomon is best used over &quot;large symbols&quot; (aka: 2^8 or larger).<p>----------<p>Any Reed Solomon code can be punctured (aka: fewer parity symbols), or shortened (aka: fewer data symbols) by simply setting locations of the Reed-Solomon generator and&#x2F;or check matrix to 0.<p>As such, if you organize &quot;smaller sets&quot; into 2^8 (aka: 8-bit bytes), its just very natural to use a punctured + shortened Reed Solomon code instead of trying to get a 2^4 Reed Solomon code to work.')
