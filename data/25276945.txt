Seems obvious, but most people don&#x27;t think that way.<p>With the Buy For Life platform, I want to fight planned obsolescence and help people finding the most durable and sustainable products in the world. In addition, this newly introduced metric could help saving money and consume less.<p>The cost of ownership is a huge concept, explained well in a Terry Pratchett book:<p>&quot;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#x27;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#x27; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.&quot;<p>I almost wonder if I could add a charitable aspect to this as well, where the site contributes BIFL products to people in need to help them save money in the long run.')
