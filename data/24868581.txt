My wife is studying here, so she has a 1 year student visa. I&#x27;m on a 90 day tourist visa, and the Malaysian government has kindly extended this until the 31st of December due to lockdowns and border closures. (It might be more accurate to say that there will be no penalties for overstaying.) I&#x27;m also working on an entrepreneurship visa that will hopefully allow me to stay in Malaysia a bit longer.<p>We&#x27;re thinking about a trip to my home country of New Zealand, but it&#x27;s a big decision. Our quality of life is very good in Malaysia, even though we spend most of our time in an apartment, and even though there&#x27;s recently been a spike in coronavirus cases. It&#x27;s nice to go back to New Zealand for a visit and a short holiday, but I don&#x27;t really want to get stuck there until the end of 2021 (or even the middle of 2021.)')
