All you need to know is that East Asians are high IQ (within 0.3stddev of anglo or Germanic whites). This predicts everything else, including economic outcomes.<p>Asians don’t get “diversity” points because they can’t be bribed with status subsidies; they are already high status (doctors, engineers, etc.) because of their intelligence.<p>Slurs against Asians are less offensive because the connotation of being Asian is bad. No one would seriously use Asian as an insult. If there’s an ethnic group where calling someone a word for that ethnic group is horribly offensive, it’s because deep down people understand that this group is usually low status. Slurs like “kraut” or “nip” don’t really have any weight because they’re basically complements.')
