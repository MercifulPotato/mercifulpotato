I&#x27;ve been developing&#x2F;selling it all by myself and am looking to bring on a developer to start taking over the tech side of things.  The tool has a small user base, but makes enough to cover the cost of running it.<p>Everything is done using AWS... EC2 for the web server, RDS for databases, Lambda for some process intensive parts.  The backend is done in PHP using Laravel while the tool itself is a SPA built using Vue.  You&#x27;d basically be coming in as a co-founder and would get a good chunk of equity and profit sharing.<p>I&#x27;m happy to chat more about what&#x27;s going on and what I&#x27;m looking for, and willing to work together to figure something out that can help take tech responsibility off of my plate!<p>Apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;lightningestimates&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1118025-full-stack-developer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;lightningestimates&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;1118025-ful...</a>')
