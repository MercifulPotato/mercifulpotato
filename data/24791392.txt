Taibbi is the apotheosis of the journaladvocate you&#x27;re talking about. He&#x27;s also a lot of other things that you don&#x27;t like about journalism; for instance, see his coverage of financial engineering topics during the &quot;sucking blood funnel days&quot; of the 2008 crisis, for some Crichton Amnesia Effect fodder.<p>As always I&#x27;ll point out that the real controlling law for all this stuff --- the quality of journalism, the quality of advocacy, the quality of software engineering, law, medicine, whatever --- is Sturgeon&#x27;s.')
