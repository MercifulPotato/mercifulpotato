Typically, they&#x27;re right - so right, in fact, that I&#x27;ve often already replied to them.<p>I&#x27;ve always said (until Twitter went full asshole, which they&#x27;re now reversing course on) that I&#x27;d pay for a &quot;Twitter Pro&quot;. Let me use a third-party client to do everything that the official client does, but with the option of turning things off - provide likes in my timeline, which my client can filter out; allow me to access polls via the API (which presumably they don&#x27;t do for everyone because of botting), and so on.<p>Twitter, I will pay you monthly to stop making me choose between an incomplete experience (third-party clients) and an awful one (inflexible first-party clients). It&#x27;s guaranteed income. Please, sign me up.')
