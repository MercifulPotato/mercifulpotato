The Pfizer vaccine has 164 contractions of Covid-19 as their mark to conclude the research. This research seems to aim for 151.<p><i>The Moderna vaccine, which is based on similar mRNA technology as BioNTechâ€™s, is expected to be assessed by the FDA on a final analysis of 151 Covid cases among trial participants who will be followed on average for more than two months.</i><p>If both groups are similar enough you can then say how effective the vaccine is in preventing it.<p>This, by the way, is why most phase 3 trials take place in the US and&#x2F;or Brazil (among other places): the more Covid-19 is around the faster you can get to the set number of contractions and conclude the phase 3.')
