His first reaction was, perhaps, much like the first reaction of any casual observer would be: &quot;What are all these people doing here just standing around?&quot;<p>NYC union rules still require oilers on cranes (because it&#x27;s still 1930 or something and our cranes all need the constant attention of someone resupplying their oil) and the union is paid a big fee for every tunnel boring machine, to compensate them for all the jobs lost (relative to half a century ago).<p>Of course, the MTA station design principles (mentioned elsewhere in this thread) do not help, excavating large caverns via mining, and the MTA doesn&#x27;t know how to run a large program effectively and maintain good relations with its contractors, and of course there are a variety of exciting reported cases where the MTA doesn&#x27;t even know why a person on the construction site is there or getting paid to begin with, so there&#x27;s plenty of disaster to go around. Either way it works to the same result: we can&#x27;t have nice things in this town.')
