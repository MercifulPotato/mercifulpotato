The current solution works relatively well: anyone using <i>open source</i> in a sense other than that described by the OSI, is reliably met with a hailstorm of criticism on HackerNews for being disingenuous. That&#x27;s as it should be. It&#x27;s a term of art in the software world, and we don&#x27;t insist on legal enforcement of every term of art.<p>I tend to capitalise the term, <i>Open Source</i>, to emphasise that I&#x27;m using it an a precise way. I do the same with <i>Free Software</i>. Not ironclad, but I figure it probably helps.<p>With all of that said, I don&#x27;t think anyone should be permitted to deliberately mislead people when they&#x27;re pushing a product. It&#x27;s obviously right that false advertising is forbidden by law.')
