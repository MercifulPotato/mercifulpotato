I want to outgrow the coping mechanisms my upbringing forced me to learn in order to adapt, which are now actively harming me. If some things we impart on children truly are irreversible, then it&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m trapped consciously aware of how my parents influenced my life and still there isn&#x27;t enough I can do to move on. And I didn&#x27;t choose my parents, so I could not consent to being raised in the ways they chose.')
