People have passions and ambitions to have an impact on the world sometimes. Doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t do both at the same time. I chose to not work for one of those ad-tech companies, would have multiplied my salary by 10 easily just at entry level, but optimizing a system so people click more on ads is not what I want to spend my life doing. Of course you could take the big salary and do good with the money... Later... but I don&#x27;t see many people around me doing that efficiently and a lot of what they give is wasted by people that know how to abuse them for &quot;a good cause&quot;. And in the meantime more important work has to be done anyway.')
