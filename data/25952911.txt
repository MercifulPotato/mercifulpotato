Just inertia and having to invest in the systems and processes to do it, I guess. It started at like T+14 when you had to mail physical stock certificates around then +7, +5, +3, +2, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll get there eventually. US futures are already settled T+0.<p>From my limited experience back office software is a legacy clusterfuck and the Ops team has to pick up the phone and call counter-parties on T+1 to unfuck things more often than you&#x27;d think, but those are things that could be fixed with better systems if the investment was made.')
