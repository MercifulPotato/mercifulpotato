The spirituality of the robot could, in theory, have been created ex nihilo or from some pre-existing form that was or was not part of the material world.<p>So there seem to be three logical options:<p>1. The robot may not be spiritual, only material.<p>2. The robot may be spiritual, but only in its material form.<p>3. The robot, whether it exists or not in the material world, could be linked to a pre-existing or post-existing spiritual form, neither defining the robot itself as having a spirit or not having a spirit, but also not negating that it could.<p>The third, I think, may be closest to the Buddhist interpretation, and leaves most options open metaphysically.<p>In that, we arrive where we started. We know more than when we started, such that we&#x27;re enlightened, but at the same time we may know no more for certain than when we considered the robot.<p>[1]- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Infinite_monkey_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Infinite_monkey_theorem</a>')
