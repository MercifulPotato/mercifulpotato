She constantly verbally and occasionally physically abused be, infront of our son. Then in court she had the nerve to accuse me of hitting her, which I never did. But because I was honest and admitted to using canabis (which is now legal) the courts believed her.<p>So yeah, I lost contact, as well as being hammered with a 100K+ maintenance bill until he turned 25, including losing my passport and drivers license when I lost my job and fell behind. Of course his mother OD&#x27;d a couple years later when I paid off what was due and he ended up being raised by the state....I guess the studies didn&#x27;t include the kids like that, huh?<p>I read that other guts comment history and it&#x27;s all aguments and belittling so what ever.<p>Good news I&#x27;m more upset, triggered about this than the election now!')
