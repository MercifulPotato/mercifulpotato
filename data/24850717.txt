The evolutionary explanation is that animals can usually defend themselves by running away and&#x2F;or use of claws or teeth. Plants (and fungi), stuck in one place, have to resort to chemical defenses.<p>Slow loresis reinforce this story by being such a rare toxic exception among mammals, and by being slow, so less able to defend themselves by flight.')
