Of these the main account name might be the real name for many people, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s required. The account name is also publicly used by Google in a whole bunch of places (e.g. when you read a Google Docs doc).<p>It also lists Youtube channels with similar names, which is generally wrong.')
