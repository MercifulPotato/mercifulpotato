Item(by='hn_throwaway_99', descendants=None, kids=[25549744, 25548555, 25549480], score=None, time=1609038167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547448, text='I went to a specialized high school (as a semi-anonymous account don&#x27;t want to give too much detail), and as such more than a few of my close high school friends went on to be famous in their chosen profession, and a couple starred in some fairly well known movies. I ended up going to a top university, and one of my roommates ended up founding a successful internet company you&#x27;ve all heard of. My first job out of college was at tech company with a &quot;boot camp&quot; like training program for new recruits. One of my close colleagues eventually co-founded a financial trading company that made him phenomenally rich in his late 20s, and another colleague founded a well-known unicorn.<p>Perhaps because I was inculcated fairly early in a competitive environment, it&#x27;s hard for me to look back and not woulda&#x2F;coulda&#x2F;shoulda it. Mainly I&#x27;d like to ask some of my successful ex-colleagues and friends (some of whom I&#x27;m still in contact with, so wouldn&#x27;t be too hard I guess) if <i>they</i> have any significant regrets. One on hand they must know how incredibly lucky and fortunate they&#x27;ve been, but of course their lives have their own trials and tribulations. And my life is good, I have close friends and family, quite mundane, though at least a good mundane. But still, I find it hard sometimes to not at least wish for a future reincarnation, one where I have the natural talents or extra drive or whatever that is needed to grab that brass ring.')
