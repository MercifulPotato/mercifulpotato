I just took a course on graph theory, and immediately though of the Ramsey numbers. Sure enough he made some progress there. What makes the Ramsey numbers fascinating to me is that they are a problem that goes from pen and paper trivial to computer solvable, to completely intractable in only 3 steps. A brute force proof of the R(5,5) case would involve testing 2⁹⁰⁵ (2^905) graphs.')
