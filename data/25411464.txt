In most of the world &quot;state&quot; refers to a sovereign entity, &quot;nation&quot; refers to an ethnic group, and &quot;nation-state&quot; is a state identified with an ethnic nation.<p>But all of that terminology solidified in the 19th century, so outside of academic political science the US uses &quot;state&quot; to refer to individual entities in a federation (e.g. translating German &quot;Bundesland&quot; as &quot;state&quot;), &quot;nation&quot; to refer to non-ethnic bodies politick, and &quot;nation-state&quot; to specify &quot;what we call a nation, what the Old World calls a state&quot;.<p>Which of course leads to a lot of confusion about the connotations of &quot;EU member state&quot;, which in European discourse implies real sovereignty, but in US discourse implies a federalist Europe.')
