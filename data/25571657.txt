I&#x27;m about half way through &#x27;Medal of Honor&#x27; on the Quest 2 and I&#x27;ve never really been in to war games (or movies) at all. But I&#x27;ve been having an absolutely great time doing the various missions - and training - where you get to mow down the nazis with a variety of weapons.<p>And naturally, different to a console game, I&#x27;m physically pointing the weapon (controller) at the (virtual) target. It&#x27;s really more fun than it should be ;)<p>It feels like being a character in a (cheesy) WWII movie.<p>(Also, I don&#x27;t think stabbing zombies in the head in &#x27;Walking Dead :Saints and Sinners&#x27; will ever get old)')
