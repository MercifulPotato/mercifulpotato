(Do you live in the US? Australia? Turkey? India? Russia? If so, it is.) The #2 thing you can do is make sure your own country is run by politicians who will not do it at home and will pressure China <i>on this actual issue</i>, not as a card in a negotiation actually about economics.<p>I don&#x27;t mean this as some kind of whataboutism. I mean pragmatically the leverage you have over the government of China is far less than the leverage you have over the government where you work and live. But the leverage <i>they</i> have over of the government of China may be significant.')
