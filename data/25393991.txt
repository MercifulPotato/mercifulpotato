My point wasn&#x27;t that YouTube&#x27;s policy was the end of democracy, but that the ethos espoused by the parent commenter, if shared by a majority of the electorate and leaders, results in the end of democracy.<p>Democracy requires trusting people to not be complete morons.  Unfortunately, the polarized nature of political discourse in the US has caused people to think that the 50% of the country that doesn&#x27;t think like them is too stupid to be trusted with speech and videos.<p>Despite the fact that my brother has been sucked into the world of Alex Jones, I don&#x27;t think most Americans are too stupid to resist dumb conspiracy theories.  In decades past, this brother was a radical leftist, regularly arrested for trespassing in the late 80&#x27;s at nuclear power plant protests, and later a radical in Greenpeace in the early 90&#x27;s.  This was long before the internet.  He didn&#x27;t believe the moon landing was real, and always believed in dumb ass conspiracy theories.  (He&#x27;s 11 years older than me, and by the time I was 11, I knew he was a moron.)\nMy other 4 siblings aren&#x27;t like him.<p>His new shift was, honestly, not that weird.  He happened to shift to the right, but it&#x27;s a horseshoe as you know, and crazy is crazy.<p>There have been, and always will be, highly illogical people looking to indulge their desperate desire to have symmetrical, orderly views of the universe that aren&#x27;t real.  The big, disastrous outcomes must always have been carefully plotted, large, grand plans (like 9&#x2F;11 being a false flag operation, which my brother also believed then).  My brother is one of these people, but most people aren&#x27;t like that.<p>This huge drive for censorship didn&#x27;t occur when a large portion of the American left thought that 9&#x2F;11 was an inside job, because the normal people on the left knew that it was a large, but still fringe, group within their own sphere.  The problem is that the same normal people on the left don&#x27;t know normal people on the right.  Why?  Because they don&#x27;t know ANY people on the right.  They are in bubbles now.  So they are unable to draw the same conclusion that people like my brother are a fringe on the right.  To them, voting for Donald Trump is evidence of a massively delusional person, rather than the grim reality that the vast majority of Trump&#x27;s voters don&#x27;t like him, and simply chose a lesser of two evils in their worldview, due to a corrupt, oligarchical class at the top of both major political parties resulting in highly polarized policy positions that force them to do this.')
