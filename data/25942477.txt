Putting it in a contract isn&#x27;t changing reality, it is just saying &quot;water is wet&quot;. If they tried to collect on it without a lawsuit, you&#x27;d surely file one to argue that you didn&#x27;t breach agreements or were not the direct cause of loss. So at the end of the day, this is just saying &quot;Conflicts may end up in court.&quot;, which is the status quo with or without a contract.<p>Not that I disagree with crossing it out - that is a good call. It just isn&#x27;t as glaring of an evil clause as it might appear.<p>This is why I would recommend OP pay for an hour of a lawyers time to read over the contract and give some advice. Because what sounds scary is often meaningless and what sounds benign is often actually fairly unreasonable. If you aren&#x27;t experienced reading contracts, it is worth the cost to get some help.')
