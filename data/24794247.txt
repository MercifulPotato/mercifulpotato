At any rate, if it <i>is</i> true, there are certainly a significant number of people who are giving an extraordinarily convincing imitation of believing that the Earth is flat. So convincing that it&#x27;s hard not to allocate at least some probability to the hypothesis that they actually believe what they say they believe and aren&#x27;t giving an imitation at all.')
