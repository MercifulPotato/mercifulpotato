They said they used the biggest node &#x27;available to them&#x27; without clarifying how big that was.<p>If the issue was RabbitMQ hitting resource limits then upgrading its hardware (or swapping it out for some other similarly featureful broker but which is faster) might have fixed some of the problems too, albeit not things like insufficient observability.<p>I also wonder to what extent RabbitMQ suffers from being written in Erlang. Switching to a featureful broker with sharding and replication that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> Kafka e.g. Artemis might have allowed them to avoid rewriting code to not use helpful features.<p>This performance blog suggests RabbitMQ may top out at ~4000 messages&#x2F;sec when making things durable, which isn&#x27;t especially good performance:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwaremill.com&#x2F;mqperf&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwaremill.com&#x2F;mqperf&#x2F;</a>')
