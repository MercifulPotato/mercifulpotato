Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose?” and “why should I exist?” lose their force upon lifestyle fixes. In other words, seeing friends regularly and getting enough sleep can go a long way to solving existentialism.</i><p>I really dig this particular one. It reminds me of something similar mentioned in Lex Fridman&#x27;s interview with Daniel Kahneman:<p><i>&quot;When you ask people whether it&#x27;s very important to have meaning in their life, they say oh yes that&#x27;s the most important thing...but when you ask people what kind of a day did you have...what were the experiences that you remember? You don&#x27;t get much meaning, you get social experiences.&quot;</i>[0]<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning, and I have generally enjoyed reading existentialist philosophy. That quote, however, presented an alternative foundation for a happy life in such clear terms, and they were terms I simply hadn&#x27;t considered using! After thinking about it, it&#x27;s almost obvious. I&#x27;m pretty young, and even now I look back fondly on the best social experiences in my life. It&#x27;s incredible to be alive, and to have had the experiences I&#x27;ve had with the people I&#x27;ve gotten to share them with.<p>I still highly value having meaningful pursuits, but above everything else, these days I aim to enjoy the company of good people and to be good company for others. I find it&#x27;s a nice cure for the existentialist blues if you ever catch them.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UwwBG-MbniY?t=3120" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UwwBG-MbniY?t=3120</a>')
