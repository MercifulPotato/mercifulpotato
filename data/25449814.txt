In the former the browser is considered the end product, in the latter it&#x27;s only the starting point. You must create an ecosystem around it by making it easy for people and organizations to augment it beyond its simple browsing functions. When I say &quot;augment it&quot; a few of us may be tempted to point at HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JavaScript. That&#x27;s pretty much Mozilla&#x27;s position as well. Meanwhile others who get it come up with such things as Airtable and Retool. Is it hard to imagine versions of Firefox that cater to businesses and work like Visual Basic? Drag &amp; drop buttons, scripting in Dart or TypeScript natively, can connect to various types of datasources. The possibilities are immense.<p>There clearly is value in using browser technology in business. If Mozilla was a browser company they would&#x27;ve pushed more aggressively to understand novel ways it can be leveraged in those environments (who are also generally willing to pay for such things). I can imagine business applications being developed in a marketplace and Mozilla at the center taking a cut somewhere.<p>Why do we have to deal with &quot;tree-shaking&quot; in 2020? That&#x27;s because the browser makers have completely divorced themselves from the idea that they could be part of the app ecosystem. They just build a browser that abides by the standards and push it out the door with their foot. You guys out there figure it out.')
