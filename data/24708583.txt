While debugging and digging through history I&#x27;m often asking the question &quot;what were they thinking?&quot;, and the info that you made a commit just to move to a different machine might make me e.g. consider it more likely that you left something out, or stopped a line of development early because you needed to do the commit earlier than you normally would. Squashing tries to hide the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;in which order&quot; so you only get the &quot;what&quot; of what was developed. But &quot;how&quot; and &quot;in which order&quot; are valuable pieces of information too.')
