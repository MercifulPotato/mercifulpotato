Has any of you&#x2F;them actually played the game? I&#x27;ve played it on Google Stadia and loved it, the main story and major side stories were exciting (Konpeki Plaza really had me on edge), combat is complex, characters are well written, graphics are amazing. As far as bugs are concerned I had to reload an earlier save maybe 3-5 times over the span of 40 hours of gameplay, which is not good but honestly I didn&#x27;t care. It does look like the console versions were worse off, though, but I didn&#x27;t play these myself.')
