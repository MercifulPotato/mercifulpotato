At best I fear the majority of the use would be just to fingerprint us more to show us more soap&#x2F;shoes&#x2F;drugs to buy.  At worst it would end up being a never ending pit of security vulins.  We have tried this sort of tech before it worked badly in the end.  So a bit of caution is not unwarranted.</code></pre>')
