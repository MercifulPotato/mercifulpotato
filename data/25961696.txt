In more adversarial cases it&#x27;s probably best to tell the police that you will talk to them, but only in a formal interview with your lawyer present (even if this isn&#x27;t true, and you don&#x27;t want to talk to them, and you don&#x27;t have a lawyer and don&#x27;t intend to get one). Telling them this, though, doesn&#x27;t give them as much license to get nasty.')
