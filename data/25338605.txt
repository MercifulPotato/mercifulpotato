It does not show that.  It&#x27;s more accurate to say that there was a <i>national</i> debate going on at the time, and the open-ness of the CA initiative process allowed it to play out here for a brief period of time.  Prop 8 was immediately challenged and was never implemented.<p>I don&#x27;t like arguing with bad-faith actors, so I won&#x27;t go further than saying you&#x27;re taking all context away from this to get to a conclusion you want.<p>&gt; Folks in California might be surprised about what the rest of the country is really like.<p>I visit the urban midwest frequently, and it&#x27;s simply not as socially progressive as urban California is.  There are progressive pockets!  There are progressive and kind people!  (And in CA, there are socially regressive places.)<p>But the support for LGBTQ rights in urban CA goes much, much deeper than it does in Midwest cities.  Arguing the point is laughable, ridiculous, and out of touch.  Come on, we&#x27;re talking San Francisco and West Hollywood here!')
