If your waiting on a query to execute your bound on whatever the query is bound on (IO&#x2F;Memory&#x2F;CPU).<p>Also I&#x27;m IO bound, so don&#x27;t care is a weird response. Doesn&#x27;t matter were I&#x27;m bound, if it needs to go faster, I need to examine what I can do to remove that bottleneck. What I&#x27;m bound on just gives me a clue where most of my energy tuning&#x2F;troubleshooting goes, not shrug and forget the problem.<p>But maybe I&#x27;m just lucky to have always worked with good people.')
