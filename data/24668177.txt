I got burned using Google Authenticator when I had to replace my phone, because there was no way to transfer the auth data to a new phone.<p>Maybe The Google app has changed now, I have no idea.  I’ve had much better luck storing TOTP in 1Password and Bitwarden - which allow you to sync across multiple platforms. So now device upgrades are a non-issue.<p>Most sites give you some static backup codes for TOTP - definitely store those somewhere safe, they can be a lifesaver.')
