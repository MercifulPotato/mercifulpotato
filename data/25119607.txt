My good friend had to leave for medical reasons, it was very sad. Another left as a sophomore. 10 years later, he asked if he could come back, and the Institute said &quot;sure&quot;, and he graduated with straight A&#x27;s. I asked him if he&#x27;d gotten smarter in the preceding decade, he laughed and said no, it just took him 10 years to get ready to work hard.)')
