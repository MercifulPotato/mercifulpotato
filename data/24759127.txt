You could have a chunk of python in a serverless setup, a small flask server in a container in k8s, as an endpoint in a monolith, etc. Each of these environments have difference performance, cost and maintenance characteristics, but I think of the star feature of serverless as the light deploy. For companies that don&#x27;t have a deploy chain, that makes serverless very attractive, but if you&#x27;ve already invested in one it seems less compelling.<p>I think serverless products have a ton of potential for side projects and hobby projects. It&#x27;s great that you can just type out python and access it on the internet immediately! That quality just never seemed to be what was holding back SAAS companies.')
