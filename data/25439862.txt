Item(by='nuker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608102098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439779, text='&gt; ran up against a lot of its limitations. Maximum file size. Maximum resource count. Automatic rollbacks of THE WHOLE STACK<p>I totally can see where its coming from :)  CFN is best used as separate templates for <i>parts</i> of the solution, not the <i>whole</i> solution rolled in a single template. Reusable is the key word here, and Parameters. Let me try a city example. Have separate templates for a school, fire departnemt and house block. Build all Detroit schools using the same school.yml template, just supply different parameters for each. Don&#x27;t copy-paste code from school.yml into detroit.yml. Actually, there should be no detroit.yml, leave city level to CI&#x2F;CD job.<p>&gt; I have to say google_compute or azure_load_balancer or aws_dns<p>Multicloud? It rarely makes sense. All you get is triple the infra code, triple monitoring tools, triple devops competence requirements. Properly designed solution with HA and AZ&#x2F;regional redundancy is sufficient on a single cloud platform.')
