Yes you read that right, that is &quot;m&quot; as in megabytes.<p>mb is short for millibit, the abbreviation for megabyte is MB (or MiB if you mean 2^20 bytes). I know it&#x27;s a minor thing, but &quot;m&quot; and &quot;M&quot; does not mean the same thing, neither does &quot;b&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and they&#x27;re mixed up too often.<p>Sorry for the off topic.')
