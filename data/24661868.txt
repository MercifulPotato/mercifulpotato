Like the source, that it builds from the canonical source, all patches it applies, all install scripts it packages and all changes it actually does? The trustworthiness of the ppa author. I know that I at best do cursory checks based on the reputation the author or the source linking to the PPA have, but I&#x27;m aware that this is a honor based system, and open source is practically irrelevant to that.')
