The FDA recently started requiring an &quot;added sugars&quot; line item on nutrition labels, which is a step in the right direction. In my city there&#x27;s now a tax on sugary drinks. People have never had more options for what to eat and drink, however we (Americans) don&#x27;t live in a nanny state, thankfully, and some people will make choices that you consider unwise.<p>To your last point, I live in the US and have a healthy diet and lifestyle and waistline.
