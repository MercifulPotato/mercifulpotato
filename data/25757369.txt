There must be a different definition of &quot;information&quot; than the layman&#x27;s, in order for this to make sense. Your post indicates we might not fully know, obviously, but my &quot;naive&quot; understanding of information would indicate that it only really exists in the mind of an observer.<p><i>Except</i>! A very interesting idea that I&#x27;ve drawn out of recent reading is the way that physical systems can map onto other physical systems (usually representing them at a drastically different scale) and that this &quot;mapping&quot; is independent of the human mind, or a conscious observer. The only natural examples I can think of are the way that genotype maps to phenotype, and the way that the neural behavior of the brain can map to certain aspects of reality. Computers are an &quot;unnatural&quot; (human-created) example.<p>Is this related to what you mean by &quot;information&quot;?<p>[edit: delete random letters]')
