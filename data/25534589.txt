Phew.<p>I have doubts whether &#x27;strong AI&#x27; is even technologically possible, since even accurately simulating a human mind, this simulation would be necessarily constrained to run orders of magnitude slower than the reality it is designed to model.<p>&#x27;Training&#x27; it with data so to allow it the opportunity to reason and thereby synthesize a conclusion not already contained in the data fed to it might take longer than a researcher would be able to in a life time.<p>When was the last time a generation-spanning endeavour worked out as planned for (the West)?<p>I wish people would stop calling what currently passes for &#x27;Machine Learning&#x27; as &#x27;AI&#x27;. Literally the same level of &#x27;intelligence&#x27; we already had in the 80s, AFAIR we called it &#x27;Fuzzy Logic&#x27; then.<p>Secretly an admission, that Hollywood basically licensed the narrative of imminent runaway artificial consciousness back to science would make me give it one final Chance to prove its aptitude at high-level human reasoning and get square with reality.<p>I&#x27;m not holding my breath.')
