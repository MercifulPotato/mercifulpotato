Even if it does have a &quot;high definition&quot; camera recording to local storage these are Gopro style lenses with massive FOV, fisheye distortion and calibrated to handle a very wide range of light exposure up to and including direct sun. Shooting meaningful video through a window is a joke at best. As you&#x27;ve identified the noise generated at distances close enough to resolve any meaningful detail are even more comical<p>Large lenses are very heavy and benefit greatly from a stable platform. Tripods and low earth orbit are preferred by spies of consequence.')
