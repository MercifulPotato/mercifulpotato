This will be triaged and hopefully we&#x27;ll understand what&#x27;s up. Please use a Nightly build or a Mozilla-provided build when doing so (so there are symbols). It&#x27;s just a matter of downloading and untaring the tarball.<p>Please also attach a copy of `about:support` raw data (button at the top), so we can understand what your configuration is: desktop Linux systems can be pretty diverse and sometimes it isn&#x27;t clear what works, what doesn&#x27;t and why.<p>If you&#x27;re playing 480p, then youtube might be serving you AV1, and this is (for now) using the CPU (trading a lot less bandwidth for increased CPU usage), you can check the codec it&#x27;s using by right clicking on the video and clicking on `Stats for nerds`, there is the codec string. You can adjust your codec preferences in your youtube profile I believe.')
