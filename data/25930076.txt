The PS2 was a gaming device first and a DVD player second. Adding the DVD playback feature really got it into many of homes as the first DVD player for the household. If someone was just looking for a DVD player, why would they opt for the more expensive Nuon-enabled device than the cheaper DVD-only device? The only people that would have bought a Nuon-enabled DVD player would have been first adopters looking to actually buy a Nuon. Perhaps Nuon would have had more success selling a console that happened to play DVDs rather than a DVD player that happened to play games. Sony repeated the same strategy for the PS3 as a console that played Blu-rays and had immediate success with that too.<p>It&#x27;s like trying to sell a commuter car with a souped up engine next to the cheaper commuter cars. Someone buying a commuter car just wants 4 wheels and an engine at a low cost. Sony sold affordable sports cars that just so happened to be capable of commuting.')
