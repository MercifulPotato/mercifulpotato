An impression I get from having had teachers yell at me in the hallway about wasted potential and other students cracking jokes about how my friends had &quot;ruined me&quot; after my grades fell off a cliff after making some new ones.  Grading doesn&#x27;t prevent inflated delusions of intellectual superiority if people believe grades are a matter of hard work rather than intelligence.<p>What drove a sense of inferiority for me was somebody getting better grades with seemingly less effort.')
