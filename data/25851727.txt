No Python install needed.  No Github needed.  YouTube obviously does not try to make downloading difficult.  The download links are visible to anyone via &quot;View Source&quot;, they are just URL-encoded and missing href tags.  That&#x27;s a very small amount of work to fix that millions of people know how to do.  It is perplexing why so many people rely 100% on youtube-dl.  Sort of like what this author calls &quot;blind actionism&quot;.')
