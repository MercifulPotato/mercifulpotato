The person who answered the phone wasn&#x27;t a network engineer, but immediately passed me on to one within 10 seconds of our conversation starting.<p>For me it was night and day after previous having had a municipality-run absolutely garbage ISP previously (CityCable, for anyone considering them, stay far far away).
