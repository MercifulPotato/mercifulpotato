We even simulated the various aspects, engine, gearbox, vehicle (aerodynamics, breaks, tires, ...) and driver independently. So you can answer the question when you place this driver (the AI driver) into this model, what the difference would be. But normally this question is moot as you test the most important aspects, which are now the engine and aerodynamics.<p>But don&#x27;t forget, some drivers are excellent engineers by themselves, which was ie critical for Ferrari to get proper feedback from testing to R&amp;D. In older times they didn&#x27;t have simulators as everyone else, they always tested in real conditions on their home track Maranello. Or look at Niki Lauda&#x27;s famous feedback and analysis qualities. You don&#x27;t get that just from engineering.<p>Another important aspect: budget. Money can buy better simulation and engineering, which you cannot really compete with. That&#x27;s why it needs to be so heavily regulated.')
