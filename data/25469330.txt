Especially if it was just by 5 manual attempts, and not some sophisticated setup.<p>Since the hacking is an &quot;admission&quot; by Gevers, my assumption is that neither side in the case were challenging whether a hack actually happened - instead focusing on whether it was ethical.<p>The White House and Twitter &quot;strenuously denied reports that the account had been hacked&quot;. While they have incentive to do so, I&#x27;m still leaning on their side unless there&#x27;s further evidence.')
