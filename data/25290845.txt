There are people &quot;at risk&quot; that have trouble metabolizing the supplement, but chances are you&#x27;re not one of them.<p>You need to do blood tests. Don&#x27;t take 10,000IU daily without consulting a doctor. The &quot;generally considered safe&quot; upper limit is 4000IU. You&#x27;ll probably be fine with 2000IU. Too much Vitamin D can mess with your calcium and doses as low as 5000IU&#x2F;daily over a few years have been reported to cause serious problems.')
