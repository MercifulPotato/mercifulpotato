This is not true. Part of the reason the Times <i>is</i> a reputable source is because they publish things that tow the red&#x2F;blue line along with self criticism and corrections like this....unfortunately people can’t stomach nuance and alternative view points, just consider the outrage the Times faced a few moths ago for publishing the (admittedly stupid) opinion of a republican politician who was advocating for federal response to the Gerorge Floyd protests.<p>Inability to have rational argument and not get immediately heated in the face of an opposite opinion is a major flaw of proponents of both the right and left....the one thing that vindicates the left in America is that its at least the arguably more humanitarian and ethical side.<p>The internet helps us all live in our own personal realities and not have to ever deign to have a civil conversation with someone who disagrees with us.')
