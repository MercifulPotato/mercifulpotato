Item(by='chris_wot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608404002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478327, text='The NYT wrote the following about the series:<p><i>Told over the course of one year in 11 cinematic episodes, ‘Caliphate’ marries the new journalism of podcasting -- stories told with sound design, musical scoring and high production values -- with traditional boots-on-the-ground journalism.</i><p>This worries me. Hard reporting may find very boring stories. The need to make them &quot;cinematic&quot; really tempts the reporter and producers to make the story more sensational than they are. In this case, they appear to have made grave errors.<p><i>Edit:</i> I would also like to highlight the following twitter thread:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SanaSaeed&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339998013922701312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;SanaSaeed&#x2F;status&#x2F;1339998013922701312</a>')
