Your program &quot;leaks&quot; if that happens. But with integer overflows and floating point precision, we just ignore the leaks as something that programmers already know about and have to consider while coding. Of course, it&#x27;s not an easy problem to deal with, as computers don&#x27;t have infinite memory and they need to be performant, but we really need to spend more time thinking about and supporting improvements like this. If it only takes 6k lines to provide an API for more precise real numbers, then almost every programming language should have it. The ideas of allowing programmers to get information about the real and potential precision errors in operations are also interesting. Well, in general the ability to define the kind of numbers you want to be working with and their precision is fairly poor in computer science as a whole, there&#x27;s still a long road ahead.')
