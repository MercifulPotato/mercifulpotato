Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603464965, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869912, text='&gt; Odds are good that if health insurance benefits are pushed out of employers, you&#x27;re going to see it funded by a tax on top of wages, not a corporate income tax...<p>Sure, but there are ways to fix that. I&#x27;m not really a big fan of corporate taxes just because they seem to always either find a way around it, or they just raise prices. It&#x27;s hard to escape.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any philosophical merit to claiming someone working 7+ hours a day is not a full time worker. We may not know the exact economics, but we do know they&#x27;re not great. Uber loses billions per year, and pays substantial money to deal with high driver turnover. A mixed system makes it worse.<p>I think the issue here is the definition of full-time work is not enough. It has to include other things, like having to physically go to a place of employment, work hours that you&#x27;re told to work, etc. Should AirBnB have to employee hosts? Why is it different? You can&#x27;t make the hours argument, because there are plenty of Uber drivers that don&#x27;t drive &quot;full time&quot; and plenty of AirBnB hosts that run AirBnB full time. It also messes with any other sort of gig work, hence why the state had to go back and carve out all these exceptions - which is in my opinion usually an indicator of a bad or poorly thought out law.<p>Here&#x27;s the actual issue. These gig workers, or contractors, or whatever you want to call them need benefits (healthcare etc.) that the government isn&#x27;t paying for. The government needs to pay for that by raising taxes and&#x2F;or lowering costs, etc. The way to do that isn&#x27;t to make Uber and Lyft leave California and leave those workers without any sort of income. Even if it was right to do so morally (and I doubt that it is), it&#x27;s wrong to do so practically. To me as I&#x27;ve stated previously, this looks like a government failure, not a failure of Uber and Lyft.')
