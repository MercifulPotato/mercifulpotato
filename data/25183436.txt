I walked into a Guitar Center earlier this year and tried out some of their cheaper nylon acoustic models, but wanted to splurge on a big higher quality model, none of which they had in-store.  They said they&#x27;d have to custom-order it.  At that point it was easier just to order from Amazon and deliver to my address... which I did (ended up being shipped from a store in Chicago which listed on Amazon).')
