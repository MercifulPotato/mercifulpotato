It came over years of watching CP \ndefend literal incel terrorists beating up lesbians who refuse to have sex with them, while gaslighting the victims and defending the attacks. CP didn&#x27;t coin &quot;Cotton Ceiling&quot; but they sure go on about it. If kinkshaming is bad, what is it to personally shame lesbians who reject men?<p>And I didn&#x27;t lead with it, I used it to explain why I found your reference to be less than compelling.<p>&gt; So if you were talking to me and saw someone who looks like Blair White across the room, and wanted to single that person out, do you think you&#x27;d spot that person&#x27;s biological sex and say &quot;him over there&quot; to me rather than &quot;her over there&quot;?<p>You and I are already talking about Blair so I&#x27;d say &#x27;He&#x27;. But If I thought it might be ambiguous I wouldn&#x27;t use either. Like I wouldn&#x27;t use a shirt-color if I couldn&#x27;t see it clearly, or thought that you couldn&#x27;t.<p>And I won&#x27;t use people&#x27;s chosen pronouns but I don&#x27;t pick fights either so I&#x27;d sidestep the issue in their home or at their event.<p>But if you mean, would I spot Blair if I didn&#x27;t know them? Ehh, I dunno.<p>Do you think this means I&#x27;m reading their gender expression? Doesn&#x27;t that implicitly assume that there are only two gender expressions then, such that I&#x27;m being fooled into seeing the other one? This whole angle feels like it&#x27;d be labelled regressive, and it brings up the question of how one would be expected to recognize &#x27;Moon Gender&#x27; at all.<p>It feels like it&#x27;d be simpler to just say that I would be mistaken about their sex.')
