Item(by='gist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605809803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151954, text='&gt; decided to be held hostage by google and pay them to remove content that they would otherwise only put in front of you if you were looking. Its like paying a restaurant not to harass you and then going to it when you could just go to the restaurant next door without the protection fee.<p>Unclear why the attitude. Youtube is a business. It doesn&#x27;t owe users anything for free regardless of what it did in the past or others have done.<p>Restaurants? You pay them to dine there. They operate at a profit or try to.  And restaurants who offer either (or both) better food or experience get to charge more like any other product or service in life.<p>Sure google or any business does not exist to provide free things to people.')
