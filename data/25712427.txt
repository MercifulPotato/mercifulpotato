You just dismissed the whole 7 million country - and didn&#x27;t feel a thing. And the world you are welcoming by it is the world of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The only different thing is that in your world books aren&#x27;t be burned - that is bad for climate change. They will be - already are - quietly deleted from the servers. You are the dystopia that we&#x27;ve been warned about by 20th century writers. We failed to prevent you. Now it&#x27;s for us to despair for the lost freedom and for you to hope to never cross your new masters (but know you will, sooner or later).')
