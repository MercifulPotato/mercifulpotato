Hardly any invention can happen, if there is no fertile ground, as being among morons requires different goals and skills to survive and adapt - with creativity.<p>Autistic people also are no anti-reproduction either - modern society is in general against reproduction, as there is overpopulation on this planet.<p>There are no problems to reproduce, if female is autistic, as she has much higher chances to find a partner and produce autistic offsprings, but it is more complicated for autistic males to find a partner and without a partner there is no reproduction even if males are pro-reproduction.')
