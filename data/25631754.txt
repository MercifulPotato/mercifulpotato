This is more along the lines of being able to protest work that is consider unethical (IE the AI noted in the article, working with other gov&#x27;ts ect...) and not be penalized or fired for it. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t believe that a union is the answer for their problem because so long as there is money to fund a project there will be people lined up to work.')
