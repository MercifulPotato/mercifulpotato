Free speech is an ideal. We would like google to preserve free speech, even though they are not legally obligated to per the Constitution. If their EULA does not uphold that ideal, then they should change it, not compromise the ideal.<p>I would like to uphold that ideal by putting a political bumper sticker on your car.  Can you give me your address so I can send it to you?<p>If you don&#x27;t have a car, I can send you a sign to put in your window or a t-shirt with a slogan for you to wear.<p>I appreciate your cooperation in upholding this important ideal.')
