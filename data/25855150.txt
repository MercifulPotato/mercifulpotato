Empirical studies suggest this effect does not occur.<p>More housing generally does entail a transformation, because you need denser housing to build more units. Cities don’t have mass vacant lots ready for units of the exact same type extant.<p>&gt; 1) For example, Xiaodi Li has a 2016 paper that looks at what happens to rents when a new market-rate housing project is completed. She uses the random timing of project completion to make sure that she’s measuring causation instead of mere correlation. She finds:<p>&gt;For every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet. In addition, I show that new high-rises attract new restaurants, which is consistent with the hypothesis about amenity effects. However, I find that the supply effect is larger, causing net reductions in the rents and sales prices of nearby residential properties.<p>&gt;That’s a very localized effect! If induced demand were a big deal, you’d expect the opening of a new “luxury” building to at least raise rents on its particular block! But yet, she finds the opposite.<p>There were more studies discussed in the article.')
