Item(by='danieldk', descendants=None, kids=[24808725], score=None, time=1602924423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808471, text='<i>Take 2D&#x2F;3D design work. 10 Years ago it was almost impossile to get any decent 2D&#x2F;3D work done on foss now there are powerful tools like GIMP[2], Inkscape[3], Scribus[4], and Blender[5], Godot[6].</i><p>Most of these have been around a lot longer than 10 years. Heck, The Gimp was released in 1996, Blender exists since 1994 (I remember playing with it at the end of the 90ies or beginning 00s when it was still freeware), Scribus since 2003, and Inkscape since 2003.<p>Sure, each of them have improved the last 10 years, but the deltas are not that big that you can get many things done now that you couldn&#x27;t get done 10 years ago.<p>I primarily use Linux, but with the exception of Blender, these tools are not as easy to use or as extensive as their counterparts on macOS (and probably Windows, but I don&#x27;t really know Windows). In fact, until very recently Gimp and Inkscape did not even have proper HiDPI support (since they were still on Gtk+2).<p>This is not a criticism on the developers of these tools. They are amazing feats of engineering. But at some point they would probably need funding so that someone can put in the time to polish all the sharp edges.')
