All I can find is this blurb which could be read lots of different ways (likely by design):<p>&quot;Currently, new revenue from YouTube Premium membership fees is distributed to video creators based on how much members watch your content.

I&#x27;m still ok with that and YouTube does make it explicit that the majority of my sub goes towards creators.
