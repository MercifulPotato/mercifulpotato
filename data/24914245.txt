Item(by='cjohnson318', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603850795, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911180, text='I think the value of leisure time is a function of how much money you have, and how much free time you already have. If I don&#x27;t have a lot of money, then it&#x27;s worth my time to work overtime in a kitchen. If I have more money, I&#x27;m less likely to do so. Also people are more inclined to volunteer an hour here or there, but avoid a regular commitment.<p>I think you could approximate this function of the value of leisure time if you had enough time and money to go around polling people. My hunch is that there would be some variation around work ethic and virtue signaling, but that there would be a clear relationship between net worth, free time, and the value of free time.')
