Heck the sysinternals suite alone is incredible.<p>Windows has incredibly good keyboard shortcut support. A small example, the context&#x2F;menu key on keyboards is the equivalent of right clicking wherever the cursor is at, making spellchecking as I type super easy, I&#x27;m sure MacOS has some meta-combo that does this, but over 20 years ago Microsoft made this tiny piece of accessibility a first class citizen on their platform by starting a certification process for keyboards that included such a key.<p>Windows has non-borked external monitor support, unlike a slew of MacOS machines. (See, every thread on HN where some subset of people report problems with external monitors).<p>Windows has insane hardware support, buy whatever upgrade is on sale today, throw it in your machine, and odds are it&#x27;ll just work.<p>Speaking of insane hardware support, my current Windows install has switched motherboards and CPUs multiple times. Pop the SSD into a new computer, boot, wait a few minutes for the OS to setup proper drivers, and off I go.<p>The UI is a first class citizen, not an afterthought. At no point do I have to wonder if my setup supports screen sharing.<p>Its media pipeline is pretty darn powerful. Per app volume control rocks, but the entire media stack can be rerouted, split, and merged, in all sorts of fun and cool ways.<p>The clipboard works. <i>really well</i>. I have actually seen the source code to the clipboard in Windows, a <i>lot</i> of engineering effort has gone into making it work that well.<p>Apps don&#x27;t randomly stop working because I upgrade. Major UI utilities that reach deep into the system that I started using on Windows 7 work just fine today.<p>Do I have complaints about Windows? Of course. IMHO it has gotten way to large, back in Windows 2k and even the Windows 7 days, the # of background processes on a clean install was a fraction of what they are today. My start menu only opens up every other time I click it (...). And as with every other OS, reliability has gone down over the years.<p>But Windows isn&#x27;t some half forgotten wasteland. It is the single most popular desktop OS, and for over a decade it was also the single most popular development platform.<p>Would I do docker based development on bare Windows? No, but I&#x27;ve done Android and Web development quite happily on Windows.<p>For reference, I have done C&#x2F;C++ dev on Linux, and right now I use both MacOS and Windows for dev.')
