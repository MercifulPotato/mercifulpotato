Automatons that can play chess, some real and some fake, have existed for hundreds of years and nobody I&#x27;m aware of mistook them for human level intelligences but just clever curiosities, so I think this is clearly a particularly poorly informed straw man argument.<p>I can maybe imagine someone not working in AI or unfamiliar with how computers work, and ignorant of the history of Chess automatons maybe saying something like this, but even if so who cares? It&#x27;s simply wrong. We&#x27;re not going to issue Deep Blue citizenship because Chess.<p>The gold standard test for human level intelligence has long been and still remains the Turing Test. Not hobbled, limited &quot;easy mode&quot; tests as in some recent competitions for chat bots, but a full on, no holds barred freeform dialogue including whatever games, discussions, tests and topics a sophisticated tester chooses.')
