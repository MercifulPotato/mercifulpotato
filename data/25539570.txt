Couple months ago I went to a dentist, she asked me what I do I said game designer, she said she was enjoying Genshin Impact lately, then I said something about how they&#x27;re copying BOTW. Felt really bad afterwards because what I truly think is that if a game brings joy to people, it&#x27;s a good game. Sorry for being a dick and judging other people&#x27;s favorite games.')
