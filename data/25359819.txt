Before then it was easy to navigate and finding the product that I want to buy. Now, I couldn&#x27;t navigate it well like I did in the past. And asian-sounding names products took over first few pages of result which made it difficult to filter out. And they are crap quality products. It is easily to tell which products is made in. Hint the brand name is all capitalized.')
