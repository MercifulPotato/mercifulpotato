At what point is it not worth it?</i><p>If you understand that vaccine won&#x27;t solve anything, i.e. it&#x27;ll be less effective and more dangerous than the crappiest mask. Then it&#x27;s pretty easy to just accept that you have to wear a mask around people for a long time, the rest of your life if you prefer, and live a normal life. We had lockdown only for two months in april and may, after that it&#x27;s back to normal, but in masks.')
