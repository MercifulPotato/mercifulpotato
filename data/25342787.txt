Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25344229], score=None, time=1607412317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341703, text='There&#x27;s an important detail missing from your abbreviated account and that is the individual refused to open the door for the warrant and apparently used the time to &#x27;alter&#x27; her situation.<p>So it&#x27;s not as if the police just came in like a swat team off the bat.<p>America is a dangerous place, and just like you&#x27;re a &#x27;regular person at the range with an AR and a Glock&#x27; - guns are everywhere.<p>The &#x27;normal&#x27; situation for police to be serving a warrant would be against people accused of things more physically  nefarious, and it&#x27;s probably very ingrained SOP to have weapons drawn if the individual wouldn&#x27;t open the door and some degree of aggression needed to be used to enter the premises to serve the warrant.<p>That they had their &#x27;guns out of holsters&#x27; is actually perfectly reasonable because systematically, it&#x27;s too dangerous for them otherwise.<p>That said - this was a warrant for a white collar&#x2F;non-violent crime and there&#x27;s just no excuse for pointing guns at kids, or even the former employee frankly.<p>Point being, we can&#x27;t cherry-pick just the things that don&#x27;t sound nice, and entirely decontextualise.<p>If there weren&#x27;t 500 million guns, many of them high-powered floating around out there - and Americans didn&#x27;t have a propensity for shooting at cops (the level of assertion people show when being arrested in the US is way more than in other nations, car chases barely ever happen in my home country) - then the SOP (standard operating procedures) would be very different. Cops are chill where I&#x27;m from - t least in part - because they just don&#x27;t face aggression or violence in a way that is really threatening. Fights, yes, guns in their faces, almost unheard of.<p>Given the possibly political nature of the arrest, I think it probably needs to be reviewed by the local Justice Department as well because &#x27;gun pointing aside&#x27; - the other Elephant in the room is the issue of whistleblower harassment etc..')
