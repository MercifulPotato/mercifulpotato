This also means more taxes stay local and in the communities paying them. Of course there are opposing viewpoints on if this is good or bad. But the state still gets a good portion of those taxes.<p>On the east coast some of our states have high state income tax AND high property taxes (and property is very expensive) and I’m not sure the services or infrastructure are any better than in states like Texas. At least in California your property tax is locked in, which has its own problems of course.<p>At least where I live, a good deal of today’s tax revenues go to pensions to people that retired to Florida or Arizona (or some other tax free state) in their 50’s. I think Texas has avoided this trap many states are in today.')
