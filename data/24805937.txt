It&#x27;s better to cut off the line past the point where it no longer has any data to support it.<p>In this case it&#x27;s about 2.5 years of missing data that is substantiating a claim of 2x+ increase during the same time. It&#x27;s reasonable to say it had an exponential function up until two years ago, and we don&#x27;t know what it was since then.<p>R squared doesn&#x27;t capture that inaccuracy because there is no data to compare it against during the scary time period in question. It&#x27;s just a line in a void.')
