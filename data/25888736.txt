Suspension should provide a clear statement of the exact reasons for suspension of the account (a generic &#x27;it did not follow our Community Standards&#x27; is far from exact. It&#x27;s a totalitarian standard), and should offer a path to satisfactory resolution. (And not an &#x27;adjudicated&#x27; one.)<p>Disabling should only follow a refusal to abide by those standards.
