I mean, who gives away used clothes that are still in good conditions?<p>&gt; When they&#x27;re no longer nice I wear them around the house.<p>&gt; When they get holes or stains in them I wear them to do yard work.<p>Well that&#x27;s if you have a yard and have space to store old clothes. I think most people (at least young people) live in small apartments and can&#x27;t afford that.')
