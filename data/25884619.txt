Item(by='unabst', descendants=None, kids=[25894601], score=None, time=1611425192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881800, text='The proper response to &quot;hello&quot; is just &quot;hello&quot;. I was annoyed at first, but when I saw the phone of one of the kids that kept doing it, I saw his message app had 1283 unread messages. They basically can&#x27;t keep up with each other, and &quot;hello&quot; is a way of inserting yourself in the queue. That&#x27;s them calling. You not answering is you not picking up. So ya, ignore it too if you want.<p>Communication guidelines are necessary and enforcable at a workplace, but this is also no big deal. Being annoyed by it is a problem, and really is your problem until you make it a problem for the person doing it. And it becomes a power issue. So without the guideline and without it being enforced, they may judge you for judging them or be offended by you thinking you can change their behavior.<p>With that said, communication is a skill that does seem to be lacking. A lot of so called &quot;teams&quot; will have information going around in circles in a game of telephone. Then there are those who can&#x27;t seem to grasp what is important, and keep deflecting to sentiment or respect issues.<p>Bill Maher jokes about how millineals are emotional hemophiliacs, but regardless of the characterization the problem is real. You&#x27;ll offend them and they&#x27;ll cancel you without telling you. You become someone they talk about behind your back. And you&#x27;ll cancel them for that. But cancelling each other out doesn&#x27;t work if they&#x27;re a client or a coworker that isn&#x27;t going away. If they work for you I guess you can fire them, and if you work for them, I suppose you can quit. The only other option is to learn their language.<p>Ergo, communication remains a skill.')
