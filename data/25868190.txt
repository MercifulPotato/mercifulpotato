Today, they have hybrid vehicles for all of their passenger cars, and class leading MPG in most of them. They are #1 in terms of sales volume for hybrid vehicles.<p>They have a fully sorted fuel cell vehicle in the Mirai, based upon technology that is no more expensive to produce than an ICE.<p>They are late to the game on EV&#x27;s, but the entire market is still in its early days.<p>You can bet that once the battery technology becomes cheap enough to stuff into cars with Corolla price tags, Toyota will be doing it, and they will be the #1 seller of EV&#x27;s in terms of sales volume.')
