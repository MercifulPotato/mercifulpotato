After installing into a virtual environment, I found a tutorial that said to run the vd command.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if pip would install a command in my path, and it didn&#x27;t.  I tried to run it as python -m visidata, and got a ModuleNotFoundError for _curses.<p>Is it possible to get this thing running on Windows, or do I need to do it under WSL (or another computer)?  Google turned up a package called UniCurses &quot;with syntax close to that of the original NCurses.&quot;<p>Edit: I found Windows wheels for curses here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lfd.uci.edu&#x2F;~gohlke&#x2F;pythonlibs&#x2F;#curses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lfd.uci.edu&#x2F;~gohlke&#x2F;pythonlibs&#x2F;#curses</a><p>And there is a visidata.exe in the virtual environment, which I presume is equivalent to the vd command.')
