I think what most people have are &quot;News&quot; or information Addiction. Where as news is any update on Social Media, Current Trends on Pop, Music, Movies, Tech, Politics, Economics etc.<p>There were a few research paper suggesting News being the biggest addiction, much more so than porn. And Smartphone addiction is by nature an extension of this news addiction.<p>Did my Idol post something on IG?<p>Did my soccer &#x2F; football team sign a new centre back?<p>Did Apple finally released a new Keyboard with more travel distances?<p>Did X finally win the election?<p>Did TSLA just broke though the channel and continue their gain in stock market?<p>New Covid Variant?<p>Is there a confirmation email for my job? Or you know somehow you are expected to reply your email within 30min with your current employer.<p>A lot of these are preying on our human curiosity. And Smartphone is only a Terminal, where Internet &#x2F; Mobile Network is the connection. It is the same before Smartphone with Internet on PC, or good old fashion TV.<p>We dont have an addiction to any of these devices, we have addiction to those content. And it has been like for that decades, blaming everything on Smartphone is simple and easy enough. But doesn&#x27;t really help with the real problem.')
