So I can easily see that the managers at the warehouse didn&#x27;t know and didn&#x27;t care about proper safety storage procedures for these hazardous goods, since they hadn&#x27;t been planning to acquire them in the first place. (In US legal terms, this would be recklessness).<p>However, evidently some people (their affiliation is not clear to me) <i>were</i> aware of the major risks this caused and pleaded with the judiciary to do <i>something</i> about it, to no avail. I&#x27;m somewhat mystified as to who exactly it is that recklessly put the ammonium nitrate where it is, and I think that the desire to avoid blame here is strong enough (and the blame itself widespread enough) that a proper investigation will only end in stonewalling or scapegoating.')
