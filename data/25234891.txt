I imagine manufacturing those hubs are more costly just by the nature of their design. It also used to be the case that you needed a specific frame built for a belt drive to run one, but they make breakable belts now so that&#x27;s no longer a huge restriction.<p>I have heard in Europe where bike commuting is far more common in the US where I&#x27;m living that belt drive and internal gearing are more common, but this was hearsay.')
