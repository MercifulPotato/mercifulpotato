Once I figured out how to get the content (by randomly clicking on things that didn&#x27;t look like user interface), I disagreed.  I think a &quot;usable&quot; interface means you can tell how to use it (requiring reading a manual would still be &quot;usable&quot; for complex tasks, but Twitter doesn&#x27;t have one, and is simple).<p>I think you are using a more extreme definition of &quot;usable&quot; than most people.<p>Originally, I clicked on the link, saw there was almost nothing there and no visible way of getting more, and went looking for a usable mirror in HN comments.<p>I&#x27;m 41.  I&#x27;m not a paraplegic, but I am physically disabled; I&#x27;ve spent most of my adult life unable to use keyboards, for example, and there are many ordinary things that most people take for granted that I simply can&#x27;t do.
