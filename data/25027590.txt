Alex and all the hard working staff on the show helped to inculcate in me, at a very young age, a deep desire and passion to always learn about and explore the world around me.<p>Though it’s called “trivia” there’s really nothing trivial about it. People who have no interest in these facts often express deep ignorance of the world and people from other cultures and places. I think people would come closer together and learn to reconcile our differences if we all took more of an interest in trivia.<p>Alex, you brought so much professionalism, dignity, and gravitas to the game show business. Your strength of voice and sincerity, together with the show’s simple format, elevated the game above the usual sensationalism and addictive patterns we see in other formats. Your tireless and selfless commitment to charity has made a difference to so many people around the world. Thank you and Rest In Peace.')
