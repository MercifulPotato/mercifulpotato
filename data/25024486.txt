I think people should be able to take whatever drugs they want. I think there should be a basic safety net and what we have now isn&#x27;t doing it.<p>I believe in evolution. (I don&#x27;t however believe climate change models are good enough to predict what will happen and I don&#x27;t think C02 will turn out to be the predicted tragedy. I do agree humans are affecting the climate).<p>I believe people should be entitled to the fruits of their labor and taxation of labor or capital isn&#x27;t a good idea (I&#x27;m a land and resource tax proponent). I don&#x27;t think society has an innate claim on the labor or talents of anyone.<p>I think people should be able to defend themselves and possess deadly weapons. I don&#x27;t go to church but I think people should be able to worship as they wish. I think churches should be somewhat restricted in what they can claim (for the same reasons I think peddlers of nutritional supplements should be restricted in what they can claim) but this is pretty loose and outright fraud is what I have in mind.<p>I think racism is stupid. I think slavery and communism are both horrible ideas for society and for the victims. I believe in representative constitutional government. I abhor monarchies, dictatorships, dynasties and anything resembling those.<p>Am I bad in your opinion? If you think so I feel it&#x27;s not me that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Of course I understand you may not agree with all my positions and that&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t think you are bad for disagreeing. Unless you are a slavery proponent or advocate of non representative form of dictatorship and then ya, you likely are bad. Otherwise you probably just have a different opinion.')
