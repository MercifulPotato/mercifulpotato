Can you believe how many GPUs have been cooked by this scheme?  I got a water-cooled GTX 1080 almost 5 years ago on Craigslist for $500. Usually old things like that get cheaper as time goes by, but not GPUs. Nowadays those things are going for like $800. I was hoping to upgrade to an RTX2080 or something (also a few years old now) but they&#x27;re like $1000!<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that cryptocurrency mining is mostly responsible. And supposedly long term mining just fries GPUs, so the used market is dubious anyway.')
