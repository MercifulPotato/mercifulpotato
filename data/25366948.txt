I&#x27;m all for it.<p>I think we can all agree that putting information on the internet was a mistake. Ask Google who invented running, or how many legs a horse has. The answers are clear, authoritative, and <i>obviously wrong</i>.<p>And they make billions of dollars. We&#x27;re expected to believe some Podunk in the middle of Podubkstan has more access to facts? Please.<p>The internet, as in its companies and its users, cannot separate truth from fiction. Thus, we need to simply remove all facts. An internet without the pretence of truth would be a much more honest place.')
