Or as you say, &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. Even the tiniest non-profit, village bakery might accidentally source ingredients from exploited farm workers in 3rd world countries, or pay tax dollars which goes into US war efforts.<p>The only reason we&#x27;re having this conversation is because it&#x27;s trendy to shit on FAANG companies.
