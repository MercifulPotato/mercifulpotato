The original &#x27;vision&#x27; is completely lost and you can almost hear the discussions between writers as they have to come up with new plot twists to make the story believable for yet another series&#x2F;season.<p>That&#x27;s why I thoroughly enjoyed the German show Dark. They planned 3 series&#x2F;seasons and that&#x27;s what we got: a well-thought-out show from start to finish with a single vision of how the whole thing will end. That clue in the first episode? Yep, directly related to the ending in season&#x2F;series 3 and not some, now inconsequential, detail the writers &#x27;forgot about&#x27; or changed course over.')
