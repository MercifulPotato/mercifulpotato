I created `rss-proxy` that transforms any website into an RSS feed by analyzing the HTML structure.<p>I love the idea of RSS, but many sites I was interested in stopped supporting feeds in general or did not provide a feed for the particular page I wanted to follow. It is just a proof-of-concept, hence there are limitations but you will get the idea.<p>You can try the live demo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rssproxy.migor.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rssproxy.migor.org&#x2F;</a>) or run the docker image on your machine. It comes with a little &quot;playground&quot; page, that allows you to choose the different models the algorithm found. No AI inside :)<p>Thanks for reading â€“ I&#x27;d love to get your thoughts, feedback, and ideas!')
