That&#x27;s the point I was making. See below.<p><i>&gt; there&#x27;s is no written definition of murder in Michigan</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s true of many common law crimes in many States. And where those common law crimes existed before any of the US States were formed, those States often continue to accept the common law definitions of the crimes, as developed over centuries of Anglo-American case law. That&#x27;s not what I am saying is a problem.<p>What I am saying is a problem is when there <i>is</i> a statute that makes specific law, but courts then &quot;interpret&quot; things into the statute that were never there and never intended to be there by the legislature that passed the statute.')
