The implication is that by some important metric, the sit in was indistinguishable from the terrorist attack on Wednesday. You haven’t provided any evidence for that, other than telling me that it’s bad faith to presume violent intent behind the armed people scaling walls and breaking down doors.<p>We haven’t even mentioned that many of the invaders came bearing Nazi symbols and&#x2F;or were members of known violent groups like the Proud Boys. I suppose that it’s unfair to presume that someone wearing a 6MWE shirt isn’t coming to be peaceful?<p>Obviously it’s impossible to prove conclusively whether or not there would have been deaths without law enforcement. But there are multiple accounts of them assaulting journalists. What do you think they would have done had they made it to the floor of the Senate without police there?<p>What, exactly, do you think the zip ties were for?<p>I will concede that a medical examiner has not confirmed the officer’s cause of death. But signs point to him being killed by one of the terrorists, so I’ll continue to describe it as murder until evidence arises to the contrary.')
