I do not assume that an AGI must be capable of performing optimally on all tasks in general--indeed, that&#x27;s quite impossible. When measuring the performance of RL agents, one must come up with some way of aggregating performance across many environments, but that&#x27;s beside the point of this paper. The point of this paper is that if you&#x27;re forced to use real numbers as rewards, you can&#x27;t even communicate all environments to the agent without misleading the agent. Whether the agent could perform well or poorly in the environments once communicated, is beside the point.')
