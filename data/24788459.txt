I&#x27;m not exactly sure about the psychological value of this (anyone here who knows whether such actions are of any positive or negative value to a retailer doing it? My gut tells me it&#x27;s not a good idea to incentivize the user to wait for sales, but that&#x27;s just my gut...), but there&#x27;s definitely no use to advertise cloth dryers to someone who just bought one a few weeks ago.')
