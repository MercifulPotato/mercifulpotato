Over two decades, I have seen&#x2F;read several books, but keep coming back to K&amp;R. It isn&#x27;t just about the language that makes K&amp;R great -- along with the ride also comes valuable (programming) life lessons, experience with terse language (minimum words to express maximum thought), and a lot of historical perspective that most modern books omit.<p>I would also recommend using the Steve Summit&#x27;s &quot;C Programming Notes&quot; as you work your way through K&amp;R. Pay attention to the &quot;deep sentences&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eskimo.com&#x2F;~scs&#x2F;cclass&#x2F;krnotes&#x2F;top.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eskimo.com&#x2F;~scs&#x2F;cclass&#x2F;krnotes&#x2F;top.html</a><p>And don&#x27;t skip the exercises at the end of each chapter. The discover of solving the exercises on your own is a revelation that far surpasses any benefit obtained by being told how to do it! :-)')
