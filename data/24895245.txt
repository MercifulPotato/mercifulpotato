Item(by='pjc50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603714327, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894628, text='The US replaces state religion with a religion of the state; the weird mandatory recitation of the pledge of allegiance. Nothing like that in British schools. As Arethuza points out, state religious education and the official Church of <i>England</i> are only in <i>England</i>. Scotland has various forms of protestant nonconformist and Northern Ireland had a religous civil war whose bombs were detonating until 2001.<p>The US&#x27;s leaning on the Supreme Court to make social progress is really a result of its inability to make social progress in sane ways through legislatures. The fact that it took a Supreme Court decision to legalize <i>interracial marriage</i> only two years before the Moon landings should be a source of profound shame on its legislatures.')
