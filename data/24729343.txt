No.<p>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study was inappropriate because they purposely withheld information about the diagnosis and lied about the efficacy of the treatments they were giving.<p>The problem wasn&#x27;t that they conducted the research without telling the patients. Obviously the patients were aware that they were part of a research effort, since they directly interacted with the clinicians conducting it.')
