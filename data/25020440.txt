For a while I hooked it up to read off the internet, but eventually I switched to OfflineIMAP, then to isync.  For sending I us msmtp.  Both are pretty straightforward to configure, especially compared to mutt itself.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend using notmuch if you do decide to keep that local copy of your mail, the search is pretty incredible.')
