I&#x27;m a young enough to have gone through school with zero tolerance policies and heavy use of police calls. I got a record with my school for cursing in the 8th grade. That&#x27;s right. I got suspended from a public school for 2 weeks and kicked off the football team and out of the school play for saying, &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; in shock after a kid poured something down the back of my shirt.<p>This lead to me being punished more than normal for the rest of my public schooling. Once you have a &quot;record&quot; if you so much as dare to be 5minutes late to a class they just send you to &quot;in school suspension&quot; as a bad kid for the entire day. There I met kids doing much worse things than me, and almost all of it was escalated by administration getting police involved. Police would hang around these kids to arrest them again and again, never teaching them anything.')
