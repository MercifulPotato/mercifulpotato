Doesn&#x27;t really matter, but anything that is linking to IPFS Desktop could easily link to their own distribution of the client as it&#x27;s all open source.<p>And while IPFS Desktop could start blocking content, so could torrent clients, not sure what&#x27;s different really. They both are just clients for a protocol anyone can write new clients for and both have the risk of adding blocklists and having people abandon the client, so the same risks exists for both of them.')
