Item(by='whereistimbo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604687117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006970, text='&gt; Stopping the diaphragm is extremely important because your egoic thoughts (or life situation) is tied to the diaphragm. The ego needs time to exist – a past or a future. You are consciousness and exist only in the present moment. I have not read this in a book or been told this by anyone, I have experienced this. I don’t understand all of it yet but I know my thought patterns have completely changed since activating my kundalini – time no longer exists in my thoughts. The only thing that matters to me is this present moment.<p>source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yogaforums.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;kundalini-and-the-breathless-state&#x2F;9171&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yogaforums.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;kundalini-and-the-breathless-state&#x2F;...</a>')
