If you&#x27;re planning to do software development consulting&#x2F;contracting, definitely read  on.<p>Here&#x27;s some scenarios I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1) US F500 companies are sending out documents to vendors to allow clawing back payments from your bank account number. So besides stretching out payment terms to monts, they can reverse those payments. Never sign those if you plan to be around next year.<p>2) Sometimes the staff proposing the project get cold feet in the middle of the approval process, realizing there&#x27;s career risk if the project fails for any reason. You&#x27;ll get an email like, &quot;Good news, we signed the deal but you&#x27;ll be reporting to somebody else. Good luck!.&quot; And then you talk o the new guy and he says, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter to me if this project succeeds. We just won&#x27;t pay if it doesn&#x27;t.&quot; Without a champion, there&#x27;s a sense of limbo that weighs on the project.<p>In this case, the former champions became so risk-averse that they said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you retain ownership of the product, and we&#x27;ll just pay you like it was a service instead?&quot; Bizarre, but that level of hands-off made them comfortable, and the product can be sold as-is to other companies.<p>3) Then there&#x27;s the &quot;missing key man&quot; who shows up after approval and says, &quot;This project is for my group, but I don&#x27;t want to meet with you. Just develop it and I&#x27;ll take a look after you&#x27;re done and let you know if I like it or not.&quot;<p>4) I&#x27;ve done development on 3 contracts where the big name companies had serious networking or other infrastructure issues that required workarounds.<p>One manager actually said after I arrived on-site, &quot;It&#x27;s more valuable to me if you troubleshoot the infra problems than finish the product.&quot; It turned out they had email loop problems that lost most internal emails and saturated their switches.<p>Often you get a reaction of disbelief when you tell people these anecdotes, even in the industry, but those actually happened. All of the projects were finished successfully, but the project risk increased far beyond what was expected for both sides, and relations turned from friendly to hard-nosed solely because of their internal politics.<p>The best thing you can do is ensure the project is big enough to make it worthwhile despite surprises, and to know exactly who the champions and customers are.
