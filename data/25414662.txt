It’s good if more and more people ask for plastic-free products, but don’t think that this changes anything on the individual level, especially if you consider that a lot of plastic in the oceans come from fishing nets.<p>It might actually make more sense to stop eating fish, if you want to have less plastic in your ocean.<p>So generelly: yes, try to reduce plastic, but also make it vocally (and vote) that this is important to you&#x2F;all of us.')
