I think there is something wrong with the way we are reacting to these people and it&#x27;s ratcheting up every day. I personally think they are deplorable and retrograde and, above all, willfully ignorant. But there is something wrong with this entire system and the path forward feels as untenable as the path we&#x27;ve been on.<p>There has to be a detente, but I would never suggest that amongst my orbit of people. The language of the moment is so loaded, I&#x27;d probably be called a bootlicker. At the same time I had friends calling for the gunning down of these people as they overran the Capitol.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to reconcile all of this turmoil.')
