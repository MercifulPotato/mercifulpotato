And we aren&#x27;t.  Part of the reason we are not doing enough testing is that we simply don&#x27;t have the capacity and Dr.s&#x27; are being told that capacity is restricted and tests should be carefully considered on a case by case basis.  The above is non-uniformly distributed in that there are some areas of the country where there is sufficient capacity and others where capacity is woefully deficient. Some sort of competent federal leadership on testing capacity&#x2F;distribution would help tremendously.')
