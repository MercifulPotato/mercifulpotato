If they allowed you to filter out the junk you don&#x27;t want to see and what you&#x27;ve already seen, there would be hardly anything left.\nThey&#x27;ve been losing rights to stream left and right.\nThat&#x27;s why there&#x27;s such a rush to produce their own content in other countries.  Some of that is halfway decent, but there&#x27;s a lot of formulaic, repetitive stuff.<p>And while saying that, I appreciate their high level technical staff.  These decisions are made by bean counters.')
