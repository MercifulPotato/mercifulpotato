I was generalizing based on my own education, which used Linux. I believe Windows does not do this either, but I&#x27;m not sure how many OS 101 classes teach Windows kernel :)<p>&gt; The advantage is that you find out if you don&#x27;t have enough memory when you make the system call to request it, not by having the program killed.<p>I wonder how much of an advantage this is. Memory availability is constantly in flux, and Linux at least, goes to great lengths to reclaim memory before invoking the OOM killer, which is a last resort. What if memory frees up immediately after the application gets the error return, but before the app touches it?<p>I&#x27;d trust the kernel more to manage this than applications themselves, because the kernel can make much better decisions on how to juggle things (evicting caches and whatnot). Plus, we all know how well we all test our error handling paths :)<p>&gt; (It may be time for paging out to disk to go away. It&#x27;s a huge performance hit. Mobile doesn&#x27;t do it. And RAM is so cheap.)<p>In case anyone is interested in learning more, this is an excellent article discussing the nuances of paging to disk: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisdown.name&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;02&#x2F;in-defence-of-swap.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisdown.name&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;02&#x2F;in-defence-of-swap.html</a><p>Re: mobile, does Android disable paging file mappings to disk, which happens even if swap is disabled? (Swap only affects anonymous mappings).')
