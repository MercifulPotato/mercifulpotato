Influenza virus is designed to recombine at every single replication cycle.  Coronaviruses as a whole do not do that.  We have a lot of data on coronavirus mutation rates and they are dramatically lower (1000x) than influenza.  The point is not that mutation&#x2F;recombination can&#x27;t happen (it can and will happen), it is just that this mutation&#x2F;recombination is relatively rare and we will not get the standard twice-yearly seasonal flu effect where we have to tweak the vaccine every year.')
