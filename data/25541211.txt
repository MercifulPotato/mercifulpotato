Item(by='jmmv', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1608954213, title='Show HN: EndBASIC 0.4 â€“ A web BASIC interpreter written in Rust', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hello everyone!<p>For a few years, I have been thinking about how to teach coding to my young kids and I have routinely reminisced my own experience of 30+ years ago. For me, it all stared with the &quot;simple&quot; Amstrad CPC 6128 computer and its interactive BASIC language, and I think such a limited environment was pretty good in teaching me the fundamentals.<p>Based on that, I set up a Raspberry Pi with DOSBox and QuickBASIC 4.5 for them, and they were actually quite interested in what they could achieve. But it felt a bit clunky for this day and age, especially because this did not work on a tablet so they had to be tied to a desk they are not used to.<p>Back in March, when the COVID quarantine started in NYC, the thought crossed my mind: &quot;how hard can it be to build my own BASIC interpreter?&quot;. As it turns out: not a lot but also not so little! Since then, I have been churning some code in my very limited spare time and have come up with a BASIC interpreter in Rust that is somewhat usable.<p>The interpreter runs on pretty much any system (tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows), and, thanks to Rust&#x27;s WASM target, also runs on the web. This latter part is really the most exciting part as is what allows the interpreter to be drive-tested by anyone with ease and makes it run on the iPad the kids use.<p>Just today, I published the 0.4 release so I thought of posting this announcement. It&#x27;s still pretty incomplete, but it now has a few built-in demos included. If you try it out, there is code &quot;right there&quot; that you can edit and play with to get a sense of what this thing can do.<p>Without further ado:<p>* Release announcement: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jmmv.dev&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;endbasic-0.4.html<p>* Live interpreter: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endbasic.jmmv.dev&#x2F;<p>* Project page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmmv&#x2F;endbasic&#x2F;<p>Enjoy and merry Xmas if that&#x27;s your thing!')
