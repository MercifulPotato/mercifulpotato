Item(by='mytailorisrich', descendants=None, kids=[25917030], score=None, time=1611674860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916434, text='&gt; <i>No rule requires him to confiscate the lunch of lorry drivers and then say &quot;Welcome to Brexit&quot;</i><p>Actually, a rule does require him to confiscate any meat product that someone might try to bring into the EU [1] (incidentally I believe that the USA have the same rule), which is what happened: It was a ham sandwich.<p>If you watch the video the driver was very surprised. Personally I took the customs guy&#x27;s reply &quot;<i>welcome to Brexit</i>&quot; as a humorous but factual and to the point explanation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;citizens&#x2F;travel&#x2F;carry&#x2F;meat-dairy-animal&#x2F;index_en.htm#:~:text=If%20you%20travel%20to%20the,fish%20products%20are%20also%20allowed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu&#x2F;youreurope&#x2F;citizens&#x2F;travel&#x2F;carry&#x2F;meat-dair...</a>.')
