It&#x27;s important to retain a copy in writing that they have removed your information. If a copy is ever found online (in a data breach or otherwise) you would be able to enact legal rights as a result of their GDPR breach. I would encourage people who upload data to leave &quot;fingerprints&quot; in their accounts, such as certain photos, emails, and other data that you have ONLY created on this service (for example, email your own gmail account a unique email, if it&#x27;s ever leaked, you know where it came from).<p>It&#x27;s the same way Spotify&#x27;s GDPR tool does NOT give you all the information they store, yet if you ask via their DPO (usually privacy@) you get a lot more data, rather sneaky way of hiding their true data collection.<p>ALWAYS use email or a physical letter, ALWAYS get a reply by the organization when enacting your GDPR rights, your lawyer&#x2F;legal authority will be very thankful ;)<p>AND NEVER EVER USE AUTOMATED TOOLS! The chances are, there is data that isn&#x27;t included within them. For example, go ahead right this second and submit a SAR for &quot;technical log information&quot; to Google, this data is NOT included in their official tools and you will be amazed how much they&#x27;re storing!!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9581826?hl=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9581826?hl=en</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;contact&#x2F;sar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;contact&#x2F;sar</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;troubleshooter&#x2F;1114905?p=privpol_remove" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;troubleshooter&#x2F;1114905?p=pr...</a>')
