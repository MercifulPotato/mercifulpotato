The messaging from the left for the past 10-15 years has really had very little to offer straight, white men at a <i>psychological</i> level. The rhetoric is pretty constant around wanting more diversity as a first, primary goal (meaning fewer straight white men), constant talk of privilege (you should be ashamed not just for trying to take pride in your own accomplishments, but you&#x27;re guilty of your parents&#x27; and grandparents&#x27; sins as well), hyper-vigilance against language that has even the slightest resemblance to a color or culture (no more master branch for you), doing things once seen as &quot;manly&quot; is now filtered through the lens of &quot;toxic masculinity&quot;.<p>And to be clear, I don&#x27;t even disagree with many of these ideas. But in a democracy why should we be shocked when people vote in their own selfish interest?')
