There are hundreds, if not thousands, of flu strains, since that virus is constantly evolving. But the flu vaccine can only protect against 5ish strains.<p>Some strains (in particular: Flu TypeA) are known to spread much faster than others (ie: Flu TypeC). So even if TypeC is more common, maybe Flu TypeA is prioritized because of the risk of it becoming a pandemic a year out.')
