Aside from the scare quotes are you saying that intelligence agencies only work against counter-intelligence, or are you saying they&#x27;re all collaborating. What does &#x27;dynamical&#x27; mean?<p>&gt;&quot;A combination of nearly unbounded public funds, a definite impunity and presumptuousness, and a solid position to feed the monster of the military industrial complex has led to a situation where their actions seem to be directly opposed with what would benefit the average citizen, of either their respective countries or the world.&quot;<p>I think you need to read a little more about public opinion, and about how government works. The intelligence agencies are often working against their military (navy, army, etc.) counterparts, as competitors. In addition, most people believe their government is working to further truth and justice, so they actually support the espionage agencies.<p>Your comment seems to imply that your anti-expionage&#x2F;military&#x2F;industry views are common and righteous, yet unspoken or unacknowledged. I think you&#x27;re totally wrong; there&#x27;s no conspiracy, and people have widely disparate (often inconsistent) goals.')
