I might not get back to you for a day or more <i>because I have other shit to do</i>.<p>Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t even bother to file bug reports anymore. 70% of the time my issue is already in your issue tracker, sometimes has been for years, and nothing has been done about it despite multiple users giving you the logs and whatnot you&#x27;ve asked for anyway. I could be all &quot;me too&quot; in a vein attempt to convince you you really should fix this thing, but you&#x27;re just as likely to be annoyed by the complaint and further deprioritize it in your mind.')
