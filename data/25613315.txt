I moved from smart watches back to an old Casio sgw-100. Battery life is the main reason. It&#x27;s nice just to always have a watch that works, and be able to go on camping trips and really be able to rely on the device.<p>I&#x27;ve changed the battery once in 2 years (and that was simply preventative). The fact that it just keeps on working for years at a time is a nice contrast to basically every other modern device.')
