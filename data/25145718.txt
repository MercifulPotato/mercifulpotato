It has it challenges but I&#x27;m much happier. I&#x27;m no longer building software for hire I&#x27;m solving business problems with software. The management layer of having to fill out time sheets to every quarter hour is gone. Spending hours coming up with requirements docs no one reads is gone. Unrealistic deadlines still exists but they are more realistic. It&#x27;s so much better. Maybe a change in roles would help')
