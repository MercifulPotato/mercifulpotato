I was in school.. Carleton U, where there was almost a religious zeal for Smalltalk.  They had it running on a collection of Apple Lisas which were running some sort of Mac emulation. Slow? Brutal.   After BASIC and Pascal, Smalltalk seemed impenetrable.  But we all seemed to survive.  Come that summer... employers had no clue about how awesome Smalltalk was.  They wanted COBOL, dBase, Fortran.  No work in Smalltalk... so it died for me that day.  Happy to see it&#x27;s still out there though. Fun times.')
