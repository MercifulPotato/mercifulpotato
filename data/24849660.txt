It gives no real insight and offers no solutions.  Comparing real problems with a toy is patronizing.  42 quintillion combinations might as well be zero compared to the nearly infinite possibilities of human interaction within a 24 hour period.<p>You can&#x27;t just say &quot;the solution is no one dies&quot; and work backwards. You also can&#x27;t say there is only one solution. The comparison is ridiculous.')
