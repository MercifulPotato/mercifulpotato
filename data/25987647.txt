By playing with the same amount of money each time, I can repeat the conditions and my behaviour. That is, I can easily &#x27;yolo&#x27; the same amount in a year and behave in the same or similar manner. The reason being that changes in circumstances significantly alter our behaviour and perception. By simulating the conditions I can possibly emulate the behaviour and thought process.<p>I understand that this sounds like a rationalising gambling behaviour, and in part it is, but on the other hand, making money it is a multi-objective problem.<p>Maximize net worth subject to minimizing risk and time.<p>There are many ways to play this; you can throw a considerable amount of money in stuff like AAPL&#x2F;MSFT and so on, and that is a good position to be in, infact MSFT went up 350% IIRC in the last 5 years, that&#x27;s nearly +35% YOY.<p>Alternatively, you can gamble small amounts and capitalize on the FOMO by identifying bubbles, riding them, and getting out fast enough by not getting too greedy. This isn&#x27;t the best strategy long term because you can miss good opportunities, like AMD, but this falls into acquiring more domain knowledge. Plus it sounds like trying to time the market, as many do, but I disagree. Many who try riding the bubble try to time the peak. I disagree with that approach. The goal is to get out fast enough to outpace the market.')
