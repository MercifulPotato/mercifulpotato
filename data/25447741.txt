I did make constant changes to my setup, but that&#x27;s the way it should be. Ten minutes one week, twenty minutes another, as I continued to eliminate issues. I&#x27;ve come to the realization that some have a problem with spending too much time on Emacs rather than on their work.<p>These days I use Geany as my primary editor for programming. Something that drives me crazy when I fire up VS Code is that it doesn&#x27;t have a sidebar helping me to navigate the program (showing function names and such). I&#x27;m sure I could get it working that way, but that&#x27;s not &quot;out of the box&quot; as is so often proclaimed.')
