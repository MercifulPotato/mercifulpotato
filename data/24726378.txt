It rained today too!<p>How is this still news? I mean I understand it is important for Facebook public relations to provide this information but it seems every second day we hear about another group of accounts being banned. I&#x27;m starting to think there might be full time positions at some of these news outlets for writing aricles about the Facebook and Twitter bans. Or is the real story about Turning Point, with just enough Iran to make it non partisan?<p>I removed myself from Facebook after my account was accessed by an ex, maybe I should write a story.')
