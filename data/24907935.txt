You need to consciously type the name of the repo that you want to remove. Windows used to add a lot of jumps to get something done, and the result was mindless clicking the &quot;yes&quot; button and realizing 1 second later that you deleted important information.<p>That extra hoops need to be cognitive meaningful.')
