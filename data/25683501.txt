Like, really? On paper and stuff? Haven&#x27;t written a cheque in Australia since 2000 and the only time I see it is the &quot;CHQ&quot; button on an EFTPOS.<p>* Contactless credit cards are only just a thing and people don&#x27;t have PINs, they still stick their card in, or swipe (?!?) and sign.<p>* There&#x27;s no such thing as EFTPOS which goes direct to your account, there are Visa&#x2F;MC debit cards that work in the field like credit cards, but you can overdraw and get fees charged.<p>* Discounts for cash are still a thing because the CC charge isn&#x27;t available. People get things like cash back on their spend, but then pay more for the card in the first place.<p>* Everyone worries about their credit score that changes in magical ways depending on different weird spending rules that have incentives for taking on debt but only in certain patterns that they won&#x27;t tell you.')
