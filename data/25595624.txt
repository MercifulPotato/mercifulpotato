But this might be like this just at the beginning.</i><p>It&#x27;s pretty much like this. Except for the fact that once you&#x27;ve stopped getting killed by those pesky Redacteds it brings in the Pact of Punishment, which gives you a bunch of ways to choose to make the game harder in return for new boss rewards - otherwise killing a boss you&#x27;ve already killed just gives you more Darkness, which you&#x27;re pretty much done needing at that point.<p>Also a lot of the hype for Hades is the huge amount of conversation - sit back, relax, let the gods talk, enjoy their thoughtful readings of lines written by a native English speaker who isn&#x27;t trying to emulate the bad translations of the games of their youth.')
