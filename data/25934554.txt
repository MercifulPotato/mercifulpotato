While both parties would probably agree on the existence of &#x2F;a&#x2F; problem, the definition of what needs to be addressed and how is likely to differ, and I can&#x27;t say that the latter attitude is the norm at any high productivity engineering organization I&#x27;ve ever worked at, built, or encountered.')
