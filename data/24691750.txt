I admitted that I think as much that that&#x27;s why those anchors are still allowed to &quot;weigh them down&quot;; they are still profitable <i>for the moment</i>. (I also think Ghosn&#x27;s attempt to jettison Nissan America was a small part of his overall weird ouster; it&#x27;s actually the easiest part of the whole craziness to understand. Investors rarely want long term plans &quot;sabotaging&quot; currently [short term] profitable sub-units, and scrutiny of that plan lead to scrutiny of other plans and personal matters.)<p>&gt; Most of the tech that Nissan and Honda of Japan developed for energy efficiency wasn&#x27;t engineered for powering the types of vehicles that Americans want to buy.<p>The Nissan Leaf is basically the same size category as Toyota&#x27;s hybrids. It&#x27;s lack of success in America seems largely a marketing failure of Nissan America than anything. <i>Especially</i> when you compare Tesla in the same time periods.<p>The argument is that good marketing tells consumers what they want to buy, rarely vice-versa. The inability to sell sedans&#x2F;compacts&#x2F;sub-compacts in today&#x27;s America may be as much a failure of imagination, and marketing than one of Americans being such a unique exception to world car trends. The marketing of trucks, SUVs, cross-overs, and other very heavy vehicles as the &quot;one true American way&quot; has been extraordinarily persuasive, but it&#x27;s not the only possible narrative, and it is easy to accuse Honda of America and Nissan America of being marketing trend followers with no spine to push new trends. Which I do; but I also recognize its hard to blame them because those trends they&#x27;ve been following have been successful (or at least profitable).')
