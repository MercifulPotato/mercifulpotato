From enterprise software, SaaS, consumer products to high-performance Gatsby websites and blogs (and lots of other tools before that). Mostly remote.<p>I&#x27;ve just build and launched a new SaaS with React (of course!), Hasura GraphQL and a Node.js backend. I have an availability of ~30 hours&#x2F;week starting around November or later this year. Mostly interested in long-term contracts where I continuously work on a product but open to anything.<p>More on my website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sebastiangraef.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sebastiangraef.com&#x2F;</a><p>- Sebastian')
