Like Pandora, except your recommendations are chosen by a real person instead of an algorithm. Downside: you get far, far fewer recommendations; upside: you can tell your recommender exactly what you want, exactly what you did or didn&#x27;t like about a track, etc.<p>Beta-testing it with some friends and family now; we&#x27;ll see if it grows into anything real!')
