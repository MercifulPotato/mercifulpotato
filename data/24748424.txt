The server then gives the authoritative answer as to &quot;what happened&quot; to all clients. The client may need to patch up any visual discrepancy that may arise from differences in the client-local simulation.<p>What you propose of course isn&#x27;t impossible and it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;d expect people with a DLT background to attempt, it just doesn&#x27;t really have much of an upside for what it requires. It&#x27;s the wrong trade-off for the domain.')
