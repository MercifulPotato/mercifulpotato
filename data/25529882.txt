Which is a beautiful dream, but...how would that even work?! Everyone just has access to every other device?<p>Or how you can be in a room full of people, but for some reason the holographic display only works for you. And good thing all you want to do is pan and zoom, because that&#x27;s about as much expressivity you get. It would be hilarious to have a scene where they struggle to get it to work, a future equivalent of &quot;Can everyone see my screen?&quot;')
