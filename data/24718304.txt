But I agree how it can be unproductive. In fact, I spent about 3 hours writing this comment. But can&#x27;t technology today save us from this pit?<p>Why not make it fun!!!<p>First ingredient is a never-ending argument which the author has exhaustively talked about.<p>Second ingredient is a common availability of the debaters or the various debater camps.<p>Third ingredient is to make the &quot;debate&quot; for public to access live&#x2F;offline.<p>Fourth ingredient is, we need a neutral person who can moderate and more importantly co-ordinate this. Why not ask HN-ers; its just another Ask HN post away? Is it against community guidelines? And if this person is a little elder that the debators, the much better.<p>The fifth and final ingredient, is a self-pledge. Towards 3 things - tolerance, civility, and, anti-social-dilemma. Think all dimensions of tolerance. Time. The relative age of the OP. What if the OP is a student or a novice? Can he&#x2F;she speak English properly? Can you tolerate the way he&#x2F;she speaks? Can you tolerate the speed of his&#x2F;her broadband connection? Know a bit of the person&#x27;s background. Can you all agree on a lingua franca? Can you not stoke any innate blood curdling racism? But once the match has begun it is going to be a &quot;social dilemma&quot;, after-match. What if I took the wrong side of an argument and now my job prospects have all gone bad...?! It is something to expect. Which is why civility is important. At the end of the debate all parties, irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, or, time zones, must dissolve peacefully...<p>I certainly don&#x27;t want a 3rd world war born out of this... :)<p>So I am literally suggesting a death match of sorts between the debaters. I am suggesting a healthy way towards unraveling your internet-anonymity. But its important to be civil. Its important to forgo the comfort of the relative pseudo-anonymity we all seem to enjoy while arguing. And the prize is a healthy argument. Sadly we all go home and eat our own cakes. If you want solace, then, take pride in the fact that this is the normal discourse of a civilization, and, you participated in it. We will have lots to love, and, hate. But that is life.<p>Today, we have the means to make this happen...Google Meet, Hangouts, Zoom, etc.<p>If this goes as dreamed, perhaps we might see sponsors from some media outlets...that is a plate with a dash of humanity in it. It is something we all might have to live with.<p>So in essence, yes, the practicality of &quot;this&quot; can be debated. At length if need be. But I think I have covered the healthy and right way to behave on the internet - anonymously or otherwise - especially when having an argument, or, not when having an argument.<p>Peace out folks!! _\\m&#x2F;')
