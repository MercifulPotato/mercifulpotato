They call it &#x27;Unified Memory&#x27;<p>It’s in the package; RAM on the die is called “cache”.<p>“Unified memory” has nothing to do with packaging.  It’s the default for how computer memory has worked since, well, the 1950s: all the parts talk to the same pool of memory (and you can DMA data for any device).<p>That’s why the term of art for, say, GPUs having their own memory, is called NUMA (“Non-Uniform Memory Access”): unified is the default.) *<p>M1 is a remarkable chip and Apple doesn’t claim that UFA is some invention: they just used the technical term, just as they say their chips use doped silicon gates.  It has become unusual these days and worth their mentioning, but it’s simply ignorance by the reporters that elevated it to seem like some brand name.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-uniform_memory_access" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-uniform_memory_access</a>')
