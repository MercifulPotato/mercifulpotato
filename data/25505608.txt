Guilty of vast human rights abuses and well paid for it. It&#x27;s an interesting question I had never considered until this thread. Societies often change in such ways over time; what&#x27;s mildly questionable today is considered an egregious human rights violation decades later.<p>If privacy is a human right, then what are the employees of big tech guilty of? Simple question, obvious answer.<p>Will societies in the future hold human rights abuse trials, looking back on what was done during this era?<p>The employees of Google and Facebook are as guilty as the management. Without the employees, none of it happens. And they have been paid like princes for the deeds that they&#x27;ve done.<p>After the robber barons, what should society do with the employees at big tech that make it all possible and knowingly assist criminal enterprises? Nobody that works at big tech can pretend to not know what these companies do at this point. These people are all morally responsible.<p>Should they be social pariahs? Should they be held responsible for the damage they&#x27;ve caused? They all know what the big paychecks are bribes meant to cover. Here&#x27;s $400k per year, have some moral flexibility, intentionally harm your fellow humans, look the other way.<p>Nobody pretends employees at Blackwater just happened to be working for an evil corporation. If you worked at Blackwater you knew what you were doing, what you were contributing to. You cashed your paycheck regardless. If you&#x27;ve worked for big tech in the past decade plus, you knew what you were doing and what you were assisting, you knew what you were being paid so well to do.')
