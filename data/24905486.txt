The student will certainly be able to multiply simple matrices and compute determinants in some simple cases, but will not be able to answer fundamental questions like &quot;what can I put in a matrix?&quot;, or &quot;what is a vector field?&quot; (the author gives 10 &quot;rules&quot; with no structure, so it&#x27;s impossible for the student to memorize them). The author throws around `R` everywhere, but all his examples use `Z`. For a book on linear _algebra_, there is very little algebraic rigor in the book.<p>The standard textbook for learning linear algebra at the undergraduate level is Hoffman and Kunz, which is far better.<p>In short, this is a poor textbook.')
