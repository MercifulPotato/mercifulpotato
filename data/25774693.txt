I attribute most of my success to luck.  I was born with aptitudes, in a stable family, white male.  I&#x27;m definitely not worth what I&#x27;m paid from a societal point of view.  I find the idea of being multiple times the median wage for chilling in front of a computer solving puzzles bizarre.<p>The idea of talking about money is slightly awkward anyway, and I guess I&#x27;d say <i>embarrassed</i> rather than ashamed?  Different culture and motivation, but a datapoint for you :)')
