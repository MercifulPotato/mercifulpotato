How can working there in 2020 not be a red flag to future employers that you stayed when you should&#x27;ve known better?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are workers trapped by visa policies or people who honestly lack the job mobility, but if you do legitimately have a choice where you work, doesn&#x27;t it start to say something about you after a while?<p>I do honestly hesitate to vilify a large class of people solely based on employment, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an entirely unwarranted question: Can you be a good person if you choose to further the agenda of evil?<p>You said you &quot;write drivers for phones&quot;. That sounds innocent enough, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s interesting work. But if that&#x27;s Android, we should consider that Android will likely be found to have been built upon a stolen platform. It was created by a man who regularly sexually harassed employees, and whom Google paid a $90 million bonus <i>after</i> they knew that. The guys who still have a controlling interest in Google have all also sexually harassed employees, and continue to profit from Android today.<p>Android has no meaningful competition[1]. Android generally is provided with terms that extend and reinforce Google&#x27;s monopoly, via a contract called the MADA. Every phone manufacturer has to agree to it, and it requires including and showcasing other Google apps. It&#x27;s operated kinda like a cartel, and Google has threatened to banish manufacturers for things like, working with other search engines, web browsers, or location providers. Hilariously, Google has tried to present this cartel as some sort of open &quot;alliance&quot;... just an alliance where they are in charge and anyone who doesn&#x27;t comply with their decisions is out of business.<p>Android was built and serves to protect Google&#x27;s interest on mobile platforms. If location services is enabled, Google collects the location of nearly everyone on earth every five minutes. They&#x27;ve been caught regularly lying or obscuring how to disable this. Google has interfered with multiple attempts to protect user privacy on their platform, and while other web browsers have moved to block tracking by ad networks, Google engaged in marketing campaigns on how blocking tracking allegedly harmed user privacy.<p>Isn&#x27;t working on this a political act? Can we separate pure engineering from the goals it furthers?<p>[1] iOS is not available to be licensed by manufacturers for use in phones. Android&#x27;s only actual competitors are like Tizen, Sailfish, and maybe a couple flavors of Linux that work on phones.')
