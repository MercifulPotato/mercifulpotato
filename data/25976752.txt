I have close to a dozen people on mine (although we don&#x27;t federate much with the network as a whole, I set it up initially for a couple of groupchats&#x2F;DMs with friends) and I&#x27;m not even close to hitting the limits of the $5&#x2F;mo Digitalocean server I put it on. Does federating with the greater Matrix ecosystem cost that much extra processing power, that one user&#x27;s chats are taking multiple gigs of RAM and gigabytes of space? It looks like the author&#x27;s using multiple bridges, which could be a problem, but my understanding is that bridges are separate programs that hook into synapse via an API.<p>I will agree that voip&#x2F;video isn&#x27;t there yet, tried it with some friends and none of us could get anything working. I did go out and set up a TURN server afterwards, but once a piece of tech fails as badly as element did for us the damage is done. E2EE could definitely be done better as well, but in another post on here I saw a comment detailing a bunch of clients (many of which were abandonware) that didn&#x27;t support E2EE at all. That&#x27;s going to kill mass adoption, since you have no idea how many people are on those zombie clients that you still need to support. I wonder if the Matrix API has a way to define versions for these purposes, to advertise the highest supported version by both the client and server?')
