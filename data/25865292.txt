You pass raw pointers to the Windows API for one, for which it makes no safety guarantees. Short of rewriting Windows from scratch I don’t see how this isn’t a fundamentally unsafe domain. Sure you could put more and more wrappers up on top (it’s not an even an issue of one-to-one translation, but how resources such as memory are wrapped), but whatever binding there is pretty much must be unsafe.<p>That it’s possible to write a safe wrapper is kind of obvious.')
