It seemed like nonsense, tracking computations with trigonometry functions given imaginary numbers, but the images: this was the first time many of the easily recognized fractal shapes were ever seen. Mandelbrot and DeVanney knew the imagery would be complex interesting, but did not expect the fantastic fractals we all know now. Fun times, indeed.')
