Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25139682], score=None, time=1605657154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25131317, text='&gt; The &quot;teapot&quot; in this case is QAnon or any specific conspiracy theory, not that any government has ever had any conspiracy. Prove or argue for a specific conspiracy and don&#x27;t hide behind that &quot;people have kept stuff secret before&quot;.<p>Am I &quot;hiding&quot; behind that?<p>Alleged conspiracies happen, or they do not happen.  I make no specific, strong assertion either way.  Many others cannot say the same though.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t that exactly what we should do? If someone (the conspiracy theorists) has a theory they should also put forward evidence for that, right?<p>Most definitely.<p>How do you feel about those who assert things like:<p>- &quot;&lt;X&gt; <i>did not</i> happen - that idea (&lt;X&gt;) <i>is just a conspiracy theory</i>&quot; (implicitly) [and  therefore it can be accurately dismissed as false]<p>- &quot;&lt;X&gt; <i>did not</i> happen, (implicitly)[we know this to be true because] <i>there is no evidence</i>&quot; (which ignores the largely unappreciated facts that human beings are not omniscient, and all that occurs in physical reality is not known)<p>Personally, I see such assertions being problematic in a number of ways, mainly: in excess quantities, describing reality in this fashion can highly distort the public&#x27;s perception of reality.')
