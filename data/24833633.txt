You could make the opposite argument -- that political voices have influenced people in the other direction. I&#x27;m not sure which would be correct. I&#x27;ve personally seen a lot of misinformation in the other direction. The top post in this thread (which I replied to) is a distillation of general sentiment and misinformation from AB5&#x2F;No22 voices.<p>Also, the &quot;against&quot; was not 40% even when &quot;for&quot; was 60%. It was 60% for, 24% against, and 16% undecided. I&#x27;m not sure where you got the number that 0% of journalists wanted to be employees but I doubt it&#x27;s actually 0%.<p>Anyways, happy to get into a deeper discussion offline -- I think there&#x27;s a lot of interesting philosophical arguments for both sides but with politics the way it is the Yes&#x2F;No voices are currently talking past each other. Feel free to reach out to me directly!')
