It&#x27;s the same problem (one of many) that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; had, in that any activity that&#x27;s illegal tends to be unregulatable. It also attracts to the market for people who are already doing illegal things.<p>I think the root of the problem is that politics in the US (and in most other places) is a popularity contest; it attracts people who are charming, lie effectively, and who&#x27;s goal is to be popular. They, of course, have other goals too, but having the accolades of the represented is a requirement, and people that seek that status end up drawn towards politics.')
