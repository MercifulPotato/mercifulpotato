But the next town over had a &quot;Sell &amp; Seek&quot; group that was essentially the same, but for small cash payments instead of goodwill.<p>One woman saw the arbitrage opportunity and started accepting pretty much <i>everything</i> that came up on the Freecycle, only to re-list it on the Sell &amp; Seek.  My wife gave away a big basket of washable diaper stuff and watched as it all popped back up, one item at a time, for $5-$10 each on that Sell &amp; Seek.  Think about the emotional ride that puts you on, from thinking you&#x27;d single handedly sorted some new young mom, to realizing you&#x27;d been suckered by this... well, not nice person.  Then multiply it by every member of that group that gave anything away in good faith.<p>The Freecycle just sort of went away inside of a month, and now all that&#x27;s left is that paid version from the next town over.<p>All it takes for one person to do this and your community dies.  Notice that she didn&#x27;t ever do anything illegal or even &quot;wrong&quot; from her viewpoint.  Just the same sort of &quot;disrupting&quot; and arbitrage that we see praised here all the time.<p>But it completely ruined a nice thing.')
