The kernel programs the IOMMU to allow access to a specific region of memory; the IOMMU then keeps devices from straying outside of that region.&quot;<p>Future To-Do: Find or create an open-hardware, open-source FPGA IOMMU...<p>(Also, such a device could be used to trap&#x2F;log errant (out of range) device DMA requests...)')
