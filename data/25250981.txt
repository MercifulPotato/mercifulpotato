It is such an ancient but important standard.<p>I just spent around one year  writing Wolfpacs, a dicom load balancer in pure Erlang. (In my spare time).<p>Question: what is your take on the headers that are &quot;undecided&quot;? For example,the headers that have either signed short (ss) or unsigned short (us) value representation. Most of the parsing is &quot;stateless&quot; but a few headers require &quot;rules&quot;. &quot;If previous headers X is Y then VR=OW&quot;. I wished they could have made the standard better in that regard.')
