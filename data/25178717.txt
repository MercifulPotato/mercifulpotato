I think the recent versions are all garbage (I guess there&#x27;s some pitfalls to democratized game-development), I play strictly version 23.0.<p>Between these two games, all my of roguelike itches are scratched. I&#x27;d say CDDA is sort of like single-player only Dwarf Fortress, and DCSS is Rogue&#x2F;Angband distilled.<p>FTL is an INCREDIBLE game, but I&#x27;ve given it up cause it&#x27;s proprietary software.<p>I also played some Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal, but imo it&#x27;s too combat focused for what RP elements are in it.<p>I&#x27;ve beaten all of these games, and DCSS around 20 times.<p>I recommend them all thoroughly.<p>Honorable Mentions:  \n1) Shattered PD for mobile\n2) Slay the Spire')
