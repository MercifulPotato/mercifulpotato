And I am sure I am not unique in this. I had to pick all that up from TV, articles etc. This might go some way to explaining the total political mess the UK is in now.<p>Sure it is interesting to learn about the Romans and the Vikings. But we could easily cut out 50% of that and replace it with learning about how the government works. Or maybe the people designing the curriculum would rather keep us in the dark?')
