The visa is permission to cross the border, but there&#x27;s the i-94 stamp which is visitor residency, so if your visa expires but you are still good with i-94 dates, you&#x27;re fine i believe (just you can&#x27;t return if you leave). Obviously it&#x27;s more complicated, i had a different visa to the one you mention.')
