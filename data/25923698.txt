There are also a lot more of those modules and it seems to have a fairly robust set of hardware&#x2F;boards that are supported.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I don&#x27;t do a whole lot in either since the boards I work on are a bit resource constrained.<p>The other thing to note is that Adafruit is putting a ton of resources into CircuitPython, I see updates&#x2F;improvements all the time from them in their git repo. The velocity in CircuitPython vs MicroPython appears to be significantly higher (and that by no means is a dig at MicroPython, I love their project and they have so much cool stuff going on).')
