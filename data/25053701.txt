I remember some of my first CS courses, everyone either had a brand new mbp or an ALIENWARE super beefy laptop.<p>I had a 300 dollar 7&quot; netbook. Turns out that unless you&#x27;re doing deep learning, etc. (which you might as well just run remote IMO), a bottom of the line intel atom processor can handle the workloads that a CS program throws at it no problem. I mean, in reality you&#x27;re doing things like solving sudoku puzzles or making some syscalls 95% of the time.<p>Admittedly, I ended up buying a desktop because I wanted the screen real estate when things got more complex, but I thought it was funny how many people had this conception that they would need to run their ray tracer from CS101 on their i7 with 32gb RAM')
