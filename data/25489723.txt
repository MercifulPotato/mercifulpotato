File manager can manage SVN&#x2F;Git&#x2F;Mercurial repositories and connect to anything. Akonadi can handle your mail and calendars at the background. Included apps (Gwenview and Okular) are very powerful.<p>Desktop effects are not gimmicky but useful (e.g: dim inactive windows). Power management makes sense and is reliable.<p>KDE can behave like anything you like and doesn&#x27;t bury power-user related features somewhere. It&#x27;s all visible. Multi-speaker &amp; multi sound card management is also better, more obvious.')
