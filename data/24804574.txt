I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s how they did it, but that&#x27;s what I would try if I were them.  You&#x27;d also want to pick the right season when the water flow was the least.  You might even be able to dredge a channel so that the water is directed away from the position of the supports.  I doubt they had a means of controlling the river flow back then, so I doubt they could have redirected the river into a temporary side channel, but that could also help if possible.')
