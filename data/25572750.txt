Item(by='zupreme', descendants=None, kids=[25577398, 25577187], score=None, time=1609265248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570207, text='&quot;Forced Labor&quot; is an active form of &quot;Slavery&quot;.  &quot;Detention&quot; is a passive form of &quot;Slavery&quot;.<p>So the choice at hand is Slavery vs, Slavery.<p>A note to the pedantic among us: I did not say &quot;Chattel Slavery&quot;, &quot;Modern Slavery&quot;, or any other modifiers.  The Cambridge English dictionary defines slavery as &quot;The activity of legally owning other people who are forced to work for or obey you&quot; and &quot;The condition of being legally owned by someone else and forced to work for or obey them&quot;.<p>I think we can safely say that this case applies, specifically because, in that country, this system of activity is &quot;Legal&quot;.')
