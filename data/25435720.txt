If I say the sky is made of honey without any evidence to back my claim and you report on my statement describing it as having no evidence, you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong. Your description of my statement is not using superfluous adjectives.<p>Anyone making a claim of fact needs to be prepared to back it up. Far too many people <i>game</i> the media by making absurd claims knowing their claims will simply be reported verbatim. Accurately reporting a claim is presented without evidence or is repeating a previously debunked statement is a necessary counter against people making absurd factual claims.<p>There&#x27;s a clear dividing line between making statement claiming fact and a statement of opinion. If I tell you I <i>think</i> the sky is made of honey I may be factually incorrect but I&#x27;m not claiming to be making a factual statement.<p>Claims of fact deserve much more scrutiny than opinions. You&#x27;re entitled to any opinion you want but you are not entitled to your own facts. When your claims of facts pose a material danger to persons or simply the rule of law, especially when they come from people with a wide audience or power, they deserve even more scrutiny than some Joe Shmoe.')
