So I&#x27;m sitting alone in cold conference room, waiting for the last interview with hiring manager. Finally middle-aged lady comes in with very serious impression on her face and first thing she says is: &quot;So, tell me why are you dreaming about working at Apple?&quot;. That moment I realized it&#x27;s not going to be good cultural fit :) When I rejected the offer their recruiter was very insistent on getting the answer whether it was the money or not. They never ever contacted me again.<p>Another funny thing I remember from that experience is that they gave new hires t-shirt which says &quot;Journey is the reward&quot;. So it&#x27;s not &quot;Money is the reward&quot; but some mythical &quot;journey&quot;. Apple is so full of shit.')
