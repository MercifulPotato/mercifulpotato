Item(by='Dagger2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604934604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007370, text='I run my own copy of bind, and use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dns.he.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dns.he.net</a> as a slave pulling the zones from it. As a result I can actually use all DNS features.<p>I find it super frustrating that most dynamic DNS providers use their own custom API rather than just using the update mechanism that&#x27;s in the protocol itself. That said, if they support v6 then you can probably use them by installing their update client on each machine that you want a hostname for. It just won&#x27;t integrate with pfsense.')
