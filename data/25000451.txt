Windows, OS X, and on the Linux side network-manager, dhcpcd, systemd-networkd etc all have privacy addresses enabled by default. Many OSs&#x2F;distros also have RFC7217-style addresses enabled by default too, so even the SLAAC base address doesn&#x27;t contain the MAC on those.<p>DHCPv6 does actually implement temporary addresses too.
