Since this is lossy to lossy conversion (Unless your source material is lossless of course!) - you want the second encoding step to do as little as possible - so a ridiculously high bitrate is desirable. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to disable the adaptive nature of the protocol if you don&#x27;t want to, but for me I get acceptable (but definitely reduced) usable range with bitpool value in the 70s. YMMV :)')
