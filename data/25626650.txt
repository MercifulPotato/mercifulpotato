Most websites aren&#x27;t &quot;inaccessible&quot; entirely. They have some parts which work fine in screen readers and some parts which barely work at all, and which leave blind people muddling through. And they can muddle through a lot - blind people don&#x27;t have much choice a lot of the time.<p>So incremental improvements like this can still be very helpful.
