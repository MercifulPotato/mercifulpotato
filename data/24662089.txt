We used to be pretty significant users of Pub&#x2F;Sub but migrated to Cloud Tasks after several discussions with our account manager indicated this wasn&#x27;t the direction they wanted to go with PubSub.<p>The implementation here also seems to be somewhat unusual at first glass - in particular that a retry of any given tasks appears to also retry any subsequent message with the same &quot;ordering key&quot;.<p>I do wonder what use cases this is targeted that wouldn&#x27;t require pretty extensive work on the application side to ensure good idempotency. Does anyone have any ideas of problems this would solve in and of itself?')
