I also am very sympathetic to anti Apple arguments framed in the context of their proprietary standards which just seem obnoxious.<p>BUT.<p>Neither of those imply to me that people should be building their own computers. My life revolves around computers, either at work, or in my primary leisure time. I am well incentivized to learn more about them. My mom&#x27;s life does not, it revolves around her garden. My best friend&#x27;s life does not, it revolves around his wife and son. Could these people learn to build a computer and get a better one for cheaper by building? Yes. Would they rather pay someone or some company a small premium to build it for them so they can  live their life? Yes.<p>This also pertains to the car example leading the article, as well as the existence of professional accountants, stock brokers, paralegals, lawyers, librarians, dietitians, electricians, plumbers, arborists, etc. I could do anything I want for cheaper by putting my own effort into it, but life is way too short to do everything, especially things I have no interest in.')
