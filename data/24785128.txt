This is pretty much the norm since Day 1. So I find it surprising it is the those from America that complains. ( That is not to say Apple is without its flaws here )<p>Before iPhone was available Sim-Free and Worldwide. Apple had always been using the same marketing. iPhone starts at $199 with AT&amp;T. The same headline without AT&amp;T get printed all around the Internet and during the iPhone 4 era, even on local news and paper press.<p>And all these price are without Tax, which is something new to those from EU of other part of the world, where everything included in the consumer pricing. So by the time Apple started publishing its Sim Free Price, most around the world are complaining ( and God Damn it they still do today ) the US price and EU &#x2F; AUS &#x2F; CA &#x2F; UK price dont make sense.<p>So this really isn&#x27;t anything new.<p>Then there is mmWave, which is only available in the US iPhone.<p>Judging from the Pricing around the world, it seems Apple really did price iPhone 12 at $799. The extra $30 seems to be trying to recoup the mmWave margin specifically for US. And personally I would much rather pay $30 more for mmWave so I could play around with it down the road when it is available than to upgrade my Phone again.')
