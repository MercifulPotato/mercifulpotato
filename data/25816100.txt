That&#x27;s one of my criteria to start taking this seriously. Though I could be persuaded other ways.<p>Do you have any data to back this up?<p>Do any internet security suites (whose job it is to &quot;protect people from viruses&quot;) advocate disabling JS?<p>Is Apple Safari switching off JS?<p>Are there popular Chrome extensions that do this?<p>If it&#x27;s really that important to you, you can probably go help make one of the above happen.<p>Actually I care about front-end performance a great deal. I advocate for it, as well as server side rendering.<p>I&#x27;m just not convinced about the evils of JS. I routinely have plenty of tabs open and if my fan starts running I close the one that&#x27;s using the most CPU. Half the time it&#x27;s Slack.<p>So far, &quot;I&#x27;ve disabled JS&quot; translates in my mind to &quot;tech extremist&quot;. Not seeing a lot of people doing it and not believing the reasons. At least not yet.<p>My technical decisions are driven by efficacy, expediency, skill marketability and what I enjoy working with. If you want to change my mind you&#x27;ll need to speak to those factors.')
