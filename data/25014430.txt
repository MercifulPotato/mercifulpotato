What if the reverse proxy is dynamically configured and our application didn&#x27;t register itself properly?<p><i>They _do_ understand http status codes and can act accordingly, like retrying requests, not caching responses, etc as appropriate.</i><p>Of course applications should return HTTP codes when appropriate e.g 500. The principle is that using HTTP codes for application specific information e.g item not found in DB, is a blunt instrument.<p><i>They have no way to unpack and interpret every developers pet error format.</i><p>I would argue that they don&#x27;t need to. The conversation is between client and API at higher level than HTTP. HTTP  codes are great for information such as &quot;its broken&quot;, &quot;please authenticate&quot;, &quot;its busy&quot;. But HTTP codes are not so useful for things such as &quot;item not in db&quot;, &quot;parameter x is missing&quot;, &quot;unsupported API version&quot; because this information is nothing to do with HTTP.')
