Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[24944571, 24941560], score=None, time=1604059516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941180, text='Tangent, but another interesting problem with date parsing besides lack of standardization is that it&#x27;s ridiculously context-sensitive.<p>For example, if I schedule an event for Oct 1-Jan 1 right now, the most likely (least surprising) parse would be Oct 1, 2021 through January 1, 2022. Which is both surprising because parsing Oct 1 depends on the current date, and because the parsing of Jan 1 depends on the parse of Oct 1, and because both of these depend on the fact that you&#x27;re scheduling (in all likelihood) a future event, rather than describing a past event. So whatever date parser you use (no matter how good it is at handling different notations) will return garbage if it doesn&#x27;t take all these into account.')
