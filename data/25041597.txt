Probably had to update 100+ sites with my new email address.<p>I you ask me why I did this, I might grumble about Google becoming too powerful, and my desire to decouple my life from them. And that&#x27;s true.<p>But the concrete thing that pushed me over the edge was the UI getting worse and worse and worse.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a dozen great web mail services out there, but Fastmail is the one I landed on and it&#x27;s been fantastic. But the moral of the story is that I might have stayed with &quot;evil Google&quot; longer if they also didn&#x27;t screw up the UX.')
