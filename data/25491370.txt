They always ended up breaking something in a fatal way where even after uninstalling them would leave the damage. For example now my windows won&#x27;t snap to half the screen edges (to take up half the screen) any more, just randomly. That&#x27;s just one example. Extensions have always caused me headache and mess.<p>People often claim Linx desktops are &quot;there&quot; today, but the lack of polish and glitches are still painful. Not horrible, but not comparable to Windows or Mac. It&#x27;s surely solid enough to use as the main daily OS, but you really have to stick to the defaults as customization often breaks stuff.')
