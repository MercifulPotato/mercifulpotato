If your pet areas of mathematics are more exciting to you, then share that with people and&#x2F;or post here and maybe it will get more attention. Or not! I wouldn’t dissuade people from following their interests.<p>My background - I’m a programmer and like building programming languages. I’m interested in HoTT because I’m interested in type theory generally and also formalization of mathematics.<p>Most mathematicians don’t care much about these things, which is fine. Like most weird stuff, it’s good that some folks are doing it.<p>Lastly you might enjoy this thread about why formalization is interesting to another mathematician:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;andrejbauer?prefetchtimestamp=1603845667275" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;andrejbauer?prefetchtimestamp=160...</a>')
