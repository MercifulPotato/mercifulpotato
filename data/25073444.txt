I use this a lot when watching educational videos.<p>- Youtube videos max out at 1080p.<p>- While there are decent ad blocking extensions, they&#x27;re not as good as uBlock Origin.<p>- Web pages are fast and smooth, but the browser UI doesn&#x27;t consistently feel as quick and snappy as Chrome.<p>- I once saw some rendering bugs when loading old reddit -- parts of the page were black.<p>This was Safari 14.')
