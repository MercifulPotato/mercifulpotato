I completely agree with this approach because it keeps the site clean.<p>An interesting question to ask is if HN owes it to its users to be more transparent about responses like shadow banning and provide ways to appeal such responses. Most of would say no, the current approach is working for us and we should keep it going. But then I wonder why weâ€™re ok with HN behaving like this but not large social media companies.')
