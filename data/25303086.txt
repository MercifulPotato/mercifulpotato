Metro trains in Asia, for instance, suffer fewer of those problems. The reason I believe authorities in Europe are settling on trains is because there are only a few problems inherent to trains as a technology. Far fewer than the problems inherent to cars as a technology. The problems that do exist are also far more tractable long term.')
