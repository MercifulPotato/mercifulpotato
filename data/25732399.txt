If the economy and governing institutions totally collapse, Bitcoin won&#x27;t be very useful because most of our modern large scale and complex society, including security, shared infrastructure, and the goods and services we consume are built on the foundation provided by those institutions.<p>Bitcoin has no answer for the needs provided by those (admittedly imperfect) institutions, and it seems to have the historical goal of deconstructing them.  Indeed, it can only exist if those institutions exist.')
