It&#x27;s very bland and has almost no fat, so it doesn&#x27;t taste like much.<p>You generally buy it as one ingredient in a fake-meat product. You can find it at some &quot;natural foods&quot; stores and online, but it&#x27;s much cheaper to manufacturers as a bulk product than at a consumer level. They use it to make some pretty effective fake meats, though the high-profile ones (like Impossible and Beyond) use related-but-different products.')
