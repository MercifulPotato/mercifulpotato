Here, it specifically refers to the banded patterning on the blades, and it&#x27;s talking about the metallurgy that produces them.  Apparently it&#x27;s not only the crucible process that&#x27;s required, but a specific range of alloys that produce the required separation when melted.  And that actually did disappear, no one was making these for quite some time, and (apparently) routine crucible steel (which still works very well for weapons) from other ores doesn&#x27;t show the same pattern.')
