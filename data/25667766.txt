That might not seem relevant until you realize that it means half of all programmers have less than 5 years experience. If you have 10 years in the industry, you&#x27;re more senior than 75% of your co-workers.<p>That&#x27;s why anyone with 5 years on the job is considered &quot;senior&quot;, even though most in most professions you&#x27;re just getting out of the entry level after 5 years.')
