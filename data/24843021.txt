If a professor can teach it to a bunch of lower-division undergraduates in a single class and receive their reports in a uniform format then it&#x27;ll be a hit.<p>A bigger barrier here is that we had to know how to apply propagation of errors, so although we could use a tool like this to do the calculation we still had to generate a set of equations for the lower bound, best estimate, and upper bound. There&#x27;s a seductive argument to be made for just plugging those equations into Excel instead of using them to validate that the Julia functions are working correctly.')
