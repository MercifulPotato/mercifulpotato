Rather than have Gnome VS KDE fighting it out, why not simply choose one as a base, and hack it up to allow for the other one&#x27;s functionality? Both teams could then use a shared codebase, and provide tailored customizations of how to run it. I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s impossible to make GNOME work like KDE, or KDE work like GNOME, with some small code tweaks.<p>In other words, if you have two different window systems with two different ways to manage a call to a part of the window... just pick one. Then have the &quot;other team&quot; add any missing functionality. Then give it to the app devs, so the devs can make their apps according to the one standard system, so users can use the one standard system and get on with their lives.<p>How you implement it is trivial technicalities, because, as a user-facing application, the only important thing is the functionality that users want. Getting in the way of what the users want means you don&#x27;t care about them, and then why should they use your thing?')
