A real fusion rocket would fall far, far short of that. 2% efficiency would be generous. Googling fusion rocket mass efficiencies shows estimates of around 1 ton &#x2F; MW, so you&#x27;re not too far from the mark.<p>But that gets to what the Epstein drive basically is, in-universe: a 100% efficient fusion drive. No physical laws being broken, technically, just the nuclear rocket equivalent of a perpetual motion machine.<p>They do in fact go around at 1G (or 1&#x2F;3 G) thrust for months at a time in the books and show, accelerating full speed for half the trip, then turn around and decelerate for the other half, for trips to&#x2F;from the outer solar system. In the inner solar system it&#x27;s only a few days to weeks to get anywhere. This lets them operate in artificial gravity without spinning the spacecraft, which is convenient for filming (although it&#x27;s in the source novels too).')
