Quite the opposite.<p>You don&#x27;t see how a lack of competition keeps prices unfairly high?<p>&gt; I like the walled garden and have no interest in it going away<p>Competition does not mean anyone is taking your app store from you.<p>&gt; I like that my mom can install apps and not worry about them spying on her.<p>Well one, they do, but two, no one is taking your mom&#x27;s app store away.<p>&gt; I don’t want to input my credit card into your black box payment system that might or might not charge me correctly.<p>No one is suggesting you do this?<p>&gt; I see that it does harm developers, but that’s a different conversation entirely.<p>It harms everyone.<p>&gt; If you want to install whatever apps you want, buy an android phone!
