Because of protectionism.<p>What countries like America will do, is to turn up their media FUD to the max.  They’ll accuse the Comac airplanes of spying on you while you fly, or having hidden cameras and microphones all over the plane, to record your private conversations, and to watch you take a piss in the lavatory.<p>Examples:<p>1.  American politicians accuse Chinese train makers of spying.<p>2. American politicians accuse Chinese bus makers of spying.<p>3. American politicians accuse Huawei of spying.  Then continues to neuter their semiconductor business, their cell phone business, and their 5G business.<p>4. American politicians accuse TiKTok of spying, and forcing Bytedance to sell their very profitable business to American companies for pennies on the dollar.  (Still pending)<p>5. American politicians accuse ZTE of spying, or violating American sanctions by conducting business with Iran, and fines them $1.4 billion dollars USD.  This was so easy, and these Chinese companies are so full of cash, that it was like taking candy from a baby. Expect more shenanigans like this in the future, as all these Chinese companies are ready for the reaping by American politicians.<p>Interestingly enough, in the 1980s, American politicians accused Japanese semiconductor makers, like Toshiba, of playing unfair, and prevented their semiconductor CPUs and memory chips from being used in America.  Thus, eviscerating their business, and allowed Intel and other American companies to dominate the industry.<p>This sounds exactly like what America is doing now with Huawei’s 5G.<p>So, expect them to do the same thing with Comac’s C919.<p>This is American Exceptionalism. But they prefer to call it “Free market capitalism”.')
