This is like basic common sense. I&#x27;m not engaging in whataboutism or trying to excuse bad behavior. Market abuse, including market manipulation should be punished irrespective of who is doing it.<p>I was pointing out the fact that if you go and do it and then brag about it in a public forum, don&#x27;t be surprised that you get dinged.<p>It&#x27;s literally like robbing a bank and then going to the police to hand in the video evidence, only to be surprised when the policemen are not impressed. Yes the big guys should be prosecuted. But perhaps if you didn&#x27;t explicitly stand on the corner shouting &quot;I&#x27;m going to rob a bank and all you guys should also rob banks&quot;, the authorities wouldn&#x27;t be on to you.')
