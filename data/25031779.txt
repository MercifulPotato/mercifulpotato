Those are small enough languages that I was able to study them for a few hours and then know roughly how to solve any problem with them.<p>Perl one-liners are different in that they rely on a large set of flags and language shortcuts which are harder to remember when your main language isn&#x27;t Perl.<p>So it&#x27;s not about getting used to the POSIX utilities and text processing, it&#x27;s more about it being infeasible to &quot;just memorise&quot; all these Perl shortcuts.<p>The traditional solution when &quot;just memory&quot; won&#x27;t cut it is some sort of index to speed up the search.<p>The guide&#x2F;flowchart thing is just what I&#x27;m talking about. Botanists use a tiered index to identify plants: they subdivide the flora first by large differences in characteristics and then down to differences you need a magnifier to see. Each observation cuts the potential space by a significant fraction.<p>Something similar would be useful for this. E.g. &quot;is your input structured or free text?&quot; &quot;Are records separated by linebreak or something else?&quot; &quot;Are there fields in the records?&quot; &quot;Are you looking to perform an aggregation?&quot; And so on. I don&#x27;t know. It would be neat for many reasons!')
