And it failed spectacularly. For everyone.<p>The outage wasn&#x27;t global and didn&#x27;t impact everyone ? It kept working for me and others in my contact list but some couldn&#x27;t send messages.<p>Also, if @matrix.org fails or @something fails then it impact users who wants to interact with both those addresses. So in the end it&#x27;s not that much different for users.<p>I think you comment about the will of the people is a bit off the rails. If anything the whatsapp exodus shows it&#x27;s not true since we are seeing people moving from whatsapp to signal.<p>When I run my own matrix instance I am still dependent on the matrix guys and what they want to do with the protocol and the de facto only matrix server&#x27;s code. I can&#x27;t fix anything with my instance but basic proxy&#x2F;ssl&#x2F;dns errors. I can&#x27;t get the ship to stir in any directions. There are no matrix board where I could voice my concerns about stickers or the default colourscheme. Just like Signal.')
