However</i>...<p>The first spade is free speech itself. Neither the custom nor the law applies to YouTube. In theory, it&#x27;s a private site that chooses what videos it shows. In practice, youtube is a newly powerful monopoly. Both YouTube and Alphabet. There&#x27;s a tension here.<p>In 2020 reality, political freedoms such as speech, association and even religion are realized on Google, facebook and co. When a politician or activist speaks to voters, it&#x27;s on youtube. Whether or not breastfeeding is obscene is a Youtube decision. This isn&#x27;t absolute, but it is to a large and increasing extent true. Your freedom of speech is violated in all but the most technical sense when fb, twitter, and&#x2F;or youtube shut your mouth.<p>Social media is not a market, or marketplace of ideas. At best its a strip mall where two jovial consortiums own all the stores. This is the place where people decide to vote for X, that the virus is a hoax, or that climate change is real. It&#x27;s at the heart of freedom of speech.<p>The second spade you called out well. These sites are corruptible and corrupted. Malicious misinformation spreads well here. This is already causing societal harm. They did this.<p>Another spade is reality regardless. I&#x27;m pretty confident that more, less powerful players, open protocols and such would be serving us better. This wouldn&#x27;t have fixed everything though. Shared narratives have to be enforced somehow: culture, religion, media. If everyone is on a different stream, the shared narrative is broken. This would probably be true regardless of monopoly, though I think the consequences would be less severe.<p>Shared narratives are not necessarily true. Truth is not necessarily known, or necessarily in Google&#x27;s best interest at any given time. In fact, truth is <i>expensive.</i> Formal truth seeking systems are the legal system, scientific method, drug approval process...<p>Going down this path means that Youtube (also fb, twitter) will be deciding and implementing the shared narrative. Religion? How about cults? Fringe activists? How about fringey elected politicians.<p>The final spade is inevitabilities.<p>These aren&#x27;t could bes. The really hot current issues (eg the pandemic) are also hot political and even religious issues. This isn&#x27;t nudity, which works as a canary for freedom of speech. This goes to the heart of political life on day 1.<p>Gotta make the star wars warning. The galactic republic fell to raucous applause. Chaos, and the need to suppress it.')
