I am certainly not an expert or in possession of special facts.<p>May I ask:  Why would there need be an <i>individual</i> behind the attempt?  If it takes (say) 1mUSD to manipulate a market, then the market is being manipulated whether 1 person does that in one $1m trade or 1000 people do it in 1000 trades each of $1 right?<p>The second possibility adds complexity admittedly.  I&#x27;d have to show they were conspiring to do it, not just all randomly making the same trade on the same day.<p>But at least some WSB members have explicitly admitted that so...<p>&gt;we somehow coordinated and we stuck with it<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kwkle2&#x2F;gme_is_a_defining_moment_of_wsb_history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kwkle2&#x2F;gme_...</a><p>There are a lot of reasons the SEC (and others) might not act on this.
