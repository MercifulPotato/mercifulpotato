That to me just seems wrong.<p>&gt; Would Twitter by OK to ban people complaining about stolen elections in some Latin American country (where we can all agree that they might very well be stolen)?<p>They indeed were (e.g. Maduro in Venezuela is a recent one). I hope Twitter doesn&#x27;t ignore such situations. There will always be a need for biased and subjective action.<p>&gt; There has been no shortage of actual stolen elections and&#x2F;or election fraud worldwide (and one would presume, in the US historically).<p>One should be really careful when talking about election fraud, to not confuse widespread systematic outcome-changing fraud (which is extremely rare) from instances of fraud (which is almost universal in any election but usually doesn&#x27;t matter).')
