If you are perceived to be forever apologizing for your own opinion, nobody is going to take you seriously, because what you ultimately lack is confidence - and if you&#x27;re not confident about what you&#x27;re saying, why should I be?<p>It is, and should be, <i>OK</i> to actually strongly state a position you hold, especially if you can back it up, and especially if the person you are responding to is going to take your criticism well (which the author did know).<p>&quot;Joe is an idiot&quot; is very different from &quot;Joe is wrong&quot; especially when Joe is definitively and demonstrably wrong (which he was in this case, the author demonstrated clearly and succinctly how to do something Joel said was difficult to do).<p>Adults are (or should be) also capable of determining when a talk is a string of personal attacks, or a mature but critical response (critical meaning evaluation, not negative). If every other phrase was &quot;Joel has his head in his ass&quot; then NumFOCUS would have certainly had a case; that wasn&#x27;t the case here.')
