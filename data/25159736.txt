Some HR departments currently fail to uphold these basic tenets in my opinion.<p>I am aware that ideals aren&#x27;t enough for policies. Example is accessibility. Everyone who hasn&#x27;t a bad day right now is for it, but can you make sure you always hold up to your own expectations? Probably not, so there is a need for mechanisms that ensure that.<p>But the impetus to &quot;positively&quot; discriminate in HR actually stems from a feeling of superiority that isn&#x27;t warranted at all. And it is also lacking elegance and understanding and I don&#x27;t even have high expectations. I just don&#x27;t work with them.')
