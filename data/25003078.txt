Item(by='seniorgarcia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604617501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002874, text='&gt;They&#x27;re sending you traffic.<p>Irrelevant traffic for every metric I care about.<p>&gt;Imagine Twitter or Facebook without link preview<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m saying. Either I care about what that person thinks might interest me or I don&#x27;t. The link preview abstract is shit anyway. Does the site title and the 2 sentence abstract really sway you? If someone wants to send traffic my way, writing an interesting abstract is not too much to ask.<p>&gt;it&#x27;s much harder to use and overall reduces the change I&#x27;ll click on a link<p>Maybe you should re-evaluate who you follow on twitter? I frankly could care less about facebook.<p>&gt;Do you think only Twitter and Facebook should be allowed publish previews?<p>I think previews are worthless regardless, I thought I made that clear. Either you care about me linking it to you or you do not.<p>*EDIT: And just for fun, here is the link preview stuff from my latest skype call with my brother: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;yO5OP36" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;yO5OP36</a><p>Look at all the value those previews added.')
