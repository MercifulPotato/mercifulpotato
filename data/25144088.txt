That said, you&#x27;re not really addressing the problem of induction. We have no reason why you&#x27;d assign a higher probability to the &quot;law of physics remain constant&quot; to the &quot;laws of physics are flipped in the next second&quot;, outside of gut reasoning.<p>If we can use gut reasoning about induction, no reason we can when we assume that quarks are a real thing, or think about this solution to the BHIP.')
