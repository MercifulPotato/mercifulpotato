Item(by='rhn_mk1', descendants=None, kids=[25550504], score=None, time=1609061074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548916, text='Slightly off-topic, but Zero-K still has some &quot;teching&quot;, just in the form of creating a supply chain of energy to the huge cannons. However, it&#x27;s messed up in that the mechanic is simply undiscoverable without a tutorial.<p>That&#x27;s sort of ironic, as I&#x27;ve been missing higher tier units, as they were as close to a disruptable supply chain as it gets in TA: build factory -&gt; make builder -&gt; build factory 2 -&gt; make tier 2 unit. Targeting builders or resources was a way to delay the coming of the next tier units. It also gave some predictability to the gameplay: not seeing tier 1 units meant tier 2 units were unlikely to come.<p>I agree with the complex mechanics, and I hate that there are so many factories, with so many units, many of them basically copies of each other. Same for defenses: do we really need 3 different anti-air towers? I much preferred the TA approach, where each unit was good at something different, and easily visually distinguishable too.')
