For instance, if the cost difference is mainly because of the cost of cold storage and transport then it’s really only the one “trade off” but it is probably more complicated.<p>Also, the Oxford&#x2F;Astra Zeneca vaccine isn’t a conventional vaccine but a viral vector vaccine which also has never been approved for use in humans. It acts similarly to the mRNA vaccines but uses a hollowed out adenovirus sheath as the transport mechanism of the RNA into the cell.')
