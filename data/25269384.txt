I want very few things, I can easily afford everything I want, and the things I might want fall into two categories:<p>1. I already know the most about the thing and have already found the one that either maximizes the utility&#x2F;price relationship or maximizes utility below my price sensitivity threshold.<p>2. I don&#x27;t know the most about the thing yet and have therefore not decided what I want.<p>The problem with the first is obvious: I either already own the thing or am about to, so the gift becomes just a cash transfer, and I don&#x27;t need or want cash transfers from my friends.<p>The problem with the second is less obvious until you know that I dislike owning things and only choose to own things when they meet the first category.<p>So what&#x27;s the answer for people with enough money and interest to buy good things for themselves?<p>Don&#x27;t buy them utility gifts if you aren&#x27;t more passionate than they are.<p>Buy them only weird sentimental things and quirky consumables that don&#x27;t have to meet a personalized utility threshold. A small piece of artwork that comes with a note saying &quot;This made me think of you&quot; carries sentimental value and will make the receiver think of giver every time they look at it. A weird chocolate with ants inside will be weird and fun and it won&#x27;t matter if it isn&#x27;t the best weird chocolate with ants inside.')
