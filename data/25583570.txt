I really appreciate that these sustainable devices exist, and I think they are a huge step forward.<p>Getting back to the initial comment I made... I think it&#x27;s important to keep a company like Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Samsung honest regarding their attention to their supplier&#x27;s ethics.  A company like Apple is going to be pretty responsive to concerns of worker mistreatment, if presented in an honest way.  If we are too quick to incriminate Apple whenever a story like this comes up, it comes off more like we have an agenda against them, especially if we are not vetting the story before expressing outrage.')
