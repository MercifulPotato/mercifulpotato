I don&#x27;t just decide where I&#x27;m going, but I also choose how to get there. Sometimes the course is more important than the destination.<p>Reliance on online nav systems is an excuse for poor roadwork planning and lazy accident management. I want robots and helicopters to take of the roads as I know them, not constantly updated paths that need to be tracked. Learned mental map of the territory should prevail. Else we&#x27;ll end up being floated over non-euclidian chaotic trajectories for reasons of economic efficiency.')
