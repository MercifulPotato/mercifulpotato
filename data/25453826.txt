But from a practical perspective, I doubt that the Dijkstra of 1988 has a good understanding of the sociotechnical reality of the present day software industry. I comment (quite obviously) not to disparage him and his outstanding achievements, but rather to highlight that we cannot expect that Dijkstra could predict the future, in particular in a realm that somewhat exceeds the domain of his expertise. For example, I think by now we have a good understanding of the relevance and importance of software maintenance. Sure, software is not &quot;subject to wear and tear&quot;, but the world around software evolves and a program that did a job well 10 years ago might not to the same job well today (think about security). We all understand this difference; i.e., I don&#x27;t think his nit-picky attacks on software engineering metaphors are particularly useful from today&#x27;s perspective.')
