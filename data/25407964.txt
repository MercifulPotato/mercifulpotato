I can&#x27;t double check the readings non destructively, so I evaluate the device according to whether in the end I hit something or not when drilling.<p>The readings are imprecise at best, with lots of false positives and possibly some false negatives (no way to know).<p>The tool is useful, if repeated readings are coupled with domain expertise, common sense and intuition.<p>If you ask me if the tool, by itself, works, I&#x27;ll reply &quot;maybe&quot;. All I know is that, aided by the tool, I haven&#x27;t done any damage yet.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the tool&#x27;s fault though. Rather, it&#x27;s the combination of non-destructive testing and the limited feedback.')
