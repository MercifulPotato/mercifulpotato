Other browsers use your operating system’s trust store and you can add &amp; remove trusted CA certs from that trust store using OS-specific utilities.<p>The big three root store programs are run by Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla&#x2F;NSS. Most (all?) Linux distros are based on the Mozilla store. Until recently, Google also used Mozilla’s store for things like ChromeOS and Android. They just recently announced that they’re gonna start running their own program though.<p>FWIW the browsers seem to do a pretty good job of policing CAs. Probably better than most end-users would do.')
