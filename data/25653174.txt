There is nothing to be gained by anything else.<p>Where I disagree with the author I guess is to suggest that some other statistically inferior model would be better because, if you had a richer set of observations, it would be shown to be true. To me that scenario is irrelevant at some level, because it&#x27;s a different scenario (I don&#x27;t agree with the author&#x27;s assertion that first move information would somehow decrease predictive information -- it might not improve it, but I doubt it would decrease it).<p>If you had information on player identities even, you might be able to model ability or something like that, and use that to improve your predictions. But then that relies on the bit of information about which players are which, beyond black and white.<p>The philosopher Quine argued that models cannot be decontextualized from the observations they are explaining, and I think that is particularly relevant in this case. At some level it doesn&#x27;t matter whether the Aliens&#x27; models are true or not, because they have no information in the scenario that they could use to do anything with.<p>The 50-50 model (per the author) isn&#x27;t <i>incorrect</i>, it&#x27;s just a (assumedly) <i>correct</i> model for the game of chess when all you know is which color won the game. If you were <i>playing</i> chess, and your pairings were random and you couldn&#x27;t see the board or what pieces were available or where they could go, etc the game would seem very similar to what the aliens were observing. A more &quot;truthful&quot; model is only relevant or useful in the context where there is more data to make it useful.')
