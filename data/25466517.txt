Sorry, but doing that is always fair game for immediate dismissal.  In fact, getting dismissed is a strictly better scenario for her in such a situation.  Now she was fired instead of having quit, qualifying for unemployment and triggering any contractual parachute obligations on Google&#x27;s part.<p>And given that, her behaviour is likely just trying to introduce spin in order to land her next job easier.  By making it about race and gender, it&#x27;s not something behavioural and so clears the situation for future employers.')
