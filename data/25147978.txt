Yes, a dedicated thief can bypass the locks and open your car, but you don&#x27;t have to leave your car doors unlocked and let anyone enter you car at will.<p>I think a reasonable middle ground might be to maintain HTTP and do HTTPS using letsencrypt.  If one of the CAs does something to limit your freedom, you could redirect https to http and turn it off.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s good to see you&#x27;re basing your argument on your principles, many people cave early and easily.')
