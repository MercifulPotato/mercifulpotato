Item(by='subjectsigma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609425467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25590124, text='&gt; This whataboutism and false equivalency is extremely toxic.<p>It&#x27;s not whataboutism, I never excused Trump nor the Republicans. They should be called out on their bullshit. If anything, responding to a comment solely about things the media has done with Senate election results is whataboutism.<p>False equivalency... Eh, maybe. The eye-for-an-eye tallying of sins never goes well and I&#x27;m not ready to try at the moment. But I will agree that Fox News has its reputation as a cesspool for a reason.<p>&gt; Are dems perfect? Lord no. Does the MSM make mistakes? Absolutely. Is one side actively engaged in a war on truth? Yeah, kinda.<p>This helped me realize the problem. You come just short of saying MSM == Democrats, other news == Republicans. Not a single line of my previous post criticized any Dem politicians, only the MSM. The previous post has at least one example of the MSM working <i>against</i> progressive values. They are not the same thing. If you consider them the same thing, I think that&#x27;s strange, because I don&#x27;t think they should be. If there&#x27;s some evidence that they are the same thing, do share, you&#x27;ll probably be adding CNN&#x27;s rap sheet of corruption.')
