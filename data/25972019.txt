ESE is the core of Microsoft Exchange Server, Active Directory, and Windows Search. It&#x27;s also used by a number of Windows components including Windows Update client and Help and Support Center. Its purpose is to allow applications to store and retrieve data via indexed and sequential access.<p>&gt; ESE provides transacted data update and retrieval. A crash recovery mechanism is provided so that data consistency is maintained even in the event of a system crash. Transactions in ESE are highly concurrent making ESE suitable for server applications. ESE caches data intelligently to ensure high performance access to data. In addition, ESE is lightweight making it suitable for auxiliary applications.<p>&gt; The ESE Runtime (ESENT.DLL) has shipped in every Windows release since Windows 2000 [...]<p>I was wondering how that might fare with the SQL Server edition meant to be bundled with apps. Besides being non-SQL seems it could be lighter keeping transactions and concurrency.')
