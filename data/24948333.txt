That&#x27;s just personal preference though.<p>I&#x27;d be fine with a &quot;source available&quot; paying solution for instance, as long as the terms of the license are reasonable. This way at least I know that if the project goes defunct I&#x27;m not stuck with apps that I can&#x27;t easily run anywhere anymore. See all these Flash games that nobody can easily play anymore.<p>An example of software that works that way is SQLite: they sell extensions as source code with a perpetual (non-open-source) license.')
