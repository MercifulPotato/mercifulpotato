Even basic recipes benefit from mise en place and wiping&#x2F;cleaning measuring spoons to do that is maddening. When using a scale the task becomes a simple matter of counting in just the same way as using measuring spoons. Using grams is the real win. Having everything in a base 10 system means less math in your head while managing the rest of the kitchen.')
