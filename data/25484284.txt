With AWS for example, it&#x27;s super trivial to get a lambda running: no EC2 instance size to choose or elastic IP address to set up.  You don&#x27;t even have to choose a back-end framework, or set up monitoring to make sure your system stays available. You can just start writing code directly in the console the very first hour you start your project if you want, and already have a functioning API.<p>When you&#x27;re working on your MVP, you can skip dev ops completely and get your infrastructure cost very close to zero.  Then if you actually do end up building a product which is fortunate enough to have to worry about scale, you can work on cost optimization.  I think this is a very relevant and valid use case for server-less.')
