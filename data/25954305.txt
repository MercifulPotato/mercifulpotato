On a side note, I should write that down in my philosophies in the future -- good comments (like yours!) are good, because they&#x27;re positive and uplifting, but &quot;bad comments are also good&quot; (paradoxically!), because they force you, they challenge you to really <i>think</i>...)<p>&gt;&quot;Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in brining to life your suggestion :)&quot;<p>Well, I greatly appreciate it, but I don&#x27;t have the time for it... I&#x27;m merely adding some ideas to the discussion.<p>You know, add some &quot;lively&quot; ideas -- to an already &quot;lively&quot; discussion! &lt;g&gt;<p>Anyway, thanks again for the kind words!')
