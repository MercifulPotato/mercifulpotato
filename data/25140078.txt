Learnt to code a bit to get stuff done, and was OK as built up proficiency. Then moved into more customer-facing stuff - gathering requirements, then coding them up. Then I stopped doing the coding. Then technology moved on under me when I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. This made me miserable - was working in IT, knew what I&#x2F;they wanted to make, but was incapable of actually producing it myself. What was the point of me?<p>Then I moved into Product Management and found it clicked. I could just write down what I wanted (or draw some pictures, design a flow) - then just wrestle that idea out of my head (which is quite satisfying). Present it, clarify it - and 2 weeks later it had become reality. It was magic. I didn&#x27;t have to do the thing I was crap at.<p>More importantly though, I started to learn how other people liked&#x2F;disliked to &#x27;consume&#x27; work. Some people seem fine with being given a picture and being told to &quot;make it just like this&quot;. Some people get upset when you don&#x27;t give them the painful new technology. Some people will blithely create something obviously stupid, as you didn&#x27;t explicitly say not to. You&#x27;re told some people are &#x27;behind with their work&#x27;, but it&#x27;s as they&#x27;ve gone out of their way to create something with elegance. Some people need to be separated from others, by the throwing of your protective body between them, as you don&#x27;t bruise easily.<p>By this point, I should probably try to write a conclusion. We&#x27;re a social species and form groups. The goals of that group become our goals. By meeting my goals, the group meets their goals, and we collectively succeed. My imposter syndrome is where I&#x27;m just looking at the gap between my abilities and responsibilities - and I feel I&#x27;m betraying the group. Feels like something useful, that&#x27;s just gone a bit too far (like an auto-immune disease). How to over-come it? Maybe be brutally honest with yourself about what you like&#x2F;dislike. What made you want to throw up and what kept you blissfully occupied in the office until the lights were turned off. Then be open about it, and ask others.<p>Simile time - I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s like office secret-santa, where you get a random name. If you know the person well, you might come up &#x27;the perfect gift&#x27; for them. Makes you happy. If you don&#x27;t, you end up buying something generic and inoffensive - a box-ticking exercise. This is just a silly activity that takes up maybe 15 mins of the year - but somehow we don&#x27;t see the latter case as an issue for the rest of the year where you&#x27;re interacting more.')
