The pigs we eat nowadays are originally the same species, now slightly altered by domestication and selection. They are sometimes considered as a subspecies Sus Scrofa Domesticus, and sometimes their own species Sus Domesticus. In any case, they are very close to each other, and I am not sure the difference between a feral Sus Domesticus and a proper Sus Scrofa would be significant. They still can mate.<p>There were indeed plenty of boars in medieval Europe, and there still are plenty of them now.')
