Someone had to supervise him (there are two crew members in the cockpit for a reason), someone gave him a medical, there is automation in the cockpit that could have at least caused an alarm, etc.<p>There was indeed a suicidal pilot that flew into a mountain, I&#x27;m not sure if you were deliberately referencing that specific time. In that case he was alone in the cabin â€“ this would have happened briefly but he was able to lock the cabin door before anyone re-entered, and the lock cannot be opened by anyone from the other side in order to avoid September 11th-type situations. It only locks for a brief period but it can be reapplied from the pilot side before it expires an indefinite number of times.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we can put that one down purely to human action, just that (to be pedantic) he wasn&#x27;t being supervised by anyone, and there were already any number of alarms going off (and the frantic copilots on the other side of the door were well aware of them).')
