I cannot think of a way to say this that is not patronising or condescending on some level. Your suggestion will not work. At all. On any level. If we implemented a system like this people would die. Hospitals and Doctors would be sued to oblivion, and rightfully so, but only if they don&#x27;t succumb to bankruptcy due to malfeasance and incompetence first.<p>Ethically building a patient administration system requires that you collect relevant information, that is patient-centric, and that identifies fully the patient, their needs, their location and their past episodes of care.<p>&gt; At this point, if you care about your privacy, you really only have the option of not engaging with the system. Or engaging as little as possible.<p>The spectrum between privacy and effectiveness with patient and clinical systems is simple and stark. If you want absolute privacy you will receive care that will be truncated, untailored, unfit and unlinked.')
