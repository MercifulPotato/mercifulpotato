Item(by='ndespres', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604547601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995375, text='There&#x27;s another gap between small family farms and huge scale enterprises. There is a lot of demand for local but quality. Whether it&#x27;s grass-fed beef, eggs from truly free-ranging chickens, or heritage breed pork that&#x27;s well butchered (harder than you&#x27;d think to find quality animal processing) people are looking for things that the more traditional farms don&#x27;t know about and the big farms can&#x27;t afford to do. I think there is a market for focused quality. Of course in the meantime I&#x27;m still punching the clock at my IT job but hope the farm can eventually sustain itself.')
