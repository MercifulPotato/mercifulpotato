Wouldn&#x27;t be a big take away now the reform of the Elector College and the shift to a direct vote from the people ?<p>As a nonUS citizen from a country in which the head of state is being elected directly from the people, I find it very unsettling that there have been cases in which the president in US elections was running behind in popular votes and by a big amount of votes, which almost happened here. I&#x27;ve tried to research it a bit but I couldn&#x27;t still understand why especially since the House and Senate members are elected by popular vote already<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any insights here')
