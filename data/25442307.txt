I still use matlab daily in my job (signal processing), and have octave on my personal laptop.  Ive played w&#x2F; the anaconda&#x2F;spyder&#x2F;scipi&#x2F;numpi suite on my own a bit, mostly cuz it seems thats gotten some momentum, but i dont have a big use for it outside work.  We are pretty deep in having a lot of tooling built up in matlab, and i dont see us leaving it anytime soon, and to be honest, I love it, probably cuz thats what im most proficient at.')
