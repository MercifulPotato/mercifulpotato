But if it&#x27;s clearly communicated, it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s just that kind of event. Here, it wasn&#x27;t clearly communicated; if the author had seen the norm, they&#x27;d have presented something else, or not at all.<p>What I reject is the idea that all spaces are somehow required to make space for criticism. There are spaces where that rule doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>We&#x27;re unlikely to find people to argue that the conference handled this well, or that the author did anything wrong.')
