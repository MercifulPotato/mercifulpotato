Apples. It feels like they have some playbook with statistics to slap when someone says something negative. If that doesn&#x27;t cut, they say that the victim should have followed the manual that says &quot;your attention should always be on the road&quot; then proceed posting a video about how thanks to the latest update they can sleep drive to work and attach a banana to the driving wheel to disable the attention safeguards.<p>If someone asks how is this an autopilot, there are usually two ways to handle it:<p>1) Autopilot is just a brand name, the self driving software is in beta, so the victim should pay attention all the times.<p>2) Autopilot is like on the planes, so only fools think that it is autonomous, therefore it was working as intended but they should have been using it like an airline autopilot. Crash due to user error.<p>I&#x27;m actually a fan of Musk and Tesla but I feel like the community engagement is very unhealthy and lacks scrutiny due to the &quot;online army&quot; of his.')
