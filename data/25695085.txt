I see this as the inevitable result of radicalization that this President has pushed for four years.<p>Shockingly when you flat out say that &quot;They&#x27;re only sending there criminals&quot; (with regards to Mexico) it has affects on how some people view and thus tread Mexicans and&#x2F;or brown skinned peoples. Repeatedly, examples similar to this have been <i>expected</i> by the left (myself included) to incite discrimination and violence to groups of people.<p>So this is, imo, the natural outcome of the President saying that the government is broken beyond belief and that it is a literal stolen election.<p>So, with all that said i don&#x27;t entirely disagree with you - BUT, this is far from an isolated incident in my mind. This is repeated escalation.')
