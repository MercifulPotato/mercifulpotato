YouTube has the right to do this as a private company, but it&#x27;s also a dangerous precedent.<p>I think a better approach, instead of broad censorship, would be simply inserting warning statement(s), at least in front of the material. They already stick in ads, so the tech is there. That way, the material is still available, but with warnings. We &quot;show but warn&quot; with many other materials (sexually explicit, violence, etc.) - I think that would be the <i>much</i> better way to handle such materials.')
