The framework&#x27;s documentation, tests and release notes work to create a relatively coherent layer above the language, which would end being recreated a thousand ways by just as many creative coders if it didn&#x27;t exist. Most of these in-house frameworks would be undocumented, poorly tested and unmaintained as soon as the lead coders left that department. Even for these standout projects that would be arguably better from a technical standpoint, none would offer the social advantage of a ubiquitous framework such as Spring provides.<p>The desire to write new code is often so strong that I&#x27;ve seen Spring being itself re-wrapped in a local flavored &quot;frameworks&quot; that only brought value by ignoring parts of what Spring could do out of the box. The solution is most often to strip off the overwrapping and bring the app back to Spring primitives.')
