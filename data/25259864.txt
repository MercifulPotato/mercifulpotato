The experimental method (xray) doesn&#x27;t take advantage of the evolutionary data.  And it also doesn&#x27;t model the underlying protein behavior accurately (xray basically assumes a single static model with atoms fluctuating in little gaussian &quot;puffs&quot; around the atomic centers, but that&#x27;s not how most proteins behave).')
