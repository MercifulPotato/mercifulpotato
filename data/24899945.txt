Your deflection and whataboutism can&#x27;t even let up for a second. In case you need yet another reminder, this thread is about Chinese camps.<p>&gt; There is a huge difference here. When you say genocide, it is equivalent to holocaust<p>You are saying this. You. You are pushing the argument to the extreme (&quot;everything is a holocaust&quot;) to discredit what is actually being said (&quot;these are mass interment camps with systemic violence and arbitrary punishment&quot;). It&#x27;s an argumentation technique that doesn&#x27;t work when the other person knows what&#x27;s happening.')
