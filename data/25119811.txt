I am very grateful that the Governor has taken the bold measure to implement an enforced mask mandate across the state, and am hopeful this will help to flatten the curve.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.governor.nd.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;burgum-announces-new-requirements-businesses-gatherings-and-masks-delays-winter-activities" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.governor.nd.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;burgum-announces-new-requir...</a><p>More and more conservative states are finding that if they don&#x27;t make masks mandatory all that winds up happening is the ICUs fill up, healthcare workers start getting sick, and things get real scary real quick (e.g. Arizona changed their tune about masks <i>REAL</i> quick when Phoenix ICUs started hitting 90% capacity).<p>I hate the government telling me what to do as much as the next person, but there are a <i>lot</i> of people out there who just don&#x27;t grasp the concept of <i>&#x27;just because you can, doesn&#x27;t mean you should.&#x27;</i><p>I don&#x27;t care if you kiss your wife or don&#x27;t kiss your wife. I do care if you stand 6 inches behind me coughing with no mask in the grocery store, and if you do that I would very much like you to be thrown out by force if necessary, because you&#x27;re putting my life and my family&#x27;s life at risk because of nothing other than some bizarre paranoia about how wearing masks makes you less of a man (not that I think you personally would do that, but I had that happen to me pre-mask-regulations during COVID in an Arizona grocery store and it <i>really</i> pissed me off.<p>A sick-looking guy with no mask on hacking up a lung in front of the deli counter at Safeway isn&#x27;t freedom, it&#x27;s stupidity. Stuff like that just happens in the absence of mandatory restrictions, and it puts everyone&#x27;s life at risk for zero reason. I wish my fellow Americans weren&#x27;t that stupid, but unfortunately enough of them are.')
