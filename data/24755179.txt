Aren&#x27;t people allowed to have their own opinions anymore, no matter if they are contrary to recorded history?<p>Are Flat Earther&#x27;s next to be classified as &quot;hate speech&quot; because they also believe something different?<p>Where does this ban on our freedom to think end? I understand this on Facebook, a private company platform and they can enact any rules they want, but, classifying people&#x27;s opinions because they differ as hate speech is just wrong and an over reach of their power. FB is a company but their reach and influence stretches far and wide, so they yield immense power, and a decision like this just seems Orwellian.<p>The message Facebook is sending is this; if you have a different opinion to the mainstream you are inciting hate speech.<p>Why can&#x27;t people believe whatever they want to? I thought we were free to think, to feel, to believe what we wanted.<p>I guess not.')
