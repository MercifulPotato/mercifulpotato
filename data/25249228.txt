Every time a farmer decided to grow more of the seeds from one healthier looking plant vs the other they pushed the envelope of the plant&#x27;s genetics a little further.<p>Look up some examples of what wild corn looked like several hundred years ago, versus how it looked at the start of the 20th century. This was all accomplished using natural processes and evolutionary pressure. Our biosphere has been a petri dish for thousands of years already. The farmers aren&#x27;t scientists wearing lab coats but they have been modifying our plants&#x27; DNA, slowly and surely over thousands of years by propagating accidental mutations.<p>The problem is that today we are reaching a point where our ecosystem is changing far faster than plants can adjust using 100% natural processes. Temperatures are rising faster than they have in millions of years, and the last time we saw such a dramatic rise in temperature it was accompanied by mass extinctions.<p>At this rate if we still want to have food in 50 years we absolutely need to do some lab driven genetic modification to add more drought and heat tolerance (among other traits) to our crops. Otherwise we are looking at a future with at best greatly reduced food variety for the vast majority of the population, and at worst outright starvation for large portions of our population.<p>Your comment is focusing on the worst possible application of GMO, but forgetting about the tremendously good applications of GMO. The solution to the problem is simple: you outlaw the negative applications, and you encourage the positive applications. If we don&#x27;t get started on this soon then we are looking at a dark future where only the richest can afford to eat like we do today.')
