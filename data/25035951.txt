Item(by='Krisando', descendants=None, kids=[25036476], score=None, time=1604936984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034418, text='&gt; I believe this is a misquote.<p>It is a legitimate known translation, not a misquote from the Ralph Manheim translation of Mein Kampf (ISBN 0395078016 &#x2F; year 1943), page 403. Other translations have similar wording on the page, although not in such a nice succint sentence.<p>Manheim was known to have gone into great effort to create an exact English equivalent of Hitler&#x27;s work for Mein Kampf.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also a morally horrific line of argument. Like saying you shouldn&#x27;t care about shooting civilians because bad people in the past have used human shields as a war tactic.<p>The point of the quote is to show there are no limits curtailing liberties, not an absolute we shouldn&#x27;t bother. The attempt to spin the quote into something else, probably because, you wish to &quot;protect the children&quot; is proving the point.')
