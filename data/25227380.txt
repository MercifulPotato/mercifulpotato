I&#x27;ve never been to America but never had a problem recognizing any object on a captcha (except some indistinguishable letters on letter-based captchas occasionally). Everything is obvious even if it looks somewhat different from its European counterpart.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much exactly is a nickel or a dime but it&#x27;s obvious to me these are coins.<p>Everybody I know (and most of them have never been to America) is Ok with these American captchas too.<p>The only problems with captchas are they spy on you (Google doesn&#x27;t actually check if you are a human, it checks which particular human you are) and annoy you.')
