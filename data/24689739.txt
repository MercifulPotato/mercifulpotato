Item(by='akersten', descendants=None, kids=[24693375, 24693871, 24690842], score=None, time=1601918222, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689642, text='Still not sure I get it. CSS makes it very easy to carve-out elements because of selector specificity.<p><pre><code>    .content * { max-width: 65ch; margin: 0 auto; }\n    .content img { max-width: 100%; width: 100%; }\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a neat demo of CSS Grid, for sure, but the above would be my much preferred way of doing this kind of layout. Maybe if there were a need for elements (quotes, callouts, etc.) in the side columns alongside the content, then it makes more sense to use Grid.')
