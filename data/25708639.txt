Why is this part up for debate? What is the truth? What&#x27;s the evidence one way or the other?<p>On one hand, Parler was the platform a bunch of right-wingers and domestic terrorists used to coordinate a half-non-violent half-violent storm on Capitol Hill. Parler didn&#x27;t moderate that, and therefore they are being shut down by big tech who has deemed they deserve to be censored.<p>On the other, I&#x27;m sure we could find some like... radical Islam groups on Twitter&#x2F;Facebook, no? Or is that the difference? Twitter + Facebook appropriately censor content and Parler didn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s as simple as that?')
