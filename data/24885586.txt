I personally won&#x27;t be an early adopter and I don&#x27;t want to do any of the work, but it would be great if lots of people get on board. I&#x27;m personally really happy with the current state of JS tooling, and I think node_modules are generally great and work fine. So I&#x27;m not too convinced about Rome or deno.<p>I&#x27;m personally looking forward to building a new toy project with Svelte, Sapper, Tailwind CSS, and Snowpack (with TypeScript, Node.JS, and NPM.) This still feels like the future to me.')
