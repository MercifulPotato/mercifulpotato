Do not force others to do it for you at the point of a gun.<p>An alternative is that we could stop enforcing property rights at the point of a gun.  What is more important; property or people?  A selfish person in a society that provides for all may feel slighted but they will live comfortably.  A selfish person in a society with strict protection of property can cause another person to die without lifting a finger.  Frankly, if it&#x27;s ethical to allow some individuals to die from neglect (thus losing everything of value) then it&#x27;s at least as ethical to allow redistribution of some personal property (losing less than everything).')
