My girlfriend and I moved out of our 600 sq&#x2F;ft apt Oakland apartment for Colorado. We now have a good sized house with a large garage for wood working and my new found love of tig welding. It&#x27;s honestly more walkable&#x2F;bikable here than Oakland. My car is unlocked with things people could steal in it right now and I don&#x27;t have anxiety about it.')
