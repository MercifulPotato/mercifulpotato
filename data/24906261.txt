Adding noise to the market is strictly an advantage for retail investors who don&#x27;t have access to high-frequency trading algorithms, pre-IPO pricing, detailed equity analysis, sophisticated pricing algorithms, or sophisticated financial instruments. There&#x27;s certainly competition amongst Wall Street firms and they do create winners and losers... but they are winners and losers amongst themselves.<p>The added noise and participation of retail investors at least somewhat disrupts their playground as you so succinctly put it, and creates arbitrage and investment opportunities. I guess one could argue that although it&#x27;s still largely exclusionary, at least it&#x27;s better than in the 1900s in terms of access, but that&#x27;s not much comfort.<p>I&#x27;m open to seeing other points of view, but at first glance this looks like it&#x27;s a good thing, to my eyes.')
