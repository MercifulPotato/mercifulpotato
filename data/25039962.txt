Item(by='dxuh', descendants=None, kids=[25041760], score=None, time=1604956332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037528, text='&gt; &quot;Best practices = don&#x27;t write bugs&quot;\nThat&#x27;s absolutely not what it means. Best practices usually means &quot;don&#x27;t use these features anymore&quot; and &quot;use these features whenever you can&quot;. And that is very reasonable and DOES get rid of a lot of the problems (not all) that are usually associated with C++, but still people don&#x27;t do it. \nI blame it many C++-people actually preferring &quot;C with classes&quot; (various code bases openly prefers this as their coding style - you won&#x27;t get those people on the Rust train either) and many people just don&#x27;t know or don&#x27;t trust it, because some of the newer features are sadly not very easy to understand properly.')
