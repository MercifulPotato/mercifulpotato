It&#x27;s about strategy as a whole over decades. Not every ad campaign is to drive immediate sales or signups (direct response). Branding and awareness campaigns can take years to run, and these are ALL diligently measured at every stage. Losses do occur do to negligence, malice, and poor execution all the time, but the brands should take some blame as well as they often feel compelled to spend. They have huge budgets that they NEED to spend regardless of they perform - sometimes due to accounting shenanigans, sometimes because they don&#x27;t know any better, etc.')
