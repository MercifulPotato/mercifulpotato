So we need to get rid of mask mandates so that people will wear masks?<p>My point is that they tried it without a mandate already. North Dakota, Arizona, Iowa, Arkansas, etc. States without mask mandates saw cases spike, ICUs filled up, health care workers started getting sick, things got scary, and they were <i>forced</i> to implement mask mandates before reaching the point where there was zero available healthcare capacity for non-COVID issues.<p>Why have so many states that initially refused mask mandates had to turn 180 degrees and mandate masks? Because nobody was wearing masks without the mandate.<p>Trump failing to encourage mask use is an active decision <i>not</i> to intervene. You seem to be saying that by failing to invade Canada, we have intervened in Canada.<p>Or maybe I missed your point? That&#x27;s definitely a possibility.')
