Yanis Varoufakis, former Minister of Finance of Greece, who has participated in the Belt and Road Initiative, makes it quite clear that China is &quot;non-interventionist to the point where we can&#x27;t imagine it&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9tJatdtv4jQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9tJatdtv4jQ</a><p>The current trajectory of sinophobia based on incorrect, overblown and unrealistic readings of CCP, indeed does not have a happy ending. That&#x27;s why the trajectory should be changed.<p>&gt; the nationalism isn&#x27;t just some reaction by their citizens to unfairness, it&#x27;s 100% cultivated by their gov&#x27;t on purpose.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, try talking to large number of mainland Chinese people first, they&#x27;ll disagree with you. Blaming everything on &quot;but Chinese people are brainwashed&quot; is just an attempt to deny reality.<p>You have an extreme view of the CCP&#x27;s brainwashing capabilities. If they&#x27;re that good at brainwashing, they would have eradicated many more down-to-earth societal problems a long time ago, such as the societal disdain for vocational jobs. They&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of the social stigma of vocational schools for years now, in order to prevent the job market from being crowded out by too many university graduates, but they&#x27;ve only had limited success.<p>Try watching some actual Chinese propaganda for a while. You&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s very primitive, not very convincing, and frankly quite bad. I don&#x27;t know why everybody keeps thinking they&#x27;re brainwashing masters without even having looked at all the materials.')
