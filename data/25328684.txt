Until right now, I never thought to disable turbo boost to make my MBP 16 run cooler or have better battery life. Now that you said it, using Turbo Booster Pro seems a no-brainer for 99% of my daily usage. Thank you!<p>My question is - is there a similar app that lets me disable the AMD GPU? Again 99% of my work does not require the discrete GPU&#x27;s power. Disabling it should help run the laptop cooler and enable longer battery life.')
