For now. A human controls its movements.<p>What’s missing is a brain. And that will come in Version 4.0. Or whenever they perfect a decision and control system, for fully autonomous decision making.<p>That’s when you should worry.<p>Or rather. You’re probably safe, if you live in one of the western allied nations. That is your privilege.<p>But a black, brown, red, or yellow person in the 3rd world should worry. Because they will be the target of America’s oppression, via this robot.<p>Meaning that: your 3rd world country had better accept democracy and western media, and have your leaders approved by Washington DC, otherwise we will deliver some  freedom to you.
