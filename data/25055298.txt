The footnotes for these numbers say the tests were done with the maxed-out previous-generation 2-port MacBook Pro:<p>&gt; Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using preproduction 13-inch MacBook Pro systems with Apple M1 chip, as well as production 1.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-based 13-inch MacBook Pro systems, all configured with 16GB RAM and 2TB SSD.<p>I think it&#x27;s a fair comparison, since the new M1 MacBook Pro 13&quot; is a 2-port model that replaces the existing 2-port models, while Apple still sells Intel 4-port models.<p>Similar situation on the MacBook Air page. The tests are done with the maxed-out previous-generation MacBook Air:<p>&gt; Testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using preproduction MacBook Air systems with Apple M1 chip and 8-core GPU, as well as production 1.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-based MacBook Air systems, all configured with 16GB RAM and 2TB SSD.')
