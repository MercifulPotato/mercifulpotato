They say it takes 1-3 business days to process.<p>As a side note, you have to close out all of your positions and transfer out all of your money before you&#x27;re allowed to close the account. This seems unusual to me from experiences with other brokers.<p>From my understanding the average retail broker will allow you to transfer you assets out to another brokerage. You can do this as part of closing your account.<p>While just transferring money out separately and keeping the account open longer isn&#x27;t a big deal, there&#x27;s tax and other financial implications to having to close your positions instead of transfer them. You&#x27;ll have to realize capital gains. You&#x27;ll also have multiple banking days in which the price could move up while your money is transferred to another brokerage to re-buy the shares.')
