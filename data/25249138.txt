Not only is Ohio right next door, but it’s also closer to the mean center of the US population (which is currently in Missouri). I don’t know if it’s actually measurably faster for West cost folks, but my application is used mostly in the Midwest and only a little on the coasts so it makes sense for me, but might be a good choice for coast-to-coast companies too.')
