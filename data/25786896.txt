A compact model is a smaller version of a model that in getting its size reduced tries to lose out on as little accuracy as possible.<p>I have a library now, that implements a subset of my promising ideas so far [1]. I am not done polishing and testing the implementation yet - hence, version &lt; 1. And I am working on some more ideas - so more theory and code to (hopefully) come soon.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;compactem.readthedocs.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;compactem.readthedocs.io&#x2F;</a>')
