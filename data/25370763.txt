Essentially kicking them to the Supreme Court to rule on constitutionality, should the plaintiffs choose to pursue it that far. I’d also like to remind everybody that Bush’s election was potentially decided by the Supreme Court over ruling the Florida Supreme Court, so trying to claim that matters like these are settled in lower courts is really just ignorant of how our justice system works. It’s probably also worth mentioning that many people claimed at the time (and still do) that Gore was the true winner of that election. I’ve never heard anybody claim people with those opinions were spreading misinformation, nor that they needed large tech companies to censor the debates they were having about the topic.<p>&gt; Trump calling it a win the night of the election is, no matter how you spin it, very close to your &quot;unaccountable central authority&quot; deciding what’s true and what’s not.<p>Your mistake to presume that I am defending Trump really backs my point here. I have made no comments defending him or any of his court action, or public statements, or any action or statements from his allies. I have only made comments in defence of reasonableness and common sense, and against mega-corps like google using their influence to control the internet in a way that suits their political agendas. The merits of his claims will be decided by our justice system, not by Google. But if you’re ok with Google dictating to the internet which sides of a political debate are allowed to exist on the internet, then I guess you and I just have very different values. It&#x27;s also a bit of a false equivalence, as the president is accountable to both the law and the electorate, opposed to Google, which is accountable to what exactly? Shareholders (theoretically)?')
