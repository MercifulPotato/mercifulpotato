Maybe it makes things harder to figure out (though not necessarily). But it doesn&#x27;t impact speed of execution, away from the bloat.<p>The other is like a fat bloated human who just got finished eating way too much. Their belly distended, they find it hard to run or lift something heavy. They are slowed down.<p>Vivaldi seems bloated in the first way, sure. It&#x27;s like, a &quot;wall of features&quot;. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to me to be slow as a result. It seems faster than Chrome, Safari, or Firefox on my (macOS) main computer.<p>True, I don&#x27;t need most of the features. (But I love a few of them, such as the OmniWeb-style thumbnail tabs.)<p>But I am not disadvantaged by them at all.<p>I generally have 5-6 browsers open, and Vivaldi recently is usually among them. If it had in-built tracking protection (like Safari), or no-effort ad blocking (like Brave), it would probably be one of my &quot;main&quot; browsers.')
