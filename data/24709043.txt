This looks to me like they&#x27;re applying deep RL to agent-based modeling. It does seem pretty silly now, but it could be promising. You don&#x27;t have to restrict these agents to any neoclassical assumptions and there isn&#x27;t any reason you couldn&#x27;t introduce firms as well. The only limit is computational power. Macroeconomics tends to look down on agent-based modeling because it doesn&#x27;t provide neat, closed form solutions. But I&#x27;ve never bought that the results from DSGE models are anything more than products of all their simplifying assumptions. After all, they seem to be the very definition of overfitedness with absolutely no predictive power. At least they&#x27;re trying something new here.')
