You should test functionalities.<p>You&#x27;re talking about integration tests and&#x2F;or end-to-end tests. I write those. Usually at the fa√ßade level, not at the network endpoint (which usually means the controller level, a shallow layer that often includes some ACL and serialization) but it&#x27;s just a matter of taste.<p>&gt; You should be able to rewrite all your app in a new language and still be confident your tests will tell you if something broke. &quot;Unit testing&quot; at the class level won&#x27;t do that.<p>Unit tests, integration tests and e2e tests are different things that solve different concerns. An e2e test will rarely expose an obscure bug within an implementation, and a unit test will rarely expose concerns in the global application flow.<p>Both have their place. And they have nothing to do with the &quot;interface vs not interface&quot;, IMHO.')
