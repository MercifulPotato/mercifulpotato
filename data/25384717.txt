For example, let&#x27;s say you need to have some of legal compliance page. But there is always changes you have to make in a bunch of regions, and the flow is constantly changing, or whatever. But why can&#x27;t this be a DSL you download and deserialize into views? Why does there have to be a hundred different native views for this that all must be part of the app? I&#x27;m hearing all these tail-end cases that one region hits and interacts with for seconds and I guess I don&#x27;t really understand why these things are not handled server-side, making the app a dumb client. After all, isn&#x27;t that how the website surely works?<p>I understand that Linux doesn&#x27;t necessarily always have the product marketing deadlines or whatnot that Uber might have, but it&#x27;s saddled with legacy code too. When things have security issues, or the API is just awful, at some point someone needs to fix it. Especially if your business is being decimated by a bug or you are lacking in APIs that meet your usecase. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as poor as a comparison as you might thing it is.')
