Experts can bitch all they want about how Neil deGrasse Tyson isn&#x27;t a &#x27;real astrophysicist&#x27;, but lets see you try to talk to the general public, or for that matter, college students starting their senior year as undergrads in your field.

We&#x27;ll call it the head-up-own-ass quotient.<p>Erlang is a very, very old project, with a historically high degree of echo chamber going on. Without active pushback from a dedicated member of the core team, such things usually end in utter chaos. It is less likely that you will achieve understanding by reading documentation of that sort, than that you will accidentally summon an eldritch horror by reading it aloud and not being very precise with your pronunciation.')
