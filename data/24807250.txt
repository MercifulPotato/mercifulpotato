My son, who normally loses interest in long songs that are a bit harder than his level, got through The well tempered clavier (one of the sample songs).<p>The timing&#x2F;spacing of the notes is a bit off though, I wish it scrolled according to beats instead of speeding up and down depending on what type of note was being played.  I understand it has to stop and wait for the note to be played, but some of the whole notes threw me off.')
