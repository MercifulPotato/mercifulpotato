There isn&#x27;t any way lotteries could rip them off any more.<p>In a hypothetically free market world, they would be dumping their disposable income in stocks sold over the counter in convenience stores, or directly through their phones, and perhaps traded without intermediaries on the blockchain, and would be developing some skills in investment analysis, along with an asset base, over time, instead of developing new lottery number picking techniques based on mathematical quackery and superstitions.')
