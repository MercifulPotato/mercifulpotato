Thanks for pointing to it!<p>However, can you change HN thread to the article title, which is: &quot;The Apple goto fail vulnerability: lessons learned&quot;?<p>I <i>never</i> used the term &quot;backdoor&quot; in the entire article, and I certainly never claimed that this was an intentional backdoor or that it looked just like a backdoor. I said, &quot;The Apple goto fail vulnerability was a dangerous vulnerability that should have been found by Apple.&quot; - but I never said it was intentional. I personally doubt it was intentional (it&#x27;s possible, but I have no specific evidence suggesting it).<p>While I&#x27;m here... ask me anything (AMA)!')
