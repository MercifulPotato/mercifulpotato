Other AMD cards may work, however, they are not officially supported at this time.&#x27;&#x27;<p>It seems like Lisa Su thinks that there&#x27;s a separate ,,gamer market&#x27;&#x27; and ,,accelerator market&#x27;&#x27;.<p>Jensen Huang understands that the same person can like to play games and train machine learning models on the same machine.<p>I&#x27;d love to switch to AMD CPU to have a portable laptop with low resource usage, as I spend most of my time travelling, but as GPUs in the cloud are overpriced (thanks to Jensen with separated pricing for servers), and internet in hotels are unpredictable, I don&#x27;t want to train models in the cloud.<p>Anyways, Lisa said that she reads all comments about AMD, so I hope she&#x27;ll listen :)')
