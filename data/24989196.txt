How does one framebuffer in a couple of lines of C?  Show me a simple program that draws a black 800x600 window.<p>&gt; you will likely end up re-implementing widgets in any case, if your app gets more sophisticated.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about that.  My &quot;app&quot; won&#x27;t get more sophisticated.  I will never ever need any widgets nor drawing directives.  Just give me a framebuffer and key&#x2F;pointer events.')
