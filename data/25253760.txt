Lithium batteries will pollute the world. We will exploit impoverished counties and extract their lithium reserves while destroying their environments. We will not clean up when we finish. Lithium batteries will pollute our water supplies here at home when they aren&#x27;t properly disposed. This is a giant environmental scam promoted to make us feel good about &quot;saving&quot; the earth. I don&#x27;t believe for a second that corporate democrats care about the environment.<p>We need widespread renewable electricity generation first anyway. Otherwise our electric cars will be running on coal.')
