Meanwhile for the Mac Mini, it depends on the SKU: the entry-level model gets a 7 core configuration, while the higher-tier model gets 8 cores.<p>This appears to be wrong. From what I can see on apple.com, the Air offers the choice of a 7 or 8 core GPU, while the Pro and mini start with the full chip.')
