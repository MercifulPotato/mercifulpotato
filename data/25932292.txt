Even static websites are &quot;strange tech&quot; to new graduates outside the HN bubble.<p>Also, developers hate mixing tech. You mentioned an &quot;interactive map&quot; in your example. This can be made with React or something like that, right? The issue is that a lot of developers will want to use React for everything else on the page, because they think it&#x27;s &quot;icky&quot; to use other kinds of tech in other parts of the website. They sorta have a point (the &quot;microfrontends&quot; discussion was a thing a couple years ago), but on the other hand they&#x27;re not considering the tradeoffs.<p>Also, the frontend is officially the centre of the application on medium sized companies (50+ devs). It&#x27;s <i>way</i> easier to add new code to the frontend and spin another microservice than to coordinate between multiple teams of backend engineers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is good or bad, btw. It&#x27;s just how it is.<p>EDIT: One thing that really bothers me that people fresh in the industry don&#x27;t really believe that websites were faster 10 or 20 years ago, so I don&#x27;t really see any light at the end of the tunnel. Sure we can do new things on the web, but what was already possible before has been made slower by our collective refusal to &quot;use the right tool for the job&quot;. Even the frontend tooling today is very heavy and slow, and I&#x27;m in a 2020 MBP. I don&#x27;t think we progressed much. React is an amazing idea (and the implementation is great), but the community has become too dogmatic.')
