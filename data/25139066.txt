More complicated stuff I usually do from the command line because I do them rarely enough, and I change IDEs often enough - that I just don&#x27;t know how to do them in IDEs.<p>I used git regularly for last 6 years and in that time I&#x27;ve been using eclipse, netbeans, kdevelop, qtcreator, visual studio and intelliJ. And a few fringe IDEs as one-offs. I would have to remember 7 different paths in nested context menus for everything. I believe it&#x27;s not &quot;unstage&quot; but &quot;rollback&quot; in IntelliJ, but I would have to check that in documentation before I do it anyway.<p>&gt; Is it even possible to selectively unstage or reset only a part of a file without a GUI?<p>Sure - it&#x27;s even faster than in gui, because you do it with keyboard only. I just can&#x27;t remember the exact options.')
