The company I am working with is willing to convert my employment to full time but that requires a H1B transfer. I looked at my approved LCA yesterday and it says Market Reaserch Analysts and Marketing Specialists. I understand the transfer will be to a Software Developer Application SOC. \nHow can I avoid&#x2F;anticipate and respond to H1B transfer complications i.e RFE and Rejections and Does it help for me to wait until the elections are over. \nThank you so much for doing this.')
