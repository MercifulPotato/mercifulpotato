Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607679640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383427, text='&gt; I think the Blaire White across a room scenario suggests that pronouns are more useful in a referential sense if they&#x27;re used in a way that aligns with gender presentation<p>I think we should have defined what we think of as gender expression. I think it&#x27;s stuff like affectations, hair styles, makeup, &quot;gendered&quot; clothing (dresses), etc.<p>Harry Styles wore a dress recently to much acclaim. He was lauded for expanding the male repertoire.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me, i.e. I don&#x27;t think most people are much more prone to &#x27;seeing&#x27; someone&#x27;s true biological sex in this kind of scenario than I am.<p>I saw a man, in a dress. And I think that&#x27;s what <i>everyone</i> saw.<p>The difference between Harry and a transwoman is - intent, which is invisible. I only know Harry isn&#x27;t trans because the article told me.<p>&gt;  I just think that thing lines up with &quot;gender presentation&quot; a lot better than it lines up with &quot;biological sex&quot; in the cases where those differ.<p>I <i>would</i> have agreed. Ten years ago nobody was going out of their way to queer everything. If a man wore a dress they either lost a bet or wanted to be seen as female. But now, in a world where nothing signifies sex, how can I read your gender expression?<p>But now a dress isn&#x27;t part of gender expression anymore and is simply a garment. I guess we&#x27;re expected to just move the bar and say that because Harry wasn&#x27;t wearing a dress <i>and</i> lipstick he&#x27;s a guy not a transwomen but that feels fleeting.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think one is expected to just recognize [Moon Gender] based on presentation. Hence, the practice of being explicit about preferred pronouns in circles that care about about this.<p>But that makes a mockery of the entire idea of gender expression. Now it&#x27;s just people demanding special labels again.<p>The whole ideology is pushed as a unit and lives and dies as a unit. Either gender expression is a thing, and there are a finite but large set of them, and sex doesn&#x27;t exist as a binary, and trans babies are real, etc, or it&#x27;s not.')
