Together with Google, they&#x27;re destroying the Internet and open computing. Soon, it&#x27;ll be all information that is locked down and controlled.<p>Computers didn&#x27;t use to be like this. Apple has land grabbed their way here and is now clamping down harder than ever before. If we don&#x27;t revolt, we&#x27;re going to wind up in a terrible place where Apple and Google make all the movies and games and we rent everything and own nothing.<p>Call your representative and ask them to put an end to this.<p>Demand open computing. You own the computer, you get to run whatever software you want.<p>(Side note: iPhones are the only computers a large segment of Americans own!)')
