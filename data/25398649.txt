No conspiracy or confusion, that was a US thing...<p>Yes, and the US didn&#x27;t for a long time because of no supplies. Chinese citizens bought out all masks in January and early February and shipped them to China, and while we were saying that this was going on and that the government should focus on not letting that happen, the media, academia and elite society called everyone racists for suggesting that and that masks weren&#x27;t important.<p>&gt;Radio waves causing a virus... there is zero evidence of that ever happening. So why would anyone believe it now... or ever<p>The theory was that it suppresses your immune system, not that it literally causes the virus to appear in your body out of thin air. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;doceo&#x2F;document&#x2F;P-9-2020-002498_EN.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;doceo&#x2F;document&#x2F;P-9-2020-00249...</a><p>&gt;actually none of the conspiracy theories were ever correct. Not one of them. Nor were they plausible to anyone outside of the lower educated half of the US.<p>Factually false.

You are, willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly, by the very fact that you believe science can be used to accurately shape policy, part of an elite class of individuals in the world that is scared the &quot;lower educated half&quot; is coming for you, and they are, because your class is corrupt beyond belief and their time is coming.')
