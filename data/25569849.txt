LNG doesn&#x27;t explode like in the movies, it needs to vaporize and mix with oxygen to burn. A leak in an enclosed space can pose an explosion risk, but that&#x27;s not an issue for a rail car sitting outside. Boiloff can potentially cause a tank to rupture, but this is easily prevented with a pressure release valve. If there is a leak, there is of course a fire hazard, but such a hazard is no worse than the leak of an oil tank. In fact, where an oil leak could potentially allow a large amount of fuel to pool up creating an explosive hazard prior to ignition, natural gas will mostly dissipate harmlessly prior to ignition. LNG transport is generally safer than crude oil transport, and a crude oil spill has much worse environmental effects. If you are comfortable with oil being transported through densely populated areas, you should be fine with this.')
