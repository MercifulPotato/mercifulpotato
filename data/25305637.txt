I understand why Sun didn&#x27;t want Microsoft&#x27;s JVM to exist. They could see Embrace, Extend, Extinguish coming for them but wow, did Microsoft&#x27;s version ever work better. I did go on to create a good bit of Java code professionally but never touched it for hobby work.<p>It really hurt Java in the browser when Microsoft refused to ship Sun&#x27;s code with Windows. Not sure why Sun assumed that after suing Microsoft about the JVM, they&#x27;d be willing to distribute Sun&#x27;s bits for them. They really seemed surprised and angry when this happened and were unprepared for it. Maybe pivoting to browser plug-ins was the only way forward they could see. Seems like the actual path forward would have been to make the Sun JVM better.')
