I guess that reflects today&#x27;s workforce, and, most likely, management.<p>It was never the company. It was <i>me</i>. The company was a corporation, and they were way too stuffy to do that whole &quot;family&quot; thing.<p><i>I</i> kept senior-level C++ engineers for <i>decades</i> (I am not exaggerating). It was a small, high-functioning team that wrote image processing pipeleines for a <i>very</i> well-known company.<p>I am aware that today&#x27;s entire management style is based on engineers staying at a company for an average of eighteen months. That&#x27;s crazy. I worked for a Japanese company, and the Japanese would barely even acknowledge my staff, until they had been there <i>at least</i> a year. It was really important for me to keep engineers for as long as possible.<p><i>NEVER</i> underestimate the impact of decent first-level managers. It is often said that armies run on their sergeants. First-level managers are the sergeants of the workforce. I was never interested in becoming a commissioned officer. I liked staying close to the ground. I&#x27;m entirely capable of doing extremely good strategy; I just didn&#x27;t like it. I had to be dragged kicking and screaming into management, and being a sergeant was as high as I could tolerate.<p>I&#x27;m a really good manager, but I also never liked it. That&#x27;s why I have returned to my engineering roots.')
