We are for businesses that have outgrown those platforms.<p>We don&#x27;t surface pricing now. We need to keep our pricing flexible since we don&#x27;t force businesses to purchase our entire platform like monoliths such as Salesforce and Oracle Commerce Cloud do.<p>Instead of purchasing Fabric&#x27;s entire headless commerce platform&#x2F;product package, many businesses purchase individual or a couple products to start. They integrate these into their existing systems, then purchase more products (SaaS) down the road and integrate those. This increases time to value and removes the need for a total replatform.<p>For instance, a multi-billion dollar company just purchased our PIM (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabric.inc&#x2F;pim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fabric.inc&#x2F;pim</a>) to start. They also want us to help with system integration. The needs and use cases are just too varied to offer blanket pricing at this point.')
