Some were given up on- the phone, but you can&#x27;t critize Azure, among many. Microsoft has developed lots of products and can develop more. They did plenty under Ballmer. When they fail they try again, or invest more effort.<p>Google has only one cash cow. They don&#x27;t know how to develop products and how to win customers. I feel like products at Google get developed when someone has a bright idea, and then as soon as they get promoted they go do other stuff, and the business isn&#x27;t really about nurturing a new product. All they care about is their big ads cash cow, with which nothing can compare.')
