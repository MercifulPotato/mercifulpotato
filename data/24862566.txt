Now the first page is all click funnel blog posts by the same 5 background check companies and ancestry.com.<p>Mentioned the term &quot;VPN&quot; somewhere in your 10 word query? Clearly you wanted a page full of sales funnel blog posts by the same 5 consumer VPN providers with big marketing budgets.<p>Want to disable Google Search ads? You can&#x27;t. You can only make them less targeted, until the ToS changes in a month, and only if you log into a phone verified Google Account.<p>Want to use an ad blocker on Google Search? Too bad. Google&#x27;s native ads continuously define the state of the art in evasion of end-user controls through endless evolution and complex adversarial misdirection even within the same browsing session.<p>Just use DuckDuckGo, and disable ads, and donate. It&#x27;s a much better user experience (even with ads).')
