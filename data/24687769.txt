If you pay a helper, some of the net income goes to you as the manager, and some to them (you can split that up however you choose). In some businesses management is hard and so the manager can skim off the top of their employees and yet their great management skills can pay the employees more than they would get along.  This isn&#x27;t one of those business where skilled management is required though, so a manager is just skimming off the top and a good employee will soon figure out they can start their own business and make more money without the manager.')
