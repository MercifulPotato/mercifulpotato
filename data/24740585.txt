Of course my usage of temp files made this much slower on multiple runs because of the page cache where traditional grep beat the approach I took because of memory speed. It wasn’t able to beat pre spout files though.<p>Most of these tools were designed expecting disks to roughly behave serially. With Ssds and raid devices you can achieve more parallelism than was imagined in the 70s 80s and 90s.<p>I think it’s an area that is ripe for more innovation.')
