And yes, several of them are in the EU.<p>As to why the governments would do this, well it&#x27;s geopolitics. The EU has some big players in the industry, but other parts of the supply chain are elsewhere. When all big geopolitical powers are interdependent, then no player will move to block another off at risk of hurting themselves. Now, both China and the US are shoveling billions into developing a higher independence (even before the trade war). Likely, the EU feels it is now forced to follow suit, or risk having e.g. the access to high-volume fabs to be a bargaining chip in future trade negotiations.')
