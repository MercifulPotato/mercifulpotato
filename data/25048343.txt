Not sure if it&#x27;s Brother itself or just the model, but my particular printer only could connect over WiFi (no ethernet option), and it kept getting confused about it&#x27;s IP address and dropping from our network. I bought a different printer after losing several hours of needing to use my limited network engineering skills to diagnose so I could print out worksheets for my kids. I haven&#x27;t had issues since.')
