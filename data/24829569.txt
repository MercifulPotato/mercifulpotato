I got tired of cheaters. Actually cheaters forced me to only play 3+2 games in the hope they would not have enough time to check each move with the engine, but lately because of better and better cheating tools and higher and higher network latency, that solution stopped working. Now I can see exactly the same trend on lichess. Last year it was a rarity to meet a cheater on lichess. Now it is happening more often.')
