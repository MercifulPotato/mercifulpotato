At first you&#x27;re OK with putting throwaway stereotypes in your work, and then you start thinking, &quot;well, why?&quot; Because if you don&#x27;t take the question head-on, you aren&#x27;t going to craft something coherent and directed towards a point or a purpose. And asking that that can lead you towards an elaborate justification, to some kind of critique, or to a nihilistic dismissal.<p>And while that can feed into culture wars issues, and popular works often arrive at the right time to be a lightning rod for them, it&#x27;s equally often a case of &quot;the real point being made is going to be esoteric anyway and only a fraction of the audience will work at understanding it properly.&quot; Especially with big productions like AAA video games, the prioritization is on rushing to produce big spectacles, and a majority of the production effort goes to the technical part of that, while the concept is kept to something easily described in blunt shorthand: &quot;you get to play as a Viking and pillage the British.&quot; And it&#x27;s like, oh, okay, gotta live up to the audience expectations here, make it a fun thrill ride with a happy ending, let&#x27;s ignore the implications. The novel stuff and minority views usually can&#x27;t get represented in such productions for structural reasons.')
