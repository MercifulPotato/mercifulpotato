Seeing him talking, it seems like himself and everyone around him try really hard not to put something cognitively challenging in his head, that will have to translate to comprehensible speech.<p>Do those in charge think one&#x27;s name and past deeds campaign on their own, as opposed to the actual candidate showcasing himself with his present words and image? Does the need to bring Donald down give a blank canvas to the other side to put in front someone unfit?<p>I am semi-sure the President can be a puppet - not by definition, but can happen sometimes I guess - since Bush Jr, that creature with the obviously sub-par IQ and cognition, was elected - and again, nobody in the US seemed to actually freak out 24&#x2F;7 with having such a man as the president. Just remember on the reason he cited for deciding to attack Iraq -  and I am not talking about the false WMD claims, but for &quot;God told me&quot;, which he stated in complete seriousness. So, when I saw that guy governing, I said to myself - it can&#x27;t be this thing having the actual power here, he does not have the mental capacity to achieve that on his own.<p>Same with Biden. He obviously does not have the mental capacity to rule, and Donald going away is not enough reason to be ok with that. I don&#x27;t even see a consensus of the type &quot;Yeah he is an old senile guy, we&#x27;ll just use him to take down Trump and then we see how it goes&quot; - everyone pretends he is normal, and that&#x27;s what baffles me.')
