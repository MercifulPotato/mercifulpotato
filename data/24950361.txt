I didn&#x27;t see a single media outlet acknowledge it. Not a single &quot;friend&quot; on FB or Twitter called it out. Not since Eisenhower had the MIC been recognized by a POTUS like that, and the reference wasn&#x27;t ignored; it wasn&#x27;t even recognized. That&#x27;s highly disturbing.<p>But it gets worse. Under the current admin the DoD budget has ballooned to nearly three-quarters of a trillion dollars. Imagine that. The POTUS is able to inflate that budget with nearly zero outrage, and then he turns around and calls out the MIC and again no outrage (about the hypocrisy).<p>The disconnect - media and public - is flabbergasting. How can this be? In plain sight??')
