Matt Risinger had a great video where they were rebuilding a 1930s house and you could see where all the moisture had built up and wept back out of the insulation, staining the wood behind the plaster.<p>My understanding is the problem with making old buildings airtight is the lack of proper vapor barriers under the house, especially if it was built on a slab. For homes built on crawlspaces, you can &quot;encapsulate&quot; them, which reduces energy losses and improves air quality. Typically encapsulated crawlspaces are ventilated and&#x2F;or dehumidified, which is supposed to stop moisture ingress into the living space.')
