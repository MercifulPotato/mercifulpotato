How many network protocols have been invented before and after TCP&#x2F;IP? I know we are talking about messaging now, but messaging is just another overlay network over TCP&#x2F;IP.<p>I&#x27;d envision in the future that the open messaging systems will be more pervasive. It will be based on local-first software and probably based on the automerge capabilities. The automerge community is focusing on collaborative editing at the moment but could someone please work on automerge solution for messaging system? This can be an excellent new paradigm for open world of messaging. I am seriously tired of people asking me to install the proprietary software of WhatsApp, Line, Wechat, etc.')
