I&#x27;m aware of a thing called &quot;ERISA&quot; , where (I think) there&#x27;s law forbidding termination before vesting (retirement funds though).<p>Are there any similar legal protections in place to prevent termination based _solely_ on equity vesting?<p>And to all the comments here saying to just walk away and keep your peace; ie - just take it as a learning lesson.  Which learning lesson is that exactly?  Sounds to me like this is a pretty typical situation we engineers can get ourselves into.  What other protections (learning lessons) could they have done to mitigate what&#x27;s happening here?')
