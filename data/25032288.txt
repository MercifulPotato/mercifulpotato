The importance of that responsibility gets completely lost when firearms are treated like cool toys that everybody <i>should</i> have and exist in abundance.<p>That&#x27;s why headlines like &quot;toddler shoots mother&quot; or &quot;dog shoots owner&quot; don&#x27;t exist in Europe, but are a sad somewhat regular thing out of the US. These toddlers and dogs didn&#x27;t do that because they watched too much violent media, they did that because the actual owners of the guns where irresponsible individuals and never should have owned one in the first place.')
