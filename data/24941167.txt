We read about pee tapes, Russian collusion, foreign intervention and suddenly there is a focus on editorial accuracy. What a joke, Greenwald is far more believable than many of his colleagues and I don&#x27;t mind him getting a bit invested here.<p>If all these activists would stop lying and just said Hillary&#x2F;Biden are better choices because their programs are more foundational, it would have been a walk in the park.<p>Instead you have these partisan fanatics (not restricted to the US) that are completely fine with undermining democratic processes and restricting freedom for their opponents, even perceived ones.<p>It makes you feel you can have a reasonable talk with a fundamental Christian instead of a reporter of main stream media. Perhaps there are drugs and blackmail involved, I am running out of explanations. Complete hysteria.')
