So are the filmed adaptations: the BBC productions of <i>Smiley&#x27;s People</i> and <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>; and the more recent film of the latter; and the <i>Night Manager</i> miniseries.<p>What has also given me a lot of pleasure was the BBC Radio productions of the eight George Smiley books [1].

Such a treat.<p>Thank you for it all Mr. Le Carr√©.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;radio4&#x2F;features&#x2F;smiley-season&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;radio4&#x2F;features&#x2F;smiley-season&#x2F;</a>')
