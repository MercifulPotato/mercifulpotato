(&quot;make selected nodes auto-smooth&quot;) Or is it a different method?<p>EDIT: hmm, the behaviour is not quite the same - inkscape seems to move the handles of its auto-smooth nodes only in response to the positions of neighbouring nodes. This &quot;hyperbezier&quot; demo moves its handles in response to positions of both neighbouring nodes and their handles.')
