It generally is 60 (base) &#x2F; 40 (variable) but other ratio exist (70&#x2F;30 is more common the technical sales side). Since the sales side has explicit KPIs tied to revenue, it&#x27;s very clear how success can be determined unlike most other roles inside of organizations. In the best case, there&#x27;s a stock plan but that is only indirectly related to revenue. Moreover, if you don&#x27;t hit your quota, you are gone. If you&#x27;re a seasoned sales rep or have personal relationships, you can skate by having a bad quarter &#x2F; half &#x2F; year but this is the exception, not the rule. This is a fine-ish solution for compensation for the sales side of the org, right? You have a quota, your success is based on attainment. Easy-peasy. Didn&#x27;t hit your quota because of a recession? Didn&#x27;t hit your number because of a global pandemic? Didn&#x27;t hit your number because of A, B, or C? Tough luck.<p>For other roles, in my eyes, there does need to be an intrinsic decoupling of current or next quarter &#x2F; half &#x2F; year sales objectives and their incentive structure. Refactoring may be important for a code base but fundamentally doesn&#x27;t bring in revenue. It nets to _hurting_ short-term revenue since the man hours aren&#x27;t focused on the newest widget the competitors have. Over a longer time horizon, it can fuel revenue indirectly by making it easier to add new features, etc, etc but for someone like me who has a quota, it doesn&#x27;t _help_ me in any direct manner. I have to build presentations and demos to work around the bugs I know exist, weak spots in the product. I have to explain roadmaps for feature sets while being very transparent that a purchase today does not entail a customer commitment so that we don&#x27;t have revenue recognition issues in 3 months when a feature slips. If the company doesn&#x27;t ship features X and Y within 6 months, are engineers fired? Generally not. Will the net effect from a marketplace competition perspective result in sales reps being fired? Generally yes.<p>Back to the culture issue, yeah, that&#x27;s present. The boiler room mentality of a lot of sales reps breeds a locker room mentality and the incentive structure formalizes things. Sales reps aren&#x27;t retained for being a nice gal &#x2F; guy &#x2F; whatever. They are retained based on a single figure: revenue. That&#x27;s the focus and in poor sales orgs that&#x27;s the only focus.<p>Will someone make more money, all else being equal, selling something? Yes. Will they have a stable livelihood? Almost assuredly not.')
