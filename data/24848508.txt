Before I have to exhaust all the medical resources, in my mind, when people get sick, they go see a doctor, the doctor prescribes medicine, and medicine fixes problems. But in reality we&#x27;re still largely relying on our own defense, e.g. COVID. We rarely have a drug that directly fixes our problem.<p>I started having really bad insomnia more than a year ago. I went to see a bunch of doctors. Initially, I was given low dosage sleeping pills, which didn&#x27;t help much. I went to a hospital to get a CT scan because I was having mad headaches, which my family doctor wouldn&#x27;t refer me. The scan was normal. Finally, I found a doctor who&#x27;s willing to refer me MRI scan. After waiting for couple of months, the result didn&#x27;t turn up anything again. Keep in mind I&#x27;ve been suffering 2 - 3 hours sleep a day all these time. I also did sleep study, and sleep study mostly care about sleep apnea, so they couldn&#x27;t identify any causes again. Then I went to see a psychiatrist, more sleeping pills, which are really antidepressants. Eventually, after a long wait, I was referred to a neurologist and sleep specialist. I&#x27;ve done so much research on sleep medicine at this point, I already knew what he&#x27;s gonna prescribe me - sleep restriction therapy. That didn&#x27;t really help altho I gave up after trying for two weeks. I intend to try it again but I can&#x27;t attempt it now that I&#x27;m back to work. So one year later, I&#x27;m still messed up with no known cause.<p>I know insomnia in my case is not a traditional disease, but it goes to show you that if you&#x27;re not having one of the common diseases then you&#x27;re shit out of luck.<p>The human body&#x27;s extremely complex, but instead of using proper debugging tools, doctors are mostly relying on &quot;console logs&quot; or &quot;print statements&quot;. Even if a root cause is identified, often time we don&#x27;t have the necessary tools to fix the problems.')
