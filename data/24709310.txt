The universe existed long before us, and it will continue long after us. We are inconsequential. This is all pretty contrary to what most religions tell us.<p>Personally I have no reason to trust or believe what clergy say (they&#x27;re as human as the rest of us and make lots of unverifiable claims), so all I have to go one is what we collectively discover about our universe.')
