Working for a big corp as a software engineer, I&#x27;ve done nothing but saving more money since the lock down started. I&#x27;ve also done much more shopping on Amazon, so I guess I&#x27;m giving back some of that money to other big corps. Doing groceries at Costo so money is not leaving the circle of big corps.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to eat out more often, even leaving less or no tips in order to feel more incentivized to not eat at home.')
