Not only you have to keep up with your enemy - you have to stay in lock-step with them. Go ahead too fast - in offensive <i>or</i> defensive capabilities - and you&#x27;re just provoking a preemptive strike. A better missile, or a better missile shield, or a better submarine detection technology - all can trigger the end if developed deployed too quickly. It&#x27;s already beneficial to be open about what you can do; I wonder if we reach the point at which it will be beneficial for the country that&#x27;s ahead to just give others its tech, to keep the parity going.<p>As for other planets, I suspect the early colonies will be completely defenseless from Earth, but if they reach sufficient level of development and self-governance, they&#x27;ll want to rapidly develop capability of hurting Earth as an opening move for declaring independence.')
