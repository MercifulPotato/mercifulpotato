I&#x27;m not sure that British companies would&#x27;ve provided services to revolutionaries while they literally try to overthrow the constitutional order of their country. Sure, they succeeded, got their independence, but when someone decides to literally fight against the country from the inside they shouldn&#x27;t expect any company to be friendly to them or to offer them any services. As a matter of fact not even the government will be friendly, because they will do everything in their power to maintain order from their legal and constitutional perspective.<p>What happened on the Capitol had elements that lead to a conclusion that the goal was to stop legal procedures in the country, perhaps even taking elected representatives as hostages. This is different from any other type of &quot;ordinary&quot; riot. Luckily the people there didn&#x27;t seem to be particularly skillful so they didn&#x27;t manage to achieve anything. But they shouldn&#x27;t expect that everyone will forget what they tried just because it failed. There needs to be a serious investigation first to determine how was it organized and what were the goals. Until this is known for sure, everyone should be really careful and that includes the right of companies to ensure their tools are not used for a potential violent government overthrow. What would happen to the revolutionaries if the American Revolution had failed? I&#x27;m pretty sure that the British wouldn&#x27;t just forget it and pretend it didn&#x27;t happen, even if they managed to stop it quickly before it got serious.')
