I can&#x27;t think of many AGPL (or similarly licensed) projects that have similar industry standard status as react or tensorflow have in their respective niches.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s free as freedom, not beer.<p>I&#x27;m sorry I should have made this point more explicit I guess. Of course I am well aware of the double meaning of free, and that it relates to freedom in this context. My point is that yes, that freedom allows you to do and read things, of course. But what? In an (exaggerated, and not entirely fair) analogy, it would be like claiming&#x2F;securing the right to wear clown shoes during coffee breaks in the office. Yes, it&#x27;s a right you may not have had otherwise, and it will brighten up your day, but ultimately it won&#x27;t change the material relationship to your employer.<p>In the same way, being allowed to read, modify, and distribute software is not in itself a solution to <i>this</i> specific problem at hand here, i.e. the strategy of Fortune 500 companies, as a stand-in for capital to get free labor from OSS devs. (note the omission of the &quot;F&quot; in this case because again, for the most part, this will happen with open source work, but not so much with libre projects).<p>-------<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m unsure how to interpret the tone of your comment, so just to clarify: please don&#x27;t mistake this as an attack from me on AGPL and similar. I think they&#x27;re better than nothing and I personally prefer contributing to strongly copyleft projects. But they won&#x27;t be a mechanism that can have a similar impact on the software industry as widespread unionization had on employer&#x2F;employee relationship a hundred years ago. I lived in the Ruhr Area in Germany for a few years and the impact was really impressive, quite hard to imagine it happening like this today... The conclusion of the podcast I linked above is that IT work (and programming in particular) has developed from something where the individual holds significant negotiation power (and thus individual choices matter a lot) to a market in which workers are essentially interchangeable (since they all work with the same tools anyhow) and thus individual choices like Marak&#x27;s are relatively <i>less</i> likely to be effective.<p>Of course I hope that Marak gets hired and paid accordingly asap, but following this argument, in the long run programmers (the non-glamorous term for anything to do with code) will have to organize and&#x2F;or accept significant drops in their salaries.')
