The thing I appreciate about Ubuntu as compared to windows is how <i>quiet</i> it is.  The only things I see are the things I put there.  With win10 there is so much noise on the desktop, in the start menu, and in system notifications.  After switching it feels relatively stressful to use Windows.<p>Also I can&#x27;t remember the last time Ubuntu crashed on me.')
