Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603900816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24920055, text='&gt;Why do we have all those regulations if we&#x27;re willing to accept 1000x worse in cars with much more lax regulation?<p>I think it boils down to &quot;because we can and still have a viable commercial airline industry.&quot; (And general aviation is much riskier than commercial airlines.) Whereas were we to vastly increase the training, maintenance schedules, monitoring of driver alertness, and requirements to have all the latest safety features, you&#x27;re probably effectively eliminating driving for most people who can&#x27;t just hire a professional driver&#x2F;car.<p>For many things, we accept that we could make things safer if we wanted to. But were we to do so, we&#x27;d effectively be banning the activity or at least severely restricting it. (Which is probably one reason why we don&#x27;t really have flying cars.)')
