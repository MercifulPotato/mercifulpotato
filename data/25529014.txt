Item(by='dgfitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608828208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527708, text='I have read it many times.<p>Why was the book centered around a children’s story that we didn’t hear about until book 7? Why were the deathly hollows items not mentioned at all throughout the entire rest of the series? Why do we not find out until the last book that the invisibility cloak should have faded a long time ago? That last point especially irritates me because it just smells like lazy writing.<p>I love Harry Potter. I have read the series many many times. I sincerely wish I had never read the last book. It felt rushed, unplanned, and almost desperate.<p>There is a fluid cohesion between books 1-6 that completely disappears in book 7.')
