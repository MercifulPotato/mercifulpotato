That was my point.  Mozilla explicitily was supporting censorship.  So, therefore it is not &quot;without censorship&quot;.<p>It seems like you are walking your original statement back though, and instead simply saying that you personally support censorship.<p>So great.  Glad that you agree that your original statement was false, and that Mozilla is actually supporting deplatforming.')
