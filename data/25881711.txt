Item(by='techdragon', descendants=None, kids=[25881731], score=None, time=1611404484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881388, text='Other than the growth (in terms of length across the surface in question) of a crack&#x2F;fracture, tape is a pretty valid solution as long as it can hold the pressure. In fact on the “inside” that’s even more strait forward since the pressure pushes the tapes bonding surface interface into the opening, so depending on how malleable the “tape” is, it might not even need “glue” to do the job of sealing a hole sufficiently to hold in the ISS’ internal atmosphere.<p>Effectively the major issue is “larger”width&#x2F;diameter cracks&#x2F;holes create greater pressures that eventually exceed the ability of simple “tape” to suffice for a workable patch. This is all ignoring any NASA engineering manuals and limits, I’m talking entirely theoretical “how long can my duct tape keep me from suffocating” type of engineering, just to be clear.<p>What needs emphasis in the long term for more permanent structures in space is on the poorly explored topic of welded joint fatigue, with respect to joints that were welded in low earth orbit.<p>We have welded with several techniques in space before (the Soviets did it) but it basically stopped there and not much has gone into studies of the long term fatigue of the resulting welded joints. If we want permanent space stations we need to be able to “patch them\nup” in a way that we can rely on and at least have some idea what the lifespan will be. It’s ok if we have to re-weld pressure hull segments every decade or two but not if the large scale structural welds on a space station hull assembled in space only hold for a few years before they start leaking.')
