But isn&#x27;t just a bunch of boring and inconsistent tales? is there really anything to be learned from the bible? &quot;</i><p>The bible is not a single book; it&#x27;s a collection of dozens of books written at very different times. Just reading it front-to-back is not a very productive way to read it. Genesis and Exodus are okay, but Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy are just dreadful.<p>The best place to start is the gospels, at the start of the NT. That gets you right to the heart of what Christianity is about, they&#x27;re good stories, and there&#x27;s quite a bit of wisdom in there. Absolutely worth reading.<p>If you want a philosophical treatise about the meaning of life, read Eclessiastes. The stories of David in the books of Samuel are exciting adventures as well as the most central part of the history of ancient Israel. It&#x27;s also worth reading a couple of psalms (23 probably being the most famous) but if you read them all in one go, they might get a bit repetitive. And of course there&#x27;s the erotic Song of Songs. For more adventure stories, Judges also has a couple of good ones.')
