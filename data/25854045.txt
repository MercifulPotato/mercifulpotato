They seem to have done a lot to grow the entrepreneurship &amp; developer ecosystem in Italy, and are growing fast enough to need to hire from abroad now. They also have a really high bar for who they hire. Their process starts off with a logic test (nothing related to coding) which takes more than a day to complete.<p>(Curious about that by the way, since we have only seen one other company - Klarna - start with a logic test. Do you know if this is common? Is it an effective screening approach? In the USA people are sometimes wary of how standardized tests of this type may impact untraditional candidates in particular)<p>But back to your point - that name issue is really disappointing. We&#x27;ll have to put some more thought into it but my first reaction is to do a little more polling to see how widespread this association is in our primary markets (MENA and countries that do a lot of hiring of software engineers, so mainly USA, Germany, Poland, Sweden, UK, Canada, Australia, etc)')
