Our current view is that:<p>1. Allowing teams to standarise on an _approach_ and a library in the first place is a huge step up from individual ad hoc implementations.<p>2. If you have shared logic between applications, you can still write language-agnostic policies and share those between them. If there are parts that are specific to an application&#x2F;language, its easy enough to pull these into separate rules and add shims.<p>3. We intentionally wanted to keep the language lean to lower the learning curve. But we&#x27;re considering adding a standard library in the future, powered by the Rust core, to provide common functionality. The nice thing is that you&#x27;re not limited by how fast we add those.<p>We&#x27;re interested in hearing from folks who are working in those environments to hear what would make the most sense for them.')
