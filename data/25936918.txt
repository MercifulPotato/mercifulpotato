Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=[25938691], score=None, time=1611797375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936760, text='&gt; but wonder if with more EU like moderation a better site could be formed.<p>&gt; If a UK citizen were to post as offensively as a US citizen they would and have been arrested.<p>The idea of posting something and being arrested disgusts me. The bar around the world for such an action should be just as high as it is in America. If I post that I&#x27;m going to come and kill you, thinkingemote, at 10:17 a.m. at your place of work located at &lt;insert address here&gt;, then by all means I deserve to be arrested. I&#x27;ve made a credible threat with credible information, verified by the fact I know your name and your workplace address.<p>However, saying something &quot;mean&quot; to you, or &quot;misgendering&quot; you, or even calling you a racial slur, should never be enough to arrest someone.<p>It reminds me of one of the few (maybe only...) great lines from <i>Ghostbusters 2</i>: &quot;Being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every New Yorker&#x27;s God-given right!&quot;<p>So it should be online as well. If you don&#x27;t like it, you can absent yourself from the platform(s), and in almost every case, if you don&#x27;t want to do that, you can block the other person.')
