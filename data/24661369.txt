Item(by='Maken', descendants=None, kids=[24661605], score=None, time=1601637180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24660616, text='What Roller Coaster Tycoon brought to the table, and makes it shine even years later, is not the theme park simulation but rather what the title promises: the roller coasters.<p>The game comes with quite complete roller coaster (and some other rides) designer tools, which not only let you build the entire track from scratch, but also includes a simulation of vertical and lateral acceleration and g-forces along the track. It also has a appeal system for the rides, which is directly linked to the ride simulated operation parameters (plus some theming bonuses).<p>Designing rides is  what (for me) takes most of the playing time and I judge every later entry in the amusement park entry by its roller coaster design tools.')
