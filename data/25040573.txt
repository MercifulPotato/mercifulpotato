The lens went fine. The glass is something like 0.25mm off in basically all dimensions (height, width, thickness). I can feel the transition when I miss the fingerprint sensor. So 3rd party replacements are &quot;okay.&quot; This isn&#x27;t a huge issue, just annoying since I recently replaced it.<p>Other than that, which I&#x27;d call self inflicted since I&#x27;ve had the phone for years and dropped it a few times and hike a lot, I&#x27;ve had no issues. Maybe the 2 had better QC?')
