For example, if the claims of a patent are directed to cache management for a messaging platform, most details about how the messaging platform works can be omitted as long as the cache management system is sufficiently described.<p>If there are unique features of the messaging platform that enable the new cache management system to work, detailed description of those features would need to be included in the patent specification. But unrelated stuff, such as, routing mechanisms, protocol optimizations, security, and so on, that may be part of the messaging platform can be omitted from the cache management patent specification.<p>Thus, the messaging platform org could keep plenty of trade secrets about other parts of their platform while still obtaining a patent on their cache management system.')
