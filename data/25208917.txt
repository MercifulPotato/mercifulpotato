Such a deployment is nonstandard and you&#x27;re left to your own devices to make it work, albeit with some decent architectural documentation so that you can work out which component needs to run where.<p>BBB <i>does</i> rely on WebRTC exclusively for its media.  The so-called &#x27;HTML5&#x27; client is in-browser.  There is a Flash-based client that&#x27;s officially deprecated, and they&#x27;re slowly stripping out support for it.<p>There is also some optional Etherpad integration, so that you can collaborate on in-meeting notes that are made available afterwards.<p>BBB&#x27;s biggest problem right now is that the Debian packaging, which is the only official way of deploying the software, is not open source.  It&#x27;s also really messy -- some stuff goes into &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local, some into &#x2F;opt, with a fair deal of leftover crud that isn&#x27;t used any more like the Flash client.<p>This is an unintentional situation, but the maintainers have deprioritised making the software truly &quot;open source&quot; (IMO) in favour of bugfixes and features.<p>I don&#x27;t think this situation meets the GPL it&#x27;s licensed under, regardless of whether you would qualify this as &quot;open source&quot; or not.')
