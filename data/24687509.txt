Sometimes it&#x27;s really nice to have a simple struct for which you (or anyone else) can write many function to act upon. Sometimes it&#x27;s really nice to have an opaque &quot;object&quot; with methods to yank described in some public interface, but which encapsulates loads of state and other objects inside it so you don&#x27;t have to think about all of that.')
