Debuggers are in some sense anti-unix.<p>it&#x27;s not a problem when you accept that the unix philosophy is extremely far from the holy grail of software design. &quot;things that do one thing well&quot; certainly has good sides for specific problems, mainly quick&#x27;n&#x27;dirty linear text processing dataflows, but is atrocious for other problems (anything that need integration and discoverability: art software, web browsers, or revolves more around user interaction than computing something)<p>&gt; 3. Some people are so used to not having a debugger that they don’t know what they’re missing. Debuggers work well for what, windows and websites?<p>if debuggers took less time to start than a full &quot;add print -&gt; recompile -&gt; relaunch app&quot; cycle as is my experience with C++, they would certainly get more use.<p>Hell, in my main project I&#x27;ve been unable to use any version of gdb &amp; lldb for something like two months as both segfault a couple seconds after reaching a  breakpoint for some reason. It&#x27;s a shitshow.')
