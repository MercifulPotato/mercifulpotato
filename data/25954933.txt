Argon2id is the newest recommended algorithm (watch out for the other variants of Argon2 which are have trade-offs between GPU resistance and side-channel resistance).<p>If your language of choice does not have a decent, audited implementation of Argon2id, you can go with bcrypt or scrypt, which would be an improvement over PBKDF2, and usually widely available in most languages.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argon2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Argon2</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crypto.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;30785&#x2F;password-hashing-security-of-argon2-versus-bcrypt-pbkdf2#30786" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crypto.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;30785&#x2F;password-ha...</a>')
