Where I wonder how much of a caring hand to impose when necessary are things surrounding say bullying or perhaps someone being non-critical or arguably abusive by simply saying &quot;you&#x27;re stupid&quot; or other name calling. Arguably I&#x27;d want people on the platforms I engage on to be trying to improve themselves, to grow, to improve their emotional regulation and manage that impulse or energy that leads them to calling someone stupid instead into developing a deeper understanding - responding instead of reacting; or realizing engaging with certain people is futile, and to put their energy and passion more into the physical world instead of their keyboard. I wonder how many people are ready for such an environment, for that level of a safe space.')
