Presidential candidates need to be able to communicate with and persuade not just college and high school graduates, but uneducated people as well.<p>Uneducated people have 1 vote each, same as educated people. If you can&#x27;t convince uneducated people that we have to do something about global warming then in democratic countries, you can&#x27;t make the sacrifices needed to solve global warming. The result is disastrous for the planet.<p>We need presidential candidates that can really dumb things down to such a level that just about anyone can understand it, no matter their education level.')
