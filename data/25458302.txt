[...] Everyone should learn how to cook some boring, staple meals using basic ingredients from the store. It&#x27;s amazing how many people don&#x27;t know how easy and cheap it can be to prepare simple crock pot or stir-fry meals that are healthy and delicious.</i><p>I&#x27;m a strict health food eater but I have to be realistic and concede that preparing healthy meals is more work.<p>For example, I have a green smoothie drink made from raw vegetables every day for breakfast for more than 10 years.  I&#x27;m pretty efficient at it but <i>it still takes more work (and time) than just putting an unhealthy Pop Tart in the toaster</i>.<p>And my dinners of lentil soup or tofu are more prep work than tossing a frozen pizza into the oven.  I have a diabetic friend who often &quot;cheats&quot; with junk food (McDonald&#x27;s burger) because cooking supposedly &quot;simple&quot; healthy meals is still too much of a hassle even for him.<p>Yes, cooking healthy may be &quot;easy&quot; but it&#x27;s still <i>more work</i> than junk food.  Convenience junk foods are just... more convenient.')
