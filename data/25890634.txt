But aren&#x27;t.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s great to have a visualization aid, especially in remote meetings. But in my experience, for the needs of most meetings, Miro boards are a cumbersome, over-featured sink of time and effort. Then they invite you to leave them standing as sole documentation of the details of a meeting&#x27;s outcome, which they&#x27;re not very good at. Use them wisely!')
