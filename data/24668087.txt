I&#x27;m genuinely curious: what does &quot;loss of taste&quot; mean here? I&#x27;d like to know in case I encounter it.<p>For instance, if I have sinus congestion so that I can&#x27;t breathe through my nose, I can&#x27;t experience the olfactory component of tastes. If you gave me orange juice and lemon juice, I&#x27;d be able to tell that both were sweet and sour but might not be able to distinguish between the flavors.<p>So when I&#x27;ve read about losing taste, I&#x27;ve wondered if this was like all the prior times when I&#x27;ve lost the sense of smell, or if this was something new and my taste buds would also stop working so that I couldn&#x27;t experience &quot;salty&quot; anymore.<p>When people discuss taste, it&#x27;s not always clear whether they mean the sensation you experience in your tongue or in your nose.')
