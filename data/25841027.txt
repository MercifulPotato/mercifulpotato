Receives fine. The handful of times I&#x27;ve used it to transmit on a local net nobody mentioned vomiting in disgust at its poor transmission characteristics. The original battery even still holds a charge, which I really didn&#x27;t expect, since it&#x27;s probably spent 3.9 years sitting on the charger being kept at the float voltage.')
