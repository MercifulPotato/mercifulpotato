They now have the board seats to pull it off. After the disastrous past week for the stock, I can&#x27;t see any other shareholders wanting to keep him on.<p>When you&#x27;re dividing your time as CEO between two companies, the presumption is always going to be against you. Unless he manages to deliver some truly astounding quarterly numbers in the immediate near-term, I&#x27;d be pretty shocked if Dorsey isn&#x27;t canned by the end of the year.')
