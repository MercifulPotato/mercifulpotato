But anybody outside of that closer circle was Uncle or Aunty. Plus, because enrolling your kids in an english medium was prestigious, &amp; expensive, those schools taught us to use english words, like mummy, papa, daddy, uncle, aunty. It felt like us kids using the english words were making our teachers &amp; parents spending those monies well spent.<p>For me, close relationship people are always assigned as native words. Stranger, in urban setting, are uncle &amp; aunty. Although now kids also call me uncle. Today&#x27;s kids&#x27; usage of native names has shrinked, &amp; more people are now uncle aunty now.<p>Whatsapp forwards, crazy info like tracking chips in currency notes, cow urine the solution to every pain, indian X is the best X in world, overflowing nationalism, are more from uncle &amp; aunties, who are not good with technology, &amp; got introduced to whatsapp directly.')
