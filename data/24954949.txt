It is <i>specifically</i> brought up in the context of slapping women, and he is quite obviously <i>not</i> talking about slapping in response being verbally abused, not at all. That is an attempt to completely whitewash what he said and the circumstances referring to his earlier quote from Playboy.<p>I am sickened to see this mental gymnastics and attempt to whitewash what he actually said. It’s absolutely misogynistic to try to reinvent the meaning of what he said so as to obfuscate the fact that gender played a dominant role in his suggestion and that it was specifically in reference to slapping women.')
