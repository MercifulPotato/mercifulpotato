Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=[25501189], score=None, time=1608589913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500077, text='Yes, the 30+ year olds have to make the tough decision of defaulting on their loans and severely limiting their ability to secure loans in the future, vs. continuing to work towards paying off their student loans. If there was no repercussion to defaulting on loans why would anyone ever pay off a loan?<p>This is precisely why it makes sense to restrict ability to default on student loans for a certain duration. Even if you have six figure salary as a new grad, it&#x27;d still make sense to default on your student loans immediately after graduation and plan your life around having a terrible credit score until your 30s. Pay for cars in cash, and don&#x27;t plan on buying a house until one&#x27;s 30s. Everyone would do this because it&#x27;s basically getting money for free. And consequently nobody would issue student loans, even to students going to good schools and studying in demand majors, because students can effectively just walk away from the loans.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not doing anything for people 22-30. This is deliberate. The point is to make sure students who can pay off their loans do pay off their loans. We make recipients of student loans wait until 30-35 to be able to default on loans so that only the ones who are genuinely stuck with loans they can&#x27;t pay off go through with the default. Yes, their credit score will tank. But that&#x27;s the consequence of defaulting on a loan. If you could default on a loan without impacting your credit score, you&#x27;d be a fool not to default on every loan you have right now - but you wouldn&#x27;t actually have any loans because nobody would lend money under sucha scenario.')
