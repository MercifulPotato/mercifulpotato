Looking at Mike&#x27;s resume, the technologies he is working with (LAMP stack, Ruby, PHP) seem like they would run perfectly fine in a VM.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing embedded development (with a Linux based toolchain) on a Windows 10 host with Ubuntu in a VM, and it seems to be plenty nice on modern hardware (and a lot of RAM).  And I don&#x27;t have to make a choice to boot back and forth: Two systems for the price of 1.5. :)<p>Edit: My question aside, I fully appreciate the article&#x27;s primary goal, which is to document the nonobvious hoops the author had to jump through to get dual boot to work.  Thanks!')
