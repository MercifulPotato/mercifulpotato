Kept coming back to what is basically the second and fourth points:<p>Rules and honeypots work better and more simply. A machine learning system will need to learn from something, continuously because malware will adapt to what the model learned previously. Every time you figure out a way to make it classify some traffic as malicious and other traffic not, you&#x27;re basically writing the rule, except it&#x27;s like beating a particularly retarded rat brain into figuring out and writing the rule for you.<p>For reference, the 2nd and 4th points are<p>&gt; How do they know their test data is anything like real life data?  How do they monitor system performance in the field?<p>&gt; Ask them why they didn&#x27;t take a simpler approach than the approach they took.<p>Making malware trigger rules is simpler and basically the result of #2.')
