The only time the course briefly talk about neural net is in the context of Logit regression. And I have always wonder if the time spent proving Gauss Markov theorem is better spent somewhere else.<p>Do you know any source(book or otherwise) that continues to build on top of topics taught in a Regression and Linear algebra course(such as Multiple Linear, Weighted Least square, Logistic, generalized least squares, principle component regression, singular value decomposition) and slowly move towards the current state deep learning?')
