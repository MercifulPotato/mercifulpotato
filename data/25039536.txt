Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=[25039627], score=None, time=1604954016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039033, text='&gt; Apple has $192.8 billion in cash on hand. What exactly is it doing with this money? Is it spending it on fundamental research in optics, laser communication, optical computing, and other stuff? No, it&#x27;s not.<p>Most of Apple’s “cash” is invested in corporate bonds, which allow other companies to access capital in order to expand their operations and grow their productivity, and most of the rest is in government bonds, which allow the government to make up for the shortfall of the “public money” you talk about. Sure, Apple might “only” spend $16B on R&amp;D, but rest assured, they aren’t just sitting on their  cash pile like Scrooge McDuck, instead it is efficiently used  by many different actors.')
