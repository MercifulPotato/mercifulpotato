You are correct that the recipe is specific to the Plots package. But consider: once written, it works not only for that specific plot function, but many others in the package as well, for example scatter. Also, I have written these recipes for my own data types, and they are <i>incredibly easy</i> to create. The recipe informs the functions in Plots how to handle your datatpye, so you can just pass it in as an argument. The thing is that Iâ€™ve never even looked at the code in the Plots package. With Julia you can use functions on combinations of your own custom datatypes to do new things, without looking at the code for the functions. Often nothing like the Plots recipes are required; but here the recipe lets you specify how you want your datatype to be visualized.')
