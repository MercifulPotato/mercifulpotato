I used to rely on this until I learned proper posture and did exercises to strenghten and relearn to use skeletal musculature correctly. I need not rest my back on anything now and my general health couldn’t be better.<p>Unless you had a recent surgery and the body is weakened or you have a serious condition (torn discs, etc) I’d advise to try to ditch all these crutches which end up weakening us up in the long term. However, I admit they could be very useful and help with back pain. I used to not be able to concentrate because of backpain and lumbar support did help at the time.')
