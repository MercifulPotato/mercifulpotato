But while reading and playing with minikanren has been quite illuminating, it has yet to help me solve many &quot;real&quot; naturally occurring problems. And indeed, some of the motivations for minkanren are aesthetic or philosophical stances, rather than pragmatic (wanting to avoid having to use the cut operator etc). Most of the work around minikanren seems more aimed at piloting approaches or techniques which could be used to produce useful tools, rather than actually producing useful tools.<p>But perhaps someone who has used languages in this area more broadly than I can comment: Which is a better bang for your buck?\n- Prolog\n- &quot;Functional logic languages&quot; e.g. Curry, Mercury\n- Clojure + core.logic\n- scheme + minikanren')
