But you can observe what happens as you approach it:<p>Let&#x27;s say I put you in a spaceship and accelerate you to 50% the speed of light toward the sun. From an inertial viewer&#x27;s perspective you are travelling toward the sun at half the speed of light and it takes you ~16 minutes to crash into the sun. But from your perspective it only took ~14 minutes to crash into the sun[0].<p>Repeat the experiment except I accelerate you to .99c. From an inertial viewer&#x27;s perspective you are travelling toward the sun at nearly speed of light and it takes you ~8 minutes to crash into the sun. But from your perspective it only took ~1 minute to crash into the sun.<p>Repeat the experiment except I accelerate you to .999c. From an inertial viewer&#x27;s perspective you are travelling toward the sun at nearly speed of light and it takes you ~8 minutes to crash into the sun. But from your perspective it only took 20 seconds to crash into the sun.<p>Repeat the experiment except I accelerate you to .9999c. From an inertial viewer&#x27;s perspective you are travelling toward the sun at nearly speed of light and it takes you ~8 minutes to crash into the sun. But from your perspective it only took 6 seconds to crash into the sun.<p>Repeat the experiment except I accelerate you to .99999c. From an inertial viewer&#x27;s perspective you are travelling toward the sun at nearly speed of light and it takes you ~8 minutes to crash into the sun. But from your perspective it only took 2 seconds to crash into the sun.<p>See what&#x27;s happening? As you approach the speed of light, the amount of time that elapses until you reach your destination approaches zero. So from an inertial observer&#x27;s point of view, time has completely frozen for travelers approaching light speed.<p>[0] Using time dilation formula from this page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phy.olemiss.edu&#x2F;HEP&#x2F;QuarkNet&#x2F;time.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phy.olemiss.edu&#x2F;HEP&#x2F;QuarkNet&#x2F;time.html</a>')
