Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610457719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745876, text='&gt; That it&#x27;d come to this is pretty obvious<p>indeed it&#x27;s not shocking given that FB were happy to take money from conservative disinfo peddlers right up to Nov. 3rd. It&#x27;s a shame this is happening but maybe it&#x27;s time they had a taste of their own medicine in their own country? Because the last time when they caused a genocide in Myanmar by supporting the junta nobody at FB has been held responsible.<p>There is no such thing as &quot;dirty&#x2F;unethical&quot; money in their eyes. Sod their mgmt and PR-teams who are playing the victim card advising employees about <i>&quot;how to be safe in a big ugly world&quot;</i>.<p>Anyone wearing FB swag should be entitled to at least half a year living (as a Muslim) in Myanmar while posting their experience with dissent on the platform. The fact that FB sees itself still as a platform that can bring positive change suggests they drew the wrong conclusions from the &quot;Arab Spring success story&quot;.<p>FB is a &quot;tool of terror&quot; in countries which are considered developing. Even in places like US, Germany, UK, Brazil, India etc FB does more to divide people than to bring them together.<p>A few FB employees now &quot;uncomfortable&quot; about whether their swag is still wearable in public isn&#x27;t anything the majority will lose sleep over. Certainly not in Myanmar.')
