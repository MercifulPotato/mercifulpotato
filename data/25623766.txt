Every time we have offered a discount to a client (we are premium in our industry as well), it almost always bites us. I just lost a client who decided that it wasn&#x27;t worth it even after getting a 20% recurring discount because he wants 10 new features that he didnt realize when signing up but doesn&#x27;t wanna pay for anything. Never again. Don&#x27;t discount the price. Give extras if needed but never discount your price.')
