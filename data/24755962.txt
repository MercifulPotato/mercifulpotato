For instance, I look at past 5 year sales growth. Then I look at yoy sales growth. Then I look at P&#x2F;S over the last 5 years (to see if it is out of whack). Then I look at PEG over the last 5 years (to see if it is out of whack). Then I look at gross margins. Then I look at dividend yield. All of this data is available for free.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure how to do all those things, and I&#x27;d rather spend that learning how to make database things work.<p>Also, it sounds like all you&#x27;re doing is looking at (very recent)past performance (not a predictor of future performance), and putting all your eggs in one basket (big tech).')
