Only a two hour concert, but the Jurassic Park theme made me tear up, and I was only 10 feet from the orchestra.<p>I paid $300 for two Conductor&#x27;s Box seats at the MSO for myself and a girl I was dating to see the Harry Potter in Concert series, where you watch a Harry Potter movie while the orchestra plays all the music from the film live. For me, it was hit or miss, since I was too old to really get into Harry Potter, but the lady I was seeing was 15 years younger than me, so it really affected her, which of course really benefited me.<p>Both cases, money well spent.')
