Sure, it&#x27;s hyperbolic, but I used it as a way to capture the idea that Javascript has many features that are comparatively worse at achieving their goals than equivalent features in many other languages. This is something that can be analyzed and measured, producing facts.<p>Crockford&#x27;s book title is simply an example of how even a strong advocate of Javascript recognizes its weaknesses. You may not understand how it&#x27;s possible for it to objectively have weaknesses, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t. In this case an objectively bad feature would be one that has negative consequences for programmers, and can be replaced by a features that can achieve the same goals more effectively, without those negative consequences.<p>If there&#x27;s anyone who&#x27;ll argue in favor of such features on technical rather than historical grounds, then it would certainly undermine the objectivity claim. But the point is that there are (mis)features in Javascript which no-one defends on technical grounds. That is a reflection of underlying objective facts.<p>I&#x27;m also not making some sort of ad populum argument. As I pointed out, any claim of objective fact has to be made in some context that provides it with semantics. In some languages, the expression &quot;1&quot;+&quot;1&quot; is a type error, in others it produces &quot;11&quot;. Both of those outcomes are objective facts in some context. What your objection really amounts to is saying that there&#x27;s no semantic context in which my claim could be true. That&#x27;s clearly not the case.<p>Perhaps a different example would help: people don&#x27;t write programs any more by toggling binary codes into machines via switches. That&#x27;s because we&#x27;ve come up with approaches that are objectively more effective. We can factually measure the improvements in question. The features I was referring to fall into the same category.<p>I&#x27;m going to repeat the closing from my last comment, because you&#x27;re still doing the same thing:<p>You can of course quibble with such claims, based on a rigid application of a simplistic set of definitions. But you&#x27;d do better to try to understand the truth conveyed by the claims, and engage with that.')
