For that, they need to be wired <i>directly</i> into the process doing the work. So no spinner gifs that are animated by the browser&#x2F;renderer, and can spin forever even if your application dies. It needs to be something where any visual change is directly related to the operations you&#x27;re monitoring.<p>That&#x27;s why a list with textual descriptions of step is a great idea - it&#x27;s literally too much work to implement it in a way other than the actual completion of a step displaying&#x2F;ticking off a corresponding label. So seeing that, I&#x27;d know the software isn&#x27;t lying to me.')
