Server Components rely on Concurrent Mode for streaming, but as I mentioned in the talk, we feel pretty good about our progress there, and the remaining work on CM is mostly to simplify it and make it easier to adopt. So it&#x27;s not too far ahead.<p>As for Suspense, Server Components largely <i>are</i> the evolution of Suspense (although it works on the client too). We&#x27;ve decided to hold back releasing Suspense a year ago because we didn&#x27;t have a solution to waterfalls. Now we do. So it&#x27;s all coming together. In general, a lot of what we do is research, and research has many dead ends and takes time.')
