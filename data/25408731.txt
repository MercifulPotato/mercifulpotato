For one thing outside of companies like Apple or Amazon who -might- be able to negotiate with the Chinese government on audits, middle to small businesses would have no possibility of that because they mean nothing to the CCP. This is a government to government thing, not a company thing and the bill doesn&#x27;t make sense to make companies culpable for the entire supply chain. It&#x27;s just punting responsibilities to companies who trade rather the US government whose job it is really to investigate such things. It&#x27;s just a feel good law to blame corps rather than Congress Critters, which they&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of responsibilities for decades.')
