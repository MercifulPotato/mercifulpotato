Keeping nodes so light so that you can validate with a Raspberry Pi with a dialup connection, at the cost of preventing 100X more people from using Bitcoin, is a terrible tradeoff.<p>There is no technological bottleneck preventing a 100X raising of the throughput limit: not Initial Blockchain Download, which is already being expedited with trusted third party set checkpoints, not computation, not storage and not bandwidth.<p>The vast majority of Bitcoin agreed with my sentiment, and that was the sentiment expressed by Satoshi any time he commented on it.<p>It was just irresponsible, overly timid leadership allowing a loud minority to sabotage Bitcoin&#x27;s widely supported roadmap.<p>Responding to the comment below:<p>1. You can prune spent transactions. Only the UTXO set needs to be stored, so you don&#x27;t need to store 5 TB more each year. But even that wouldn&#x27;t be prohibitively costly for thousands of hobbyists worldwide. So even if pruning wasn&#x27;t an option - and it is - Bitcoin&#x27;s censorship resistance would remain totally secure.<p>2. You can use checkpointing in initial sync up, instead of downloading the entire transaction history. The hash of the true chain is widely disseminated and Bitcoin nodes already use a form of checkpointing, where they skip validation for transactions before the checkpoint flag, to expedite Initial Blockchain Download.')
