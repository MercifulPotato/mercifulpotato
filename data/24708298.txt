Most of my tvs, all they have is an Apple TV - it&#x27;s always a process of zip-tieing it to the back of the tv or tv mount or buy a mount for it on Amazon.<p>We used to be able to hang modems on the wall also. Looking at my Xfinity router, no way it can be hung on a wall, so it&#x27;s on random shelf &#x2F; window sill out of the way.<p>[edit] Why the down votes? Perfectly legit question isn&#x27;t it? Those of us that live in apartments and sq ft is limited, why wouldn&#x27;t you hang a tv on the wall and it&#x27;s accessories behind it?')
