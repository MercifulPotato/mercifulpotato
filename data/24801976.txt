At least the gov workers are beholden to their job and maybe their office  People are for whatever reason terrified to allow gov workers to just do their job.  Instead they allow them to contract out millions and billions of dollars to companies that are beholden only to themselves and maybe a contract that will take 10 years to dispute in court.<p>The saddest part is honest companies want nothing to do with these huge gov contracts.  The only way to navigate the minefield of regulations is to lie which honest people dont want to do. This results in nefarious companies that specialize in ripping of the government.<p>And just to get my mandated downvotes.  Trump has been beating the drum of their being too many regulations since he got in office.  I&#x27;m guessing HN won&#x27;t want to hear that though.')
