They don&#x27;t have the economy to even fade like the UK. They would lose everything.<p>That&#x27;s the typical arrogance from a west germans. Poland was already a country before EU and I don&#x27;t remember in the history an non-authoritarian Poland. So that&#x27;s how they are. So is Turkey and so many other European countries or partners. To ask for a diverse Germany, but try to kick out countries that don&#x27;t really buy the German vision, is at least contradictory.<p>&gt; Mind you, I am advocating for the enforcement of human rights and social progression, nothing more.<p>No you are not not. You are just repeating the other spectrum of populism. You and Poland are just different sides of the same coin.')
