I could even hook it up to AWS and have it update automatically.<p>Doing all of that is less time consuming and requires less effort than reading through the grav or hugo documentation, installing and setting everything up, and troubleshooting the inevitable problems.<p>The only issue I have is that doing front-end web development&#x2F;design is not something I enjoy, so grav and hugo&#x27;s existing library of themes is very convenient. Convenient enough to put up with the other annoyances.')
