Still enjoy it but I feel like taking a long break, getting out of the SV bubble and exploring the world for a bit, maybe 6-12 months.<p>Has anyone taken a sabbatical before and would like to share their experience? I&#x27;m wondering what types of things people do. Currently debating if I should just travel the world, or volunteer at an organization like the Peace Corps, or do something else to get me out of my SV &#x2F; big tech company bubble :)')
