I try to like it (I was an early paid adopter, and now my company uses it so I must too), but there are so many points of friction that most of my effort is spent fighting it rather than using it.<p>Does the general typing latency not bother people?  There&#x27;s a noticeable delay between pressing a key and seeing a character appear.  Other apps, Electron-based even, don&#x27;t seem so slow.  But then you type something like a&#x2F;b and you realize why it&#x27;s so slow.  About half of the things a technical person might type while writing notes or documentation result in some &quot;helpful&quot; popup which must be canceled.
