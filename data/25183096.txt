It is true that wayland isn&#x27;t network transparent, but it can be used over the network with things like wayvnc and waypipe. Now you can say that those aren&#x27;t really mature yet, and I would agree with you. I think wayland&#x27;s readiness is often over-exagerated. However, I don&#x27;t think any of the things you pointed out are  compelling evudence that wayland isn&#x27;t unix like.<p>Otoh, I do think wayland departs from Unix in how it requires the &quot;compositor&quot; to perform to many roles. While in X, the compositor, window manager, etc. can be and often are seperarate processes from the x server, in wayland the compositor also needs to be the window manager, the keyboard layout manager, xwayland server, etc. And at least according some developers for a popular desktop environment, it is also the compositors responsibility to perform other tasks such as  screen capture, vnc server, taskbar, lockscreen, etc. It isn&#x27;t possible to do something like use i3 as the window manager for kde in wayland.')
