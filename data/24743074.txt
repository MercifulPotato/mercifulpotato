A lot of people complaining about the complexity of the front-end ecosystem. Too many tools, to much configuration, etc.<p>I’d like to say that you don’t need that complexity. If you just want to write a dumb front-end you don’t need typescript, you don’t need babel, you don’t need pug, you don’t need webpack, etc. If these things bother you, just skip it.<p>I always start my websites with a simple index.html file and run a `python -m http.server`. That is it. Modern JavaScript has a really good module system that works in all major browser (even Edge), and node. If you want to write type safe JavaScript you can write your types as doc comments and have typescript check it without bundling or compiling. You literally need only two tools to write a website: a browser and a text editor.<p>I’m not here to tell you that people shouldn’t use these complex tools. Many people configure their front-end environment just fine with webpack, babel, typescript, etc. If they work better that way, that is fine. But if that bothers you, simply don’t do it. There is no reason for you to complain about it.')
