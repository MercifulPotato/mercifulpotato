Given the thoroughness of the write-up, I&#x27;m going to assume that the author did not find that any of the discrepancies in the implementations were actually bugs in the reference implementation. He goes as far as to say that he reimplemented the reference implantation so this seems like a safe assumption. Still, it would be nice to confirm. Given that other implementations seem so shoddy, it wouldn&#x27;t be surprising to find a bug in the reference.<p>2. &quot;Conventional wisdom Nazis&quot; Maybe the author was just bored of writing at this point, but some justification for why bitwise comparing floats was a correct decision would have been nice. Is it because there&#x27;s no math involving unrepresentable intermediates? Because there&#x27;s no integration happening, so no way for errors to accumulate?')
