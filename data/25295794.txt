All three are important river crossings at or near a major metropolitan area and must remain open to traffic during construction. These cable replacement designs will need to overcome myriad difficulties, including cable support at the existing tower tops and placement of new anchorages within restricted available spaces. Alternatives will include placing the new cables above or adjacent to the existing ones. The construction procedures and load transfer sequencing is a critical part of the design. The new cables will need to be erected in their free position and will undergo substantial deformations as the load is transferred to them. Additionally, the existing cables and towers will undergo their own deformations, as will the bridge superstructure as it is released from the old and supported by the new suspension system. The work will require extensible hangers to accomplish the load transfer, and all operations must be coordinated to limit changes in the roadway geometry and stresses in the superstructure, towers and suspension components.')
