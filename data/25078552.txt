This senator, a conservative, anti-tax Democrat, asked my acquaintance about Sweden and swaggeringly commented about &quot;all those taxes the Swedes pay&quot;. To which this American replied, &quot;The problem with Americans and their taxes is that we get nothing for them.&quot; He then went on to tell the senator about the comprehensive level of services and benefits that Swedes receive.<p>&gt;&quot;If Americans knew what Swedes receive for their taxes, we would probably riot,&quot; he told the senator. The rest of the ride to the theatre district was unsurprisingly quiet.')
