Politicians wanted to seem like they were doing something so they rolled their eyes and enacted these half-assed &quot;orders&quot;, making sure to forget to have the police enforce them. In CA, our brilliant governor told everyone to wear masks and avoid restaurants, then went out and had a fun maskless restaurant outing himself.<p>Most people I know took stay-at-home seriously, but enough people didn&#x27;t that it was totally ineffectual.')
