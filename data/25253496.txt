A knight is often considered “less” than a bishop, but trading your bishop that is on the same color as your pawns for a knight that is covering the center is generally a “good trade”.<p>Or taking a piece that is stuck or unlikely to be a threat while putting your own, possibly lesser piece at risk may be a poor play too.<p>Game dynamics matter too. Knights do well in closed games where as bishops are nicer in open games. Games tend to open as time goes on though.<p>And then of course if sacrificing to setup a mate soon - that’s the entire goal of the game so in that situation positioning is quite important.<p>Counting the pieces is pretty indicative of most games I’d say though. Against poor players you can be down quite a few pieces while setting up a back rank mate the opponent just doesn’t see. But this would never fly at moderate skill levels.')
