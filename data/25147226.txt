These changes can be due to change in velocity (winds, currents) or moment of inertia (moisture in atmosphere).<p>[1] If we ignore friction due to tidal forces from moon and sun (which is valid on these time-scales), the &quot;earth system&quot; is not affected by any non-central forces and so the angular momentum is constant.')
