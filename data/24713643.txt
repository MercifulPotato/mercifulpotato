You know they are in one of three rooms. Right before you can open the first one, your friend opens the second one and say: &quot;not there&quot;. People assume the Monty Hall problem means that it&#x27;s more likely your friend is in the third room and not the one you were going to open and think it&#x27;s silly. And they are right to think that. What they don&#x27;t get is that the case where your friend opened the correct door is part of the switching choice in the Monty Hall situation.')
