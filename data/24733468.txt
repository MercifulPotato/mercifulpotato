Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[24734027], score=None, time=1602271464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723041, text='<i>&gt; 3) I’m not being an asshole to you because you’re a black trans woman, I’m being an asshole to you because I am an asshole and my white male friends say “oh Xxx is such as asshole.” So don’t take it personally</i><p>I thought this deserved to be broken out to a separate reply.<p>I actually used to be in that camp. In my case I used to say some extremely heteronormative patriarchal objectifying bullshit <i>ironically</i> (typical examples would be &quot;barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen&quot; or &quot;get me a beer, bitch&quot;. This started pretty darn early, like 10 years old. My mom&#x27;s friends all thought it was hilarious when I was asked what piece of chicken I wanted and I answered with a deadpan &quot;well, I&#x27;m usually a leg man, but...&quot;). In other words, I was pretending to be a misogynist asshole for purposes of humor.<p>It turns out that as an adult, many of the people closest to me couldn&#x27;t always <i>tell</i> I was being ironic, despite the obvious (to me) extreme contrast between these statements and my everyday persona.<p>And that&#x27;s entirely aside from the fact that this sort of humor is painful to people who regularly encounter the real thing when it <i>is</i> meant to hurt them, <i>even if they completely understand that I don&#x27;t mean it that way</i>. I was essentially using their pain as a prop for my humor.<p>So, I could have responded with some variant of &quot;fuck &#x27;em if they can&#x27;t take a joke&quot;, but that would have left me associating only with people who a) got my sense of humor and put up with it, as well as b) people who didn&#x27;t but approved of the literal interpretation and were encouraged by it. That wouldn&#x27;t have been a good outcome for me.<p>To give a less pointed example of my sense of humor, I once horrified a co-worker who brought to my attention a severe defect that would have caused a user security issue if it had been deployed to production by responding &quot;Well, we <i>certainly</i> couldn&#x27;t allow <i>that</i>!&quot; with heavy sarcasm. I was using sarcasm ironically. Since I immediately escalated the issue I would have thought that it was obvious that I was taking the issue very seriously, but I had misjudged my audience.<p>It is incumbent on me to communicate clearly, even or especially when using humor. And my sort of weapons-grade irony and sarcasm can&#x27;t be handled too carefully.<p>Now, what you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t quite the same thing (since I actually try to not be an asshole), but in your case it really is incumbent on you to communicate clearly as well when you&#x27;re being an asshole that you are not being an asshole to a black trans woman <i>because</i> they are a black trans woman, and also that you aren&#x27;t being an asshole to them <i>as</i> a black trans woman. And you have to somehow do it without a bunch of &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist etc., but...&quot; qualifiers. The latter point is so subtle, you&#x27;re never going to be able to get it right, except perhaps one-on-one with someone you know <i>very</i> well (eg. my spouse thinks a &quot;get me a fuckin&#x27; beer, woman&quot; demand from me is hilarious, but that&#x27;s in part because she knows I don&#x27;t like beer, and rarely swear. Even with her I would be pretty careful about asking for anything else that way). You certainly won&#x27;t get it right while still using racist and transphobic rhetoric.<p>So, you have a stark choice similar to mine: stop being an asshole to black trans women, or end up associating only with people who think doing that is excusable, normal, or even desirable, behavior.')
