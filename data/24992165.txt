And I say that as a Rust fan myself.<p>&gt; ...but remember that garbage collectors are great. By having a GC, we don&#x27;t have to do any of the stuff that causes all these problems in Rust. Maybe that costs performance, but I need the ability to quickly write code a lot more than I need the extra performance.<p>This is very valid and sensible. Worth noting is that C++ would be a ridiculous choice for this type of application, and Rust manages to be a <i>not</i> ridiculous choice which is already a huge accomplishment. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s always a <i>good</i> choice.')
