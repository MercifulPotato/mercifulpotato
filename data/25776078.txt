A theoretical solution to the problem that can deliver the promises of rent control is if the government guarantees housing for the desired price.<p>The reason why it works is because the government is forced to change laws that prevent the construction it just promised. It&#x27;s about accountability rather than the promise itself.<p>The reason why rent control doesn&#x27;t work is because the government can enact or keep laws that restrict the supply of housing. There is no accountability. It&#x27;s actually equivalent to censorship. If you want the housing market to look good, just ban bad news (high prices).')
