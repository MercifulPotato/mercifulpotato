Item(by='perl4ever', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610354839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726269, text='That says &quot;seditious conspiracy&quot;, not &quot;sedition&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s wrong to call that &quot;sedition&quot; by extension, if you like, I&#x27;m just confused because I didn&#x27;t get the memo on how the word is being used now.<p>All my life, &quot;sedition&quot; has meant, as far as I knew, criticism of the government, possibly false criticism. Nor did I know of laws against it since around a hundred years ago or more.<p>Here is something saying sedition is:<p>&quot;The federal crime of advocating insurrection against the government through speeches and publications.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;sedition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;sedition</a><p>Here is a part of the law that sounds like it&#x27;s outlawing sedition even though it doesn&#x27;t actually include the word: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2385" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;18&#x2F;2385</a><p>The significance, ultimately, is I&#x27;m suspicious that someone is pushing this term because they want to turn around and outlaw criticizing the government and say Democrats asked for it. Or, even if nobody has that plan yet, that using the term carelessly could invite it.')
