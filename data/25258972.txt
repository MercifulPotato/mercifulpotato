You can&#x27;t just release a CPU for which there is no operating system.<p>Apple can pull it off because they already own entire stack from hardware to operating system to cloud services and the can swap out a component like CPU for a different architecture and release new version of OS that supports it.<p>Apple, by creating new CPU, replace a part of the stack that is owned by Intel by their own which only strengthens them position even if it did not improve any performance.<p>Apple is invulnerable to other companies copying the CPU and creating their own because they are not really a competition here. Apple sells an integrated product of which CPU is just one component.')
