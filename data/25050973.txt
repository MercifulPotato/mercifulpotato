You can&#x27;t have a society with 330 million people and not have at least 1 murderer who is relentlessly violent, who needs to be physically confined to protect everyone around them. As soon as you have 1 individual like that (which is almost guaranteed by the law of large numbers irrespective of how good that society is), you&#x27;ve already agreed that some kind of prison (whether or not you label it as such) is necessary.<p>Every large country has some kind of supermax prison, including Scandinavian countries, because it&#x27;s a simple reality that individuals like the above exist in small numbers.')
