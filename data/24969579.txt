I work primarily in backend technologies and specialize in making odd data sets come together in ways that don&#x27;t seem apparent to give my clients an edge in their fields. Most recently, I&#x27;ve worked on a technology that I call VoteFlipper; it&#x27;s a set of AIs that tell you if any particular voter will vote in an election and gives you a good idea of their true partisan lean. VoteFlipper shows campaigns how to use their resources in the most effective ways; why spend money advertising to folks who will never share your ideology?<p>It’s had a good 2018 and a great 2020, but I’m looking for new opportunities to work with fresh, unique datasets to solve different problems.<p>You can check out the main site here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voteflipper.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voteflipper.com</a> and I’ve made a series of timestamped, interactive charts on my Twitter, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;voteflipper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;voteflipper</a>.<p>I’m looking forward to hearing from you!')
