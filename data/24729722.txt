Item(by='etangent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602250311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725167, text='You are taking a &quot;consequentialist&quot; stance implying that if something has political consequences, then it is political. There are several problems with this.<p>First, literally anything could have political consequences, from a solar flare to a fly landing in someone&#x27;s hair. This logic easily devolves into absurdity. Famously, Chinese government under Mao declared sparrows &quot;public animals of capitalism&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Pests_Campaign" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Four_Pests_Campaign</a><p>Second, when anything could be political, the moniker &quot;political&quot; (like any other inflated moniker) loses a lot of its meaning. And yet real politics is still done by real people with real consequences.<p>Third, raising everything to the status of political is an example of <i>politicization</i>. This is typical of totalitarian regimes. Totalitarian regimes are in fact <i>characterized</i> by the fact that literally everything is raised to the realm of political, the realm of rule by the regime. By pressuring others to be political, you are creating a totalitarian environment, a very unpleasant environment for most people to be as we already know from some very bitter 20th century lessons.<p>Fourth, politics is about having political enemies. When political enemy (opponent) does not exist, there is no politics as such. By insisting that people <i>act</i> politically, you are simultaneously insisting that they have enemies. There are profound moral problems with this, whether you are Christian or even not religious at all.')
