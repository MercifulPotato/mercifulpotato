People used them to make DotA and other mini-games, not other RTS games even though they could&#x27;ve.<p>It just seems to me RTS games are like chess, not easy to get into, not easy to watch &#x2F; understand unless you pour a lot of time into it. People would rather just play Catan or other not-so-try-hard social games.<p>I think DotA is the best example of this, it&#x27;s still try-hard yet somehow it strikes the perfect balance of try-hard but still easy enough that the average player can understand it and follow it.')
