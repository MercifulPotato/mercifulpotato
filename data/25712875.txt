If you don&#x27;t even do that, you&#x27;re just getting less and less healthy.<p>This also explains the different advice we see here on cardio vs weights. For those first 10 minutes or so you&#x27;re probably better off with cardio - you want a systemic exercise. After that, resistance training all the way.<p>Also if you do enough resistance training (say 20-30 minutes per day or more), you can skip cardio altogether.')
