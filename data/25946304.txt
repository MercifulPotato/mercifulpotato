Casual in-person conversation doesn&#x27;t shift to chat platforms, it just happens less frequently.<p>People being remote that miss out on office chit-chat aren&#x27;t actually missing out on something if their coworkers can help it. I think these interactions are incredibly important for people who value them, and fear of &quot;leaving out&quot; remote workers isn&#x27;t a very good reason to prevent them.<p>The most effective workplaces I&#x27;ve been at that have had successful remote workers are the teams that try to consistently involve those people. It&#x27;s not a set of rules or trainings that makes people do this, it&#x27;s a mix of cultural values and individual conscientiousness.')
