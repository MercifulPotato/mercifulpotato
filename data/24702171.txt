If <i>your</i> insulin dose is too expensive, you die. If <i>my</i> insulin dose is too expensive in America, I ship it from generics factories in India¹.<p>The problem for <i>you</i> is that you can&#x27;t do what I do. And maybe the problem for you is also that I can&#x27;t sell you what I get this way.<p>So in America <i>you</i> have &#x27;shortages&#x27;. <i>I</i> do not. And if you wanted, you could also choose not to have &#x27;shortages&#x27;.<p>I remember the same thing happening when Chloroquine was &#x27;in short supply&#x27;. I could <i>always</i> get some. You never could. This is by choice. You live by rules that the universe does not require of you. These are probably for other reasons like perhaps you believe in living by the categorical imperative. But there are predators in this forest who do not believe in that.<p>¹ Even insulin can come here stably and safe. But drugs for other conditions are easier.
