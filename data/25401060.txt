Told numerous times throughout the sales cycle by their architects and engineers that their API could do all the things we needed &quot;easily&quot; and that they could finish off the last few features we needed within 2-3 minor releases.<p>Fast forward almost a year, at least 7 releases, and probably $200k of payroll on our end and their product barely runs, and doesn&#x27;t handle all of our standard workflow, let alone edge cases. Best we can assume is they were writing the API from scratch because we needed it and didn&#x27;t have the skill to do so. Documentation was offensively bad when it was correct, which most of the time it was not, to the point where there were several instances of the endpoints in the docs being wrong, causing us to call support to ask what the real endpoints were we were supposed to be calling.<p>All this to say yeah, buying is great if the company is professional and has a well-documented product, and the sales and technical pre-sales folks know what they&#x27;re talking about. But that isn&#x27;t necessarily the case, even for six-figure purchases. And when it&#x27;s not the case you can easily burn a non-trivial amount of money before you ever realize it.')
