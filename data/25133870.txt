BSOD, instability, viruses,<p>2. Expectations of ability to run billions of existing windows software<p>The first thing that popped in anyone&#x27;s mind about Windows Phone was 1 above.<p>For ARM, many frustrated customers returned their store-bought Windows ARM devices after they got home and could not run normal vlc, chrome, existing games...<p>Microsoft having realized this, has spent the last 4 years+ working on the ability to run classic windows apps on windows for ARM. They placed their bet on faster chips - Apple got there first.<p>If Microsoft names their ARM operating system something else, initial marketing dollars would be initially higher.
