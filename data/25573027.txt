While whistleblowing is a vital activity, the data dumps Manning pulled from the military network and State Department were unredacted raw dumps.<p>WikiLeaks tried to get the Pentagon to help them redact documents[1].\nThey refused to do so knowing there would be people like you accusing WikiLeaks&#x2F;Manning of wrongdoing here.<p>&gt; I like Manning as a person, but state secrets exist for a reason and she deserved to be imprisoned for her crimes.<p>You do realize she shed light on war crimes right? Do you consider war crimes &#x27;state secrets&#x27; that &#x27;exist for a reason&#x27;?<p>The reason, oftentimes, is simply to hide wrongdoing, as was the case here. The fact Manning was imprisoned, (and tortured), while the killers of civilians and journalists she exposed were not shows that this is not a just system. It&#x27;s designed to chill whileblowers and allow atrocities to continue, unpunished.<p>How anyone could support that is beyond me.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;wikileaks_5&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;wikileaks_5&#x2F;</a>')
