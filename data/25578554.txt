I guess it is single threaded. On the other hand, with normal graphics programming, where OpenGL or Direct X with GPU hardware does these things for us, execution is parallel. With this course we will get the fundamentals strong. Still for high quality light processing, ray tracing is the king. The course is good with this aspect. But you have to unlearn everything to avoid prejudice to get accustomed with the massively parallel GPU environment. That is the faster and economic way for real-time rasterization. That is a point of caution. Or rather an aspect to consider spending time on this non parallel algorithms. If this course discusses parallel things, cpu is only multi-core, not manycore like GPU, so cannot give real-time performance. However, I am assuming everything from the course-outline!')
