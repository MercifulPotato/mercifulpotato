Rather than trying to imagine the issues, try to develop an eye to see the problems that are already in front of you. And don&#x27;t start with grand ambitions. Start with the problem in front of you.<p>One way is to have hobbies, side hustles, volunteer work, whatever. As long as you&#x27;re doing something that requires solving problems that are different from your day to day programming job, you will find a constant stream of problems that maybe you can improve with a bit of code.<p>Some of my side projects are directly related to my work, but most of them aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;m working on something right now because someone in my life needed advice on digital security, and it turned out to be not an easy problem to address.')
