The wealthy world has ascended the Maslow pyramid to the point that our itches are no longer scratched by material stuff. Isn&#x27;t this the situation that spiritual people have been begging for for millenia?<p>Now it&#x27;s time to move onto people&#x27;s real problems: loneliness, hopelessness, etc.<p>For those people saying it&#x27;s an American thing: yes, you&#x27;re right--we&#x27;ve been on the wealth train for long enough that we&#x27;ve lost that urge to maximize everything. Do we need yet another item that becomes trash? No, we&#x27;d rather not waste the money and resources because it&#x27;s no big deal to have yet another trinket around. And I&#x27;m sure the rest of the wealthy world will be with us on this before too long--maybe when a majority of their population didn&#x27;t grow up combatting scarcity as kids.')
