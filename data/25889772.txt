I also have no idea how to actually make it better.<p>This has been my gut feeling for a long time, and in the last year, I finally took the time to write down my thoughts on the topic.

But I have some ideas to make it better.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiringfor.tech&#x2F;archive.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiringfor.tech&#x2F;archive.html</a>')
