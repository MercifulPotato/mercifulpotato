Even though I don&#x27;t like clubs, my friends would pull me to them , and occasionally I&#x27;d meet someone.<p>I&#x27;m not on social media&#x2F; online dating because I found it to be a stressful time suck.<p>Now you have an entire generation who see social circles as optional. So they sit inside all day swipping right , and when they find they&#x27;ve been chatting with Bots all day, they lash out on Reddit.<p>The best part of going out with my friends was always spending time with them. It wasn&#x27;t a matter of go to club 3 times == find partner. Chilling with your friends, even just the Uber home , is its own reward.<p>At the same time you definitely can invest time in real social activities. A colleague of mine, who&#x27;s married casually remarked all the guys in her tennis class have phds. You want to be a PhD, or another high income individual who spends his or her free time in tennis class, not an angry net citizen who complains about liberals all day on Reddit.')
