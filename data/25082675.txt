There was never division until politicians and their PR engines decided to divide us... to conquer us.<p>Government has become too large and our news media has gone under the control of said gov. For crying out loud, even China has a large presence&#x2F;narrative control of Reddit and from a userbase perspective, Ghislaine Maxwell [1] has been controlling the narrative on Reddit for years [2].<p>Obama, it’s a joke if you think we can all simply be aligned. It doesn’t work like that. We all have different lives and issues we are facing. We all have different needs. If you want government to be more functional, scale has to be decreased. The USA is simply too big and diverse to meet the needs of all with one stone.<p>Finally, painting one man, Trump, the way you are is simply wrong.  One man can’t destroy a nation - and if one can - then this nation was never meant to survive. Luckily, he can’t and this nation will prosper long past your book publishing.<p>Enjoy your pizza and dogs.  The citizens of the USA will win no matter what you do to try to stop&#x2F;hamper it.<p>[1] Epstein’s friend.<p>[2] &#x2F;u&#x2F;maxwellhill')
