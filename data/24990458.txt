Ultimately what his model encodes is the polls+a degree of uncertainty of the polls are completely wrong. If you looked at just the polls, there was no way for trump to win, even assuming a polling error of the same variety as 2016, which appears to be about the situation we are in now.<p>So no, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with his tweet. Otherwise, you should be able to explain how trump could win without a polling error. Which states that trump was polling behind by 5-7 points he&#x27;d win, and how he&#x27;s win them <i>without</i> a polling error.')
