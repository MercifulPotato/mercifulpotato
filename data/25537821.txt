I moved to Macs over two years ago, had to work on multiple Macs(2 2018, 1 2020) and literally had ONE issue during update which was solved in 15 seconds by rebooting into whatever the name of the super menu in Macs. My girlfriend on the other hand routinely faces issues with Windows updates, drivers issues, WiFi not working, random restarts, noise issues. And this is on 2.5k lenovo, which puts it into the same bucket as my MBP. If she didn&#x27;t need Windows for work she would switch to Mac without looking back.')
