The majority of the transactions went to &quot;Brian Forde for Congress&quot; and have the memos like &quot; .03533216 BITCOINS SOLD VIA COINBASE - PURCHASER UNKNOWN&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think these are contributions <i>by</i> Coinbase, but Bitcoin contributions that went <i>through</i> Coinbase.  There is probably some byzantine election funding rule that allowed or forced these recipients to list Coinbase as the&quot;source&quot; of anonymous Bitcoin donations.')
