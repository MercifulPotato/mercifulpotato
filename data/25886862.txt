Even in a single water molecule the electrons loose their &quot;identities&quot; and even if you could look close enough at infinitesimally small time intervals at the molecule you&#x27;d never be able to say &quot;There&#x27;s one electron here, and there&#x27;s the other over there&quot;. And I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s just too hard to have a microscope that good, I&#x27;m saying not even &quot;Mother Nature Herself Knows them apart&quot;<p>Imagine if you setup a standing wave on a water surface, and there are exactly two peaks in the wave system. You cannot label one &quot;Wave A&quot; and the other &quot;Wave B&quot; and then turn off the energy source and then turn it back on and create the pattern again and say &quot;Ok now which is A and which is B&quot;. The question itself is nonsensical. The same thing is going on in physics probability waves. Particles don&#x27;t have identities just because &quot;when you look for one you find one&quot;.<p>People think QM is describing &quot;where particles go&quot;. It isn&#x27;t. It describes where they can be found, and there&#x27;s a huge leap of knowledge in understanding to comprehend the difference.')
