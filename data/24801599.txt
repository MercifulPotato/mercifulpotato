It uses ZT as the transport, encryption, and network virtualization layer and then does P2P exit node stuff on top of that.<p>ZT would be useful for this from an oppressed country because it is used by a ton of businesses. You would just look like you were accessing a corporate ZeroTier DVPN from home, which is pretty common these days.<p>That&#x27;s better in some ways than Tor. The problem with Tor is if you use it naked then it can be obvious that you&#x27;re using Tor. Even in countries like the USA I&#x27;ve always been concerned that using Tor might put you in some kind of database. In a very non-free country I&#x27;d be really worried about using Tor naked, meaning without running it over something more mundane looking like ZT or Wireguard.')
