It could very well be that they have a lot of buyers because of a very low profit margin and this actually has a notable impact on the company&#x27;s finances.<p>Saying you are &quot;held hostage&quot; might be a bit of a dramatic way to phrase it, but for some companies a change like this actually makes a difference. Such is the life of relying on any third-party services though.<p>Also, pointing out &quot;faults&quot; is not helpful. It&#x27;s unproductive conversation. Many companies are built upon third-party services that they are (probably falsely) under the impression will not change. It&#x27;s not your &quot;fault&quot; if you decide to use AWS services and become deeply integrated and they increase their prices by 10% and you can no longer afford their services... It&#x27;s no one&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s just unfortunate and all you can do is try to work around it, or close the company.')
