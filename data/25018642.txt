It&#x27;s getting cold, people are getting symptoms, and the rate of asymptomatic cases is 90%. So a lot of people are getting tested now, but had an infection months ago. The PCR tests still picks up the pieces now.<p>Every PCR positive cannot be called new infection, because both might be false. Not new, and not infected.<p>That&#x27;s why everybody is putting the much better and cheaper antigen tests forward. Only when that is positive, a PCR test needs to be done. Antibody tests are highly unreliable, but antigen tests have no false positives. China tested a whole 5 mill city in a few days with antigen tests, Slovakia tested their entire population in two weekends.')
