Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[24691891, 24691915], score=None, time=1601928918, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24690538, text='&gt; We’re talking about a mild respiratory infection in 99+% of people.<p>It <i>kills</i> 1% to 3% of people that get it, and many of the others have a pretty bad time.  The fact that many people can get it with only mild symptoms actually makes it <i>worse</i>, because it means the disease is less self-limiting, and overall more deadly.<p>And even if you got the statistic right, it&#x27;s not telling the story you seem to want it to.  A car that will only start 99 days out of 100 is not a reliable car.  A car that doesn&#x27;t kill its passengers 99% of the time is not safe car, and may actually be one of the most dangerous cars ever made.<p>&gt; Censor me if you’d like. Every day fewer people care. There is nothing you can do to change that.<p>Yep. Stupid and selfish people are a fact of life, unfortunately.  That&#x27;s why the law needs punishments.')
