However I&#x27;m pretty skeptical that a moderate amount of alcohol consumption, say 1-2 drinks per week, is any higher risk to your health than the many other activities we engage in to live a happy and engaging life, as other commentators have pointed out.<p>Anecdotally it seems that the people who take these things to the extremes (i.e. never have even a single drink because drinking alcohol is bad for you) tend to stress out about a lot of other things as well. Obviously if someone doesn&#x27;t drink because they find the effects unpleasant that&#x27;s different, but I&#x27;m talking about the kinds of people who for example are overly concerned about microplastics (to the point of not eating any food that has been stored in a plastic container), or air quality (co2 monitors in every room, etc), or diet (will not touch anything with nitrates, only eat unprocessed foods, etc).<p>To a point, yes all of these things are legitimately harmful to your health, but having this kind of mentality is also not great for your well-being. Really perhaps the highest health-yield lifestyle change they could make is to relax a bit more and try not to get stressed out as much through meditation&#x2F;mindfulness<p>Not sure why, but SV in particular seems to attract a lot of people with this kind of mentality.')
