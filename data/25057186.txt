Making which faction with ~45% hardcore supporters [in swing states] has control a matter of dumb luck as opposed to whether their conduct impresses or appals the few people able to see merit in both political philosophies doesn&#x27;t sound like an improvement.<p>Also, the incentive to be corrupt certainly isn&#x27;t <i>weakened</i> by removing any incentive to present oneself as clean for future re-election from the equation.')
