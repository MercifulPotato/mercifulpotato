Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=[25971240, 25970139], score=None, time=1612021442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969707, text='&gt;  It’s psychologically and economically almost impossible<p>For you. But I know quite a few mid 30s retirees.<p>I agree that a lot of people seem to have a problem with impulse control and trusting their own valuation, when everybody say &quot;it&#x27;s wrong - it&#x27;s a fad - it&#x27;s tulip&#x2F;beanies&quot;.<p>Eventually you tune out everyone and learn to laugh all the way to the bank at the HN nonsense.<p>BTW I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss DOGE as a fad if I were you. Same mistake again and again on HN: regular people doing something? They must be wrong!<p>Turns out regular people want a crypto they don&#x27;t feel bad about, and that&#x27;s not owned by big banks like BTC&#x2F;ETH or anarchists like XMR&#x2F;ZEC. There aren&#x27;t many that can deliver, and DOGE is one of them.<p>Do you have a position, or are you planning to fail again?<p>Because the WSB mob is out for blood, and if GME is any sign, they are foaming at the mouth. DOGE should have been a simple pump, but it&#x27;s still around 900 sats<p>I give it 3 days (time for the deposits to clear and for people to coordinate) until it starts again.<p>Redditors have stated their goal: parity to the USD. They are half way though.<p>&gt; There aren’t many Bitcoin millionaires through speculation or early mining alone.<p>The best way not to win is not to play, alleging it&#x27;s psychologically and economically impossible.<p>EDIT: for the reply with a quote of DOGE in cents: They just did a 10x event. All they need is another 10x event to get DOGE on par with USDT.<p>They have already done one with minimal coordination and media attention, so I call that half way through because they already did half the work. It was done in a few days, thus a log scale seems applicable.<p>Of course, if you care about the linear value in fiat currencies, we have different values, so you may prefer a different choice of words.')
