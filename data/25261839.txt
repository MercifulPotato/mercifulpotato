My dad needed to drive through a particular toll booth multiple times one weekend. He figured out that same weekend you could go pretty fast and the ezpass would still register. So he went fast every time.<p>A week later he got a half dozen letters in the mail all at once:<p>* warning do not speed\n* warning (+fine)\n* final warning (+fine)\n* ezpass revocation (+fine)\n* etc.<p>I think he ended up arguing that he didn&#x27;t get the first warning before the others, and they agreed to waive the fines and roll back to the first warning. I.E. human judgement applied after the fines &quot;fixed&quot; the issue.<p>In any case: toll booths are a workplace, there&#x27;s people there, go slow.')
