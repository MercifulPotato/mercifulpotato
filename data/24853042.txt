Google&#x27;s SPDY, which was a binary HTTP protocol over TLS, eventually resulted in HTTP&#x2F;2 which there&#x27;s a fair chance you use today.<p>The other idea, QUIC, is a much bigger lift. It replaces not just the HTTP protocol and TLS but the whole stack, even TCP. At the IETF this work was split into two pieces, the IETF&#x27;s QUIC is just the TCP replacement, an encrypted connection-oriented reliable protocol. So the HTTP part of the problem is being standardised as HTTP&#x2F;3<p>Google&#x27;s QUIC &quot;gQUiC&quot; will be obsolete once the standardized protocol is finished. Right now a Chrome talking to e.g. GMail uses gQUIC, once the standards work is firmed up it&#x27;ll speak HTTP&#x2F;3 and then maybe a year later Google&#x27;s sites will discontinue gQUIC because it&#x27;s just maintenance effort with no residual value.')
