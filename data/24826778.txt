Women goes for walk with baby and needs to know husband will retrieve her if she is late, for her peace of mind? Really? Absolutely no one is served by pretention that normal women are scared to take walk with babies unless someone is checking on them.<p>I would assume that if the location with your partner is not available for a bit, you wont turn into bundle of anxiety.
