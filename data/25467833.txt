I think a lot of people are leaving big cities for good. But falling rents could make way for a new generation: it&#x27;s likely easier to move up in a lot of careers if you&#x27;re there in person. It could lead to more startups and innovation coming out of &quot;2nd tier&quot; cities and other places.<p>As someone who lives in an &#x27;outdoorsy&#x27; place that&#x27;s been a hot market for a while, I&#x27;m curious if people will end up spread out widely in the many towns in the west with outdoor access that still have cheap prices, or tend to cluster more in places like Bend (where I live) and Boulder.<p>Should be interesting to watch wages too. Companies that pay the same across the board and don&#x27;t cut for remote workers could be very strongly placed to attract a lot of great talent.')
