Not eating beef or steak or pork or lamb is surprisingly easy on the surface and the choices are better than they used to be. But it&#x27;s amazing how many mammal products have snuck their way into our food chain underneath, and those were the hardest things to avoid. Gelatin in liquid medicine capsules, pork-fat as a soup additive, chicken wings fried in beef tallow, the list goes on and on. And explaining to people in restaurants that you can&#x27;t eat mammals because you&#x27;ll swell up and die six hours later gets you a lot of weird looks.<p>Mercifully, after a year of being absolutely clean, I got a clean bill of health from my allergist: no more alpha-gal proteins in my system, and I can now eat soup in a restaurant or order the wings without worrying I&#x27;ll wake up choking to death later on. As a plus, I will say it improved my diet considerably and got me to think a lot about what I eat, so the experience was not without its benefits. That said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the experience to anyone.')
