They last more than a couple years if you treat them well (my cats chewed on them, though, which has made one of the earpieces more hit-and-miss but still functional, can&#x27;t run with them because the sweat will get inside now). I&#x27;ll likely replace them in &#x27;21, giving me 4-5 years of life out of them. That&#x27;s probably a better life span (but not better cost wise) than most wired headphones I&#x27;ve had (suffered various fates from loss, theft, to cat vandalism).')
