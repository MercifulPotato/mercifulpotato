Back when I had to restore a Z2100 plotter for my employer, I found out that all the &quot;clean printhead&quot;, &quot;print test plots&quot; and other commands - including when you launch them from the printer buttons instead from the web interface -  are just ordinary print jobs under the hood.<p>If you ask me, this is one huge security hole waiting to be exploited.<p>And if anyone ever wants to play around with the Z2100 or the formatter (HP50XI&#x2F;SCR or HP50XISCR)... they&#x27;re x86 Linux based!<p>Reboot the printer in Service mode, navigate to &quot;Service Utility&quot;, then &quot;Enable&#x2F;Disable Firewall&quot; and upon a reboot you get a SSH root shell. Kill all processes, sync the disk, and dd it out to your computer, as the laptop PATA disk on the formatter is encrypted. If you&#x27;re afraid of the PATA disk ever failing, take a CF card, a CF to 2.5in mini IDE adapter, dd the image from the previos step and replace the old disk.')
