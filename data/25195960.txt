I resuscitated one guy&#x27;s breathing after he&#x27;d choked on his own vomit behind a speaker at an open air concert. I only saw him because I like to stand behind the speakers where it isn&#x27;t as loud.<p>It sure was nasty having to give mouth to mouth without a membrane, but the lifesaving training[0] I did as a kid didn&#x27;t even mention them. Anyway, I got the guy breathing and instructed others to get the medics and got some antiseptic for my hands, since I had to remove the vomit from his mouth with them, but unfortunately there was no mouthwash available. I&#x27;d do it again, but if there is any story out there for you to realize the benefit of mouth to mouth membranes this is it.<p>[0] Did up to bronze cross but I failed one of the swimming tests because I accidentally did the racing version of a stroke instead of the life saving version. It&#x27;s hard to unlearn things that were hammered into you in a sports mindset.')
