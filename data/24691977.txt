I personally would not recommend that anyone try to use anything with less than 8 GB of RAM as a general purpose desktop computer anymore.<p>You can do it, sure, but there will be significant compromises and limitations along the way.  A secondhand x86 PC with 8+ GB of RAM is almost always a better choice for general purpose desktop use.  Leave the &quot;hacker boards&quot; for roles that benefit more from their compact size, low power consumption, and&#x2F;or specialty I&#x2F;O capabilities.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried the Pi 8GB, that should at least solve the RAM problem, but the lack of native high-speed storage still likely impacts usability.  Here&#x27;s hoping the major Pi-likes follow suit to offer variants with more memory soon.<p>---<p>And of course as noted by other comments, another major reason to think of these things more as appliances is the generally spotty support for updating kernels and the like that is unfortunately standard in the ARM world.  That entire side of the industry is infected with NDA culture and has no interest in curing it.')
