Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609263212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571163, text='It&#x27;s entirely confirmation bias; try posting a study or meta-analysis showing the inverse, or - and I think this will fare even worse - a meta-analysis of the effects of pornography on attitudes or sexual aggression.<p>The literature on pornography is more mixed and contentious, though. On violent video games and &quot;gaming addiction&quot;, there seems to be less and less going for the hypothesis that they cause violence or aggression.<p>However, from what reading I&#x27;ve done, you will find that longitudinal results in porn and video games are dissonant with experimental results in lab settings. This suggests that while there are effects, they do not persist to the level thought. More complex models (such as the confluence model in porn effects research) which try and explain apparent hidden variables are also gaining steam. There are actually only four or five major contemporary figures in porn effects research; Wright and Tokunaga finding that porn has negative effects on everyone; Hald and Malamuth finding that the main or only worry only lies in those low in agreeableness and predisposed to aggressive behaviour.<p>To a bunch of gamers and porn-users (including myself in both of those categories), these things are either things we spend a lot of time doing (for a portion of HN, I suspect their entire leisure time is taken up by video games), or they are very personal and private. Nothing is more personal than what we get off to, so any analysis of porn tends to be taken as an assault on sexuality itself (though interestingly, much as with advertising or propaganda, the very same sexuality cultivated by porn consumption).<p>I&#x27;ve tried discussing the literature on video games, porn, violence, aggression, and morality before on both HN and Reddit, and the discussion is either ignored or shot down with downvotes because any discussion at all feels like a personal attack.<p>I&#x27;d recommend for anyone interested in the topic of video games and aggression or behaviour, and indeed the hot topic of &quot;video game addiction&quot; to check out the papers by CJ Ferguson, who has a positive view on video games. At the same time, check out the people he replies to and the people replying to him. It&#x27;s ridiculous to draw any conclusion from a study that happens to reach the top of HN.')
