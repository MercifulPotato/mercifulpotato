Specifically in the beta you could just use hotkeys to quickly use Zerg Queen to spawn extra larvae. But nope! Pro players hated that. Why should players be able to do something in a strategy game in fewer clicks when they could simply do it in more? Garbage.<p>In an RTS the mechanical skill largely comes down to raw speed. And itâ€™s relatively binary. As opposed to a shooter where mechanical skill is reaction time and accuracy.<p>Interesting write up. I agree with many points. I pray someone twists the RTS genre in a way that is radically less reliant on APM.')
