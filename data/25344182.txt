Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607429165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337689, text='&gt; There is a chapter called ‘ninja code’, which is full of terrible advice.<p>How someone interprets a tongue-in-cheek chapter could be a good litmus test of their reading comprehension, grasp on the fundamentals, and (last, but not the least) basic sense of humour. I’d hate to see it removed.<p>If someone takes this section literally, I would be immensely curious how they reconciled in their mind that advice with what they (supposedly) read in preceding sections.')
