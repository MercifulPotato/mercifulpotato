If I&#x27;m wrong feel free to call me an idiot.<p>We had a rash of these COBOL articles earlier in the pandemic due to the need to update unemployment systems - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inputmag.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;ibm-will-offer-free-cobol-training-to-address-overloaded-unemployment-systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inputmag.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;ibm-will-offer-free-cobol-trai...</a> is agood link to review - but just to reiterate to anyone considering learning COBOL:<p>Don&#x27;t do it if you want to maximize compensation. Do it only if you&#x27;re interested in the language. COBOL is a interesting language that is unlike most, if not all modern languages. It&#x27;s great if you want to stretch your brain and attack new challenges. But it will not increase your compensation. Most COBOL opportunities are in the public sector working on unemployment services, taxation, etc. Their compensation is unlikely to exceed $100K - you&#x27;d be much better off learning the bleeding edge technologies and solutions, grinding LeetCode, etc.<p>With that said, I learned COBOL early in my career and it is quite interesting - it&#x27;s worth a poke at the Wikipedia page if you&#x27;re interested in history.')
