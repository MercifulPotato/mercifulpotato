Since the last few iterations of Apple hardware and OS software, I&#x27;ve decided to switch to something else. I&#x27;m also advicing all friends and collegues to do the same. There is simply no reason to stay with Apple anymore as a professional. It used to be stability and ease of use, but Windows has since closed that gap, and Linux is a close second (and a must for programming).<p>Most likely that means I&#x27;ll run a Linux laptop for programming, and have a partition for Windows on a gaming computer, cuz I love me some games. I know Steam is gradually approaching Linux, but most AAA games still run best under Win. Plus it&#x27;s an easy platform (outside OS X) to run multimedia production tools. Sorry, I just don&#x27;t think Gimp or other Linux tools for multimedia production are good enough yet, but the hope remains that they will someday compete with giants like Adobe. For real. And not just as free but woefully inadequate alternatives. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, though. I&#x27;d love to be surprised, if you are able!')
