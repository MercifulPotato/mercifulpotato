Objectively people who don’t have compassion do better in life. I believe a lot of CEO’s and politicians lack compassion. Also compassion, makes me feel bad more often.

If I did not have compassion, it would not bother me.<p>Now, reading the thrust of the article, it seems the author wants to keep one unreasonable thing (compassion) and throw out another unreasonable thing(religion). However, I do not see any example of principles that can show why one should be favored and another discarded, especially when for many people, their religious duty is what motivates compassion.<p>However, if you decide to throw out compassion and just stick to reading and evidence, I think you eventually end up with the morality of Thanos.')
