I wrote this out of memory based on reading  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-nasa-brought-the-monstrous-f-1-moon-rocket-back-to-life&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-nasa-brought-the...</a> a few years ago.<p>and I also remember reading that they had to reverse-engineer the designed and build their own CAD models because they couldn&#x27;t re-build the situation (and it looks like a lot of customization was done to each engine). But my overall point still stands, IMO. They couldn&#x27;t just rebuild it , just because they had the plans.<p>Fact Check 2: Last I checked I can still download&#x2F;clone repos anonymously, from public repos;\nMy point is , this can very quickly reverse. It won&#x27;t take a lot of time for Github (and others) to add restrictions under any excuses to restrict anonymity.<p>Just like how it took one Apple and only a couple of years  to make an entire industry almost completely eschew 3.5mm jacks for seeming no good reason (One excuse was waterproofing, but my s7 had a 3.5mm jack and was still IP67 rated).<p>Imagine if ifixit.org was de-platformed, because they were providing repair guides that was &quot;illegal&quot; from Apple&#x2F;Google&#x27;s perspective. Sure, as users we would rally behind ifixit because to us, the user&#x27;s, ifixit&#x27;s cause is noble. But, can you actually force Apple to reverse their decision, when it doesnt work out for your benefit ? If they don&#x27;t , do you have an immediate alternative, that works for you, before your or ifixit goes out of business ?')
