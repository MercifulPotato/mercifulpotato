The diameter of the airy disk at f1.6 for 500nn is of 2 microns, and for a line pair you&#x27;d need double that, not a single, so a line pair would fit on 4 microns. Over an 8mm sensor that&#x27;s 4000 lines, 2000 line pairs. Note that even here contrast is reduced by diffraction as we are operating from the first null. If you use the Rayleigh criterion and relax your standard for resolution you&#x27;re at 4000 barely distinguishable line pairs. IIRC that would 4000LP at MTF15, so at MTF50 you might be at around 2500-2600?<p>And this is of course the very best you can do at 26mm equivalent focal lengths, if you want a tighter or wider shot your image quality degrades because once again the optics don&#x27;t fit and you&#x27;ll have to reduce your f number.<p>2000 line pairs in perfect conditions is quite low. Better is expected from cheap DSLR zoom lenses.')
