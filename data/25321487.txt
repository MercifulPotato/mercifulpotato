They will almost certainly choose that if it means they won&#x27;t get sent to jail. Right now, in LA and SF, certain areas are littered with needles and feces. I&#x27;m not blaming the homeless. I&#x27;m blaming the woke tech liberals who get offended no matter what how the police interact with the homeless. I seriously doubt that that anyone is allowed to casually shoot up in highly trafficked streets in Sydney or Berlin.')
