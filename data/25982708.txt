Though it <i>is</i> possible to provably audit exactly how many USDT are in circulation at any point.<p>I think OP&#x27;s point was more about things which exist entirely on-chain, i.e. the idea of having stock ownership tracked directly there (rather than as a proxy for real shares tracked somewhere else).<p>In that frame, a better example is something like the DAI stablecoin, which is backed by assets that are on-chain.  So at any block, you can audit exactly how many DAI there are, exactly which assets exist to back it, and exactly what the last reported oracle prices are for those assets.')
