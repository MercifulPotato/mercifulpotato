Blown.</i><p>This is basically what also happens during long division! I marked the remainder of the previous operation in each line with a bracket (no italics in code formatting, sadly), appending another digit of the dividend behind them is the same operation as multiplying the &#x27;remembered&#x27; number by 10 and adding the next digit to it:<p><pre><code>    8 5 3 6 2 9  &#x2F;  7  =  1 2 1 9 4 7; remainder 0\n  - 7                       \n   --                       \n   [1]5            How long division works:\n  - 1 4   &lt;-------     subtract largest possible multiple,     \n   ----                 note remainder in next line, append\n     [1]3               next digit from number at top, and \n    -   7               repeat until done. And make sure to\n     ----               keep track of the result.\n       [6]6\n      - 6 3                 \n       ----                 \n         [3]2\n        - 2 8\n         ----\n           [4]9\n          - 4 9\n           ----\n             [0]  &lt;= final remainder = 0, i.e. 7 is a divisor of the number\n</code></pre>\nThanks a lot for your comment, this was insightful!')
