It exists wherever a weaker force encounters a stronger force. In the revolutionary war Americans were criticized by the British because they wouldn’t line up to shoot.. they would hide behind trees and fire from cover. Or more recently in the Iraq war (2) we got to watch as the Iraqi military dissolved into an insurgent force (this was before alqueda moved in).<p>We see more of it today because so many wars today are imbalanced. It’s not US v China.. it’s US v Afghanistan. They have no choice but to attack from the shadows.')
