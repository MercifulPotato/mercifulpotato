If they are absolutely rockstar talent and can be just as good remotely, then why wouldn&#x27;t they command the highest salary? In fact, they should be able to command <i>even more</i> money now as all the remote-OK companies bid for them without any friction over moving &#x2F; commute issues.<p>Honestly it&#x27;s a win-win-win - a win for the company that has far larger talent pool, win for the employee who gets paid more and can move to a more desirable, low cost-of-living location, and win for the &quot;left-behind&quot; areas of the country where many rich techies will move to.<p>This will reduce class divisions and equalize our communities without any coercion and continue to allow highly-skilled labor to extract maximum income from capital. I very much like this shift towards remote work - it is the silver lining to come out of the pandemic.')
