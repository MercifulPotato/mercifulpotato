Congress would have a full declaration of war signed in an hour.<p>Terrorist attacks like 9&#x2F;11 leave doubt about who to go after and at what scale to retaliate but a clear attack on a city by a foreign state as an act of war is a different thing. Gloves would come off and the complete full force of every resource ( military, political, economic, etc ) would be brought to bear.')
