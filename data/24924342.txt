They&#x27;re comfortable and sound good for the price, but they get a bit too warm for me after a couple hours. I was avoiding open-backed headphones at the time because I&#x27;ve heard they leak audio and didn&#x27;t want to annoy my coworkers. Now I work remote, so maybe I should re-consider open-backed headphones if they breath better. Thanks for the suggestion!')
