Item(by='crossroadsguy', descendants=None, kids=[25649242], score=None, time=1609871904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647884, text='Not sure where you are from but getting a SIM (mobile connection) or even getting your own SIM&#x2F;number re-issued is not as simple as that is in many (western) countries.<p>Transfers&#x2F;switches&#x2F;porting always have a decent cool-off period. So while I am not saying it&#x27;s as safe as it gets, I was just wondering whether you were assuming it&#x27;s the same way in many other countries.<p>PS. Credit cards just can&#x27;t work just based on credit card number, CVV, and expiry MMYYYY here either. You have got to have that SMS OTP auth and in many cases a password as well. Also, at POS (shops, restos etc) you must enter your PIN, it&#x27;s not optional. (Now up to â‚¹2000 some cards let you just swipe&#x2F;tap w&#x2F;o a PIN, but it&#x27;s an opt-in feature)')
