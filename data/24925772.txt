When learning you have to balance rewarding activities with valuable knowledge and skills. Excel maybe isn&#x27;t so frustrating (unless you&#x27;re trying to do stuff like, short-circuit &quot;or&quot; statements .. )<p>I much prefer to take the data into a language -- like Python -- and do analysis on it.

Massive Excel files.')
