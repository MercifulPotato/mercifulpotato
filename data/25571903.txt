I hope he has a backup of all his videos.<p>ALWAYS HAVE A LOCAL BACKUP of all the content you upload to other services. Facebook is not your photo backup. All your stuff could disappear off Google tomorrow. The cloud is literally someone else&#x27;s computer.<p>The biggest takeaway for all YouToobers is to organize all their videos in a manor that they can upload them to a new place when (not if) the time comes.<p>YouTube is going to become a dinosaur in a few years. I don&#x27;t see people finding meaningful content on it with the shit they keep pulling.')
