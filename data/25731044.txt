Item(by='dvdkon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610382079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730638, text='&gt; smartphones don&#x27;t require repairs often<p>I&#x27;ve had people come to me with broken screens, old batteries, non-functional&#x2F;muffled earpieces, wonky USB connectors, cracked lenses and other problems. Smartphones do require repairs and people, at least the ones I know, do want to repair them. But when I tell them the part will take a month to arrive and might not have the same quality as the original, not to mention the non-zero risk of cosmetic damage during disassembly, I can&#x27;t blame them for rather buying a new phone.<p>My parents have a washing machine that&#x27;s now over 15 years old. It still gets repairs regularly. The parts cost is going up though, because they haven&#x27;t been made in a long time now. Imagine how long we could keep this washing machine if the parts were standardised or their CAD files available online, maybe some manufacturer would be making clones of them right now.')
