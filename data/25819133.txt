This looks really over-provisioned compared to the reported size of their site, there is no caching layer that I can make out, I bet they are using those forty i3s to host user content as blobs in a database. If they added a couple varnish servers and moved the user content to S3 (or similar - you can get much better deals with the same api from other vendors) they could probably ditch &gt; 90% of this.<p>When I was at Tumblr they also overbuilt a huge amount of infrastructure just because they had the investor money - they dropped something like 1.4 million on two Cisco routers, each one could probably handle all the traffic in South America - but you need two of them, right? They dropped another half million a year on four network engineers to manage the two routers, and they had nothing to do most of the time so they sat around staging gladiatorial contests between a couple turtles and whatever the pet shop had that day. I’m sure the users would have been outraged and canceled Tumblr if they knew that was going on.')
