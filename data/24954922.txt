I used the same license and also added full credit, since the elisp was mine but the selection of colours wasn&#x27;t.<p>One contributor decided to fork straight away and then link to it in an issue rather than adding a pull request. Eh, whatever, I didn&#x27;t like it so much at the time but we came to an agreement, and the person who forked did a great job maintaining the theme.<p>It became popular enough that some more prolific emacsers caught wind, and the project became more integrated.
