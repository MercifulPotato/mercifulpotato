Item(by='TulliusCicero', descendants=None, kids=[24968775, 24970007, 24968117], score=None, time=1604322386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24966262, text='&gt; Escooter&#x2F;ebike is rarely a replacement for a car.<p>True for most of the US, but that&#x27;s by design.<p>Our family of three gave up having a car when we moved from California to Munich, here our electric cargo bike is our &#x27;car&#x27;. Works great. Plenty of other families without cars as well.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that a car wouldn&#x27;t be very useful or more convenient for certain kinds of trips, of course (e.g. Ikea). But it doesn&#x27;t feel like a necessity here the way it almost always felt like one in the US. And that&#x27;s for a simple reason: Munich actually takes different forms of transport seriously, including street design, allocated land, and $$$ (well, €€€). I could go on and on about the differences.<p>In the US, mandatory very low density zoning, as well as local transportation systems designed to be car-first (or car-only), are the reason driving is usually a basic necessity. But if you start upzoning and pouring serious resources into other modes of transport, they can work very well too.<p>edit: I guess I should say, thinking of it as &quot;a replacement for a car&quot; is a very American mode of thinking, because it assumes that the car is a necessity in the first place. The aim <i>should</i> be a system where a car is a nice-to-have, not an integral component of every single person&#x27;s life, a system where an ebike doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be a &quot;replacement for a car&quot;, because you don&#x27;t strictly need a car to live your life.')
