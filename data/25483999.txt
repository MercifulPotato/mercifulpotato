There is a reason GPUs have their own memory bus -- contention. CPU&#x2F;GPUs fighting over access to memory causes massive disruption to very parallel computation. Even if Intel&#x2F;nVidia resolved their fight over inter-CPU connectivity or we&#x27;re talking POWER and nVidia using NV-LINK, you still need extra memory ports to keep things fed. The more cores and the faster the GPU the more memory bandwidth required.<p>I expect to see future Mac Pro M1 series machines with  multiple CPU sockets -- at which point memory isn&#x27;t unified any more, and all the regular CC-NUMA tricks will be used. But it won&#x27;t be a big deal.')
