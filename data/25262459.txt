My professor had us do online homework with unlimited attempts, but we had to submit our hand written work as well. Even though that class was entirely online, I felt very confident applying what I learned on projects.<p>The immediate feedback was 10x better than having the week or two of lag, and 9x better than having the answer on the back of the book because I never ran out of problems to try.')
