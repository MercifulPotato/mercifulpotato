Which at a bare minimum means exposing ports and adding a network layer. Suddenly you find yourself in the weeds with docker-compose and debating whether or not it&#x27;s actually suitable for a production environment, when they recommend using swarm instead. Then you find out swarm is on shaky ground and now you&#x27;re hearing about nomad and ten different other solutions just to avoid k8s.<p>Infrastructure-as-code is a wonderful idea. But the reality is it&#x27;s a full time job. There will always be orphaned containers and things that need cleaned up and automated. And if you don&#x27;t, then your environment will run out of space or RAM and all devs will be sitting there doing nothing.<p>Building docker images also takes time, especially if you don&#x27;t optimize the image. The simplest deploy workflow I&#x27;ve seen was a git hook (post-update, I think) that ran a few commands when the repo is updated. It&#x27;d really be hard to make up for the efficiency of that workflow after messing about with docker for days.')
