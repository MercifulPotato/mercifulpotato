We are 100% certain our voter rolls are not entirely clean. I’m not saying there was voter fraud, but Kreb’s statement just seems odd. Best possible case, there was no chain of custody for ballots, so even if there were no issues or reasons to be suspicious, it just isn’t a great claim.<p>If you look at the Trump tweets (ugh), it says dead people voting, software glitches switching voters, and observers being unequally treated. I’m sure in tiny tiny doses thats all possible.<p>Should Krebs be fired just for saying the election was the most secure ever? Obviously not! ... but devil’s advocate, I don’t see how it could have been. We relaxed integrity requirements because of Covid, not increased them.<p>Edit: look how little room there is to step out of line, hmm')
