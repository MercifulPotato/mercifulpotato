Typically have to use their concurrency&#x2F;transaction management<p>* In apps that have state, a lot of times the only safety is required - this state only changes in one place, I can&#x27;t afford a partial read, but otherwise I don&#x27;t really care about concurrency. Atoms for this.<p>* Sometimes there is an ordering or coordination to state, but a lot of time that is producer-consumer, so core.async can be a nice fit.<p>* In a (relatively) small subset of cases, I actually have multiple writers whose behavior I need to coordinate. STM is perfect, and I prefer it to managing my own locks in those cases.')
