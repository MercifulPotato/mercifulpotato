In the post I walked through a model with three training records (yellow, blue, red) which created six prediction boundaries. Half of the rules weren&#x27;t covered by the training data, which makes them hard to find without an efficient algorithm to search out all possible rules. The risk of undiscovered rules is they may cause unexpected behaviour that leads to bad predictions - and if you haven&#x27;t described the whole model then it will be impossible to know how many of these potentially bad predictions exist.')
