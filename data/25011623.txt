After I had a couple hundred subs, I made a video asking if people were interested in additional premium content and shared a link to a survey. About 70 people saw the video, 22 filled out the survey with their emails and seven paid when I offered an earlybird discount.<p>After that, I built a &quot;real&quot; but very minimal site and created a subscription business. I&#x27;ve put very little effort into marketing other than the fact that most my videos are free.<p>I probably picked too small of a niche but it&#x27;s what I was into. It may be hitting its growth limits, but it&#x27;s in the 4 figures &#x2F; month MRR range.<p>My main advice is to focus on being helpful over UI, business models, growth hacks, etc. The first step is to provide value. After you can do that, then start worrying about how to capture it.')
