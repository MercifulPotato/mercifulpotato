Meat, according to Wikipedia, is &quot;animal flesh that is eaten as food&quot;. So they&#x27;re familiar with biological creatures very similar to those on earth, and they eat them? But at the same time, they have trouble with the concept that biological creatures can have some degree of intelligence? That&#x27;s just nonsense.<p>And why then do they keep using this term &quot;meat&quot;, which refers only to some parts of animals?<p>Maybe that&#x27;s just me, but I feel like the point of the story is to gross the reader out by repeatedly calling them &quot;meat&quot;. ;)')
