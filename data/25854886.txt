I was under the impression that shrinking process nodes represented a trade-off in terms of power consumption on the low end. There must be reasons why nobody makes a 14nm microcontroller, right?<p>Shrinking the process node means that you get less power consumption per transistor flip, but it can also increase the amount of static leakage current, which hurts designs that aim for energy budgets under say, 100uA.<p>I could be wrong, and I think that leakage can be mitigated by the lower operating voltages on smaller process nodes, but I don&#x27;t believe it is as simple as &quot;smaller process = more power efficient&quot;. If you&#x27;re talking about GHz-scale application processors it holds true, but getting that sort of chip to idle at 0.05mA might be hard.<p>RAM can also consume a lot of power, if you have gigabytes of it. So until we have cheap high-density NVRAM, you might need a sort of &#x27;hibernate&#x27; mode to get really low power consumption. And if you did that, you&#x27;d need to burn a bunch of energy to wake up and go back to sleep...busy, busy, busy.')
