They&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s not a good way to teach racial history. To Kill a Mockingbird portrays the situation as a white people problem, with the blacks as passive victims requiring good, white actors to save them.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt, To Kill a Mockingbird is written to antagonize racism. But some are arguing the means by which it accomplishes this are not representative of where we&#x27;d want to be; echoing the generally vast liberal&#x2F;conservative argument whereby most conservatives are not racist, in that they do not believe minorities are intrinsically worse or less deserving than whites, but they support the continuation of power structures that make it systematically difficult for minorities to have equal levels of opportunity. This is a nuance that most people on both sides generally fail to understand.<p>The harsh gut reaction to someone saying &quot;this is no longer good&quot; will bring out an angry response in many because they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad and they know they&#x27;re not racist AND they are not in fact racist. But there&#x27;s additional levels of depth here and asking for change is a good thing, though it falls flat to anyone not interested or aware of the depth.')
