I already have our phones setup to VPN home when off the home WiFi, so this would be great for privacy.<p>I would pay that much for the cloud offering if you had a contractual&#x2F;legal obligation NEVER to sell my data EVER, or to sell the service to any company without wiping ALL of my data first.')
