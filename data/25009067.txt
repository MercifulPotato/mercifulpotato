He said when he is performing, no one cares how much time it took him to prepare a piece, what his mood is that day, how much he played that day, etc. Those are all things that can positively and negatively affect his performance. They only care about the end product, the performance.<p>I relay that story because it is much the same with an ARM chip. I know it is &quot;just&quot; the CPU, and the SoC is what integrates it. I don&#x27;t really care. The end effect is still all of the problems I listed above, which makes me steer clear of using ARM in a laptop. If ARM really wants to break into this space, these are problems that need to be fixed, and it is in ARMs interest to fix them.<p>I have not tried the Pinebook (though it uses the same RK3399 has the rockpro64, and the annoying install experience I spoke of was about the rockpro64), and frankly, after my experience with the Rockpro64, I am hesitant to really buy more products from them again, which is sad because I have two pinephones and I really believe in what the Pinephone stands for. The RockPro64 had bad memory, and there are a few reports of other people with the same issue. I bought it in early September, it took me three weeks to get an RMA (and that was only after I filed a dispute with Paypal), and it is in week two of me waiting for me to have them ship it back.')
