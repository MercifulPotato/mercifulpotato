But I do know that public transit in Japan is insanely good and the cities are definitely walkable and all of it is quite safe. Trains are always on time. You can see small children riding them on their own. You can get almost anywhere you want to go using them. It’s actually phenomenal and it makes me angry to come back to the states after being there for any period of time because I suddenly need to drive again. (That said groceries would be more problematic if living there and I’m sure there are places you need to get to via car if living there, but most of the time a train has been fine for me as a visitor or when I was living on a military base. Only needed a car to get to the gate to leave and then walk to the train station)')
