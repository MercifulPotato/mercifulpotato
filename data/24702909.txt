It also has &quot;HVM&quot;, which includes a full system emulation (motherboard, etc); but also &quot;PVH&quot;, which is basically what PV would be if it were designed today:  It takes advantage of hardware support when it makes sense, and paravirtualizes when it makes sense.  It doesn&#x27;t require a devicemodel to be running at all, but also isn&#x27;t susceptible to the PV XSAs.  There&#x27;s also a mode called &quot;shim&quot; mode, which allows you to run &quot;classic PV&quot; kernels in PVH mode.<p>Xen now has KConfig, and you can now disable PV mode entirely when building Xen.  You can run dom0 in PVH mode, and then run all of your guests either in PVH mode or HVM mode.<p>The ARM port was made after ARM had virtualization extensions; so it never had a &quot;classic PV&quot;; nor does it require any devicemodel whatsoever.  There&#x27;s only one guest mode, which corresponds roughly to the &quot;PVH&quot; mode above.')
