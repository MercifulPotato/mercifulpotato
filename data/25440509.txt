I was at an Indian firm a while back and due to arcane labor laws, we did not want to hire a network engineer but needed one to work with some Cisco equipment we were getting. We agreed to pay Cisco about $1000&#x2F;month for 2 years to have an engineer on their books but placed at our firm. When the engineer was actually placed I learned from someone that he was being paid ~$100&#x2F;month so Cisco was skimming about 90% of what we paid for him.')
