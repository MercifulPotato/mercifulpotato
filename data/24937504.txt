I&#x27;m asking seriously because on Glenn&#x27;s article he says that the Hunter emails have gone through scrutiny similar to the material from previous hacks or leaks, and he makes a really solid case with examples of how each dump was &quot;verified&quot;.<p>Also does the Biden campaign has seen or have forensic evidence about this being forged? Because for the Typhoon Investigations fake dump they showed it but for this Hunter laptop thing they just said it was a Russian operation and didn&#x27;t question the material, they just refuse to answer questions about some of the stuff that&#x27;s there.')
