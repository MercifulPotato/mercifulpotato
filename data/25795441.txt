Only Element iOS&#x27;s push server is run by the &#x27;matrix developers&#x27;, and if you are worried about that then (if you are an iOS developer) you can build your own copy of Element iOS pointed at your own push server.<p>&gt; This means that both the push server operator, as well as Apple, can see the content of all of the push notification messages, thereby bypassing the e2e encryption as well.<p>This is completely incorrect.  By definition, the server can&#x27;t see the contents of end-to-end encrypted messages, and we don&#x27;t send push contents (encrypted or otherwise) to the push gateway anyway.  Instead, the push notification is a single flag sent to the client to tell it to wake up, which then runs a Push Extension (on iOS) to talk to the Matrix server and do E2EE in order to display the notification body (if desired).
