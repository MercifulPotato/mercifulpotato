The problem I have is that this old version has serious bugs.<p>So you write a bash script, test it with a modern bash and everything looks fine. But then you start the same script on a fresh macOS and it doesn&#x27;t run. Took me a while to figure out it wasn&#x27;t because of my script but because of the outdated bash version on macOS.<p>And I am not talking about &#x27;don&#x27;t use that option&#x27; kind of bugs but more along the lines of &#x27;when you nest too many sub-shells it doesn&#x27;t find its way back and throws a syntax error&#x27;. So if you want to make sure your scripts work out of the box on macOS you have to test against that old buggy shell.')
