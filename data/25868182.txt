Get a portable Honda generator and plug into it with a mobile connector to charge (my Tesla can charge from a 120V 15a circuit, or a 220v dryer outlet). If that doesn’t provide you enough charge, find a surplus generator on a trailer and haul it behind you with a hitch. If it’s a diesel, you can even run it on vegetable oil instead of petroleum.<p>When you’re not going to the boonies, you’re fully electric without dragging a generator with you, and can rely on charging stations.')
