Thy are just seeking entertainment and maybe to win a little money. For instance, in a race between two candidates priced at $0.70 and $0.30 (ranging from $0.01 to $0.99 before resolution), many players are happy to pick the favorite indicated by the market.<p>Of course, if those prices are accurate, then they will lose money in the long-run after fees. For players who are betting more frequently and over a longer term, it&#x27;s like any other speculation: You might assess the $0.30 underdog to have a 40% chance of winning. She is still the underdog, but you profit over the long run by buying her at her too-low price. Those players are scooping that value wherever they can find it.<p>For major electoral events that involve a populist with a large, loyal, and misinformed fanbase, the value pretty much finds you. Both of the described groups are making lots of money because the markets are wildly mispriced.')
