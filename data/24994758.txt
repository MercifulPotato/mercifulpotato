Human arousal is dumb&quot;.<p>I take no offense at the idea that the monkey-brain arousal mechanisms of men and women is &quot;dumb&quot;, in the sense of simplistic. Logically, we know a picture is not a valid mating target, but still we can get aroused.<p>Yes, if you read it as calling men dumb, it&#x27;s a little sexist. But if you read it as a commentary on human arousal, well, that&#x27;s not a thinking feeling target, so you can be no more sexist against it than against a rock.')
