It was surprisingly easy. Here&#x27;s how you can do it too. For probably under 1k.<p>1. Fly out to Anchorage, Alaska<p>2. Drive to Denali visitor center, (Denali State Park)<p>3. Take the Bus to Denali (~$50)<p>You are almost guaranteed to see a wild grizzlies along the way. The bus will stop so you can take a photo. You can even get off and go for a hike if you like. They will pick you up on the way back. (or whats left of you...) If you decide not to, thats okay too. You will have many near death experiences, as your school bus drives along a dirt road along steeped cliff mountain edges, for many miles. The bus takes you to heart of Denali, where you can see Mount Mckinley (Highest mountain in North America), and where temperatures can dip to minus 60 degrees in winter.')
