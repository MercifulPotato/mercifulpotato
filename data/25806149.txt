Was he Russian intelligence? I always was skeptical of the Russia thing, or thought it was exaggerated at least. Did Assange go fascist along with so many others in the former hacktivist subculture? Maybe but I didn’t see any overt proof of that.<p>Then I see this again and wonder if it was less about being in the bag for Trump than being against Hillary Clinton and the people around her. It seems like Assange and I’m sure others were determined that Hillary Clinton should be kept out of the presidency at any cost.<p>I feel like there has got to be a story here that hasn’t been told.<p>My own opinion is this:<p>I get wanting change and there are a lot of bad things you can say about the current powers that be, but if you want revolution you have to offer something better than the status quo. Fascism and race nationalism are things that are decidedly worse than the status quo. I don’t support nihilistic revolution for the sake of revolution either. It almost always ends up in something as bad or worse than what existed before. Revolution only works when there are better ideas or at least better people, and I see neither.')
