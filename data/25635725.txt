Giving more bargaining power (collectively) to people that otherwise don&#x27;t have much bargaining power.<p>Most people in tech, and especially so at places like google don&#x27;t feel like they have low bargaining power. So I think the perception is, not only is there not much to be gained by unionizing, there is potentially more to lose by giving up individual bargaining power to the union. So basically losing autonomy and control for some unknown and fuzzy benefit.')
