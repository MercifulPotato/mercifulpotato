Back in the days before it, we had to learn to live with those around us, now you can just go out and find someone as equally stupid as yourself.<p>I call it the toaster fucker problem. Man wakes up in 1980, tells his friends &quot;I want to fuck a toaster&quot;\nFriends quite rightly berate and laugh at him, guy deals with it, maybe gets some therapy and goes on a bit better adjusted.<p>Guy in 2021 tells his friends that he wants to fuck a toaster, gets laughed at, immediately jumps on facebook and finds &quot;Toaster Fucker Support group&quot; where he reads that he&#x27;s actually oppressed and he needs to cut out everyone around him and should only listen to his fellow toaster fuckers.<p>Apply this analogy to literally any insular bubble, it applies as equally to &#x2F;r&#x2F;thedonald as it does to the emaciated Che Guevara larpers that cry thinking about ringing their favourite pizza place.')
