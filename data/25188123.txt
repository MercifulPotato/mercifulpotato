But for hobby projects that get couple of hundred requests per day this is more than enough, and if one of them gets too successfull, I&#x27;ll just pay someone for a day or two of work for migrating my code to other hosted platform - and since I never use vendor-specific tech, this shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to do.')
