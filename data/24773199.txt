That means the developer has to increase sale prices in order to turn a profit, which in turn means new landlords need to charge more rent to just break even.<p>If you consider that a newly constructed 750 sqft 1BR apartment can easily run $800k-$1M, a buyer is looking at $4-5k per month to cover the mortgage, property taxes, insurance, HOA, maintenance, etc.  Do you really think a buyer is going to turn around and rent it out for $2k&#x2F;mo?<p>For buildings wholly owned by a leasing company, the economics are better, but still not to the point where they&#x27;re going to rent that out for under $3-4k&#x2F;mo.')
