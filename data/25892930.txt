Even in so-called urban cores, there are often strict restrictions on what you can build, and demand exists for bland modern apartment tower blocks but they just can&#x27;t be built. There are often rules on maximum height, mandatory parking (pointed out in the article), design &#x2F; &quot;character&quot; requirements, etc. Getting rid of zoning and review processes and letting the market take care of things is <i>exactly</i> what folks are calling for.<p>But more generally I don&#x27;t understand your complaint. You&#x27;re saying that people should not advocate for changing how the suburbs work, because if people wanted to change how the suburbs work, they would advocate for it?<p>Like, I&#x27;m sorry you feel that a <i>claim of fact</i> comes with an attitude, but it&#x27;s a testable, refutable claim. Do you think the claim is wrong? Or do you just not like it?')
