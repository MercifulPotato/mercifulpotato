So, there&#x27;s a clear physical separation: different parts of the house, different times of the day, different media. They don&#x27;t overlap, so they don&#x27;t conflict.<p>Are you reading for pleasure, or for study?<p>If for study, you can save a lot of time by scanning the text, contents, and index for what&#x27;s relevant to you, and only reading those parts (or at least reading them first). For articles you can usually just read the middle half, ignoring the introduction and conclusion.<p>If for pleasure, you&#x27;re out of luck. You&#x27;ll never read everything you&#x27;ll want to read in one lifetime. You can maximize the value of your limited time by casting off any sense of obligation you may have to books you aren&#x27;t getting value from. If a book isn&#x27;t justifying itself after an hour, or 50 pages, or whatever, toss it out and find something else. Life is too short to slog through garbage.')
