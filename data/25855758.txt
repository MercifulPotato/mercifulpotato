Item(by='fy20', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611206633, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841923, text='&gt; Car radios these days are an integral part<p>Typically a single car is sold with a few different models of stereos, not only for different trim levels but also different regions, e.g. SiriusFM is common in the US but doesn&#x27;t exist in Europe, and the navigation is usually region specific (you can&#x27;t just swap a DVD like you could 15 years ago).<p>&gt; what on earth are you going to do with that?<p>In my country salvaged cars are imported from Western Europe and the US, fixed up and resold here. A car with a European radio&#x2F;infotainment&#x2F;nav system is going to sell for a lot more than a car with a (pretty useless for here) USA system. There&#x27;s also people who need a replacement for whatever reason (it broke, spilled coffee on it, dog scratched it up, etc) and want something cheaper than â‚¬5000 for a replacement at a dealership.<p>As I hinted at, the radio software is locked to the original ECU so you can&#x27;t just swap them directly, but if you know what you are doing (or more likely know someone with access to manufacturers software) it&#x27;s possible.<p>This wasn&#x27;t just a junkie stealing a radio they can sell for $20 to get a hit, it&#x27;s an organised crime. I&#x27;d be very surprised if this doesn&#x27;t happen in the USA too. I would have thought it would be easier to steal the whole car and take it to a chop shop than just stealing parts though.')
