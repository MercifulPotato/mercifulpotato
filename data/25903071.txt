Amazon took a turn for the much worse 5 years ago and it continues going down this spiral every year.<p>Few highlights:<p>- fake item inventory: 50% chance of getting what you ordered vs some fake knockoff<p>- delivery hell: stolen items (i have personally watched a delivery driver steal my package), delivered items that never arrived (probably falls into the previous category but i have no proof), failed delivery for addresses that worked for 5+ years before<p>- item arriving from different country that I made the purchase, this is funny in Europe, UK has left the EU on 1st of January so there is import customs to pay on items. I order and item from Germany and Amazon send me from the UK because it is 1 cent cheaper for them. I have to pay the same amount of customs + tax that the amount of the purchase. After some back and fort they reimburse.<p>So if there is a startup that allows me to order from a local store, I could not care less how much more expensive it is than on Amazon, I am going for it. I hope they succeed.')
