Apparently there is a lot less in the stuff labeled cinnamon and sold to Americans, which is actually not cinnamon at all, but cassia, a whole other species. The difference was understood in Europe in ancient times, so there is no excuse. Sometimes you can find the real stuff in the US labeled &quot;Ceylon cinnamon&quot;. It&#x27;s a darker red than cassia, which is unapologetically brown.<p>Real cinnamon tastes more like red cinnamon candy than cassia does. Americans are always mystified as to why cinnamon candy doesn&#x27;t taste anything like the cinnamon they put in their pies.')
