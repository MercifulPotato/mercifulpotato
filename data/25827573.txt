I definitely will drive in (normally) for activities like theater. With a self-driving car--even just on the highways--I&#x27;d be <i>more</i> inclined to go in for an early evening get-together. But I wouldn&#x27;t be popping in multiple times a week even if I didn&#x27;t mostly need to drive myself.')
