If you screw around with the IP, all functions will stop working as expected and YOU personally take responsibility for the hardware from that point forward.&quot;<p>Would that address your concerns about, &quot;Right to Repair?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a start, because it clearly articulates the relationship between you and the the hardware you purchased, however, I suspect you also want more information so that you can take any reasonable maintenance actions necessary for the life of that hardware without relying on the manufacturer<p>But that is speculation on my part<p>I want a clearer understanding of where you would draw the lines and what you really want from a modern, culturally significant, &quot;right to repair&quot; policy.')
