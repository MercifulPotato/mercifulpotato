The size of the chunk should be the biggest size you can make it such that I wouldn&#x27;t even raise an eyebrow to lose a whole chunk. I make decisions to invest&#x2F;divest 1, 3 or 3 chunks at a time. When I decide to make a move I divide a chunk into about 5 parts and try to dollar cost average into a position. The time scale for the dollar cost averaging depends a lot of the events&#x2F;contexts surrounding the trade.<p>I put money into a mix of long and short stock positions as well as long call options (LEAPs). The shortest call options I would do are quarterly, where I will listen to the earnings call, watch how the market reacts in the next day. and then set a call option that expires after the following earnings if I think the stock has been unfairly punished. But I usually stick to call options &gt; 1 year. I have about 2&#x2F;3&#x27;s of my total portfolio in stock and 1&#x2F;3 in options just to get good leverage.<p>This is sort of where I landed at right now. I didn&#x27;t have any strategy going into all this. I am the kind of person that likes to learn for themselves and I knew I would lose money doing it. I just tried to know my limits and not lose too much when I thought it might happen. Looking back there was a time when I had maxed out my margin account buying AAPL as it was tanking in September. I sold that margin off for a big loss. I made some really stupid choices. But I learned and processed everything I did.')
