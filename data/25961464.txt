We built it fast because we needed it and didn&#x27;t have time to use the standard system we use in-house. I&#x27;ve been given very few hours to work on it outside of my regular duties so I&#x27;ve just had to deal with the terribleness of it. We recently got some money to update our tools and while we made something a little bit better for some tasks, the terrible foundation is still there. I&#x27;m going to look into this, it looks slick and sounds exactly like what I need. Just having the ability to dump whatever telem field I need would save me so much time compared with coding up a python script to pullout whatever from the GBs of telem we&#x27;ve been producing.')
