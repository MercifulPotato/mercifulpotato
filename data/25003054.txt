DRE machines without a paper trail are relatively rare and appear to be becoming rarer over time, although it&#x27;s hard to get statistics on the issue. As mentioned in the article most DRE machines were purchased as a result of the 2002 HAVA and seem to be slowly going away as jurisdictions replace their equipment --- although there are certain stubborn hangers-on to DRE w&#x2F;o paper trail.<p>Many states conduct a mandatory sample audit of machine tabulation, either by hand or using an independent machine. I would urge those concerned about election security to lobby for this requirement in states that don&#x27;t have it, as it is a practical and readily achievable improvement in election integrity.<p>In many states which use machine tabulation, machines are tested using a reference ballot set as part of the commissioning process, immediately before being sealed for delivery to the polling place. Once again, a requirement that should exist in those states which do not have it.')
