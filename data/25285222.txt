They <i>can&#x27;t</i> self-regulate because they are trying to control a number of people many orders of magnitude greater than their own internal manpower. Governments can only control so many people at once because:<p>(a) they are unbound by privacy requirements, and know your real name, history, and physical location<p>(b) they can dictate punishments at will until you comply; ranging from fines to jail time to gag orders to physical penalties like whipping<p>So now the ball is right back where it should be: in the hands of government.<p>Are the Proud Boys a white-nationalist terrorist group or merely an ethnocentric all-boys political action club? That&#x27;s something the U.S. government should decide on its own, the U.K. government should decide on its own, and so on.<p>Facebook is in no position to figure out if people opining about election fraud are conspiracy theorists, foreign agents, or dangerously close to sedition. That kind of deep investigative work is the role of <i>government</i>.')
