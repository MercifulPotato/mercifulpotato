Working internet connection\n2. Slow internet connection\n3. No internet connection<p>Everything works fine in 1 and 3, but breaks the OS when in 2 (and it is very common, just walk further from your router and you&#x27;ll notice it - e.g. when waking up the mac from sleep).<p>What is strange to me is that I had an old Macbook Air with latest pre-BigSur macos, bought a new Macbook Air (early 2020) with the same OS and I saw the problem only on it - at first I thought it was broken.')
