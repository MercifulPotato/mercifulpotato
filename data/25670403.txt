Openness vs privacy&#x2F;security are entirely different concerns in isolation, but I believe openness is most important for providing a model upon which privacy can be sustained in the longer term.<p>Of course Matrix is the only truly long-term sustainable option of these. Encouraging users to move to any of the others will only lead to this discussion re-occurring down the line. And being ultimately more difficult as platform-switching fatigue intensifies.')
