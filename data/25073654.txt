Once a company gets too big, certain anti-competitive actions become illegal.<p>&gt; Why do we even care about fairness now?<p>It is not really about fairness.  Instead, it is that if a company is large enough, certain actions negatively effect the market much more.<p>If a company is large, then people have few other others, and anti-competitive actions have a worse effect on the market.<p>If a company is small, it doesn&#x27;t matter very much if a company is behaving anti-competitively, because people can just use a competitor.<p>Thats the justification.')
