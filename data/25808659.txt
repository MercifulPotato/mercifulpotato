I will be very disappointed if they add back in USB-A&#x2F;HDMI&#x2F;SD ports, or remove USB-C charging in favor of proprietary charge port. Sounds like unnecessary feature bloat. Please just do MagSage + USB-C, so I can maintain my one-cable-for-everything, making traveling lighter and simpler. Here&#x27;s my counter argument to all those that love MagSafe: makes traveling a huge hassle, forcing me to carry a special charge brick that only works for ONE device. In 2021 going forward, I will flat refuse to spend money on anything that doesn&#x27;t use USB-C or Qi charging. I can now travel with a single 2xUSB-C power brick, and charge all devices from the same cable. This is a huge step forward, please don&#x27;t reverse this.<p>I am all for removing the TouchBar. The new MacBook Air with TouchID + physical function keys is a perfect combination of features. There are a few things about the TouchBar I do like -- eg, having a custom one-touch screen lock button that&#x27;s always present. However vast majority of the time I use external keyboard+trackpad+monitor, so the touchbar can&#x27;t be part of my usual workflow anyway. Removing this reduces cost and complexity.<p>Please. Just keep it simple.')
