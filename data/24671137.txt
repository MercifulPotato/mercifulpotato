I chose to wire the cluster simply to guarantee a reliable connection within the cluster. You can absolutely use a Raspberry Pi over WiFi without an Ethernet cable, it would just be a less reliable connection (jitter, congestion), and then of course it would have to be powered conventionally rather than via PoE.<p>General 802.11s meshing: If all you want is fewer network cabling in your home <i>specifically between switches and access points</i>, then it could certainly help. However, the best choice network-wise is almost always a proper deployment with a central router and several APs (broadcasting the same SSID) wired back to it.')
