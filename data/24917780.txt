Well we can agree the Web is a conglomerate of standards proposed by the W3C.</i><p>No, I can’t agree with that because it hasn’t <i>ever</i> been true. For its first decade, it <i>was</i> the place where most relevant standards were proposed, but that still didn’t <i>define</i> the web; you had to look at what browsers <i>did</i> rather than what specs said, especially in such days as IE’s domination, because it varied quite substantially from the “standards”, and more importantly people <i>depended</i> on these variations and extensions to the “standards”.<p>But then W3C tried to take the web further in a direction that the actual people with <i>power</i> (browser manufacturers) didn’t like—more XML everywhere, and little to no activity on HTML itself—and so they split and formed WHATWG which has since taken over progressively more and more of the actual <i>important</i> standards (e.g. HTML, DOM, URL, Fetch, Encoding), so that W3C itself is increasingly irrelevant, though there are still important things that are done through W3C, e.g. the CSS Working Group (CSSWG); and if you’re willing to stretch it, you could count the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG), but that’s more <i>hosted</i> by W3C than <i>part of</i> W3C.<p>Nowadays, if you say, “what is the web?”, you must include specifications from at least IETF (e.g. HTTP), WHATWG (e.g. HTML), W3C (e.g. CSS) and Ecma (e.g. JavaScript); but actual browser behaviour (an extremely vague concept) must also be considered too, because it has a big impact on what the web is.')
