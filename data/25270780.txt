It&#x27;s not the occasional 5-second long request, it&#x27;s &quot;the app doesn&#x27;t start serving requests for 5 seconds&quot;.<p>Using data science tooling in a lambda seems iffy, especially ones that are not production ready. And good luck getting such libraries in go.<p>Python cold booting an interpreter 3 seconds faster than Go is a big deal, especially if your target execution time is &lt;50ms and you&#x27;ve got a large volume of invocations, and are not being silly and importing ridiculously heavy dependencies into a lambda for no reason other than to make a strange point about Python being unsuitable for something nobody should be doing.')
