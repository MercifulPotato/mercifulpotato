I have a question:<p>In the article you demonstrate how quad-trees are used for indexing spatial data, but does Cockroach DB do this in 3D as well (i.e. octree)?<p>I was fairly interested in PG Pointcloud [1] back when I was in grad school, but storing arbitrary 3D information seemed to present unique challenges in this space (especially with regards to indexing). Would the approach used here extend to 3D? I don&#x27;t know if I see a clear reason it wouldn&#x27;t, but I was wondering if there&#x27;s anything in Cockroach that might make that extension difficult. I recognize you&#x27;re using the S2 library here as well, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have all the 3D primitives, but I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pgpointcloud&#x2F;pointcloud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pgpointcloud&#x2F;pointcloud</a>')
