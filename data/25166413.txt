Optimizing to 1&#x2F;100 the time (reducing requests from say 1.5 sec to 15ms) is like adding 99 server</i><p>Who the hell is casually optimizing away 90% of the latency in the time it takes to spin up 9 more pods? That&#x27;s insane. Like the latter is an operation on the scale of minutes.<p>Also, this is a throughput&#x2F;latency conflation.<p>90% of the cost a startup incurs is in the things it could be doing instead, not in the infra. Opportunity cost dominates.')
