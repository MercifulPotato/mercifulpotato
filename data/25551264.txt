The cloak factory is said to be a solid choice for beginners. From there, you can venture in other flavors of &quot;bot&quot; factories, like shield bots and jump bots. Then you can experiment with the more specialized ones, like spiders, hovers, gunships. And finally there are the very specific ones like the airplanes factory and the ships factory (good skills in those can make a difference in multiplayer games).<p>Of course it is better to have some knowledge about each of them, so you have a general idea of what to do when facing e.g. spiders.<p>Zero-K explicitly follows a rock-paper-scissors scheme (mainly raider-riot-skirmisher). Each category has a logo, which helps with selecting a counter-unit [1].<p>This is precisely the purpose of the campaign, which has been designed as a giant tutorial (without the annoyances of click-there-do-that past the very first mission). It restricts you to a single factory and often only a subset of the units of this factory, as you unlock the units when you complete missions. It is also RPG-y as you can unlock more modules for your commander as well. It is quite well done.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero-k.info&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php?title=Unit_classes" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero-k.info&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php?title=Unit_classes</a>')
