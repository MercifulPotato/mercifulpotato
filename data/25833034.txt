Mine is that it is okay to &quot;sow doubt&quot;, similar to that it is okay to &quot;sow doubt&quot; when someone claims they built a perpetuum mobile.<p>But since you are asking me to download the language so politely: I think this is not necessary. A look in the documentation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.raku.org&#x2F;language&#x2F;concurrency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.raku.org&#x2F;language&#x2F;concurrency</a>) seems to be enough:<p>&gt; The subroutine await is almost equivalent to calling result on the promise object returned by start but it will also take a list of promises and return the result of each<p>So &quot;await&quot; is equivalent to calling &quot;result&quot;. What does calling &quot;result&quot; do?<p>&gt; result blocks the current thread of execution until the promise is kept or broken<p>This stands in direct contradiction to what was said in the thread here:<p>&gt; so while the code containing the `await` blocks and waits, the underlying thread&#x2F;core is released<p>Unless the OP referred to a _different_ await, I would say: case closed.')
