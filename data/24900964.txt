I personally use Obsidian and would recommend it over others like Roam. It is super fast and super responsive.<p>Advantage that Dendron has is that it is based on VSCode which is fantastic foundation. Pretty much why I love Obsidian, you type fast and can work on ideas quickly.<p>I personally couldn&#x27;t care less about graph, it looks pretty but to me not useful at all.<p>Good thing about tools like this is that you can sync and backup text files.<p>Bad thing is that having mobile app would be difficult. However, I use IAWriter to write into type of Inbox on my phone and this file is in Obsidian (again same workflow like Dendron)<p>To me personally, Dendron is too similar to existing one I am using, otherwise solid tool and would recommend to people.')
