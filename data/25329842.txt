Item(by='keyle', descendants=None, kids=[25329879], score=None, time=1607322456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329261, text='mid stream randomly, you get thrown 30+ seconds of ads, great if you were having a conversation with the host.<p>then if the stream breaks, refresh, new set of ads.<p>pop the popout player, ads.<p>It&#x27;s totally rooted. The suits run the show and they&#x27;re milking the cow. The only reason they&#x27;re going so hard at it, I speculate, is that they&#x27;re being hit by big DMCA fees.<p>I can&#x27;t otherwise explain with logic why they&#x27;d run ads literally on DJ streams with thousands of viewers.')
