How to do this well is both how to ask questions as a new engineer <i>and</i> how to make junior engineers feel comfortable doing so.<p>People are often afraid to ask because they’re afraid to look stupid (or worse, afraid they <i>are</i> stupid&#x2F;can’t do it, etc.)<p>This is a mistake for a lot of reasons, the smartest people I know ask more, say when they don’t know or understand something and as a result learn faster.<p>A good lead will also direct when they should spend some time figuring it out or where they should look to learn more. I think it’s good to encourage people to ask early and often especially when starting out. It’s also good to reinforce this by example (asking questions yourself as a senior engineer when you don’t know something).<p>The worst thing someone can do in response to a newbie’s question is feign surprise, “you don’t know what X is?!” - whenever I see that I shut it down.')
