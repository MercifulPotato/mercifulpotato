Full stop.  No airliner is permitted to be unstable by FAA regulations.  At no point in the flight envelope will the aircraft pitch up into a stall without pitch-up inputs, thus it is not unstable.<p>MCAS was used to augment flight stick characteristics, namely to simulate a linear relationship between flight-stick input force and pitch-up&#x2F;AoA.  This was, and always has been, about single-certification and pilot UX, not anything about the stability of the airplane.  Having stick forces be somewhat lower than expected at high AoA does not make the plane unstable.  The linear relationship is considered ideal, but many planes such as the 757 have a similar non-linear relationship.  MCAS is not anti-stall.<p>Granted, this has widely been mis-reported.  The real issue is that the MCAS system was made dramatically more powerful, and thus dangerous, over the course of development.  Without a concomitant change to the reliability of MCAS inputs (namely the AoA sensors), this resulted in disaster.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-aerospace&#x2F;as-the-faa-finalizes-the-737-maxs-return-is-boeings-jet-now-safe&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-aerospace&#x2F;as-th...</a>')
