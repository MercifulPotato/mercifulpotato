If it was about distribution-rights on small vs big, it would be &quot;freedom to whisper&quot;, not &quot;speech&quot; which implies speaking publicly.<p>Another concern: by your logic, net neutrality should be moot. Let ISPs choose and throttle online service by their whim.<p>Anyway,&quot;freedom of speech&quot; is actually intended to prevent any dictatorial entity from hiding the other side from the public.<p>imho, If the &#x27;democrats&#x27; are actually &#x27;democratic&#x27;, they should have solved this with a much more elegant solution - eg. inviting people to a common, shared platform and refuting them there. Current FB&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;aws solutions are rather &#x27;easy but dictatorial and may backfire&#x27;, which is somewhat &#x27;republican&#x27; in taste...<p>(* by backfire:\n pro-trumps can think: &quot;The other side is trying to snuff us. What are they hiding? Are they more evil than imaginable? We should do something to guard USA from them&quot;<p>imho, the root of the whole fiasco is actually the press preventing the broadcast of Trump after the election. (the &#x27;snuffing&#x27;)\nBetter solution would be having open discussions to refute the pro-trump people.<p>Another thing is that by-standers will note about how &#x27;undemocratic&#x27; the whole solution is, and whether they&#x27;ll also be treated if they end up being the &#x27;other&#x27; side of other issues')
