These were partnered restaurants, so they were signing up for this and could opt out of any of these services, in theory anyways I wasn&#x27;t part of this so I have no idea if it&#x27;s really that easy to opt out<p>Separately, a practice pioneered by ubereats and doordash, &quot;Place and Pay&quot; is a new thing in the past 2-3 years where Grubhub will just list a bunch of restaurants without them asking for it (&quot;non-partnered&quot;), and when you place an order online the driver will go in and order takeout, then carry it to you. The restaurant can opt out of this, but they never asked for the service in the first place so it&#x27;s kinda shitty. That&#x27;s what this article is about.<p>Grubhub was against place and pay at first, when UberEats and Doordash began doing it (not because Grubhub is selfless but because partnered restaurants are way more profitable), but resisting place and pay turned out to be a recipe for losing market share so that&#x27;s no longer the case.')
