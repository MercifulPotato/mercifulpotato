If not, you will probably find it quite boring and pointless.<p>Fincher is certainly no art house director. He makes big-budget movies with stars like Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck. He is kind of like Steven Spielberg - a director so talented in the craft he elevates rater middlebrow material to be uniquely enjoyable. Fincher just gets a bit more respect because he is &quot;dark&quot;. But dark does not mean deep. For example Seven is really quite silly and contrived, but his excellence at directing makes us forget that.')
