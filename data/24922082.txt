I think each game maker can make their own choices about how the UI should work so it&#x27;s not clear what I should be looking for (in terms of UI widgets).  Then they need to document how the game UI works which seems to be hit-or-miss depending on who wrote the mod.<p>For Heroquest, at least, it then seemed like I needed to spend a bunch of effort to get past the 3D aspects of the game in order to focus on the actual gameplay (which is fundamentally 2D).<p>At the end of the day it feels like trying to smash a 3D peg into a 2D round hole - I love the idea but in practice having a dedicated, 2D board game framework seems like it might be a better fit for board games.<p>What have you all found?<p>How did you get started?<p>How do you find good docs?<p>Is there a Boardgame Simulator out there that I&#x27;m missing? :)')
