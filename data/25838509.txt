If your book is good we&#x27;ll pirate it. And if your book is good it doesn&#x27;t matter how you write it. The publishers will be willing to dig through your shit to get to the grains of it. Trust me. If you worry about formats you need to write better. Let that shit sink in. It really doesn&#x27;t at all matter. And if you&#x27;re popular you&#x27;ll both earn a million and have a million pirates dude. Just write a good book. Bad books is nothing anyone cares about.')
