Even if a person expresses the desire to be childless, that biological urge may be pushing for a younger mate who might be fertile.<p>That leads to the anxiety. Trying to do impressive things and to display wealth, no matter how useless, is a biological urge. It becomes time to buy the fast car or take up hang gliding.
