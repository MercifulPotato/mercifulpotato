I know where it is and the signs call it out if you are there.<p>Different places have a different culture. It all kind of depends on what you&#x27;re in to. For example, I know some people who love the Traverse City area and some others who have been there for a bit and are ready to move. That&#x27;s an area worth looking at.<p>If you want to be close to things and like urban-ish then there is Ann Arbor. The train to Chicago goes right through town. The express ways also make it easy to get to a lot of places as fast as you can in Michigan. While it&#x27;s about as urban as it gets in Michigan you can also get out of it pretty quickly into the outdoors.<p>Michigan has a fair amount of variety. That&#x27;s why people can have such different experiences.<p>I visited my parents the other day. On the drive down their street I passed a couple dozen wild turkeys. While I was at their house an 8 point buck walked through the back yard.

Not every place is like that.')
