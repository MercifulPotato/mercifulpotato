Escaping a hit and run with this hypothetical three man team is probably harder and more dangerous for the operatives than smuggling in a remote controlled gun. Last time I remember they assassinated a HVT with magnetic bombs on the side of a the target’s car. This led to iranians allied to Mossad getting killed.  They obviously can’t risk or possibly can’t find people to risk their life so doing it remotely is the safest bet.<p>And we have no idea how high tech this is. For all we know it’s a standard high caliber rifle attached to a pretty standard mount, with a live feed scope and a trigger puller. A team of engineering freshmen could develop this kind of system given the equipment. If Israel or the US are behind this they have probably had this tech for over a decade.')
