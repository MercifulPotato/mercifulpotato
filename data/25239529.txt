It would take a swarm of maybe a few hundred powered &quot;satellite movers&quot; maybe a decade. But in time, seems like it could become a fantastic means of dealing with space debris surrounding earth especially space junk that can&#x27;t easily be ditched to re-enter the earth&#x27;s atmosphere and burn up.')
