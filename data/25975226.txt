People say it often, and cite a few examples, but nothing that amounts to a general rule that I have seen.<p>Also, it’s simply not true that these companies only real aim is to generate money from investors.  If you look at the incentive structures for the people involved, that starts to look like an untenable position.  For example there are a lot of subject matter s experts whose incentive is to build careers based on their contributions and expertise - e.g. Chris Lattner. This is just one example of how this reductive idea of what a company is simply breaks down.  Certainly <i>some</i> companies - usually financial ones - have no other goal, but outside of the financial sector this is just not true.<p>And really - the companies we’re talking about have only had this ‘power’ for just over a decade, and frankly all of their products, Google, Apple, and Facebook are quite lacking.<p>There is no room to compete head to head with them, but plenty of room to innovate and compete in way that they are simply under delivering.')
