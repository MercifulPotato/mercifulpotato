The MSM has overplayed its hand over the past several years to the point they&#x27;ve been written off by their opposing sides. So that forces a dividing line so you don&#x27;t even bother looking at the opposing news sources, and when ever you do it&#x27;s so biased it makes your head spin. But hey, ratings are through the roof!<p>That has allowed traditionally marginalized news sources that embrace less-vetted news to shine. Say what you want about Alex Jones, but he was covering Jeffery Epstein&#x27;s lolita express&#x2F;island in 2008 and no one would touch that story back then. So now we have the marginalized news sources ending up larger viewerships than the national evening news. So while you do get real news which is less skewed left or right than in the MSM, it is wrapped with plenty of crap and is less vetted.<p>The news industry, politicians, and big tech censorship has made this problem. Now they get to lay in their beds. It sucks, I&#x27;m not a fan of what&#x27;s going on in DC right now, but I also don&#x27;t blame those doing what they feel they must for their country. They are merely products of the system that made them. Until the MSM and politicians decide to stop twisting everything for market share or political gain this will continue to escalate. And we know that won&#x27;t happen sadly.')
