Why are these companies so uncooperative? I have a Clevo laptop and I actually emailed them asking for documentation or some kind of help. They replied with an Ubuntu help page. I had to reverse engineer it in order to implement some features on Linux and I didn&#x27;t manage to figure out everything.<p>It&#x27;s very hard work and I have immense respect for people who are able to reverse engineer entire systems. There would be no need for this activity if companies just played nice but since they don&#x27;t I&#x27;m glad that there are people out there doing this work.')
