Syntax &quot;bread&quot; to the syntax sugar.<p>For example, regular expressions and date strings can be written in a nice and compact form, but how nice would it be write `Not(DigitalCharacter)` instead of `\\D`? Or `TwoDigitYear` and `FourDigitYear` instead of `y` and `Y`. The same convenience exists in short and long command line flags; and optional named parameters in function calls.')
