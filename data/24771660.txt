Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602632850, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771446, text='&gt; Begging the question is about assuming the truth of one or more premises<p>No, begging the question (the fallacy) is about <i>assuming the conclusion you are attempting to support.</i><p>&gt; Assuming the conclusion sounds equivalent to &quot;non-sequitur&quot; or just not making any argument at all.<p>It is very different from non-sequitur, but since it means making an argument that reduces to &quot;<i>P</i>, because <i>P</i>&quot;, describing it as &quot;not making an argument at all&quot; is not wholly wrong.<p>I actually like the common (so-called &quot;incorrect&quot;) use a lot because:<p>* It is distinct from the fallacy use because the fallacy is always intransitive and the common use is invariably transitive, naming the question so &quot;begged&quot; as the direct object; thus, it is impossible to confuse one use for the other.<p>* The fallacy use, as noted elsewhere, is the result of a series of mistranslations and, standing on its own, is bizarre in English.<p>* the &quot;incorrect&quot; use is a much more natural use of the English words which <i>also</i> makes the fallacy use more natural, since it is exactly equivalent to the &quot;incorrect&quot; use with the unstated, implicit direct object of &quot;the question the debate was attempting to resolve&quot;.<p>So, <i>accepting</i> the &quot;incorrect&quot; use has no conflict with the use to denote a particular fallacy and, indeed, makes that use more natural.')
