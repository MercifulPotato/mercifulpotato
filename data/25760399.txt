We build a free open source&#x2F;creative commons app (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfirst.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secfirst.org</a>) to help people learn about digital and physical security. It&#x27;s one of the biggest guides ever written about the topic, something like about 160k words in 40 different topics translated into 7 main languages. All done with volunteers.<p>We regularly get people giving us one star reviews and telling us the app is shit because it&#x27;s not translated into Japanese, Korean, Dutch or Norwegian etc. I mean we&#x27;d love to translate it into all these languages but Norway isn&#x27;t exactly the world&#x27;s most dangerous country so not our main priority. We try to reach out to <i>every</i> user who contacts us no matter what and sometimes we send people the details about how easily to help is translate it if they can - but the usual answer is abrupt, unhelpful and dismissive.')
