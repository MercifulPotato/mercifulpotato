Some books used to use the letter &quot;ꙩ&quot; when writing the word eye (ꙩко).  The letter was (from what I can tell) never used for anything else.  Because dual is a thing, clever people then went to write ꙭчи or Ꙫчи to mean two eyes.<p>Both those characters made it into Unicode as there was some use in historic script.  However even completely absurd variations made its way into unicode.  The &quot;many eyed seraphim&quot; is written as серафими многоꙮчитїи.  So if you need to write something with a lot of eyes, you can use ꙮ.')
