I don&#x27;t own any, and they wouldn&#x27;t go well with most of the music I listen to, but I&#x27;m glad to see someone actually defending Beats on HN.<p>One of the weirdest myths around audio is that it&#x27;s possible to objectively rate specific speakers&#x2F;headphones&#x2F;etc - while there&#x27;s no such objective rating for music, which is _the thing that you are playing_ on said headphones! I&#x27;ve listened to a number of very high end setups, and frankly for a lot of music (most pop, for example) you&#x27;re better off with a pair of AirPods. Yes, with the $2000 setup you hear all the details, but did anyone ever ask if you wanted all those details? And while bass with more &quot;oomph&quot; might not be the most accurate, it often makes the music more fun to listen to.<p>In my opinion, the entire debate around audio has been focusing on completely the wrong thing: some sort of objective measure of &quot;quality&quot;, as if it&#x27;s some measure you can put a number on and simply compare A to B. Many of my favorite songs, in my experience, lose their power and emotion when listened to on an &quot;audiophile&quot; setup. Sometimes you don&#x27;t need the details: maybe a bit of distortion and bass is a good thing. And that&#x27;s just talking about the sound! Getting into the actual experience, there are a ton of non-audiophile products that provide a far superior experience. The actual sound quality of some beat-up 70s rock records and an old turntable isn&#x27;t great, but the experience is lovely. And the user experience of AirPods + an Apple device is wonderful. Meanwhile the user experience of audiophile products is often (not always, but often) terrible. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of those portable hi-fi players and they are incredibly frustrating. And I love my Etymotics earbuds, but they have to be inserted so deep into the ear that they freak out your average Joe that tries them.<p>That is to say: I feel the whole audio world should stop with the obsession of some weird measure of accurate, &quot;high quality&quot; sound over everything else. Imagine if other things had the same obsession - people looking at art based solely on some weird measure of &quot;picture quality&quot; and &quot;crispness&quot;, or buying extremely expensive, ugly, uncomfortable cars because some Internet reviewer made some graphs showing they had better &quot;drive quality&quot;.')
