And have those goals really changed? Unless you&#x27;re some black turtle neck wearing genius artist with millionaire patrons, you&#x27;re expected to be more literate, more punctual (at all hours of the day), and more responsive to the needs of others (manager, client, w&#x27;ever) than ever before, whether you&#x27;re a high-salary Silicon Valley programmer or a low-wage service worker. Whatever increased creativity demanded of workers as compared to assembly line workers of yore is literally <i>imaginary</i>. Nobody cares about your creativity building tree forts, at least not to the exclusion of those other requirements. You&#x27;re still expected to learn how to be on time and in place and ready to take direction. That&#x27;s what schools needed to inculcate in the 19th century, and it&#x27;s still what&#x27;s needed of them; it&#x27;s just that now we need them to teach <i>additional</i> skills.<p>[1] It did have a veneer of Protestant Christian ethics, but that was just the sales pitch. The sales pitch isn&#x27;t the product; not now, not ever. People keep confusing those things when examining history even when they&#x27;re savvy enough not to make the equivocation in their day-to-day lives.')
