That it wasn&#x27;t resubmitted for peer review is a huge red flag.  The author has also publicly dismissed (what appears to me to be) valid and well-founded criticism of the algorithm, and made some unsubstantiated and one-sided charges about the academic peer review process.  This has more than a faint odor of quackery about it, and that&#x27;s not good about something as fundamentally important as a PRNG.')
