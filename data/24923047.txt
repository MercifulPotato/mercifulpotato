Item(by='ross_chanin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603913071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922567, text='Hey - Really appreciate the sentiments! Thanks for sharing your experience with your dad - as I mentioned in the post, I had the same experience with my grandfather.<p>We&#x27;d love to have the opportunity to serve you as a customer. We&#x27;re interviewing parents and grandparents about their life stories everyday. Feel free to reach out directly with any questions at contact@heyartifact.com.<p>And in case helpful, we typically create a &quot;Life Story&quot; Artifact over three to four interviews (so it&#x27;s like a mini-series). The outline, which you can of course adjust to your needs, tends to look like this:<p>Interview #1: Family Heritage &amp; Childhood - Your dad&#x27;s personal memories of prior generations.\nInterview #2: Teenage Years &#x2F; Young Adulthood &#x2F; Early Career.\nInterview #3: Mature Adulthood &#x2F; Family Life &#x2F; Career.\nInterview #4: This tends to be a &quot;wild card.&quot; Your dad and the interviewer may just have more territory to cover after the first sessions, or your dad may want to return to a certain time in his life or several themes. We can also 100% refund if this interview is not needed (we find that 80% of the time it is desired).')
