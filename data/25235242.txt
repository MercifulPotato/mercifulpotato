And that&#x27;s okay, or great even. A filesystem is a leap yet beyond that.<p>Apple takes great pains to hide the filesystem from the user in iOS.  And that was probably a really, really good move.  They have the freedom to change how the internals of devices use files and may have gotten some security benefit as well.<p>Mobile computing provided a great opportunity to enable some cool tech that breaks backwards compatibility.  Like signed bootloaders, indexed-database-as-filesystem, permissions&#x2F;capabilities.  All of these were available on desktop OSs but haven&#x27;t found a wide audience.  Or hadn&#x27;t, until much more recently.  Sorry- bit of a tangent there.<p>Point being: way back when, in order to be productive with a computer you had to know more about its design.  But today, many things &quot;just work&quot; without need to understand how&#x2F;why.')
