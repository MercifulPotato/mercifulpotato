Do they Rob or murder? (Genuinely asking)\nIf not, than why is it so bad? \nBecause you don&#x27;t like seeing the poor?\nI mean sure people <i>forced</i> to homelessness is a problem from their view point. This is usually related to their upbringing and could be avoided if you have a strong welfare state that don&#x27;t let children grow in crappy situations with bad education and poverty, with a sense of security in the future.<p>When you don&#x27;t have that, most of the time, you&#x27;ll grow up and be homeless, or your kids will be.<p>But the homeless of today are just a symptom of deep rooted problems, throwning money on taking care of them now won&#x27;t make them disappear.')
