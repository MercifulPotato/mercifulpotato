The House of Representatives is supposed to proportionally represent the constituencies of the various states.  The Senate exists to represent the state legislatures - though the 17th amendment changed that(and I personally believe it should be repealed).<p>It makes sense to me, as the House choosing the President is still a somewhat representation of the will of the people.  It&#x27;s also very similar to Westminster-styled parliamentary democracies choose their Prime Ministers.')
