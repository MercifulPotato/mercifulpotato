Part of the explanation I believe is that it doesn&#x27;t make anyone any money. But, this can&#x27;t be the total explanation. It&#x27;s frankly astonishing. Studying someone&#x27;s breathing habits should be part of routine medical exams and general wellness check ups. No M.D. that I have ever been to has ever brought it up, and when I&#x27;ve asked them about it, they shrug and give me a weird look, as if I&#x27;d asked them about UFO sightings. It&#x27;s phenomenally strange.')
