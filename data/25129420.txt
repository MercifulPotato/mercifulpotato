Was AIDS a manufactured mass hysteria in the &#x27;80s? People are rightly concerned about COVID because it is relatively new, we don&#x27;t have super great ways to treat it yet, and in addition to being deadly, there is good evidence of lasting health impact to people who survive it. It doesn&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re denying the disease, but you are downplaying it.<p>The public health guidance isn&#x27;t just about protecting a handful of &quot;elderly, unhealthy, immunocompromised people.&quot; People in all age groups, with and without pre-existing co-morbidities are getting the disease and dying of it--albeit in smaller numbers. And if not, they&#x27;re spreading it to people who <i>are</i> dying of it. Even if we just for simplicity&#x27;s sake, pretend that only the &quot;elderly, unhealthy, immunocompromised people&quot; are literally the only people who are at risk from it: you still need to have everyone observe the same precautions, or you risk infecting the at-risk group.<p>If this were like seatbelt wearing, I&#x27;d be totally on your side. If someone chooses to put their own life at risk, fine, itâ€™s their life and their body. But it&#x27;s not like that with a highly contagious disease. People&#x27;s personal choices are having a direct effect on other people&#x27;s health. Your right to do something personally risky should end when it puts others at risk. There&#x27;s a reason we don&#x27;t let people fire guns around randomly as long as they don&#x27;t happen to hit others.<p>The economic hardships are temporary. You can&#x27;t bring people back from the dead and you can&#x27;t (as far as we know now) reverse the long-term damage done to survivors.')
