If we are thinking about this as being a startup, how can we outsource the cost of building the hospital to the doctors and nurses? That way you might be able to build a billion dollar business by tricking people into owning all the downsides while you own all of the profits?<p>I&#x27;m just joking of course... the idea that the market can optimise every problem is simply incorrect. There isn&#x27;t a move fast and break things for doing startup hospitals, it&#x27;s simply a problem that central planning can organise effectively. Unfortunately, the American allergy to government means your healthcare system costs twice as much per capita for the same outcomes.')
