Item(by='kiliantics', descendants=None, kids=[24681639], score=None, time=1601831024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679389, text='&gt; I am a firm believer that all of the war and crime you see in the world is driven by some biological wiring that most of us continental organism possess, from ants to humans.<p>That is a very fatalist view that denies humans the agency we clearly have. We are obviously capable of devising social norms that go against our &quot;biological wiring&quot;, whatever that even is. A simple proof is how varied social norms can be -- with respect to things like marriage&#x2F;family, work, death, religion, etc. -- across different cultures in space and time.<p>We have the power, collectively, to end the horrible practices that lead to war, exploitation, imprisonment&#x2F;torture, climate change, and whatever else. These are not an inevitability. The idea that it is inevitable is more of a self-fulfilling prophecy that allows it to continue without any challenge.<p>We have shown in many ways that we have risen above the determinism of many biological processes. We should realise that things can be different and change ourselves to be a part of that difference.')
