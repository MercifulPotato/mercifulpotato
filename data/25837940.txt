Regarding  1-based indexing I don&#x27;t care one way or another. I often switch back between C, Python, JS and Lua. At first I was bothered by differences and blamed Lua for being more verbose or using unconventional indexing. After a while I can just switch the language mindset and use 1-based indexing where appropriate.<p>I agree about the scoping though, it should default to local.')
