He was going in and re-writing our software stored procedures.  They had to work a particular way or the whole harry ball came flying apart.  2 level one techs, 3 level two techs, 3 on site rebuilds with 3 installers and 4 senior engineers.  3 months of work.  All because 1 dude decided to change things out and did not follow our extensive docs and use the people we dedicated to help him.  All because he wanted a feature but did not want to pay for it but did not want to admit he broke the multi million dollar system they bought.  It was like an hour of work for me and 1 line of code.  But he jerked us around for months and cost us thousands of dollars of time and work and would scream at us for hours on end that nothing worked because he broke it.<p>BTW The dudes who worked the .COM boom&#x2F;bust stuff are hitting their 50s.  When you are on your 15th uber framework sometimes you just wing it and dig in only if you have to.  Or as I say to my fellow devs &#x27;what useless tech skill am I going to learn today that I did not want to know about&#x27;.  For my first couple of stacks I can tell you everything you want to know for hours on end.  For current ones that passion is mostly gone.  Crunched out of me with endless meetings and forms to fill out.')
