It sounds like it shouldn&#x27;t be called anything BUT algorithms. It implements standard generic algorithms for various operations. The kinds you&#x27;d be asked about in an algorithmic test, learn in algorithms 101, and so on.<p>Of course technically any part of a program is an algorithm, but usually (like here) we reserve the name for general things like here (from path and graph to partition and search algorithms), not for our &quot;business logic&quot; algorithm.')
