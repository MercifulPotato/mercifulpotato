Rather than having a public project\n    that does not meet HashiCorp standards, we have decided to\n    close source the project so we can rethink its design and\n    implementation. The source code is still available for\n    download, but Otto will no longer be actively maintained or\n    supported.\n</code></pre>\nIt looks like this is the successor to Otto, just with a bit of a different architecture.<p>The thing I&#x27;m worried about in terms of considering trying&#x2F;adopting it for any project is whether this will suffer the same fate, if it&#x27;s not as successful as Hashicorp hopes. I don&#x27;t want to learn new tools that give a small increase in efficiency if I don&#x27;t have a guaranteed return on that effort and some reasonable confidence using that tool will help me in other areas too.<p>Especially if the code behind the thing has the risk of going closed-source... it&#x27;s kind of the Google problem (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com</a>), and I really hope Hashicorp can avoid that (which they have, as they continue to support well-used even if not-flashy-anymore tools like Vagrant).')
