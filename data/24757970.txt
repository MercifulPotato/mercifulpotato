At first it looks like &quot;wow, people in the US really like working from home 4+ days a week.&quot; And then you wonder did they separate out &quot;never&quot; and &quot;rarely&quot;? The cynic in me wonders if lumping them together would have undermined the thesis of the article too much as it would have been a large plurality of all answers.<p>Or to put it another way, 60%+ of US people want to work remote 2 days or less per week.<p>That response lines up with my personal experience. While I like working from home occasionally, I don&#x27;t want to work somewhere where I don&#x27;t have a desk available 5 days a week.')
