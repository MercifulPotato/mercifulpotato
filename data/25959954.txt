What I do is just assume I&#x27;m going to have to work until I die, and keep angling toward work I tolerate better.  I try to invest wisely, maintain a few months of cash savings, etcetera, but don&#x27;t think about it otherwise.  Money is imaginary and anything could happen to it at any moment.<p>If once in a while I want to use some of my disposable income to spin a roulette wheel or buy GME, and can keep it under control, I see no problem.  If I win, it&#x27;s a nice surprise.  But if I don&#x27;t feel like playing, of course I won&#x27;t win anything.<p>Despite having watched it since Monday or before, I don&#x27;t think about what I could&#x27;ve won on GME this week any more than what I could&#x27;ve won at some dog track.  I decided not to play, and that&#x27;s that.  My life continues on as normal.')
