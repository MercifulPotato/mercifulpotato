Item(by='ci5er', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603739320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898446, text='The VC, on the board, has a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders: directly, his firm; the other shareholders, including the founders (!); and indirectly his LPs.<p>It is the board&#x27;s responsibility to hire and fire executive management and as both a significant shareholder and board member, has the leverage to do so IF the other board members agree. It is almost never unilateral. Now - in the early-ish days of a company (say,pre-D series), the board is pretty small and pretty acquainted, so the guy who wants to fire you (the CEO) just places about 4 phone calls, and if everyone is on board, gets the ball rolling. Legally, it is a lot easier than it is with a public company or with someone with one of those weird split-stock-right things like Facebook.')
