The code was not open source, and so stealing the key was itself copyright infringement, and more obviously circumvention of DRM.<p>In this case we have video which is streaming on the open web, which trivially provides for the user agent to download &#x2F; cache a copy. The question is not a matter of whether that copy is being redistributed, but that the user agent can watch it in an ad-free space whenever they want. You could probably accomplish the same thing, or nearly so, with a browser plugin.<p>Which is why I make the comparison to uBlock. uBlock is similarly &quot;playing back the content in an unapproved way&quot; and perhaps you could say it is also a circumvention device.<p>The whole concept of &quot;user agent&quot; is that software on the user&#x27;s machine -- that they control -- is rendering remote content in a form and fashion <i>chosen by the user</i>. The HTML provided by a remote server is not a legal contract for how that content must be displayed. It is a semantic description of the content, which the user agent can do with whatever it pleases for display to the user.<p>As long as no redistribution is occurring, the whole basis of the world-wide web is that a user agent can do whatever it wants to the content, including save a copy on the local machine.<p>So to me the most interesting question is exactly how youtube-dl becomes&#x2F;became distinct from a user agent.')
