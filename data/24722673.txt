I would have tried something like:<p>&quot;Close your honor, but let me expand on this further. Imagine instead that your opponent publishes their calls and they are regularly available to all individuals of the general public. However, while they may describe a call for going long, they do not give any specifics if the receiver starts from the left, center, right side of the field, how fast he should go, who should block for him, etc. They essentially are just assigning a call to a general concept of &#x27;go long&#x27;.\nNow as a competitor team, I look through their publicly available calls and say &quot;Hey, thats a good idea, we should have a call for &#x27;go long&#x27; as well&quot;. However, in practice my team does start from the left, and then cut in the center of the field to receive the ball. This may, or may not be totally different then what my opponents choose to do when they call &quot;go long&quot;\nThe additional benefit is if I transfer a new coach onto my team, he can use the call &quot;go long&quot; and even though the team accomplishes the goal, possibly by a different route, he can make the call to accomplish essentially the same thing.&quot;<p>Note: Not a huge sports guys, so perhaps my football analogy broke down a bit there, but hopefully you get the idea.')
