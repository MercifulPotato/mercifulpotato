Yes, you can make read-only replicas easily and many large AFS users make good use of that, but it doesn&#x27;t fundamentally solve the problem or fundamentally do something NFS can&#x27;t.<p>Also you can avoid a SPOF in NFS with Isilon&#x27;s commercial offering (which worked great in my experience, at least back when they were using an implementation based on FreeBSD&#x27;s kernel NFS server), or potential Red Hat&#x27;s HA setup.<p>Also, CephFS is an option too and avoids a SPOF by design. I&#x27;ve only run Ceph block storage but it&#x27;s absolutely a real distributed system and works well.')
