I checked an article about copyright protection for short phrases[0] and learnt that a court ruled that the text “I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent” is protected by copyright.  It would thus be possible for the author of that phrase to register:<p>i-may-not-be-totally-perfect-but-parts-of-me-are-excellent.com<p>and sue anyone who links to them.  Hopefully the author will be so grateful for this insight that they won&#x27;t sue me for reproducing their copyrighted work in this comment.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fairuse.stanford.edu&#x2F;2003&#x2F;09&#x2F;09&#x2F;copyright_protection_for_short&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fairuse.stanford.edu&#x2F;2003&#x2F;09&#x2F;09&#x2F;copyright_protection...</a>')
