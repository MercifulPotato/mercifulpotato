Item(by='chias', descendants=None, kids=[24827139], score=None, time=1603118869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24826697, text='If you define a &quot;program&quot; as &quot;a series of instructions to perform a task, where the instruction set is Turing Complete&quot;, then your statement is tautologically correct based on your definition. A much more general definition is simply &quot;a series of instructions to perform a task&quot;. Do you feel that the former definition of the word &quot;program&quot; is the only one worth using?<p>As an example: if you use a Game Maker application to construct a video game where your inputs are the graphics, the level design, and some basic scripting to connect them up, is the resulting output &quot;not a program&quot; because the input scheme that you used in order to define its behavior was not Turing Complete? You could make an argument that, in the context of Quines, this isn&#x27;t relevant because the Program is not outputting its own source code but only the top-most layer of its definition, but then again that&#x27;s true at some level for any Quine not written in machine code (and even then it&#x27;d probably be missing much of the OS &#x2F; display drivers &#x2F; etc.).<p><i>Edit: removed an example about &quot;programmable TV remotes&quot; because it wasn&#x27;t a very good example, and added a note about Quines.</i>')
