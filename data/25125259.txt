I&#x27;ve used plenty of applications that don&#x27;t look &quot;native&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Is there a reason to prefer it?  I get that performance can be an advantage, but one can easily write a very performant application using something like Skia, or doing one&#x27;s own GPU acceleration, without having any native look.')
