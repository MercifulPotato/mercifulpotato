There is a small admissions of figuring out who needs to stay in the hospital vs just send home, but that is comparatively easy, just run a few tests and you will know.  The real problem is those who need special care in a hospital bed. So long as there is a bed with staff to treat 80% will walk out after a few weeks. But as soon as there are not enough staff 100% will die in a few days.')
