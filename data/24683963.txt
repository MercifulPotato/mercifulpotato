We did not understand the idea of disk partitions at the time, and I don&#x27;t even remember the exact details--I believe we booted from floppy to get into Linux.<p>After spending a couple of days on tech support figuring out how to set the master&#x2F;slave jumpers on the drives, we felt like we were making good progress. That&#x27;s right, not all drives labeled their jumpers, and given that the web was a few years from being invented, there were not any support websites on which we could look up that info, so phone was the only way.<p>Next, we spent a week going to the UIUC CCSO computer lab and downloading slackware floppies.  We installed them, and managed to get everything up and running... until we tried getting X to run.  We had a strange 800x600 monitor, and getting the dot clocks right was another week of trial-and-error.<p>The dot clock hurdle surmounted, another problem: almost anything &quot;big&quot; we did under X would pretty quickly cause  a kernel panic.<p>So what did we do?  We followed what the README file in Linux said to do: we emailed Linus Torvalds the panic message. A few hours later, we had a response. Linus noticed that the crashes were all with pointers with a value of 0x08000000 (or whatever) which most likely was supposed to be a null pointer, but one of our SIMMs probably had a bit-stuck-at-1 error.  He apologized for not being able to tell us <i>which</i> SIMM in the system it was, but encouraged us to swap hardware.<p>The local computer store sales guys were unimpressed that LINUS TORVALDS HIMSELF had told us we bad memory, but we eventually got them to do a warranty exchange, probably just to get us to go away.  And I&#x27;m 100% sure those modules found themselves in the next system they built for a different customer.  New SIMM modules in hand and the problem was resolved!')
