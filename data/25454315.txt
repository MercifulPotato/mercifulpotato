(Actually, on the manual-transmission version it&#x27;s a flywheel that has a sort of lip around the rim that&#x27;s thicker on one side than the other.)<p>Aftermarket flywheels are generally symmetrical, with a way of bolting on a separate counterweight piece.<p>(The reason I know this is that I&#x27;m working on converting an RX-8 to electric.  I got the car cheap with a messed-up engine, and I bought an aftermarket flywheel to replace the lopsided stock one because I don&#x27;t want the car to shake itself to pieces.  I haven&#x27;t gotten around to ordering the adapter plate yet, but CanEV makes an RX7&#x2F;8 transmission adapter plate along with two different versions of a coupler that attaches the motor to either a tapered-shaft style flywheel, which is what the car had originally, or a six-bolt variant for some other version of the engine.)')
