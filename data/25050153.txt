Likely in very specific benchmarks.<p>Keep in mind that the general performance of a given chip, and the performance of that chip in a thermally-constrained form-factor like a laptop, are very different things. Just because the i7-8557u is a decent CPU in a testbench, doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t thermal-throttle itself under sustained load inside an MBP.')
