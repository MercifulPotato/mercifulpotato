Python engineers about this, and their response is always, &quot;These things come and go, virtualenv&#x2F;wrappers + pip + requirements.txt works fine - no need to look at anything else.&quot;<p>At the macro level, this seems like a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy: if all the senior and principal engineers using Python don&#x27;t care to take a look at something else, then it&#x27;s not too surprising that new solutions don&#x27;t end up sticking around. That isn&#x27;t too say that there does necessarily need to be a change in the Python community&#x27;s choice of package manager, but the rationale for not even considering looking at other options doesn&#x27;t seem super compelling.')
