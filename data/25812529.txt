That’s an incorrect assumption.<p>I haven’t upgraded because paying &gt;1000$ should add value over my MacBook Air 2012, yet for me all laptops in the market do not add enough value to justify the cost.<p>A new MacBook with 1 TB SSD storage sets you over 2000$, but the value just isn’t there.<p>Everybody’s mom is recommending an M1 these days, yet crappy webcam, support for 1 monitor only, expensive storage, low ram, being 1st gen of apples arm lineage with 1st gen flaws, no MagSafe, ... make it a bad value proposition right now for me compared with my 2012 air which doesn’t have most of these flaws.. sure it is better in many aspects, but it is also much worse in others (eg 1 external monitor support is a deal breaker for me)')
