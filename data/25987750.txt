They will just punish businesses that were stupid enough to work with Americans and Europeans.<p>&gt; This is a giant fuck-you to the West, and it’ll work, because the West has zero leverage.<p>They won&#x27;t work to fix Myanmar, but at some point the West has to ask itself if trade with China is worth it, for the future of both the West and all other countries that are not already in the grasp of China.<p>My opinion is that anyone who have political representation in the west (i.e. congressional representative, member of parliment, etc) should be calling and writing to them and demanding that they sanction China to the fullest extent.<p>I think there are plenty of reasons to sanction China, and maybe your political representatives won&#x27;t actually push for sanctioning China as such a move would be rather impractical now, but they need to understand that the people they represent are not okay with what is happening so that, at the very least, they start pushing back and stop making new deals with China like the EU-China deal that Germany rammed through on it&#x27;s neo-empire[1].<p>If the West does not take action on China soon it will be too late, if it is not already too late, and it is pathetic that Germany, a country that should know what &quot;never again&quot; means more than any other country, can&#x27;t find a backbone and stand up against a genocidal tyrannical state like China. Germany should be ashamed of itself.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;germanys-drive-for-eu-china-deal-draws-criticism-from-other-eu-countries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;germanys-drive-for-eu-china-...</a>')
