They do not. A decimal floating-point string represents a precise mathematical value and the only acceptable value for a CSV parser to produce is that value correctly rounded to a Float64 (or some other type if requested). Any CSV parser that does anything else is simply incorrect.<p>&gt; We saw elsewhere in the thread that Julia&#x27;s float parsing code at least presently handles certain syntaxes incorrectly.<p>You may be referring to a bug mentioned elsewhere that fields like `-123.` with a leading minus sign and a trailing decimal point are misinterpreted as strings. That is a bug, plain and simple. It has nothing to do with float parsing speed&#x2F;accuracy tradeoffs.')
