And not because &quot;it&#x27;s bad design&quot;. But because that is the requirement.<p>These sorts of things are always better discussed in terms of specific cases instead of generalities, but I think one of the key parts of good software engineering is factoring the requirements into the simplest design possible.<p>And even when time or other considerations prohibit creating an extensive design ahead of time, practicing a few well-chosen heuristics like &quot;use composition&quot;, &quot;keep functions and methods short&quot;, &quot;use clearly defined and consistent terminology in your abstractions&quot; can go a long way to making code less unruly and easier and cheaper to refactor down the road.')
