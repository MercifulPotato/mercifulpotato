Lots of bright people wanted to work there. Nowadays there are many interesting and rewarding jobs for people with good education, and the news industry is losing resources to social networks and online classified sites.<p>A similar analysis can be applied to explain the decline in the quality of school teachers. Women used to have very few work opportunities in the past, and many of the brightest ones would end up teaching.
