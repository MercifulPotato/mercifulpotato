I called TD early in the day and the limitations were not about buying stock but rather about selling (&quot;shorting&quot; options), and buying&#x2F;selling spreads (a combination of options with interesting characeristics).<p>There are two classes of broker here -- brokers that are backed by Citadel, and Brokers that have a different market maker&#x2F;clearing house and&#x2F;or are not exposed to Citadel. The WeBull CEO did an interview mid-day and noted that certain market makers and institutions (i.e. citadel and&#x2F;or Robinhood) were calling banks for bridge loans in the middle of the day. He also mentioned that Melvin Capital was bankrupt. I think Citron got out (that&#x27;s a different story) a couple days ago or so.')
