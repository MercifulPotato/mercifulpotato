The former is a strict formal process with a lot of thought given to a particular PEP proposal, whereas the latter seems like an informal chaotic hashing&#x2F;bikeshedding between a few key people in Julia community. I&#x27;ve contributed to Julia and people are really nice but IMO it is missing structure, discipline, hardline regimented approach of confronting difficult problems, etc. One feels like hearing a supreme court case and the other a street brawl to decide upon important issues.')
