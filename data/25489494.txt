Got it for a real bargain because the battery was getting old and one of the two speakers had broken. Those two things took a combined €110 and 2 hours of work to repair. I initially bought this just to hold me over until the ARM 16” comes out in a few months, but now I think I might hold onto it longer. It does everything I need, is very repairable, has good IO, and doesn’t suffer from some of the issues that newer models have.<p>Other than a few obvious improvements like moving from Thunderbolt 2 to 3 and shrinking the bezels a bit, the 2015 15” is pretty close to the perfect laptop.')
