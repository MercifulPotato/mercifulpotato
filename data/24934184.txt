They push product that is not ready.<p>I&#x27;ve seen enough arrogant quotes from systemd developers. But it solves user problems. Arch Linux was first among systemd adopters, boot become much quicker. And I think it solves maintainers problems, that&#x27;s why it was adopted so quickly.<p>Oh, I&#x27;ve heard GNOME also helped adoption, but is it systemd fault or GNOME fault? I believe GNOMEs. As I know OpenBSD does not run systemd so it is possible if people care enough.<p>I do not use PulseAudio, but I have not tried since 2008 (pushed by Ubuntu, wrong choice). Maybe it works, ALSA works so I do not care. If I cared enough about ALSA, I&#x27;d support its development like maintaining Firefox ALSA backend.<p>&gt; Wayland, unfortunately, is not willing to exist as just another option<p>I do not believe this is developers attitude, more like your opinion. You would gain nothing by attacking Wayland. Some developers would burn out sooner, same developers that could have implemented features you need. And lets face it no one wants to work on XFree86, not you, not me, hardly anyone. Because it is a mess:<p>&gt; The size isn&#x27;t so much the issue, it&#x27;s the design. The xfree86 ddx seriously believes that you have one video card driving one monitor with one keyboard and one mouse, and anything beyond that only works well because we sank a ton of effort into it. (It used to have code to disable interrupts! From userspace! What could go right.)<p>&gt; X is a tremendously successful project whose core design and reference implementation do not reflect how computers work anymore, in ways that make it painful to develop and maintain as the system display server.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24925189" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24925189</a>')
