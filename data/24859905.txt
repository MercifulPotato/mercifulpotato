This results in all cells having similar charge levels.<p>It doesn&#x27;t change the charge time, though. You&#x27;re putting the same amount of energy into the pack either way. 14.8V @ 100mA applied to 4 cells in series is the same energy as 3.7V @ 100mA applied to 4 cells individually. Can&#x27;t escape the laws of physics.<p>If power efficiency is critical (solar applications, for example), the BMS might have fancy switching circuitry to re-route energy from overcharged cells to undercharged cells. This is expensive, though, so most BMSs just use resistors to burn off extra charge from overcharged cells.')
