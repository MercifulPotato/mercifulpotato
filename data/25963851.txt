Let&#x27;s look at all possibilities :<p>- Maybe Dick knew that the management under him was behaving like cowboys, and tried to stop it. Then that&#x27;s sad, but so far no one seem to have given any tangible proof that this was the case.<p>- Maybe Dick knew the that the management under him was behaving like cowboys, and did not tried to stop it. And he got what he deserved.<p>- Maybe Dick just did not realize that the management under him was behaving like cowboys. Then the company he was a part of got what it deserved for putting that man - who was not competent enough to realize what was going on - in a position of power.<p>- Maybe Dick did not realize that the management under him was behaving like cowboys. But the &quot;company policy&quot; prevented him from acting. Then he should have left. You don&#x27;t reach such positions without playing the game.<p>Maybe Lehman was not the only one doing all of that. But Lehman was definitely one. As such they maybe should not have been the only one to die, but they definitely deserved what they got. I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;I was a clueless nice guy that got caught in the middle of it&quot; story. He&#x27;s not sorry he did it, he&#x27;s only sorry he got caught, otherwise he would just have left sooner.')
