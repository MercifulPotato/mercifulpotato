Rich countries have no other choice but to pay up to raise the poor(who are the 1% of the world and compared to a Syrian refugee, they are not suffering) at this point.<p>IMO, it’s worth it because we can’t halt progress because of socio-economic road blocks.<p>The amount of productivity and time lost fighting over piddling sums of money in a country that has trillion dollar budgets is not worth it.<p>Better to institute UBI if that will reduce noise. I used to be against UBI, but once that seed of free money has been planted, it’s going to be difficult to eradicate that weed seed bank. Thanks to start ups( hello, YC!) who experimented with giving out free money. Time to pay up and move on.')
