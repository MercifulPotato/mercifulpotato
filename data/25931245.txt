Because it keeps happening and companies keep getting fined for it.<p>This is not a logical sentence.  They are obviously getting fined because it&#x27;s illegal.  The traders involved are also terminated, fyi.<p>All banks are required to submit automated reports on Front Running detection algorithms daily to the regulators.  Every trade is evaluated by the compliance systems.<p>If you think the fines are not big enough or that the algorithms are missing things, then make that more logical argument.<p>Stay away from hyperbole because it discredits you.')
