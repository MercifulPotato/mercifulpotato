These are still the most common kind, given that Republicans tend to value low-density communities while Democrats tend to value denser, more walkable places.<p>The link offered to support this is based on personal choices of conservatives vs. liberals on where to live, NOT conservatives using government policy to block development.<p>If you look at data in areas where building codes are most restrictive and home prices are increasing the most, it is almost all exclusively in progressive deep blue cities, states, and areas. Most &quot;deep red&quot; large cities (like Houston, TX - famous for having almost no zoning laws) are still very affordable with lots more construction happening everywhere. This would lead me to believe that NIMBY behavior is most often associated with progressives, not conservatives.')
