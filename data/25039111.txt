Yes, you&#x27;ll eventually have to be on site to integrate the equipment, and making anything actually move while not on-site is a big no-no, but between a little simulation, a VPN, and maybe a controller, good development practices make it easy to work remotely. Also, all our machines for several years now have included industrial VPN appliances so we can do remote support and updates - an Ewon Cosy is way cheaper than even an engineer&#x27;s airline ticket - we just use them a little earlier now.<p>I used to have a wireless router in the shop so I could do development from my office with its desk, monitors, keyboard, and chair. Now that router also runs OpenVPN so I can do the same from home.<p>It&#x27;s only the non-technical staff that think workers have to be warming seats and shifting steel to  be getting work done. A huge amount of building those machines is spreadsheet wrangling and rote business logic connecting inputs to outputs, which is more effective when working remotely than on-location.')
