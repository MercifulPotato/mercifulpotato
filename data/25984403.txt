Sometimes minor architectural decisions, that don&#x27;t take much time, can lead to a happier long term life.<p>But I 100% agree with designing for horizontally scaling.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons I always try to steer people in the direction of Heroku for new projects, because while it reduces your ops burden and makes your life easier...it also forces you to design for horizontal scalability from day 1 via 12 Factor.')
