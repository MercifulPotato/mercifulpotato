The north polar region is warming much faster than most places on the globe. Without its usual thick mass of ice, the region isn&#x27;t cold enough to sustain the usual &quot;polar vortex.&quot; Global models have been predicting for weeks that the vortex would split, and a lobe of very cold air would spin off over Europe, causing record cold temps.<p>The debates are over and we are already living with the consequences of burning up so much fossil fuel. But your snark is, uh, really funny! Ha ha!')
