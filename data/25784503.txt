It is a contactless-technology which operates in the spectrum between 30 GHz - 300 GHz. Due to the technology’s use of small wavelengths it can provide sub-mm range accuracy and is able to penetrate certain materials such as plastic, drywall, clothing, and is impervious to environmental conditions such as rain, fog, dust and snow.<p>mmWave sensors transmit signals with a wavelength which is in the millimeter (mm) range. This is considered a short wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum and is one of the advantages of this technology. Indeed, the size of system components such as antenna required to process mmWave signals is small. Another advantage of short wavelengths is the high resolution. A mmWave system that resolves distances to wavelength has accuracy in the mm range at 60-64 GHz and 76-81 GHz.<p>o Additionally, operating in this spectrum makes mmWave sensors interesting for the following reasons:<p>o Ability to penetrate materials: see through plastic, drywall and clothing.<p>o Highly directional: compact beam forming with 1° angular accuracy.<p>o <i>Light-like: can be focused and steered using standard optical techniques.</i><p>o Large absolute bandwidths: distinguish two nearby objects.<p>PDS: This sounds like it could have applications for exploring underground caverns (including Mars?), and possibly for space flight and space missions, like Star Trek&#x27;s scanner, version 0.000001...<p>Also, weird idea: Perhaps there&#x27;s a wavelength such that you could bounce it off of a small object, say a microchip, and then read the scatterings of those waves at some distance, maybe several meters away...<p>Net effect would be that the waves would expand, and would magnify (as a scatter pattern on the larger object which might be a screen which detects EM waves of some sort) the smaller object, without needing a microscope...')
