Feedbacks are appreciated', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi, I&#x27;m Tony and I&#x27;m the only founder of Fonsori. Fonsori focuses on empowering underserved communities by first improving their access to mental health care providers and non-licensed mentors via our social networking and marketplace platform. This is my first time starting a company so I would appreciate any tips and feedbacks if possible, especially the best way to reach out to the first potential customers. My plan is to focus on the supply side first since it&#x27;s a two sided marketplace&#x2F;social network.<p>Link to site: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fonsori.com&#x2F;<p>Thank you for your help!')
