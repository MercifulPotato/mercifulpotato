I installed Linux. The installation process was very painful. Getting it to cooperate with the hardware was worse, and of course there is no real support. I finally got it halfway working. At that point, I found it was hard to learn, harder to get used to, and hardest to do anything useful since none of the programs were familiar.<p>Two days later the computer stopped working entirely and would not even boot. I spent hours fighting with it, tried to reinstall linux and it simply would not work. I removed the hard drive that linux was on, plugged back in my Windows hard drive, and could not make the computer boot up.<p>I finally took it to a computer repair place and was told the CPU was damaged, and there was damage to the RAM too. Total cost was more than I paid for the computer. I also took along the linux harddrive, and was told that the drive had permanent damage (a brand new drive). The repairman asked me what I was doing with these computers. As soon as I mentioned the word &quot;Linux&quot;, he told me that&#x27;s my problem. He said Linux destroys computer hardware, and said he wont even allow it in his shop. He said that simply installing a self booting Linux CD can wreck a computer in minutes. mostly destroying the CPU and drives. This is caused because Linux sends the wrong voltages to components and burns up the CPU and other chips. It also plays havoc with harddrives, and causes them to lose their ability to read and write data.<p>So, here I sit with around $1200 worth of damages and repair bills. (Not including many hours of wasted time). Since Linux is made by a bunch of computer geeks and idiots with no real business address, there is no one to sue. Both my computer repairman and lawyer said it&#x27;s worthless to even try a lawsuit.<p>All I can do is warn others, to avoid Linux like a deadly disease. Dont even try it, unless you want to intentionally destroy your computer.')
