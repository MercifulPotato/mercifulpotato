I did go on keto and it helped me tremendously. This has also made me &quot;eat more like grandma&quot;. I eat &quot;normal&quot; again but in doing so limit carbs and eat more fat automatically.<p>Instead of the current everything is sugared into oblivion over-carbed food with fat reduced recipes I like to use grandma style recipes that start the recipe with: take a cup or two of cream and a block of butter (ok not really _that_ much but you get the idea). Tastes way better and needs way less sugar to taste good and I know exactly what&#x27;s in it as a make it myself.')
