The US wasn&#x27;t banning or forcing acquisitions for foreign competitors like WhatsApp or Line, and the EU isn&#x27;t making moves on Visa&#x2F;Mastercard which are arguably just as critical. If the EU was making this move based on national security reasons, I&#x27;d also expect them to be upfront about it.')
