There&#x27;s an episode where Jim tries to combine birthday celebrations as one of his first acts as manager and it blows up in his face. After, Michael imparts real wisdom about why that happened. It becomes clear that while he is a ridiculous and imperfect man, he is a decent leader after all. And some of the jokes and such? They&#x27;re for morale, even if they don&#x27;t always hit the mark. Somehow Scranton stays afloat..<p>What a great show')
