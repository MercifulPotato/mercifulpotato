I am not sure if they are playing politics or this is their sincere outlook.<p>I can’t stress this enough: China may have been unlucky to be struck by the original SARS-CoV, so it’s reasonable that they had the motivation to study its origins; that research is valuable and it’d be absolutely bonkers to criticize scientists for having done it. Even if lab escape did indeed happen to be the cause of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, I am not sure this should be a basis for prosecution of a particular country (as opposed to e.g. tightening of BSL security practices): there’s human factor, and mistakes happen; if it hadn’t been China it could’ve eventually been another country.<p>What I find alarming is if an effort to obstruct the study of pandemic origins in order to save face (?) is taking place. If it <i>was</i> a lab escape, humanity’s future could be much safer if we knew how it happened—but how would researchers know it was a lab escape if they can’t look in that direction?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virologyj.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s12985-015-0422-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virologyj.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s12985-...</a> (2015, two authors are with Wuhan Institute of Virology)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2002–2004_SARS_outbreak#April_2004" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2002–2004_SARS_outbreak#April_...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;publications&#x2F;m&#x2F;item&#x2F;who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;publications&#x2F;m&#x2F;item&#x2F;who-convened-global-...</a>')
