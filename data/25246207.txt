You can put some error bars on that, investigate the differences (did that 1% where it changed happen disproportionately with a certain side of the coin up?) and from that provide an estimate for whether the coin is fair. If the confidence intervals aren&#x27;t small enough for you, you can do more experiments. The confidence interval will never be 0, until you&#x27;ve either done an infinite sequence of trials. (Only axiomatic logic can have confidence interval 0, and it doesn&#x27;t make statements about the real world, only about the axiomatic system in use.)')
