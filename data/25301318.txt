The hype around GoT was very much centered around the shocking twists and reveals and speculation around how everything would play out.<p>Redoing the last seasons with better scripts would be enormously expensive, but would not generate the same hype so would not get a large audience.<p>Making a sequel show would be a much better RoI since it could at least create some hype again, even if the hype of the original show would be hard to top.')
