If it&#x27;s a database you don&#x27;t need to be accessible except in bursts this can be really handy for cutting costs as you&#x27;re not paying for any read&#x2F;write resources you&#x27;re not using. Of course if you do need it generally accessible all the time then you&#x27;d want to provision it accordingly.')
