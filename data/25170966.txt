However even in 2020 there&#x27;s plenty of stuff to look for on military bases both famous and not famous, and its also fun to take overhead journey of something like the Empire Builder railroad line and compare it to my memories of taking that ride in person.  Also national parks look interesting on google earth, at least to me.')
