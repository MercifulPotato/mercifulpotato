I&#x27;ve mentioned some in another comment here, but really why cmake should be thrown in the garbage is too long a rant to fit into a comment field.<p>I am VERY interested in hearing new ideas. If you have a truly better way, then I want to use it.<p>Though I&#x27;m not sure why you say generating code is so bad. Code gets compiled to machine language, and (especially with optimizations and all the new fancy instructions) are not a thing that most people usually look at anymore.<p>Yes, actual developers need automake&#x2F;autoconf installed. Of a sufficiently recent version. But what exactly is your suggestion? Autotools at least makes this an issue only for the developers (and not even all of them, since they may not need to change things), not for the orders of magnitude more users.<p>But this is not a unique thing to developers. There may be other generated code. E.g. they need to have protobuf compiler installed, with all the plugins required. End users, even those who build, don&#x27;t. Developers who don&#x27;t modify those parts don&#x27;t.<p>But here&#x27;s the main thing though: Any portable build system, that <i>already requires EVERY user to have that build system installed</i>, is DoA for being a viable portable build system.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to download a package, only to find that the build system the author in their infinite wisdom chose to use, has not been ported to your platform (or if it has, you have to yak shave for a few hours to get it and its dependencies installed). So you can&#x27;t compile the thing.<p>The beauty of autotools is that it &quot;compiles&quot; to a &quot;virtual machine&quot; (shell) that will truly run anywhere. Nowadays even on Windows, which now ships bash.<p>CMake too fails on this aspect, in addition to all the other aspects this box won&#x27;t be able to fit.<p>But please, I truly mean that if you have a better way, then I do want it. It&#x27;s incredibly hard to build something portable though. Hence the minimal dependency of &quot;just a POSIX shell&quot; for autotools.')
