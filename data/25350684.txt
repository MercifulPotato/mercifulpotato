Compare for yourself, it&#x27;s not hard to find: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nutritiondata.self.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;vegetables-and-vegetable-products&#x2F;2770&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nutritiondata.self.com&#x2F;facts&#x2F;vegetables-and-vegetabl...</a><p>&gt;  Certainly not to any green leafy vegetable you find on a supermarket shelf.<p>Yes, those too. They all have different profiles. Generally leafy green vegetables are NOT high in <i>everything</i> at once. They&#x27;re high in vitamin K and C. That&#x27;s not terribly unique - many plant foods share this characteristic.<p>Add to the fact, green vegetables are not as satiating as potatoes. The soluble fiber tends to be fermented quickly. They fulfill a different purpose.<p>&gt; Boiling destroys vitamin C and many others as well.<p>Huge overstatement. We generally cook our vegetables as well, a good portion of the vitamins stay intact. In fact cooking increases bio-availability. It doesn&#x27;t really matter that there is some loss in the process.<p>&gt;  Now maybe boiling is not how you do consume potatoes but that&#x27;s how most people consume them.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you get this idea. I roast potatoes, but all the same cooking in hot water is a gentler cooking method.<p>All of which to say, discounting potatoes entirely owing to some notion of a poor nutrient profile is absurd.')
