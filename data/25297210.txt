Social activists may go over the line and be rude or abrasive, but unfortunately it&#x27;s impossible to be a polite social activist. Activism fundamentally requires telling people that their actions should be modified, that their beliefs may be flawed, that their systems have problems. It&#x27;s really hard to do that and be a likeable person.<p>Of course social activists may at times cross the line and be unnecessarily rude or abrasive. But I&#x27;d have more sympathy because their fundamental job is to be subversive and critical of people.')
