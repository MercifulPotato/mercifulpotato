That&#x27;s like saying time dilation is a physics failure in newtonian physics. Technically correct, and entirely unhelpful to solve the problem.<p>The problem here being that writing &quot;<i>based purely on the market forces (i.e. excluding carbon taxes) coal is still a very viable option.</i>&quot; suggests that since we all want free markets we&#x27;ll need to accept this.

Technically correct, but entirely unhelpful to find a way how to move forward.<p>A free market needs rules. &quot;Free market&quot; does not equate &quot;do whatever you want&quot;. Without rules that are enforced, you don&#x27;t have freedom either.')
