Item(by='grawprog', descendants=None, kids=[25554573], score=None, time=1609102790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25553055, text='I grew up in that time, I can at least say why we never had one which was mostly just because we had an n64 at the time.<p>The Dreamcast, at least from the commercials I remember, didn&#x27;t really seem all that appealing by comparison and the games available for it never really stood out to me or anything, at least at thr time. I have played some Dreamcast games since and did enjoy them, it would have been cool if it hadn&#x27;t died and things had gone differently for sega. I always did love the genesis I spent about as much time on that as I did the nes and snes as a kid.<p>I remember I didn&#x27;t even hear about sonic adventure until I got the sequel on the gamecube years later. Both of which are actually pretty great games.<p>But we had a lot of choices on the n64 and most of the time my siblings and me or my cousins and all of us played together so we had a lot more choice of stuff we could all play together. There was tons of great 4-player games on the n64. Some i think are still the best 4 player games out there.<p>GoldenEye, perfect dark, the multiplayer on Conker&#x27;s bad fur day, the mario party games(except the first one...that bastard killed all our control sticks...stupid weak n64 controllers and those devious stick spinning mini games designed to sell more controllers.), super smash brothers, mario kart, diddy kong racing, Iggy&#x27;s wrecking ball, I dunno, I could just keep listing games all day.<p>The n64 still probably, gives hands down the most choice in and arguably some of the best local 4 player gaming experience out there.<p>It was the same reason why none of us had a playstation growing up and why we ended up with a GameCube for a ps2. Not as much opportunity for multiplayer.')
