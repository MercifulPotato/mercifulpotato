I&#x27;m not sure why, but he seems to have a rather myopic view of the left. It&#x27;s a sudden departure from the writing he was known for during the days of The Intercept and Salon.com. I am honestly even starting to question the honesty of his writing, even.<p>An example for this article:<p>&gt; including a refusal to aggregate user data in order to monetize them to advertisers or algorithmically evaluate their interests in order to promote content or products to them.<p>He says this but fails to mention that the same people who were the founders of Cambridge Analytica also were the founder of Parler<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20201116&#x2F;01141545710&#x2F;what-if-cambridge-analytica-owned-own-social-network-ca-backer-rebekah-mercer-admits-shes-co-founder-parler.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20201116&#x2F;01141545710&#x2F;what-...</a><p>Furthermore there seems to be little, if any, mention of the fact that the Mercers who were major funders for the Trump organization were also using the data obtained from Cambridge Analytica to target political advertising.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;595338116&#x2F;what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;595338116&#x2F;what-did-cambridge-...</a><p>I know this is beyond the scope of the article that Greenwald was writing but having read his writing for <i>years</i> I have to wonder why it wasn&#x27;t mentioned? It&#x27;s not something that would typical go without mention in writing from earlier in his career.<p>I am not one to typically hedge on the side of removing &quot;free speech&quot; from people, but Parler represented a clear and present threat to American democracy. The ties to the Trump organization and it&#x27;s funders were innumerable. Why does Greenwald have an agenda to foment discord regarding this? His writing lately, the twitter screeds that he has gone on against the left, and his staunch denial of the Russian interference in the 2016 election makes me question if he hasn&#x27;t been compromised in some way.')
