But I’ve noticed if you wear only one pair they are more prone to developing odor than if you rotate them with a second pair, so there’s maybe a practical reason for more than one. Not to mention our culture sometimes(unfortunately!) looks down on people that don’t vary their outfit, maybe because lack of variety is a signal that it can’t be afforded, so it’s a marker of status.')
