Even Goldstone, the next most powerful radar telescope, is 20x less sensitive.<p>Not to mention the pairing of Arecibo&#x27;s radars with the LIDAR system and it&#x27;s HF Ionospheric heater system. I don&#x27;t think saying Arecibo was not the only observatory in it&#x27;s class is being rather disingenuous.')
