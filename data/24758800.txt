It&#x27;s more like a configurable intercepting proxy where dns is a small facet. The beauty of this is that it&#x27;s like magic, it just works. No distribution of self-signed certs to all devices necessary because cloudflare already handles tls termination.<p>Tailscale is ergonomic tunnel management&#x2F;&#x2F;authentication. Which in itself is a great product, but it&#x27;s not nearly as granular. Being able to restrict access based on identity provider, individual, etc is a must for a corporate solution.<p>One of Tailscale&#x27;s selling points is the data isn&#x27;t routed through their servers, just between peers. That&#x27;s the opposite of Cloudflare; their value proposition is centralized granular control, no plumbing, just plug&#x27;n play.')
