There&#x27;s a lot of perspective to be gained from being at different levels of status, and seeing that life really isn&#x27;t that different. IME, like a lot of life, there&#x27;s a tension: you need to be willing and able to work hard (often without recognition), able to accept the rewards that may come from that work, but also able to not hold too tightly to those rewards.<p>I hope I can teach and model this lesson well for my son.')
