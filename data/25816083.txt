Electricity (minus the energy lost in transport etc etc) is zero-sum. If the miner uses hydro, that means someone further from the dam is using coal, methane etc as the hydro company isn&#x27;t selling excess on the grid.<p>Energy is finite on the grid, so yes mining takes energy which could have been used for (arguably) better purposes')
