It is :) I&#x27;ve been trying out Tim Hortons as well, it&#x27;s quite nice.<p>&gt; Until you go outside and try to walk in the street :)<p>I feel like I lucked out and bought the right winter coat early on. Or maybe just stepping from one heated building to another doesn&#x27;t feel that bad. Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of the two. Either way, I haven&#x27;t felt cold on the street yet. And It&#x27;s already colder than my coldest winter experience in Pakistan.')
