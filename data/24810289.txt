You deduct more than you earned and also deduct the interest payments.<p>The mere use of a business entity gets you a 20% tax deduction up to $120,000 (unincorporated sole proprietors can get this too, just easier to challenge and audit to fail) and then you can pump another $57,000 into a solo 401k.<p>An S-Corp designation can somewhat mitigate the self employment taxes.<p>You can also try paying people in shares&#x2F;membership interests, parts of specific revenue streams or other noncash things (like free access to your service), so that you can keep your cash position while still making tax deductions.<p>Just dont run for office, or do, I dont care.
