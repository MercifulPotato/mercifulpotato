Also, more White than SF.<p>SF is more diverse (even just racially; ethnicity and national origin just makes that even more clear.) There&#x27;s more to the world that White and Black.<p>(Also, in the Bay Area, Oakland is  22.7% Black and about the population of Tulsa, so if you are looking for concentrated Blackness, the Bay Area has Tulsa beat on that as well as diversity.)')
