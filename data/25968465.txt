Well, I made this the other day.  I measured, so probably didn&#x27;t do that right and my oven is crummy, so the temperature was probably off and I think I left it in a little too long (or I&#x27;m at the wrong altitude?)<p>So the outside was a bit more crispy that I&#x27;d expect, but it wasn&#x27;t burnt. The inside was definitely cakie - not fluffy enough to be called cake, but not solid or hard enough to be a proper cookie (the outside was cookie-like). Quite edible, but it turns out you can actually use too many chocolate chips....')
