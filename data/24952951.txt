My line is pretty simple. Is it a tradition that involves harm being done to an individual without their consent? Then I&#x27;m not honoring it. Is it a tradition involving personal behavior and decisions or interactions between people with all parties consenting? Then it&#x27;s none of my business. Discrimination falls very clearly on the first side of that line. Something like caste is &quot;mild&quot; enough that it&#x27;s only really worth the energy to fight in the US when it crops up, but things that are more severe (like outright genocide) are things that I would argue we go beyond &quot;not honoring&quot; into the realm of &quot;time to actively intervene.&quot; The Rohingya genocide is being committed by a society &quot;very different from the one in which I was raised.&quot; I feel no desire to exercise tolerance towards the practitioners. I guess that makes me a bit more of a hawk than the average American right now.')
