I don&#x27;t like having things that I didn&#x27;t specifically require&#x2F;install&#x2F;configure. I really appreciate the philosophy of starting at stock vim, and then add configuration&#x2F;tools when you realize you need&#x2F;want them. [ And of course, vim keybindings can&#x27;t be beat ;) ]')
