He says:<p>Economy&#x2F;Resource - 2.8 &#x2F; 10<p>&quot;However when comparing it to the SC universe, WC3 has always been underwhelming to me when comparing its resource counterparts of mineral&#x2F;vespene. Gold obviously being the most important, with wood generally feeling more like a chore than something I want to collect. To me the most limiting factor is the upkeep cost, a mechanic that not only limits strategies, but also deters expanding or larger scale battles.&quot;<p>This misses the point of WC3 vs. Starcraft &#x2F; Starcraft 2. In Warcraft 3, one of the most important resources not present in Starcraft is your heroes and their levels. If you watch any professional WC3 game, there is rarely a discussion of who&#x27;s ahead based on economy (although that is a factor at times) - but there is always discussion on hero levels. The importance of creep routes and disrupting creeping for heroes &#x2F; races with favorable creep is a huge component of the game.<p>Also, upkeep is a specific choice meant to reward players who don&#x27;t inflate their armies for the sake of it. Grubby said it on his stream, in Starcraft, it is universally a good decision to spend your money as soon as you have it. It&#x27;s not strategy if it&#x27;s always a good thing to do. Whether you spend it on X, Y, or Z is where the strategy comes in, but as long as you spend it something, you can be confident that it was better than not spending it &#x2F; banking it. In WC3, that too is up for debate. You can spend on X, Y, Z (units, hero items, expansion, another hero, tech, upgrades) but at certain times in the game, it is also perfectly valid to hold on to that money for a specific reason. I think this is a smart design decision, and is one of the reasons why WC3 has some interesting dynamics.<p>This is my perspective as a really big fan of both games. They&#x27;re different games, but it&#x27;s clear HuK is using Starcraft as the rubric. No game is as Starcraft as Starcraft, Warcraft is its own game with its own complexities.')
