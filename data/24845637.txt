I am building <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brainless&#x2F;dwata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brainless&#x2F;dwata</a> but from a different angle. It is not a builder as such and has no SQL in the interface at all.<p>It is where non-technical folks can do everything - dig into data, merge data from CSV even, create reports. SQL is generated automatically from schema reflection. There is no engineering help needed, at least at this stage and it does multi-table JOINs by itself already.')
