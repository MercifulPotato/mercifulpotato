It&#x27;s funny, but long and unpleasant process. I was aware of the &quot;I don&#x27;t mind cookies&quot; extension, and that was perfect... but for the opposite! I was wondering why there wasn&#x27;t an option to say no instead of yes.\nSo I&#x27;ll definitely try this. If it works as expected and you keep at least the basic features free this will be a must have for me.')
