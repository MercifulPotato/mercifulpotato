Missing 5k in contributions to retirement accounts at 25 and then making up for it with extra at 26 is very different than making up with an extra contribution at 46. Same applies to education, and if you&#x27;re trying to make up missed &quot;contributions&quot; in 6&#x2F;7th grade, you&#x27;re already the educational equivalent of a 46 year old.<p>At risk of stretching a thin metaphor even further, this is to say nothing of Social Security (long-term structural impact of system-wide attempts to catch up half a generation of students on 12+ months of education).<p>edit: formatting&#x2F;proofreading')
