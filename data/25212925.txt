The extremes stay planted. They define the Overton window. The centre is the bulk that moves. It&#x27;s the part that decides. The extremes effect change by persuading the centre, not by talking to other extremists.<p>This is the problem with partisan-fueled premature dichotomization. It creates lots of immovable people. The only solution to that system is to punt the problem for a generation in the hope that more people drift to the centre.')
