Having actual programs rather than entire desktops run remotely is amazingly handy. A desktop inside a window has never been a great experience.<p>Indeed it&#x27;s not great at high-latency, it was invented for rooms full of local X-terminals (that were on constantly so connection loss wasn&#x27;t an issue either, unless someone messed with the cable terminators :P )<p>I would love for this to continue being developed though, as there is still a great usecase for it IMO. But the protocol could really be cleaned up removing a lot of round-trips with locally cached variants (basically what NoMachine NX and X2GO are doing).<p>I do agree it makes sense in this increasingly cloud-centric world.. I hope it will eventually come too!')
