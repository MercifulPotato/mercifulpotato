Not saying it&#x27;s indie game&#x27;s fault but it&#x27;s true very few indie games have online multiplayer and very few really made it awesome, most of the time networking is not worth it for smaller games, a lot of awesome local multiplayer games won&#x27;t even consider online. And yeah strategy&#x2F;turnbased games definitely will be better.')
