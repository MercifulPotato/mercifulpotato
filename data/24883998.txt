I just went to the Oculus Quest website, and as soon as the page loads there is an animation in the upper left corner that shows the Oculus logo with the text &quot;from Facebook&quot; that animates away. The only other Facebook mention is tucked away at the footer of a long scroll that says &quot;from Facebook&quot; in a non-style guide adhering white font. Doesn&#x27;t look official at all.')
