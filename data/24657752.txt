Even on those consumer-grade SSDs, that would allow for much higher throughput than what&#x27;s presented in that reviewâ€”though most of those consumer-grade SSDs wouldn&#x27;t be able to sustain such write performance for very long.<p>Right now, a lot of software that wasn&#x27;t written specifically with SSDs in mind is effectively bottlenecked on the CPU side with system call overhead, or is limited by the SSD&#x27;s latency while using only a fraction of its potential throughput because the drive is only given one or a few requests to work on at a time.<p>If you do write your software with fast storage in mind, and have the fastest SSD money can&#x27;t quite buy, the results can be very different: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;io-uring&#x2F;4af91b50-4a9c-8a16-9470-a51430bd7733@kernel.dk&#x2F;T&#x2F;#u" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lore.kernel.org&#x2F;io-uring&#x2F;4af91b50-4a9c-8a16-9470-a51...</a>')
