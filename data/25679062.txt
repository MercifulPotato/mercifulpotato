When we&#x27;d run random drawings, I&#x27;d (properly) randomly select and provide a winner.<p>It happened more than once that the marketing side would come back and ask for a new winner because of a situation like us doing a drawing for a prize from an ISP, and the winner&#x27;s email being &quot;@competitorisp.net&quot;.<p>As far as I know (and I&#x27;ve got a reasonable basis for this), the clients never requested this or anything. It was purely our marketing guys not liking the optics of telling the client that a competitor&#x27;s customer won.<p>And yeah, for some giveaways and stuff they&#x27;d take a list of people and trawl through their social media accounts to figure out who&#x27;d have the most impact.<p>Again, don&#x27;t think the clients had requested this, it just made the job we&#x27;re doing look better to show the client &quot;Yeah this person won and look at all the social media buzz it created!&quot; rather than &quot;Yeah we gave it to someone that looks like a troll, has no media presence, and the only people that will probably hear about this are a few people in an IRC chatroom.&quot;<p>If it&#x27;s not regulated (or small enough that the regulators won&#x27;t notice), I&#x27;d assume any contest&#x2F;etc like this is probably rigged. Marketing is, generally, an industry full of lies. The contests are no different.')
