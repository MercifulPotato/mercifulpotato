I&#x27;ve looked through the docs, and I can&#x27;t see how you would play a sample back (i.e. to create a simple sampler, which is one of the projects I&#x27;m most interested in creating).  Am I missing something, or is that something that wouldn&#x27;t be present at that level, and you&#x27;d need to roll your own?<p>EDIT:  I&#x27;ve just read the code for the simple piano, and I see that it implements the sample playback itself, so I guess that answers my own question!')
