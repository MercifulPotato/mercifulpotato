The Gripen is built using a NATO engine (modified F404&#x2F;414). The T-7 Red Hawk trainer will be the trainer in many NATO countries and one of the most numerous aircraft in NATO for years to come, and it’ll be built partially by Saab too.<p>The successor to Gripen won’t be a solo project, it’ll be built in collaborations like with BAE in the Tempest program. NATO is more than the US, so buying Dassault&#x2F;EADS&#x2F;Airbus is “Just as NATO” as buying Lockheed and Boeing.<p>I doubt there would be many permanent US forces in Sweden considering the Norwegian forces are now being cut.')
