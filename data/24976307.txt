And it may or may not be coming or true, i don&#x27;t know :)  That&#x27;s why I keep asking to see the evidence when I keep seeing someone making the claim: I actually want to see it if it exists or if they&#x27;re just repeating the news stories.<p>To me, it&#x27;s not the position that Covid has long term effects that&#x27;s incredulous, because we know that a proportion of a lot of viral infections can develop into longer term complications and effects.  But it&#x27;s the idea&#x2F;observation that the longer term effects are both comparatively worse than other viruses, and splitting the quantumn of those effects into a &quot;general covid effect&quot; (that is to say, the probability of the effect for a given case of covid), and those of a &quot;general pandemic effect&quot; (that is to say, the population-size effect of having all these infections happening at once due to a relatively vulnerable population with little immunity, in contrast to some of the older&#x2F;other viruses).<p>But I admit myself a little more than disturbed how every time I ask to see comparable figures&#x2F;studies to see how we have knowledge of long-term effects of a virus that&#x27;s only been around for the short-term, and claims that are usually made without any reference to the viruses to which covid needs to be compared, that I generally get hit by a quick wave of downvotes.')
