This social construct is valuable. Why? Because this construct solves the problems associated with bartering by allowing us to frictionlessly keep track of who owes what and how much to whom (claims on goods and services). This social construct can use tokens such as dollar bills or gold, for example, as the abstraction for the ledger of record. There are problems using dollars and gold as the abstraction. Dollars (or fiat) violates our common sensibilities as a record on claims on goods and services. The problem is it can be printed without regard and used to extract goods and labor from you (if you choose to accept it). Some people would consider this fundamentally unfair because they are trading their product of their efforts for something that is created infinitely without effort by the privileged few (i.e. something for nothing). Gold is better in this regard but as a money abstraction it is also leaky because it takes up physical space and has transportation and storage inconveniences. Bitcoin is better by having none of these issues which makes it more relatively suitable for the social construct of money (again, it is the social construct of money that is valuable - for which bitcoin happens to be better suited than the current alternatives).')
