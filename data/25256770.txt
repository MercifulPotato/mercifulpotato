Classic cyberpunk was all dark sprawling streets and neon-lit seedy underbellies, led by shadowy faceless corporate execs of austere zaibatsu.<p>Whereas the malefactors of great wealth in our present did not forget the average consumer and instead manipulates our emotions with cutting-edge marketing, algorithmic analysis of our deepest desires, and use of primary colors and comfy fonts. The copy is nonthreatening or hip language. The reality is grim, but the appearance isn&#x27;t. More <i>Brave New World</i> and less <i>1984</i>. More Disney, filtered through Banksy.<p>I think most Gibson cyberpunk failed to capture the banality of the future, because they were fixated on the romantic cowboy-gangster hackers outlaws who lived on the fringes. Among the big names, Neal Stephenson did a great job of it with <i>Snow Crash</i> and <i>The Diamond Age</i> because he remembered that the megacorps had to sell to someone at the end of the day, and had to have shiny customer-facing dross.')
