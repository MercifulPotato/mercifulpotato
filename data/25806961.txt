Automation takes care of 99.9% of it, and some guy handles the 0.01% that&#x27;s exceptional, falls through the cracks, and so on.<p>The problem is when you scale from 100,000 events per day to half a trillion, and your fallback is still basically &quot;some guy&quot;. At ten failures a day, contacting The Guy means sending an email, and maybe sometimes it takes two. At a million failures a day, your only prayer of reaching The Guy is to get to the top of HN, or write a viral Twitter thread.<p>There are some things which are important enough that they can&#x27;t be left up to this formula, and maybe you&#x27;re thinking of those. I&#x27;m not, and I doubt the person you&#x27;re replying to is either.')
