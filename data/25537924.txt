This implies that we are genetically programmed to die.<p>Immortal species may have appeared, but they probably went extinct, because they had to have few offspring to prevent overpopulation.  With fewer offspring, there is less genetic variation, and less ability to adapt to environmental shocks, such as new pathogens.')
