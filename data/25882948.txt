This approach (putting raw binary data into files) is filled with footguns. What if you add, remove or reorder fields? What if your file was externally modified and now doesn&#x27;t match the expected layout? What if the data contains things like file descriptors or pointers that can&#x27;t meaningfully be mapped that way? Even changing the compilation flags can produce binary incompatibilities.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s not sometimes very useful but it&#x27;s tricky and low level enough that some unsafe low level plumbing is, I think, warranted. You have to know what you&#x27;re doing if you decide to go down that route, otherwise you&#x27;re much better off using something like Serde to explicitly handle serialization. There&#x27;s some overhead of course, but 99% of the time it&#x27;s the right thing to do.')
