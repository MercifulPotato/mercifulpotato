A proper definition of free speech - not my definition - is that it is the freedom to speak without interference _from the government_. So fines, jail time or anything else driven by the government is out. This I can agree with to a large extent.<p>Free speech does not, and has never, meant the right to be free of consequences for your speech, or the right to speak anonymously in public, or to have your identity hidden. Free speech does not give you the God-given right to post anything you like to any service or publication. You can’t force the NYT to put your opinion on their home page and you can’t, or at least shouldn’t be able to, force Twitter to spread your lies.<p>And, again in my opinion, if someone does say something harmful then there needs to be accountability. That means that if someone is hurt by someone else’s speech, then the victim should be able to sue or otherwise take action against the perpetrator.<p>Here’s the problem. Sites like Twitter and others can publish anonymous hate speech while hiding behind the CDA. This means neither the anonymous asshole nor the profitable company can be touched, and this is causing huge damage to our society.<p>The solution seems pretty simple. Anonymous speech should be the responsibility of the platform, and subject to civil action against the platform. Speech published by platforms which is not anonymous can and should be the responsibility of the individual making the claims.<p>This simple change would force platforms to moderate all their anonymous content, instead of the current, low cost statistical methods they are obviously using today.<p>Also, it does not mean that speech can’t be published anonymously. It just means that the service must know the details of the writer, and that the anonymity of a user can be uncloaked by a court.<p>Note that this is how “letters to the editor” worked for a very long time.<p>If you like your privacy, then don’t intentionally invade the privacy of others, or otherwise harm them, with your lies.')
