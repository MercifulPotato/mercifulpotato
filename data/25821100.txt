I shipped support for iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 4 without having either of those devices on hand–for the latter, as you probably know, without even recompiling it. None of my personal Macs have a Touch Bar, but that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from writing code for it.<p>It&#x27;s completely fair–actually, it should be <i>expected</i>–that extensions targeting standardized APIs should function correctly regardless of platform. If you&#x27;re coming from a position of trying to incentivize people who largely don&#x27;t care about a tiny, strange platform to begin with, locking them out entirely based on hardware requirements is frankly about the worst thing you could do to drive adoption.')
