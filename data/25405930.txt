Presumably, for most services we’re talking about here the marginal cost of having one user versus ten is probably negligable. It doesn’t seem unlikely to me that if a sevice starts charging, 90% of the users drop off, and thus the revenue per user needs to increase commensurately in order to have the same profits.<p>Of course this is totally made up, so it’s impossible to argue about, but my point is that what you described didn’t necessarily seem out of line to me.')
