Even the source code can&#x27;t tell us that, because we don&#x27;t run the servers.<p>What we do know is that programs like Telegram <i>have to</i> store data about users on their servers, by design. A big difference between the two projects is that Signal is carefully designed to minimize the amount of data the service needs to operate; it&#x27;s why identifiers are phone numbers --- so it can piggyback on your already-existing contact lists, which are kept on your phone.<p>By contrast, other services store, in effect, a durable list of every person you communicate with, usually indexed in a plaintext database.')
