Item(by='black_puppydog', descendants=None, kids=[24882185, 24882542, 24883167, 24884693, 24884219], score=None, time=1603573761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880745, text='The one problem I have with solarpunk is that much of the fiction is simply not that good.\nI think most emblematic of that is maybe Cory Doctorow&#x27;s book &quot;Walkaway&quot;.<p>I have lately come to accept that the book had a huge influence on me; it just keeps coming up in conversation. Well... I bring it up, because it struck a chord, and because it fits well with the conversations I have.<p>But the writing is so.... aaaargh, so shoddy at times. And half of the book is just a brain dump of ideas and projections of current trends in the future, but it&#x27;s just not presented as a good plot line. It&#x27;s very clear that the intention is to wrap some (powerful) ideas into a plot to make it digestible, but it&#x27;s just not that well executed.<p>But as I said, I made my peace with this love-hate relationship I have with the book. I just hope there will be more, better solarpunk art. Something I can actually recommend to friends without it feeling like homework.')
