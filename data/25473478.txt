They say that people taking opioids develop tolerance for them and the meds lose effectiveness over time. This means that people are still in pain, but are now also taking dangerous and debilitating amounts of opioid meds. Their function is worse because of the opioids.<p>Providing talking therapy to these people isn&#x27;t saying that the pain is not real. You saying this <i>causes harm</i> and you need to stop saying it, because you clearly do not understand what&#x27;s happening.<p>When people have long term pain they lose function. They stop doing activities they used to enjoy. Their quality of life plummets. This makes their pain worse. (We know this, there&#x27;s plenty of research.) Talking therapy aims to get people their life back by helping them regain function. They start to learn to live with pain. They get back to doing activities they enjoy. This doesn&#x27;t eliminate pain, but it does lessen the pain and it improves quality of life.<p>You seem to think that &quot;pain free but on opioids&quot; is possible. For most[1] people in long term pain that&#x27;s not possible, because opioids don&#x27;t work like that.<p>[1] <i>most</i>, not <i>all</i>.')
