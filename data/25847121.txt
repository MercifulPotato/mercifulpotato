If I arbitrarily reduce the risk of causing harm, that&#x27;s still reduced risk of harm. Those are good. I value results over consistency. I definitely value results over analysis paralysis, over waiting for a perfection of clarity not available this side of the grave.<p>And as best I know, <i>I do</i> &quot;do this&quot; with all potentially fatal communicable diseases. I get the flu shot every year. I even do it with non-fatal diseases as best I can. When I&#x27;m sick, I stay the hell home. I exercise good hygiene and good food safety.<p>And I have no idea why people don&#x27;t do otherwise. All it takes is valuing others&#x27; health and survival.')
