That&#x27;s why the probability of finding a cluster is higher looking back than forward - most people don&#x27;t get to actually spread the virus.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic&#x2F;616548&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;k-overloo...</a>')
