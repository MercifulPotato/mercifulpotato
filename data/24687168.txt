Faced with something that suddenly stopped working, the developer went on a wild goose chase, first decoding their JWT -- presumably the same one that &quot;used to work&quot; -- then looking for possible framework bugs or misconfiguration, before looking at their own code, the single most likely place that the bug would be. They even linked to <i>select is rarely broken</i> but failed to internalise the main lesson behind it.<p>Whether they squashed their commits or not would make a far smaller difference to the time taken to spot the bug than simply not assuming that it&#x27;s everywhere else than their own code first.')
