Watching surround-sound TV with spacial audio enabled is basically indistinguishable from watching TV with a surround sound system and no headphones, to the point where I have to check to make sure the audio is playing through my headphones and not external speakers.<p>Downside is that it only works with iPhone, iPad and AppleTV 4k. It&#x27;s such an amazing upgrade over my current setup, though, that I&#x27;m planning on upgrading to an AppleTV 4K so that I&#x27;m not limited to using spatial audio on just my iPad.')
