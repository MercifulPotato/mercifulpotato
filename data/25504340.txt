I linked the XKCD comic, but the real data actually looks like that. It doesn&#x27;t matter much if it is 90% or 95% effective, which might be hard to distinguish with this number of cases. But it is easy to say that the vaccine works in general, even without detailed statistics.<p>And more importantly, for the question of safety the whole trial with more than 40,000 people matters, and that is a very large trial.')
