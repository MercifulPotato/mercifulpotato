If you find the terms unconscionable, perhaps you should petition your legislators to change the labor laws (this is where democracy is appropriate).<p>As an aside, I do not understand where the notion that &lt;something&gt; + democracy is always going to be better than &lt;something&gt;. I never would have thought back in college that banding together with my fellow physics majors and demanding what we&#x27;re taught and how we&#x27;re graded would produce better outcomes; I choose my school&#x2F;department because of the reputation resulting from the faculty&#x27;s decisions. I imagine the same goes with most employees at most companies - a lot of engineers want to work at FAANG because of what &lt;ceo&gt; is doing. Democracy works well for things you can&#x27;t opt out of, like society. I doubt Apple products would be as good if Steve Jobs let every engineer into the boardroom.')
