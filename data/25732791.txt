It&#x27;s why we went that way with browserless.io<p>Truth be told selling a small library probably isn&#x27;t enough to make significant money on your product since it isn&#x27;t solving a big enough risk. The risk of forking is fairly low, especially for small to mid sized companies. Larger companies, maybe so since things like security become much more urgent.<p>It&#x27;s hard to separate people from their money, but I feel it becomes a lot easier if it offsets a potential risk they&#x27;re not willing to take. Just my 2 cents.')
