She was a little younger than OP and repeatedly told her doctor how she had symptoms which could potentially be colon cancer but she was repeatedly told not to worry as she was too young and it was probably just haemorrhoids.<p>This went on for about a year I believe. Things got worse and when test were done she found out she had stage 4 cancer and probably only had a few months to live.<p>If you have symptoms which could be cancer regardless of your age insist you have the right tests done to rule it out. Most cancer is very preventable in its early stages.')
