Windows does not use the CGA&#x2F;EGA palette (unless started in EGA mode, which is a thing that can be done)<p>The Windows 16-color palette is based on pure, fully saturated colors (i.e. red is 255&#x2F;0&#x2F;0, lime green is 0&#x2F;255&#x2F;0, cyan is 0&#x2F;255&#x2F;255, etc) while the CGA&#x2F;EGA hardware palette is a little bit softer and less saturated, as in your Wikipedia link.<p>It also seems like your screenshot does not represent the true 16-color palette that Windows 3.x actually used. I have no idea what&#x27;s going on with PCJS or what manner of weird graphics driver it&#x27;s emulating but this is not what Windows 3 generally looked like if you had a VGA card. The first row does not have the correct color values, and the second row should be visibly darker. The difference between the lighter and darker blue is very small in your screenshot, for instance. This is not correct.<p>This screenshot shows the true default Windows VGA palette (in true color mode, so the rightmost columns are not dithered): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YR37uSO.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YR37uSO.png</a><p>EDIT: I had to investigate. Yes, PCJS is doing some kind of weird color mangling and does not display the real color values. You can see in this screenshot I just took that what Windows running in PCJS considers to be pure green is actually not that. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SpUJI8x.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;SpUJI8x.png</a><p>EDIT 2: For the sake of completeness, the following screenshot shows Windows 3.0 running in actual EGA mode. This was a very rare sight even back in the day since most hardware powerful enough to run Windows 3 satisfactorily would have had VGA&#x2F;SVGA. Regardless, it is doable. You can see that the titlebar color is very different from the default VGA one. The default EGA fonts are also quite different and are a rare sight. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;6245486&#x2F;41811800-6b2074e2-76cb-11e8-8b09-d0950eeded65.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;6245486&#x2F;41811800-6...</a>')
