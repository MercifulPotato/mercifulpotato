Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[25498990], score=None, time=1608575201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25495610, text='TBH, this is a point I struggle with. TLA+ is different from programming languages because  TLA+ is a language for writing mathematics [1] and mathematics is different from programming. Internalising that -- and learning how to describe things with mathematics -- is the challenge, not learning new syntax. In fact, I think that anything that makes simple mathematics look superficially similar to programming makes learning TLA+ more difficult, not less. But either way, once you&#x27;ve learned how to use mathematics to describe systems, wouldn&#x27;t you rather use syntax that&#x27;s as close to standard mathematical notation as possible? If physicists and engineers use standard mathematical notation to write mathematics even when describing the behaviour of some, say, spring system, why would programmers want to use a special notation when writing mathematics?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- I think it&#x27;s cool to show how to express TLA+ with Z3&#x27;s Python API, perhaps it even helps some people understand what TLA+ formulas mean, but I disagree that it makes using TLA easier. I realise this is a matter of pedagogy, and preference might be individual, but that&#x27;s my point of view.<p>P.S.<p>This is beside the point, but I&#x27;ve been programming for ~30 years, and while I&#x27;ve programmed professionally in quite a few languages (more than ten), I don&#x27;t know Python (or JavaScript; at least not well). Neither do most programmers I work with. There&#x27;s no doubt Python is among the best known programming languages, and millions of programmers know it, but many more than you might expect don&#x27;t (just as I was surprised to realise there are programmers who don&#x27;t know C or Java)! IMO, TLA+ is easier to learn, at least as far as syntax and core modules go, than <i>any</i> programming language.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;tlaplus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;enencr&#x2F;yet_another_example_that_tla_is_math_not&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;tlaplus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;enencr&#x2F;yet_another...</a>')
