They couldn&#x27;t help me directly but they maintain a national network of attorneys that are vetted and specialize in all things digital. It never came to actual courtroom litigation in my instance but we talked and she agreed to help me pro-bono (which was amazing to hear). I don&#x27;t think I should get into more specifics but I will say the demand letter was so obviously bonkers she said she&#x27;d gladly slap down their lawyer and (if needed) represent me if they chose to take things further. Luckily simply calling their bluff was all it took and they backed off immediately. So maybe look to the EFF for a referral - It might not be free but if you need legal help as a code creator they may be able to offer guidance.')
