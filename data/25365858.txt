Let&#x27;s not pretend that his campaign is actually reacting to sincere revelations of fraud. They were always going to dispute the election if they lost it. So many people claim evidence of massive fraud and yet every case I can find gets laughed out of court, often by Trump appointed judges, despite <i>massive</i> incentives to show that evidence in court. It has gotten to the point where conspiracy theorists are literally referring to nonexistent state counties in their court filings. Frankly, it is a conspiracy theory.')
