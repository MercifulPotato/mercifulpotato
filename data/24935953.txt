Asking for an article to be narrowed down in scope is a perfectly good suggestion as an editorial board, especially in news articles where too much stuff can make the article ineffective. Furthermore, the editor is nothing less than professional&#x2F;polite, while the response is full of wild accusations like &quot;What&#x27;s happening here is obvious: you know that you can&#x27;t explicitly say you don&#x27;t want to publish the article because it raises questions about the candidate you and all other TI Editors want very much to win the election in 5 days.&quot;<p>It looks like a tantrum to me.')
