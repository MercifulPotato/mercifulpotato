Thanks for sharing your experience!<p>In Australia we only have access to the Libre 1. Which is both frustrating as I’d like my girlfriend to have the ease of the Libre 2&#x2F;3 (bluetooth etc) but it’s tolerable given the more open nature of the first iteration where we double the function life - essentially halving the high cost.<p>I’m looking at grabbing a Bubble glucose monitor (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bubblan.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bubblan.org&#x2F;</a>) that adds bluetooth functionality to the Libre 1 amongst other monitoring etc.<p>Have you looked into OpenAPS &#x2F; AndroidAPS to move away from the Dexcom? Still learning so this may be an overly simplistic question.')
