If you could stick to &#x27;simple foods&#x27;, like the author advocates, it still works.<p>The reason why so many people dismiss it is that from the 1980&#x27;s onward food was starting to get designed for overeating, and labeling requirements were starting to be gamed so the calories listed on these designed foods (and that includes nearly everything today) no longer have as high straightforward correlation with the &#x27;calories&#x27; measured in &#x27;simple&#x27; foods of old.')
