Ideally we&#x27;d slowly unwind the debt spiral in non-crisis times by raising interest rates and letting the various asset bubbles deflate (ie young people could buy houses again). Failing that it would be a long term benefit if the treadmill were allowed to lock up via defaults, although it would be painful in the immediate future.<p>Realistically there&#x27;s no political will to do any of this, but my overall point remains about the overarching structure of our society not being one based on voluntary association. Insisting individuals have a choice while they do not is Orwellian tyranny.')
