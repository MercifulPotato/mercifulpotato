Like most chit-chatter at most parties. I could show up to the party, get on a soapbox, do my monologue, then leave. But I won&#x27;t make any friends or impact that way, even if these parties is where the audience is.<p>Good point. However, making friends&#x2F;impact is not what everyone wants from twitter.<p>Some people just want a place to put their thoughts out, and don&#x27;t really care what anyone else is doing.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d like to apologize for being overly aggressive in my first comment. That was uncalled for. This chain clearly has started a discussion, for which I thank you.')
