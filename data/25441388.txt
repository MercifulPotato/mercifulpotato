C++20 is amazing, there has been so much incredible work put in my some many amazing engineers.<p>Yes there are competitors to C++, and we all love an underdog story, but I personally find it to be the only language with this level of expressiveness, without sacrificing complete control.\nYou can write JS-style, with auto and other zero-runtime-cost abstractions, or you can write plain C with function overloading and templates.<p>C++20 is an incredibly exciting milestone, and I congratulate the standards commitee on every little milestone. Great work, guys!')
