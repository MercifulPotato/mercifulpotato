I&#x27;m building a SMT-based superoptimizer for SIMD sequences that is still pretty stupid (it can only handle &quot;lanewise&quot; SIMD i.e. some op on each lane, it can only do AVX2, it can only handle arbitrary graphs up to 4 instructions before it gets too slow).<p>And yet... it concocted a good chunk of a PSHUFB based pattern matcher (effectively &quot;shufti&quot; from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;intel&#x2F;hyperscan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;intel&#x2F;hyperscan</a>) that I invented in 2009. If I could push further on this and scale from 4 instructions handled in about 45 minutes (single core, though it scales well) up to 5 instructions (currently takes a <i>month</i> of single-core search time) to 6-7 instructions (I don&#x27;t even know!), this system would be able to come up with the full version of shufti, a &quot;quite commercially relevant&quot; SIMD sequence that I invented in 2009.<p>Not saying that sequence was the cleverest thing ever, but it seemed novel enough, and to have a machine just spew it out when given the black box description of what it&#x27;s meant to achieve... it would be pretty cool.<p>All I need is a few orders of magnitude worth of search optimizations. That&#x27;s OK - when I started, my superoptimizer took a couple days to handle 4 instructions, so it might still happen.')
