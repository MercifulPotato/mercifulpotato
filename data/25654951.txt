Your experience boondocking in National Parks should guide you.<p>In terms of safety, it&#x27;s not a place where anyone &quot;looking for action&quot; is going to hang out. It&#x27;s a long way from anywhere and even at peak capacity mostly empty. That&#x27;s my take on most wilderness areas in the US and the only locals at Big Bend are in Boquillas and dependent on a good tourist experience.<p>All with the caveat that I&#x27;m an old man not a young female.<p>Anyway, the biggest dangers are the usual suspects: exposure, dehydration, and falls. It&#x27;s remote and dry with temperature extremes. The average worst event is a flat tire from taking Old Maverick Road without truck tires on your vehicle.')
