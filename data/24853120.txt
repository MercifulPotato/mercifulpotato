It was a markup language claiming not to be a markup language.<p>The acronym <i>literally</i> stands for &quot;Yet Another Markup Language&quot;.<p>Edit: To comment something less pedantic, the article doesn&#x27;t really go into anything specific it doesn&#x27;t like about it. It&#x27;s sort of like when my brother comments about how awful the vim home web page looks. It&#x27;s still a good web page. I don&#x27;t know why people are commenting about aesthetics in YAML if they can&#x27;t pinpoint a particular functionality problem.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not blind to the many warts and weird edge cases and dozens of different ways you can specify a string in YAML. I hope something more elegant comes along that&#x27;s still not as draconian as JSON (simple, elegant, hard to write strings, no comments).')
