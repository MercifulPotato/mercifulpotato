It&#x27;s true because we have nukes. Full stop.<p>Not really? Nukes only come into play with great power wars, and there&#x27;s not really any fewer great power wars in the past century than the century before that. Post Napoleonic Wars, the only great power wars (in chronological order) are the Crimean War, Austro-Prussian War, Franco-Prussian War, World War I, Russian Revolution&#x2F;Russian Civil War, and World War II, with the three 20th century wars all being far longer and more violent than the 19th century wars.<p>What has dropped down considerably is the lesser wars, be they localized conflicts such as the Ecuador-Peruvian War of 1941, civil wars such as the Spanish Civil War or American Civil War, wars between great powers and lesser powers such as the Russo-Japanese War, colonial wars such as the Boer War or the Indian Wars, revolutions such as the Revolutions of 1848. Of these, the only conflict that may have been avoided by nukes is an India&#x2F;Pakistan conflict--note that Israel&#x27;s acquisition of nuclear weapons hasn&#x27;t forestalled further conflicts with Arab countries (notably the Israel-Lebanon in my lifetime).')
