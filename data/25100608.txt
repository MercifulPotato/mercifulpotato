I decided to start doing something else instead (teaching people how to program). I&#x27;m still doing programming, but only as a hobby, or on projects I pick. My stress levels dropped significantly, and I work much less for only a 20% decrease in pay.<p>That being said this COVID situation is starting to take a toll. I&#x27;m only meeting with friends in open spaces and with 1.5 meters between us. No lan parties, and stuff like that. I really hope that next year we&#x27;ll get a vaccine and we can return to a more normal lifestyle because I&#x27;m starting to feel like a pit bull with half of its mouth sewn shut.')
