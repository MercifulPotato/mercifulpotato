A mandate under heaven. All Russian speaking peoples. The USA took the opposite approach. We have the luxury of the New World, something all powerful people in history blundered and missed. What&#x27;s the minimum we have to do? If people are going to tell other people what to do, which is government in practicality, some things are unavoidable, like the sun rising in the east or water running down hill or not watering hot horses.<p>Self evidence is the true purpose of the Bill of Rights. It&#x27;s not some luxury or a convenience. You can misspeak. You can&#x27;t tell others how to speak. You can&#x27;t disarm your own enemies. You can&#x27;t disarm mine. If you are perfect, no need to tell other people what to do. Everyone would just say and do what you do.<p>Marxism is a command economy of patronage from vassal states. Their economic numbers are orders. They resort to barbarity and animalism to meet them, churning people. The powerful get so many billions. The powerless pay, even if they have to smash people with tanks or resort to cannibalism, which was a thing not long ago.<p>The first purpose of the law is to limit the violence, not create it. That goes back to civilization itself, Lex Talionis. Without it, humans no longer are at the top of the planet&#x27;s food chain. Humans no longer have access to paradise. Humans are really no different than animals and only know the lash.<p>The last purpose of the law is that the law applies to everyone, or else there is no law. A law for the powerful. A law for the powerless. People gain and loose power. The law is completely arbitrary and we&#x27;re back in a free for all at the tree line.<p>The best thing a nation state can do today is to stay out of it. Shut things down. Walk away. You really can&#x27;t tell people what to do. Getting involved only makes it worse. If you&#x27;re not doing it yourself, you&#x27;re just running your mouth about how great you are, a glorified People&#x27;s magazine puff piece.')
