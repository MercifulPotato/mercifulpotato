There were obviously teams simply goal chasing for prizes. Which I felt the organizers pushed so hard for that it went against the &#x27;spirit&#x27; of hackathons.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of personal gain to be found being an OSS developer (especially in a group setting just outletting creatively with other talented people) without directly making the motivation prizes&#x2F;money the end goal.<p>No one is against rewarding OSS developers as much as possible. I&#x27;m certainly not and think every successful company using OSS software, aka all of them, should have a wing donating to projects. But I am against watering it all down to some narrative of OSS developers somehow being exploited by commercial companies.')
