That is why I&#x27;ve most minimal config and just using to have some &#x27;linux&#x27; time to time.<p>What I use is `docker context` command or DOCKER_HOST=ssh:&#x2F;&#x2F;user@host pattern.<p>env-var is more convenient for &#x27;ephemeral&#x27; hosts. (It uses your own SSH-key to connect to host) And for static hosts (like staging machines) I use context.<p>Plus it uses native SSH client, so it supports ProxyJump or JumpServer or Bastion Host, forwarding, session-reuse, YubiKeys &amp; whatnot.<p>So, I&#x27;d rather to have client on my laptop, having 1 or 2 medium sized hosts in Digitalocean, AWS, whatever place. (Some providers even gives you docker hosts with ssh access, like civo.com - disclaimer: I just started using them last weekend...)<p>PS: You cannot &#x27;mount&#x27; your local folder to remote host. But you can &#x27;build&#x27; your local folder on remote host. (Thanks to BuildKit &#x2F; DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1)<p>Edit: I remembered that I&#x27;ve installed (compiled actually) docker-cli to my Android phone using Termux.\nYou can&#x27;t run daemon at all. The client gives some warnings at the start saying some things not right. But it works with those methods &amp; variables...<p>Hint:<p><pre><code>    $ go get -u -v github.com&#x2F;docker&#x2F;cli&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;docker\n    # profit...</code></pre>')
