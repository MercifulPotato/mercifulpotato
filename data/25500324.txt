Total down time was about 15 sec which for our application was acceptable. The build time was a lot longer than that (3-4 minutes), but that happened before the existing services were stopped so it didn&#x27;t affect downtime. If any of the services failed to build, the deploy was aborted and the existing services were left running uninterrupted.<p>The deploy tool was home grown and was part of the repo. Having everything in a mono repo was really important because it dramatically reduced the number of permutations of interfaces that had to be tested down to one.<p>These trade-offs might not be right for everyone, but for us they were fine and allowed us to create a highly efficient development environment.')
