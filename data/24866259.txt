I don&#x27;t know how much that is, but I&#x27;d imagine in addition to those $2 it would likely add another 30% or so to the total cost (someone more knowledgeable please chime in with a better estimate).  Of course that&#x27;s assuming you&#x27;re operating at Uber&#x27;s scale (there are still overhead costs), but since prices go up you aren&#x27;t, so now the prices need to go up even more!<p>I don&#x27;t know where the equilibrium point is, I just know it&#x27;s higher than what Uber is charging.  My extremely hand-wavy guess is rides would need to cost around 50% more.')
