It&#x27;s also in 256 colors, versus Treister&#x27;s images from 1995 done when the maximum number of colors was 32. Unless you had a paint program capable of Hold And Modify mode, which DPaint was not at the time. (And Extra Half-Brite did not exist until the A2000 and A500 came out in 1987.)<p>So let&#x27;s have a more equal comparison: here&#x27;s an image from Defender of the Crown (1986). <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;artist&#x2F;JimSachs&#x2F;DefenderOfTheCrown_Normans.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;artist&#x2F;JimSachs&#x2F;DefenderOfTheCrown...</a><p>And here&#x27;s an image from Avril Harrison in 1985, which might have been one of the demo images that shipped with DPaint - I know several of her works were on the disc: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;year&#x2F;1985&#x2F;AH_Waif.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;year&#x2F;1985&#x2F;AH_Waif.html</a><p>And of course how about Harrison&#x27;s 1985 image of Tutankhamun&#x27;s death mask, which was both on the disc and on the cover of the box? <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;year&#x2F;1985&#x2F;AH_KingTut.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amiga.lychesis.net&#x2F;year&#x2F;1985&#x2F;AH_KingTut.html</a>')
