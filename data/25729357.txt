It&#x27;s at most a minute with the right tool (angle grinder), and the bike itself is left unaffected.<p>A tracking device though would be embedded inside the frame itself, and thus not be removable without cutting up (and thus likely destroying) the frame. The frame is the single-most valuable component on a bike.')
