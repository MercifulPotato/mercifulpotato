My knowledge too comes from dabbling with gamedev, programming&#x2F;hacking underpowered hardware (90&#x27;s consoles), and spending (too much) time on open-source projects where performance optimization mattered.<p>I don&#x27;t expect my colleagues to have the same kind of experience, but I would expect someone presenting as a &quot;senior frontend engineer&quot; to understand the GC impact of allocating thousands of objects in a tight computation loop; or of doing heavy computations &#x2F; updating the DOM inside a mouse move event handler.<p>On the other hand, Slack is worth $27.7B and is still selling a product that has frustrating multi-second delays on standard keyboard interactions, so I don&#x27;t know. Maybe I am really just expecting too much.')
