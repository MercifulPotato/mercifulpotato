The entire basis for &quot;we should understand that ideas go unchallenged&quot; is because a Vice article told you that? An article that doesn&#x27;t do anything other than cite a few instances where JR lets interviewees go unchallenged? Honestly, that article is terrible. I would expect something more conclusive  to say something like &quot;we fact checked 100 of JRE&#x27;s guests and found 47 of them to be factually incorrect in what they were saying&quot;<p>I mean I generally agree that he doesn&#x27;t necessarily challenge his interviewees but to say you don&#x27;t learn something from JRE is kind of off IMO.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s besides the point because I&#x27;ve both read the book and watched the podcast. Additionally I&#x27;ve checked some of the sources and they&#x27;re consistent with what the author has communicated. In a world of sound bites, I&#x27;m simply offering that this soundbite is better than single sentence headliners but not as good as reading a whole book or even further, reading a book and every source.')
