I&#x27;ve seen people buy macs even after seeing all the flaws because it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re used to and don&#x27;t want to exert energy learning a new OS and environment. Apple used to make great products and I think people still cling on to that thought, even though their quality has been degrading these past years. Something needs to be 10x better (or at least perceived that way) for people to switch and switching to a new OS for them is probably like a 1x improvement so not worth the time cost.')
