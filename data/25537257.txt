Item(by='spacedcowboy', descendants=None, kids=[25537406], score=None, time=1608913127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535965, text='<i>shrug</i> I work at Apple<p>I’ve just moved out of an R&amp;D group, and yes, there’s things I won’t talk about because Apple pay me very well to keep their “surprise and delight”, well, <i>just that</i><p>There’s no culture of fear though, like some are saying, it’s just that there are projects I’ve spent years bringing up from bare bones, then there’s the time it takes to turn that into a product that Apple will sell. I’m willing to wait for that to happen, good news can always wait.<p>Now I work in icloud. I’m the DRI for privacy in my group, which is something that Apple take <i>very</i> seriously, it’s a fun job although there’s a lot of “it’d be really cool to do that, we could offer X, but we need a good way to keep the users data private under circumstance Y, so we can’t”. There’s going to be some interesting work along those lines in the future.<p>In the past I’ve worked in software (Aperture, Final Cut), and on technologies (precursor to Spotlight, and then the mechanisms behind Spotlight itself).<p>None of the above is anything that Apple would have any problem with me talking about, though they’d obviously not want me to disclose anything in the future that I might be working on. I’ve also worked for the Ministry of Defence, and frankly no company I’ve ever worked for has the security of a government agency like that. To compare the two situation borders on the absurd.<p>I like the various jobs I’ve had at Apple, it’s the longest I’ve ever stayed at any company, even ones I owned! I’m in the fortunate position of being able to choose where I work, and I choose Apple. That’s the strongest statement I can make.')
