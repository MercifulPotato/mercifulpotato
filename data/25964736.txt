This array_is_list function doesn&#x27;t change things much: I already have the same implemented in many of my projects. The point is that I shouldn&#x27;t do that: I just should use a typehint the same way as I&#x27;d do it with array or MyCustomClass.<p>Of course there is Ds\\Sequence, but having it as a part of some relatively obscure library isn&#x27;t the same as having it as a part of a language, with syntax as simple as [1,2,3]. Actually, I&#x27;m not even sure: does it have as good performance, as &quot;arrays&quot; do? I never tested.')
