Item(by='dmitriid', descendants=None, kids=[25361441], score=None, time=1607532246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360162, text='&gt; enterprise products would rather get more features out over micro optimizations.<p>I&#x27;ve been using logs, bigquery, dataflow, and a smattering of other products pretty regularly for the past few years.<p>Are these products getting &quot;more features&quot;? Hardly. Well, dataflow deprecates minor SDK versions every month, so you have to run twice as fast just to stay in one place.<p>Instead, they have been redesigning the logs interface with fancy animations. And for the longest time ever they <i>removed</i> features from it like streaming logs.<p>Meanwhile the minor stupid things like displaying dates in MM&#x2F;DD&#x2F;YYYY format in date pickers, using AM&#x2F;PM for time? Oh, they stay on. Graphs that work half of the time and you can never know if they are broken, cached, or just don&#x27;t work? Oh, they stay on.<p>It&#x27;s Google&#x27;s systemic organisational failure: they suck at UIs, they don&#x27;t care, and they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to maintain features because &quot;oooh, shiny new thing looks better on my resume&quot;.')
