I don&#x27;t know that he would even agree with it. It was just the first example I recalled of somebody arguing that a technical-debt-driven rewrite killed Netscape.<p>A total rewrite, if done well, is going to take less resources and way less calendar time than a refactor-and-cleanup approach done equivalently well. That&#x27;s what I mean by quick. Was Netscape&#x27;s rewrite done well? I doubt it. But there&#x27;s no reason to think their refactor-and-clean up would have been any better. Which again leads back to my point: they were probably fucked either way at that point. Note that in the ensuing years, nobody has made major direct revenue from selling a browser.<p>The thing that has fundamentally changed versus 20 years ago is major advances in dealing with existing code. Back then, writing tests was extraordinarily rare. Now if it&#x27;s not the norm, at least it&#x27;s common. Things like continuous integration are common. Builds and tests are much faster, and the amount of computing power available to an individual dev is hugely improved. The tooling advances are incredible as well, from debuggers to languages to runtimes to IDEs with built-in understanding and refactoring of the code. All of this makes incremental cleanups much easier that was possible in 1999 with a 1994-era mishmash of C and C++.')
