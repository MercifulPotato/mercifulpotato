I don&#x27;t need to have a particular use case. I view as detrimental the very action of giving money to someone who wants to decide how I use the hardware I bought.<p>&gt; Any mac user could have seen this transition coming many years ago, and given up their platform of choice then on that prospect, but what good would that have done them? They wouldn&#x27;t have got to enjoy anything.<p>This could easily devolve into a &quot;to Mac or not&quot; type of discussion which I don&#x27;t want delve into, but I&#x27;ve personally never used a Mac (I have tried it) and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m missing out because of it. Certainly the freedom to run any software and not be beholden to a large corporate interest is more important to me.<p>&gt; Yes conceivably Apple is setting some precedent that other manufacturers could follow, but in the previous example Apple is also just pushing you to buy their products instead.<p>Yes, precedent, but also increased market share if they were to become more popular. One day, an alternative might not exist if we do not vote financially early enough. Therefore, my immediate urge is to say: no, I do not want to participate in this scheme. Make your hardware open or I will not buy it.')
