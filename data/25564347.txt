The tape customers transfer everything over to the new generation every 2 to 3 years, so it&#x27;s never tested and none of the customers really care.<p>You also only get a couple hundred writes to a tape in it&#x27;s lifetime.  That includes bulk appends as the stress from seeking is a major factor of what kills them.  They really need to be treated as WORO media, bulk, the whole 12TB or what have you at once.  Not a great fit for home use.')
