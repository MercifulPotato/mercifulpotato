If you live in a developing economy, the number of $500k equivalent jobs is likely not high, and at least for the countries I&#x27;ve visited, they are often roles at multi-nationals with foreigners at the top (and not all that accessible to locals).<p>Similarly, your potential investments for retirement savings can be quite limited.  We&#x27;re quite spoiled in the west to have massive stock markets with tens of thousands of stable, profitable companies.  And a regulatory framework which means the chance you buy a stock and find out the entire company is a fraud is relatively low.  I&#x27;ve heard from folks in some developing countries that they&#x27;d never put money in their own stock market - the chance of losing everything is way too high.<p>For developing countries, you often have a young, expanding population, and 7% GDP growth in one year wouldn&#x27;t be seen as abnormal.  Small businesses become a great way to get in on the growth (the market is often highly fragmented, so competition isn&#x27;t that fierce) and businesses are a much more accessible way to wealth than any corporate job.  The other avenue I&#x27;ve seen is real estate.  In the SE Asian countries I&#x27;ve been in (the ones growing quickly), real estate is even more of a ticket to wealth than in the US.  Seems like they can never build enough and in the big cities, prices aren&#x27;t that different than non-coastal US ($100k+ USD), which is shocking considering the median salary is 1&#x2F;10th that of the US.')
