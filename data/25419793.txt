I&#x27;d rather 10 year old timmy see sexual content instead of terminator.<p>I&#x27;m most likely in the minority - but I&#x27;m also convinced that I&#x27;m living in a clown world where our society tolerates and encourages senseless pain and violence from the very beginning (through routine male circumcision of hundreds of millions as just a single example), so being in the minority makes me believe that my chances of acting ethically are higher, not lower.<p>Basically, porn is far less bad than violence from a very early age.')
