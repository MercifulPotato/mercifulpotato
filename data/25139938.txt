Some folks have associated this sort of thing with claustrophobia as well.<p>That said, we spent a few thousand dollars insulating and sealing our home so that we did not need HVAC assisted climate control. Part of that included finding ways to exchange the house air with outside air so that during the summer months we could pull in cool air at night to lower the house temperature, seal it up when the Sun came up, and then remain cool all day. Similarly with bringing in warmth during the day in winter and minimizing the temperature fall during the evening. This is not particularly great for minimizing COVID in one&#x27;s home.')
