For instance, the reaction this article to the author&#x27;s friends disinterest isn&#x27;t for the author to question their own beliefs, but to complain about their friends not seeing the truth.<p>I&#x27;m often left with the impression that discussion of biases for many ironically becomes a way to reinforce biases. I&#x27;ve even seen people argue as much - &quot;I&#x27;m aware of my biases, and you&#x27;re not, which is why I&#x27;m correct, and you&#x27;re wrong.&quot;')
