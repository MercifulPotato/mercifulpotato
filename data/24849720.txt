It&#x27;s just like DevOps in the sense that it&#x27;s a corporate efficiency strategy, but it&#x27;s never seen as all that necessary. Execs just see it as another Six Sigma, something to banter about at the golf club. And nobody outside of sysadmins and managers really get it at all.<p>I think the more companies rely on technology, the more screwed they are, because they don&#x27;t realize how much harder it is to run a business dependent on technology. The fact that SRE exists proves that, I think. The system is by default a garbage fire, because by default you can&#x27;t push back on product in order to fix your tech debt. Most other businesses seem to grasp the concept that they need to perform maintenance on their machines or they won&#x27;t be in business for long, but as soon as it&#x27;s &quot;the magical box with the 0s and 1s inside&quot;, they pretend it doesn&#x27;t require long term investment or a different strategy.')
