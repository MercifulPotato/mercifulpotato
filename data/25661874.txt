Item(by='astrobe_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609964580, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659483, text='I somewhat disagree with the way he connects simplicity and cleverness.<p>I once had to explain the behavior of a particular subsystem. It was governed by a bunch of simple rules, but their combination created a complex behavior. This was similar to social insect colonies, where components (eg. ants) are driven by relatively simple rules, but the whole system exhibits remarkable &quot;emergent behavior&quot;.<p>What takes cleverness is to anticipate, predict, understand,explain the global complex behavior from the simple rules. If someone can predict what comes out from cellular automatons like in the <i>game of life</i>, I am amazed. <i>Simple is not easy</i> (no, sorry Rich, following your simple advice is not that easy either). Simple is not always easy to understand, even less so easy to do. That&#x27;s why complexity tends to accumulate.<p>At the risk of being wronged, I would say that being comfortable with complexity is a form laziness. I belong to the messy type of person. I believe I am that way because I can rely on a good long term memory: because of that, I can yield to laziness and not put away things where they belong when I should. Being able to handle complexity is a great quality, but not being discomforted by complexity is like not being ashamed by your messy home.<p>When you make the effort to really simplify, under the favorable circumstances (like in hobby projects, where you can afford to move goalposts a bit), you can make complexity collapse - not by its own weight, for once. I understand that the author emphasis teamwork and communication so he gives this kind of John Wood&#x27;s &quot;<i>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live</i>&quot; justification for fighting complexity, but preventing complexity from collapsing by its own weight, crushing a product in the process, is to me on equal grounds.')
