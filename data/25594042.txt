If you&#x27;ve developing an OS or web browser or game engine you&#x27;re going to be having to think about memory management very carefully in any event and dealing with Rust&#x27;s lifetimes is just formalizing the work you&#x27;d be doing anyways.  But most applications aren&#x27;t optimized that heavily and as long as you don&#x27;t have a memory leak or an algorithmic pessimization you don&#x27;t have to worry about performance in most cases and having a garbage collector is saving you a lot of work.')
