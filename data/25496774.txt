Apple or Google can turn a $500k total compensation package for an employee into $2M&#x2F;year or more in revenue, so they&#x27;ll keep snapping up people and dragging wages up.  Facebook doesn&#x27;t even bring people on to a specific team, they know that coders are so valuable that they&#x27;ll hire as many as they can and just find things for them to do.<p>Even at the low end, six months of tooling work from a $100k coder can often put a handful of $50k&#x2F;year white collar employees permanently out of work (or make them twice as productive as before).  If one company doesn&#x27;t realize that, another eventually will.  It&#x27;s not too tough to pull in ~50-100k&#x2F;year running a SaaS business or freelancing<p>Things in the USA are really broken in the retail sector.
