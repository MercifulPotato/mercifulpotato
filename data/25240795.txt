In its name, people refuse when they want to accept, say what is not meant, express what is not felt, invite when it is not intended, replace bad news with false hope. By doing so, they try to say what they “wished it were” – without ever admitting that it isn’t.</i><p>Maybe it’s my Americanism, but I’m absolutely happy this is <i>not</i> how it works here. “Yes is yes and no is no” works better for me.')
