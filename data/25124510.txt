Every time the discussion comes up here we see people who say they like targeted advertising.<p>Apple wants to exclude other mechanisms and have an opt-in mechanism to support this 20%. They are one step away from making it opt-in but were delayed by political pressure from Facebook.<p>If Ad Tracking companies improve their practices, perhaps they can persuade more people to opt-in.<p>Apple has reached this point by slowly eliminating other sources of fingerprinting from their apis, and adding rules insisting that IDFA be the only identifier used.<p>The <i>only</i> issue here is that IDFA is not yet opt-in.  Otherwise, Apple is way ahead of the game.  All other platforms allow some kind of fingerprinting.')
