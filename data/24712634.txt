Just ask people, would you prefer 1 door or 2 doors.  I&#x27;ve never understood how expanding it to 100 or 1000 doors is simplier than asking &quot;which is better odds 1&#x2F;3rds or 2&#x2F;3rds.&quot;<p>I also dont believe the original intent of the question was ever meant to be ambiguous with regard to whether he had knowledge of the goat door or whether he chose at random.  The intent was for him to have prior knowledge or impeccable luck, and the wordsmithing of the question came later as, in my opinion, a failed rebuttal to the simplicity of the question.  The question might have been worded to not be immediately obvious, but it was not intended to have different correct outcomes depending on interpretation.')
