I mean, there are entire sites like udemy where amateurs teach amateurs things they’ll never use in a real job, and that place, and others like it, seems to be doing just fine. Hell, every PACKT book ever written was worth more as blank paper.<p>Why do I care? I’m an external examiner, sometimes I need to read some of these god awful books to see what students are expected to know. I’m not sure why professors ever stray from the true CS classics, but they unfortunately do. Especially at the academy level.')
