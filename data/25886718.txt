At low speeds engine noise and braking are predominant, and the former for electric is actually a problem because people are used to hearing the sound of ICE cars when judging to cross the street.<p>The worst bit is that sound walls, at least the ones deployed in America, do not even really fix the problem, because they can reflect sound (so they may reduce immediate area noise but increase it farther away). You would probably want something pretty much like a tunnel.')
