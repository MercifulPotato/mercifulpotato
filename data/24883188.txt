Lots of the problems he talks about involve people very underlevereged in the market and incapable of making decisions both because of an unequal distribution of information and&#x2F;or capability.<p>So maybe we can solve the capability problem by giving everyone enough cash to allow them to make market decisions not solely based on survival, but also based on things like moral value. For example, people could more sustainably make purchases based on things like logging, spying, data protection or even allow someone to move from one rental property with an overzealous landlord to another without being captive to the whims of the owner out of circumstance. The monetary threshold is arguable and having the capacity to make non-binary market decisions when capable doesn&#x27;t mean that people will -- most that are capable of voting with their wallet today still often don&#x27;t. This wouldn&#x27;t solve those human problems, but in many markets I feel we&#x27;re reaching a point where many people are not just unwilling to make pro-consumer decisions, they&#x27;re incapable.<p>My second point, mandatory information disclosure, is kind of a necessary component to a functioning capitalist market. Consumers can&#x27;t make informed market decisions without information from the market. Forcing correct information disclosure of one kind or another allows consumers to compare services. Sure this doesn&#x27;t solve problems with what should be mandated or &quot;natural flavors&quot;, etc, but the more correct information consumers have, the more likely they will be able to make the best market decision, be that ingredients, certifications or schematics.')
