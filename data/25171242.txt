My own uncle passed from a cancer which was diagnosed as non-aggressive by a rural for profit hospital yet later rediagnised as extremely aggressive at a more sophisticated facility 2 years later shortly before his death. Geography and demographics create provincialism, organizational structure obviously has an impact on how we respond to that difficult problem but regardless of if a healthcare system is for profit or not, a nation is simply not going to commit the same resources to rural areas.<p>To my mind, the more surprising thing isn&#x27;t how different the problems of American and Canadian provincial care are but how much the same they are.<p>Regarding<p>&gt; Governments are not this sophisticated or operationally nimble unfortunately.<p>I don&#x27;t know that this is true. Governments collect and act on a lot of public health information.')
