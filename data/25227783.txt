This is often bidirectional, with the EU recognising PDOs (by other names) of other countries.<p>The sticky thing here —and likely the reason they also have trademarks— is this isn&#x27;t just an AOC-style geographical label like Champagne, Grana Padano isn&#x27;t a place, it means &quot;Big grainy [cheese] from  Po Valley&quot;.<p>But I think this guy is rolling over far too fast. If the internet can crowdfund honeymoons and holidays for otherwise well-off people, they should be able to buy this guy enough representation to stand up and not encourage companies to attack people for just saying the names of their trademarks. He&#x27;s not selling their product under their name, he&#x27;s not encouraging others to sell their product under their name, it&#x27;s just a few people making cheese.')
