It&#x27;s possible that the &quot;solution&quot; just makes things worse&#x2F;complicates implementing better, longer-term solutions.<p>The &quot;_only_ way they know to help&quot; part especially raises red flags, because it&#x27;s exactly that narrow-mindedness and ignorance of context and alternatives that leads to &quot;if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; thinking. A big problem with &quot;technosolutionism&quot;, as the article calls it, is precisely people forcing complex social, political, economic, cultural, etc. problems into the technical paradigms with which they are familiar, and then attempting to solve those problems as if they were technical or engineering issues.')
