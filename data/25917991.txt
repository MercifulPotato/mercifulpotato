That&#x27;s not meant sarcastically; smart people are able to rationalize away even the most extreme cognitive dissonance. I don&#x27;t blame you. Looking at a situation from a viewpoint opposed to one&#x27;s own is quite literally physiologically painful, and who needs that.<p>There&#x27;s also nothing to be gained by doing so. Most likely your family and friends and co-workers, given your area, are of a similar mindset, so there&#x27;s no social capital to be gained. It&#x27;s unlikely that it will net you a better job or higher paying salary, or make your life easier in any way.<p>Seeing other viewpoints can help with compassion, though, and that might be a necessary ingredient for a society. Not that that&#x27;s your concern: an individual is negligible to the behavior of the collective.')
