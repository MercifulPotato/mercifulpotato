The earth’s heat and heat generated by the moon’s gravity stretching the planet would increase that, initially, but I doubt it would be over 100 kelvin. That’s not cold or even cold cold, but cold³. If there still would be oceans, they would be a mix of nitrogen and oxygen.<p>I’m not sure living on it would be much easier than living in space. You would have better radiation protection and more raw materials, but staying warm might be harder.')
