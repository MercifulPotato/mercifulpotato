One of my best friends (at the time) lived in Zimbabwe. I lived in Uganda (I think that nation made the news, as well).<p>There&#x27;s another country that has had a hyperinflation problem: Venezuela (I think it&#x27;s still going on).<p>When you have to use a wheelbarrow to carry money to buy a loaf of bread, then something ain&#x27;t right.<p>Hyperinflation doesn&#x27;t cause despots, but good old-fashioned misery for the masses goes a long way towards it.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to be clinical and analytical, when we don&#x27;t have to pay the price, ourselves, but I can tell you, from personal experience, that walking past psychotic young men, carrying loaded machine guns, backed by the government, every day, kinda sucks.<p>A lot of people in the world have to do exactly that.<p>The one issue that I have with the tech social media scene, is how divorced we become from simple, basic humanity.
