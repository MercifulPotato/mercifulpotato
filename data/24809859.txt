Even a dozen of scientists didn&#x27;t manage to actually provide evidence that &quot;long COVID&quot; exists in significant numbers. All they cite is an editorial.[1]<p>&gt; like other seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of re-infecting people who have already had the disease, but the frequency of re-infection is unknown.<p>In other words: It happened a couple of times, but there is no evidence it happens frequently enough to worry about. Millions of people have been infected, of course edge cases occur.<p>&gt;  Such a strategy would not end the COVID-19 pandemic but result in recurrent epidemics<p>How exactly can we get recurrent epidemics when the pandemic hasn&#x27;t ended yet?<p>&gt;   It would also place an unacceptable burden [...]<p>What&#x27;s acceptable is subjective, there can&#x27;t be a scientific consensus on it.<p>&gt; health-care workers, many of whom have died from COVID-19 or experienced trauma as a result of having to practise disaster medicine.<p>Lockdowns (including those euphemistically called &quot;restrictions&quot;) cause trauma too, <i>and</i> they affect much more people. Psychologists are critical of lockdowns and social isolation.[2][3]<p>&gt; Such an approach also risks further exacerbating the socioeconomic inequities and structural discriminations already laid bare by the pandemic.<p>The <i>pandemic</i> is at fault? Not the <i>lockdowns</i>? Too bad the authors don&#x27;t provide any evidence.<p>&gt; Japan, Vietnam, and New Zealand, to name a few countries, have shown that robust public health responses can control transmission,<p>The island nation of Japan has defeated Covid. The island nation of New Zealand is even more successful, having defeated Covid twice so far. Vietnam is a single-party state and shouldn&#x27;t be a role model either.<p>&gt;  the endemic transmission that would be the consequence of waning immunity would present a risk to vulnerable populations for the indefinite future.<p>Apparently we have no idea when safe and effective vaccines arrive we can use to protect our societies and economies, which supports the authors&#x27; arguments.<p>&gt; The evidence is very clear: controlling community spread of COVID-19 is the best way to protect our societies and economies until safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics arrive within the coming months.<p>Now we do know when safe and effective vaccines arrive we can use to protect our societies and economies, which also supports the authors&#x27; arguments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02796-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02796-2</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-53037702" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-53037702</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;14&#x2F;doctors-note-the-psychological-effects-of-social-distancing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;14&#x2F;doctors-note-th...</a>')
