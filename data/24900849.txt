They don&#x27;t want to spend money and carry responsibility moderating content.<p>It was large media outlets and the public outrage they produced over &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;the far right&quot; that pressured them into taking a more proactive stance.<p>People like me who were opposing it back then and saying &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re asking for&quot; got labeled far right, and essentially bunched with Trump, which was hilarious to me as a left leaning European.<p>Newspapers now becoming angry Twitter is evenly applying the new rules - the rules newspapers lobbied for - is even more hilarious to me.<p>And you have to understand that Twitter did not make a mistake in how they responded to this. The article objectively was against their rules.<p>Whether these rules are good rules is another matter, but clearly the whole thing was dumb from the start.')
