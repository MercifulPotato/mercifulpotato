Here&#x27;s my mental model, which may or may not be relevant.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re holding a penny directly in front of your eyes, between you and the sun. It can do a pretty good job of blocking the sun for you, because it&#x27;s so close, but no one else is impacted.<p>Now move that penny a few hundred feet up. Now it&#x27;s almost imperceptible, but far more people (technology permitting) are capable of spotting it.')
