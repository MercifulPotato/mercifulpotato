You can push hardware beyond its apparent limits.<p>The interesting question is how much of a performance gain is there from hyperoptimizing for an architecture, how much from porting your code to C (or maybe assembly), and what&#x27;s the cost. Considering how much more complex software has gotten than Wolfenstein 3D, the porting cost would be pretty expensive. I&#x27;m also not sure if the performance gain would be as good as hoped; compilers have gotten a lot better, architectures have gotten a lot more complex and harder to understand.')
