Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603061728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821554, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re asking questions then confidence that the answer - which you do not know - is simple betrays the reality that you&#x27;ve become falsely confident of your understanding despite the fact that you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing or else you wouldn&#x27;t have a question at all.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of assumptions without even knowing the question, and is symptomatic of troublesome responders.<p>A lot of times the question I ask is of the form &quot;Yes&#x2F;No&quot;.<p>As in &quot;Is it possible to do it using X?&quot; If the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; I may have follow ons, but it&#x27;s amazing how often I cannot get an answer to this question. Even a &quot;Yes, but it&#x27;s a bad idea&quot; will suffice, but I&#x27;m more likely to get <i>several</i> &quot;You probably want to use Y&quot;. That&#x27;s simply not answering my question <i>at all</i>.<p>&quot;Can doing it via X handle a size of N?&quot;<p>Sure, maybe doing it Y is usually better than doing it with X, but telling me that is not answering my question, and the majority of times Y will not solve my problem. I also may already <i>know</i> that Y scales better, but my point is that even stating that up front in the question will not get me the answer I am seeking.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m just curious. I <i>know</i> Y is better, but I want to know what the limits of X are. It&#x27;s an appropriate question.<p>Depending on how well I know the person, I may give context, which is part of the skill in asking good questions. However, in an impersonal online setting, this backfires <i>more often than not</i>. As the example showed above, it usually leads to a 5x more effort spent in explaining and justifying the context than in discussions that are on the route to my getting an answer.<p>(As an aside, I do come from an academic background, where it is the norm to explore, and be curious. A lot of the questions they ask and discussions they have are not for anything practical. Which then becomes annoying when they ask a question online and the other party has all kinds of assumptions on why I may want to do X.)<p>&gt; Asking questions is a skill<p>Agreed, and so is answering questions. Jumping to conclusions on what the questioner is trying to do means the person has poor answering skills.')
