It really <i>is</i> a joy to use, at least compared to Vulkan or OpenGL. It feels a lot like D3D11, which is also (mostly) a very well-designed 3D API, and Metal fixed the few warts of D3D11 and modernized its concepts (like adding render passes, pipeline state objects and command buffers). And D3D11 backend code is very easy to &quot;port&quot; to Metal, so a new Metal backend fits well under existing wrapper APIs which already had to deal with D3D11 anyway.')
