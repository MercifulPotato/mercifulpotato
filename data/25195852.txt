I think of cross correlation of 1D signals with a kernel as sliding one of the functions over the other [0]. In my head I imagine drawing the signal and kernel next to each other one a big piece of paper and literally folding it over and sliding it back over the signal to intuit the convolution (with an imaginary see through piece of paper). I really don&#x27;t think that was obvious from what I posted, so definitely not dyscalculia!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Cross_correlation_animation.gif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;File:Cross_correlation_an...</a>')
