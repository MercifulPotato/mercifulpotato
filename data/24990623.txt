The only thing I take slight issue with is:<p>&gt; 5) Don&#x27;t roll your own authentication<p>&gt; Just don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s simply not worth the time and effort. Simply use a third party service that fits your project the most, and call it a day.<p>I agree with &quot;don&#x27;t roll your own IDP&quot;, for sure, but having implemented my own libraries to handle CAS and then SAML authentication (because no libraries worth using were available on the language&#x2F;framework I was using at the time), I can tell you that it was a huge learning opportunity and really gave me a much deeper appreciation for how these authentication systems work.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to put my code on a public facing network, but it was good enough for intranet use, and the knowledge gained has made it easier for me to implement SSO in a slew of paid, free, and homegrown apps over the years.')
