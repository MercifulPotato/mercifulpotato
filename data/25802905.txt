I also do not think that they are deliberately ignorant&#x2F;indifferent or that calling attention to it will do any good. These types of individuals got to where they are largely by knowing fully well that their actions are malicious and legal. I used to work under such people, and currently interact with and work with such people on a very regular basis (you could even consider me as part of them tbh). It is very much possible that the management level folks at Google don&#x27;t have an ounce of goodness in them, and will always see such decisions from a zero-sum perspective.<p>To make it relatable, do you care so much for a mosquito if it&#x27;s buzzing around you, disrupting your work and taking a toll on your patience? Because your SaaS is a mosquito to Google. After a certain point, you will want to kill the mosquito, and that&#x27;s exactly what Google execs think so as to get to their next paycheck.')
