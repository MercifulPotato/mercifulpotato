The fact that you get bored when reading work by authors that set up the scenery thoroughly might be a sign that those authors stuck to some kind of template for story drafting.\nThere are tutorials and bootcamps for novelists, just like we have coding schools and Create-React-App.<p>If you get bored by texts created based on templated story layouts, imagine how readers would feel being fed GPT-3 nonsense.')
