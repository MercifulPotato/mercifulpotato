The red and blue shifts from in-person and mail votes were very reasonably predicted before the election. But the reason the probability of a Trump win rose so much was that Florida turned out red by quite a bit compared to the polls and if that polling miss was systematic Trump would have won. It later became clear that the Florida miss was specific to that state, probably because of specific demographics and the probabilities swung in Biden&#x27;s favor again.')
