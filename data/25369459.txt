Raffensperger [1] filed in the superior court of Fulton County, state of Georgia. Beginning around paragraph 139 of the petition, you can see arguments that the Trump legal team have brought which talk about various violations of state mandates regarding signatures.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t see a signature &quot;verification&quot; law as anything but an attempt at disenfranchisement<p>You may argue that these laws or mandates could disenfranchise some voters, but I think it&#x27;s unfair to suggest that it&#x27;s their sole (or even primary) purpose.<p>&gt; make sure everyone votes<p>Even in countries where voting is mandatory you do not get full voter turnout. There would certainly be enough left over to turn the tide of many elections.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.democracydocket.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;45&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Trump-v.-Raffensperger.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.democracydocket.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;sites&#x2F;45&#x2F;...</a>')
