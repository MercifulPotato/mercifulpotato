But even having someone from the Heath department at least oversee and have a minor assistant operations role or something would have gone a long way when they gave away a portion of their (incredibly scarce) vaccine in the middle of a f&#x27;ing pandemic!<p>&gt; <i>By January 9th, Doroshin had a deal with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and Mayor Jim Kenney&#x27;s administration. The city never signed a formal contract with Philly Fighting Covid or gave the organization any money, but did provide its unofficial sanction, and publicity. Most importantly, the city turned over part of its vaccine allotment to the group, and helped them find recipients by sharing lists of residents who were newly eligible for the vaccine, based on the city&#x27;s own prioritization scheme.</i><p>Entrepreneurs, but founders in particular, are overly optimistic (borderline delusional at times, and I speak from first hand experience) and are incredibly risk prone people by nature and often take on way more than they can deliver under even ideal conditions, so under a pandemic which you see has a death toll that increases on an hourly&#x2F;daily basis and represents an affected family(s) and is the reason why a lot of the country has been locked down and suffering a damn near economic depression now for almost a year, its clear to see this is far from ideal conditions so some basic contingencies should have been made.<p>With that said, I agree, the numbers by comparison to the mass vaccination at Coor&#x27;s Stadium by UChealth, who only did a 1000 in a weekenm, are not bad because even a small state like CO is struggling to match those numbers and they were the first place to report cases of that 2nd strain and recently opened up it&#x27;s businesses and schools, thus increasing the need more than anyone else. They&#x27;re suppoed to do 10,000 this weekend, and with better weather in Denver they might just get it, but it that took a massive coordinated effort and way larger budget, team and infrastructure.<p>Shoutout to the Philly Fighting Covid team for this undertaking under immense pressure! And a personal thanks for trying to take some pressure off the over worked physicians and nurses who when this is all said and done will have a long road to recovery in physical but specifically mental health.<p>And while I&#x27;m sure people here (and elsewhere) are going to point fingers and judge, just ask yourself: what has been your biggest achievement during this pandemic, especially for those you work remotely from the comfort of your home and doing the supposed 2-3hours of &#x27;actual work a day&#x27; a mid tier SWE does in a day.<p>A sentiment that so many here agreed they do most days all while getting paid obscene salaries.<p>I&#x27;m sure as hell it wasn&#x27;t as impressive as mass vaccinations under immense pressure. The way some people are viewing this you&#x27;d think they were Theranos 2.0, when people are in fact getting the vaccine.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2021-01-28&#x2F;ralphs-cancels-covid-19-vaccine-appointments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2021-01-28&#x2F;ralphs-c...</a><p>PS: I don&#x27;t care if you downvote me as I don&#x27;t care about your fake points, but GP raised some valid points and in the time I typed all this out with citations he was dropped to the bottom and downvoted into oblivion with no rebuttal.<p>That&#x27;s a really pathetic thing to do at HN in what is supposed to be at its CORE a hub for entrepreneurs to chat and discuss ideas, not obscure people&#x27;s opinion who you don&#x27;t agree with.')
