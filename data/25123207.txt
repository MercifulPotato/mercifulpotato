No, those are thought by zoologists, meteorologists and physicians, respectively.<p>With that in mind, I see thinking about graphs and other areas more complex of version control as being, similarly, part of the job and the cognitive load of software engineers.<p>In short: People don&#x27;t usually think like that, but, in my opinion, thinking like that is part of a software engineer&#x27;s job, so I don&#x27;t see an inherent problem with that.')
