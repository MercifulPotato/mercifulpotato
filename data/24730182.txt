Many families dedicated to learning migrated ahead of the Golden Horde to western parts of Muslim lands. The mystic poet Rumi is a famous example, and even got his name “Rumi” because his family migrated from Khurasan to Anatolia.<p>Based on that background, we know that the cause of the famous decline has little to do with religious doctrine. The Golden Horde of Mongols destroyed the Golden Age of Muslims. Simple enough.<p>West should count its lucky stars that Muslims took the brunt of the Mongol destruction.')
