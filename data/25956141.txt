Perhaps on the level of the _individual_ forum&#x2F;channel&#x2F;board   you may be right. But not on the level of the _platform_. Specific forums&#x2F;spaces&#x2F;channels etc. which collapse - collapse, that&#x27;s a problem for their founders and members.<p>In that respect, I&#x27;ll make a different analogy: Mailing lists and newsgroups. Also not a perfect analogy, but - a mailing list or NNTP server does not have to police anything, but individual lists often need to set up some sort of moderation to avoid collapse into flame-wars etc.<p>So you can&#x27;t avoid the use of force here, the question is the amount of force being used, and whether it is commensurate to the specific event it is being used to mitigate.')
