Specifically, when installing rnnoise as shown in the readme it of course goes to &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;lib, but  &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;lib&#x2F;pkgconfig was not in the PKG_CONFIG_PATH of my distro. Maybe there could be a hint to set that when calling `meson build` if rnnoise can&#x27;t be found?<p>Packaging software is always annoying, sorry for dragging you into that mud. Ideally distros will pick it up and compiling manually unnecessary. I would have left this as an issue but saw no issue tracker on the project page.')
