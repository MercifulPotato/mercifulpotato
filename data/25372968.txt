The web developers (or marketing agencies or whatever) are also slow to learn what proper data protection means, and slap popups and banners on everything, making the web disgusting and regulations seem misguided.<p>A session cookie, especially after a login, may not require consent at all. Describe in your policy what personal data, if any, is tied to the session, and what you do with it. Most places collect and process only what is necessary to deliver a service and fulfill a contract. Let users read this policy and possibly contact you to make changes to their data.<p>Of course, this is not what happened here with Google and Amazon. In the meantime it is so unfortunate to see cookies becoming &quot;illegal&quot; taboo.')
