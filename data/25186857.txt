It&#x27;s not just &quot;the police&quot; or &quot;the government&quot; or &quot;the market&quot; - it&#x27;s every advertiser, every company they deal with, various branches of government, possibly even their HOA. Basically everyone that can persuade you or has power over you, that stands to benefit from particulars of your behavior.<p>The key aspect here is that these systems are usually impersonal and amoral, they <i>don&#x27;t care</i> about people who are being used as MVs. There&#x27;s also very many of them. It&#x27;s not a question of being influenced or not, but of limiting your exposure to the systems that harm you.')
