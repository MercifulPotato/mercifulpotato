Here&#x27;s a test: checkaux.github.io<p>Mobile firefox lacks simd, i haven&#x27;t been able to get its shared memory to work on a local or deployed environment because of bugs in what it thinks is a &#x27;secure context&#x27;<p>Desktop and mobile Firefox does not support OffscreenCanvas without turning on flags.
