Students use much of their junior and senior year time working on business plans, pitching investors, and trying to get their businesses started. It&#x27;s a great model for leveling the playing field.<p>Anecdotally, local entrepreneurship circles are absolutely full of young people from wealthy backgrounds who think they&#x27;re going to leverage their parents&#x27; connections and capital into personal riches.<p>They almost all fail the same way: They focus too much on quick-flip opportunities and the get-rich-quick schemes. They view entrepreneurship as collecting capital from investors and giving it to contractors to produce a business for them. They don&#x27;t actually want to grind out years of work to get a business off the ground. They burn out after a year or two.')
