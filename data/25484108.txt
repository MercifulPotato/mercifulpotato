You can run things like they were run in the 1990s, complete with Apache and mod_perl CGI and MariaDB swapped in for MySQL and everything held together with shell scripts and run via ssh and ftp. No magic, no lock-in, no complexity beyond what every other serious general-purpose computer system is these days.<p>I agree that Big Cloud Providers layer on pricing models and whatever middle-management-ware they can come up with to obfuscate the underlying mechanics, but if you&#x27;re against that, say so. Don&#x27;t catch <i>everything</i> in your blast radius because it reduces the overall impact.')
