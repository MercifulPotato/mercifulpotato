Even then, it would cost a single person far less in disk space than the electricity to run their refrigerator and again, few people even sync with the chain.<p>These are the same nonsense recycled bizarre statements that get made over and over. Why do the people in charge of bitcoin push propaganda that has no connection to reality? That&#x27;s the real question.')
