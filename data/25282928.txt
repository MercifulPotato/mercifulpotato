Decisions are made by 100&#x27;s or 1,000&#x27;s of individual managers, each of whom join and leave over the years. CEO&#x27;s enter and leave. Board membership changes.<p>Accountability comes from people not buying a product. Or from a government fining them $$$$.<p>I&#x27;d ask you, why do you think a voluntary statement of &quot;contrition&quot; from one of a corporation&#x27;s single employees means anything at all?<p>(I&#x27;m playing a little bit devil&#x27;s advocate here, but I think it&#x27;s worth remembering that corporations <i>aren&#x27;t</i> people and shouldn&#x27;t be treated as such.)')
