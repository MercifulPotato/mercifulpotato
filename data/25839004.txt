Item(by='afavour', descendants=None, kids=[25841445], score=None, time=1611091139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838581, text='&gt; The mods really have no reason removing posts, outside of clear violating posts that may break laws, since the users can choose what they want to see with the upvote and downvote button.<p>I have to disagree. My counterpoint would be the AskHistorians subreddit:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AskHistorians&#x2F;</a><p>Admittedly, I&#x27;m a history nerd, but it&#x27;s probably the most interesting subreddit I&#x27;ve found yet. And it&#x27;s <i>full</i> of deleted comments, because they have a very strict criteria about what can and cannot be posted. The system absolutely works for them. I&#x27;m not saying every subreddit should be organised the way theirs is, but I&#x27;m glad they are able to do what they do.<p>IMO, transparency is good. By all means make a public log showing what admins have done. But don&#x27;t limit what they can do.')
