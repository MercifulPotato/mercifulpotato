The last project we funded was for 31,500 INR per kW ($425) and we are currently about to fund a few projects at $364&#x2F;kW for Tier 1 equipment. This is more expensive than utility scale projects. The estimates in the article are what we are seeing on the ground.<p>Yes, it is accurate that solar can&#x27;t supply more than 30-40% of the energy mix. But we are still far from reaching that level of supply in the developing world and faster the cost reduces, the better it&#x27;ll be for continued deployment en masse. Battery innovation as well as other tech will continue to improve the amount of solar in the energy mix.<p>Edit: You may also find this helpful - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.energy&#x2F;blog&#x2F;solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.energy&#x2F;blog&#x2F;solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020-...</a>')
