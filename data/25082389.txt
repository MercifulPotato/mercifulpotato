But I like to hold out a tiny bit of hope based on the movement towards digital sovereign currencies and the improvements to cryptocurrency scaling such as Ethereum 2.<p>My belief is that the economy is really a technical problem.  And I feel like there is a technocratic movement which is partially in the right direction as far as holistic measurement and action to some degree but also partially outdated.  If you can upgrade technocratic ideas with an understanding of networks and decentralization technologies, I want to believe there is a chance to create a new type of money and government that is functional.<p>But I do believe that if we don&#x27;t make radical changes then there probably isn&#x27;t going to be a resolution barring some kind of very unlikely truly massive debt forgiveness.<p>What I think is going to happen is that there will be a very strong movement towards effective taxation of large corporations and the wealthy.  But that seems like it probably is not going to be adequate in the face of expanding entitlements for all segments and the existing debts as well as the accelerating automation.')
