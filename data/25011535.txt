While I never did know (or I guess care) idea that roguelikes were meant to be free. I think that is the reason I ended up at least trying many roguelikes you&#x27;ve mentioned.<p>ADOM was a game I grew up playing with my best friend. There were so many mysteries that we were trying to solve playing game after game. (That mystery kind of evaporated after we found out wiki pages on the Internet)<p>IVAN and ToME were interesting at the time but didn&#x27;t play them that much, maybe few dozen games each. IVAN with it&#x27;s all graphics felt really bloody and brutal. I&#x27;m kind of bummed about how ToME was changed during the years, while I do understand the reasons. It&#x27;s kind of foolish to build&#x2F;sell game on IP you don&#x27;t own.<p>I found Caves of Qud looking and feeling like roguelike I used to like, but I guess I&#x27;ve changed.<p>One &quot;roguelike&quot; I found very interesting during past years is &quot;Invisible, Inc.&quot;. It has that buildup of excitement and surprise I had with older roguelikes, mixed up with some XCOM like action. Surely it&#x27;s not free and as many others it also has this meta progression.')
