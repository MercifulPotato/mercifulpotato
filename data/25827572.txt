Item(by='gpm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611009598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823290, text='I think &quot;free speech&quot; is not quite as simple as a single concept.<p>Despite how it&#x27;s often portrayed, Parler was not hosting uncensored speech, on the contrary it was a heavily moderated platform controlling for a certain set of speech.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that this example (really <i>any</i> of the examples of speech surrounding Trump) are actually representative samples of what private communications products not subject to control by any central authority looks like.<p>There is still someone that was exercising free uncensored speech here (under the american 1st amendment definition) - but that person is the person running Parler, and not the users. What we observed with this deplatforming was one set of platforms with <i>relatively</i> little censorship (though a fair bit in absolute terms) stop supporting a sub-platform with a <i>lot</i> of censorship.<p>One lesson I would take away from this is that enabling platforms on which censorship is performed by a third party not under your control can be scary. The amount of damage bad-faith moderation&#x2F;censorship can do was surprisingly (to me) high - I would have thought people would notice and reject it more strongly. Uncensored platforms for speech might also be scary, but I don&#x27;t think Trump gives much evidence for it (sites like 4-chan might, I don&#x27;t really know).<p>Another lesson I would take away from reddit&#x27;s handling of Trump (in general) is that manipulation of algorithmic content discovery can do a lot of damage. There we saw that happening with things like bots upvoting (as well as bad faith moderation), but I think the pattern is more general. If you can choose what people are looking at, especially if you can convince them that it&#x27;s &quot;organic content&quot;, it can do a lot of damage. I&#x27;m told that similar issues with Facebook&#x2F;Youtube content discovery existed as well, but I don&#x27;t have first hand experience with those issues (youtube tends to recommend random technical and rocket related content to me, and I barely use facebook).<p>Whether those lessons are &quot;anti free speech&quot; - well that&#x27;s up to your definition of free speech. I don&#x27;t think they are under my definition, but I think they are under the US constitutions definition.')
