Start writing software -greenfield-. &quot;Wow this framework is really neat&quot;.<p>2. Grow it over years. Maintain it. &quot;This language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;architecture really sucks&quot;<p>3. We should rewrite it in Rust. Goto 1.<p>The real problem is that architecture is hard. Maintainance is difficult, scope creap a thing and accumulating technical debt will kill you eventually.<p>In Rails, getting a Proof of Concept &quot;blog&quot; out there, is done in hours. But all the &quot;shortcuts&quot; like &quot;throw in Devise for auth&quot; will get back to you in future, turning &quot;hours of rapid development&quot; into &quot;months of stagnation&quot;. Getting a basis that will survive pivots, quick market changes, scope creep and allow to tackle technical debt when time is right, takes years of experience with not just Rails, but with &quot;software architecture&quot; in general.')
