There are <i>tons</i> of things that you may not know how to leverage that can improve your mental health and overall happiness.<p>Know that it will take some shopping around. As with any doctor, do your homework, ask friends, and don&#x27;t stick with one until they &quot;feel right&quot;. The modern world is hell on brains that evolved to fit a very different environment than the one in which we live today, and it can take a lot of work to structure your life to deal with that.<p>Also, remember be both kind to and honest with yourself.<p>It can be so easy to beat yourself up when you fail or fall down, or to try and shift the blame to other people, but these are both anti-patterns.<p>Nobody makes every shot they take.
