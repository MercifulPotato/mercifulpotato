It&#x27;s just like if you took the rounds out of games like ring of fire and truth&#x2F;dare and turned it into an app. Only problem was it had some super buzzkill questions, like &quot;What&#x27;s worse, slavery or war?&quot;, and I thought I could do a better job.<p>Very simple app really, had a list of questions to run through, stuck peoples names into the question etc, but my issue came with the Android store. I called it &quot;Beercules: Drinking game&quot;, but even after months (and a rating between 4 and 5 stars) you couldn&#x27;t find it in the store unless you searched that full name. Searching Beercules or Drinking game didn&#x27;t even put it at the bottom of the list, it just didn&#x27;t exist. Oh, and then they updated the ToS and took the game down due to me not having a privacy policy, and gave no guidance on what that even is, never mind how to complete it, so i just gave up on it. \nI never expected it to be super successful, but I&#x27;d hoped it would have been given a chance.')
