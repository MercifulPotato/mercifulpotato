The Earth didn&#x27;t emit much of a signal on radio waves until about 1900, so even if the aliens were only sixty light years away and could move at the speed of light, they&#x27;d have had to launch just as soon as they got some signals.<p>Ah, but FTL, you say.  But nothing.  FTL implies Closed Timelike Curves: time travel, or the informational equivalent, with all of the logical paradoxes that can entail.  I&#x27;d sooner believe in breaking the conservation of mass-energy than beating the speed of light.')
