Look at all the threats made against people on social media.  The fact that there is almost no accountability means it keeps happening.<p>The only repercussions most of the time is that the platform kicks you off.  Part of it is, its their platform and from a business perspective having you around if you are too toxic isn&#x27;t wise.<p>It seems like a society problem.  Non enforcement and a lot of people with nothing to loose.')
