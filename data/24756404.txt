I&#x27;m on Windows, and 99% of this stuff Just Works really really nicely, but that means that &quot;just use Make&quot; isn&#x27;t a real option. I love that Rust&#x27;s tooling is so cross-platform, and this is just a final pain point. The problem is hard, but it&#x27;s mostly about fiddly details.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m trying to figure out how good I can make this without throwing it all out and doing something else. If we never push Cargo&#x27;s boundaries, it will never grow into being a good fit for these projects.<p>The fundamental problem with Cargo is that it&#x27;s not a general-purpose build system (like, say, make). It&#x27;s a black box with a bunch of hooks for achieving certain common things that the black box itself doesn&#x27;t handle. As a result, every time you step out of the &quot;supported area&quot;, it will be yet another &quot;final pain point&quot; &amp; &quot;mostly about fiddly details&quot;.<p>I agree make is not a good fit for a cross-platform project (nor is Meson, IMO, due to the Python dependency). But there are good (IMO) options in this area that meet your requirements (cross-platform, no external dependencies, etc). I can elaborate if you are interested.')
