I don&#x27;t see why we should not use this effective tool, when we agree that Google is doing a lot of wrong things that should be stopped.<p>If you believe the government is doing other bad things, against other people, fine you can argue that.  But that is not particularly relevant, and is just a non-sequitor.<p>I don&#x27;t see how, in this particular situation, using coercion against Google is bad.  Seems like it would be pretty good to me.<p>It can both be true that the government is doing bad things against others, but that in this particular situation, using a monopoly on violence, to use coercion against the Google leadership is a good thing.<p>To argue otherwise is just an irrelevant point, that is not directly related to the immediate situation.')
