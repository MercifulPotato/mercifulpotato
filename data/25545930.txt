I published one paper at NeurIPS this year and I work in a machine learning subfield where I basically only train networks on the MNIST digits dataset. It felt pretty pointless having to write down that I had no ethical concerns as my study only deals with handwritten digits. Some other researchers in my field got more creative and wrote down how their allegedly more efficient training algorithms would actually stop global warming... that really was pretty pointless.')
