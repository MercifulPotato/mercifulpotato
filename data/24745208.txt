The largest worldwide protests the world has ever seen, but the US and UK didn&#x27;t give a shit. Saddam didn&#x27;t have WMDs, so the US and UK governments made up &quot;evidence&quot;. The UN vote failed, so the US strong armed the UK into joining them in a ploy to blackmail UN members for votes. The US and UK went to war anyway, even though the UK&#x27;s own legal advisor had previously thought it illegal - funnily enough, he had a complete u-turn after a visit to the US. How many killed as a result? How many children maimed? And for what, to score political points and further line the pockets of the rich and powerful.<p>And what consequences for all of this corruption, for all of the lies to the people of the US and UK? Nothing.<p>Western governments, and their security apparatus, particularly in the US and UK, are utterly and completely corrupt, <i>broken</i>. They are so good at controlling the narrative that most of the populace doesn&#x27;t even have a clue what is going on, and would give half a shit even if they did.<p>We are well and truely <i>fucked</i>.')
