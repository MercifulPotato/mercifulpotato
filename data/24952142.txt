Or have they actually sent this money to someone else? Was this money acquired legally? Is it being used for illegal activity? A Bank would have to audit it at the very least, so there&#x27;s value for the people at having banks manage that transfer rather than let them do it anonymously.<p>Also for someone with $166M cost of a large transfer seem negligible even if it was in the 100s of thousands. Unless they need to move it all the time continuously, in which case I&#x27;d ask, why do they need that?')
