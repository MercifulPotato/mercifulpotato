Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603652166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887498, text='&gt;&gt; Basing on 10,000 graduates of Wisconsin high schools in 1957 happens to “control for” (in a by-and-large way) many or most of the confounding influences one would have in a study today or in an area such as, for instance, Maryland or New York City.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how selecting a non-representative sub-population controls for anything! Same goes if the data was from Maryland or New York City.<p>In any case, disentangling confounding factors and isolating the influence of IQ should be the goal of any research (though of course I can&#x27;t ask that of an &quot;analysis&quot; published on a blog). If a dataset seems to reveal some deep relation between IQ and other outcomes because that dataset is free of confounding factors, that doesn&#x27;t tell us what happens in the general case, where the confounding factors apply. In other words, there&#x27;s a danger of finding what one is looking for because one is looking for it where it exists, when the goal of looking is to make sure it exists everywhere.')
