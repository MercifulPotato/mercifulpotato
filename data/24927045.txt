Why did they simply follow the explicit procedures of the CoC rather than stopping to question if what they were doing was the right thing to do?<p>I suspect they were afraid to deviate from their own Code of Conduct, for fear that the 2 complainants would use social media to criticize the event operators. No event organizers want to be publicly accused of ignoring their own Code of Conduct or denying that a CoC complaint was valid. Getting on the wrong side of this issue could be a death sentence for the organizers.<p>So instead, they used the Code of Conduct machinery to turn the complaints into a vague punishment for the speaker. In doing so, they washed their hands of responsibility and shielded themselves from criticism. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense, but they upheld their end of the CoC and therefore are &quot;safe&quot; from being cancelled.')
