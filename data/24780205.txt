I can easily replace &quot;Roku&quot; with &quot;RSA SecureID keyfob&quot; and have the same conversation - it is not a generic device; it is a targeted hardware extension of their core business model. An &quot;online account&quot; (an account with RSA the company) is <i>required</i> for this keyfob to be of any value other than a LED screen displaying random numbers.')
