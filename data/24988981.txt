Specifically, existing countries have to work with&#x2F;for the people they&#x27;ve got. Over time it may be that the citizens are no longer really &quot;like minded&quot; to a minimum level where they can cooperate effectively.<p>We should be able to try experiments with &quot;re-booting&quot; populations without secession, civil war, ethnic cleansing, or genocide.<p>I would be interested in re-seeding a secular society that although it doesn&#x27;t ban religion also doesn&#x27;t privilege religion. I.e. believe and do what you want but any time your religious beliefs run into conflict with secular values, secular values win. The problem is that religious beliefs are (at least pragmatically) protected because they are so deeply and dearly held. It seems unfair and ultimately futile to just ask true believers to turn it off in school &#x2F; on the job &#x2F; in the voting booth.<p>From what I understand of US law, non-profits are not able to discriminate based on religion, but religious organizations are. So e.g. you can&#x27;t say &quot;You can&#x27;t join the Secular Space Nation Project because you&#x27;re religiously devout or your particular religious beliefs will make you hard to integrate,&quot; but you can say &quot;You can&#x27;t join the Church of the New Space Country&quot; because you don&#x27;t practice the &quot;New Space Country&quot; religion.')
