So no components or anything fancy. For this we just put the JS stuff using Django&#x27;s template system.<p>Once we had proved that this improved the site, we went all in and started to use the &quot;proper&quot; way, building the JS and deploying to a CDN.<p>In parallel to this we set up Django Rest Framework and set up alternate routes to fetch the view data as JSON.<p>In retrospect I would probably skip the hybrid system and just start building view components, but it was done this way so we could more easily revert if it didn&#x27;t work out.')
