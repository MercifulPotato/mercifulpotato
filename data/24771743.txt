It has a SATA extension cable connected, with the end hanging out the side of the laptop for easy access. eg:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;itm&#x2F;15-7-Pin-SATA-HDD-Extension-Cable-Data-Power-Male-to-Female-11-28cm&#x2F;152202347595" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;itm&#x2F;15-7-Pin-SATA-HDD-Extension-Cable-D...</a>\n&lt;-- I don&#x27;t know the seller at all<p>The laptop itself is setup and &quot;ready to go&quot; (eg external monitor, keyboard, mouse plugged in), and doesn&#x27;t get moved.  All it needs is the appropriate SATA drive to be connected then powered on.<p>Been using it this way, swapping over drives as needed (while powered off of course) for a few months now.  Works perfectly.<p>This kind of setup would probably work ok for you if you&#x27;re using Linux, as most distributions include the common hardware drivers.  So even differences in hardware between the laptops (within reason) generally won&#x27;t be a problem.<p>If you&#x27;re using Windows though, no idea.  Even with identical laptops in all locations it&#x27;ll probably notice different serial numbers on devices.  Not sure how that would play out.')
