It&#x27;s designed by the Braille Institute who I assume know what they are doing.<p>The relative legibility between fonts for people with good vision is probably marginal, but can be measured with reading comprehension tests and eye tracking systems. However I suspect the difference is pretty small for most well designed fonts for most people with good vision.')
