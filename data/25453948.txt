You can build it for less than USD 20 and send the data to our cloud server or any other backend.<p>We also measure CO2 because if you have purifiers running you often do not have enough fresh air ventilation and your CO2 often gets very high (often &gt;1500ppm) causing headaches and reduce cognitive performance.<p>We measured this in classrooms some time ago and the results were not very good.<p>Details. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-measured-the-co2-level-in-a-classrooms-this-is-what-we-found-out&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airgradient.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;07&#x2F;we-measured-the-...</a>')
