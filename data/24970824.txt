Lots of places sell blunt-tip syringes or you might be able to get away with insulin needles (I&#x27;m not sure -- pink tipped luers are the smallest I&#x27;ve ever used).<p>Do use luer-lock though, because the other kind of syringes suck. Just ask your local pharmacy -- they usually carry them and they can be used for all sorts of non-illicit-drug reasons.<p>In the US&#x2F;Canada Lee Valley sells a set of blunt tip syringes for inks and glues.')
