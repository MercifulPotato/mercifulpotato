This is probably one of my biggest weaknesses as an engineer so I really appreciate your help.<p>Right off the bat, I think you hit the nail on the head whereas I have only slowly started to think about how API&#x27;s are used, rather than just how they&#x27;re written.<p>1 is a great point. I&#x27;ll take some time to get more info on the end to end flows, and I think that will provide some great foundational understanding before even going in.<p>2. Is a whole knowledge bomb in itself. I hadn&#x27;t even thought of many of these points. Talking to the consumers is another great idea and I&#x27;ll make sure to do that.<p>3. I appreciate the reassurance. Part of why I never built up the skill so far is because it&#x27;s, frankly, intimidating to start poking at some big system from scratch. Thinking about downstream APIs is a smart angle.<p>4. I like this point a lot. Seems like a way to level up and start thinking about the bigger picture.<p>I can already see the benefit of these strategies and how they&#x27;ll help me develop my understanding. Now I feel equipped to tackle our team API&#x27;s, not as daunted as I was feeling before. Thanks!')
