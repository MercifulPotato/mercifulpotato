It sharply rises, before plummeting at age 40.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this line. It&#x27;s not because you don&#x27;t see your kids often when they&#x27;re adult that it wasn&#x27;t worth having them, or that you don&#x27;t appreciate the little time you still spend with them.<p>Personally, I didn&#x27;t want kids but now it&#x27;s something that I regret somewhat. Being a man, I wrongly assumed the option would always be there.')
