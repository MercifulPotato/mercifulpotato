I too am a developer with considerable assets accumulated over the years through investment and savings, and with no wife or kids to worry about I&#x27;ve often thought about taking the leap into being a solo dev working on my own projects. In 2020 I learned how to make a new passive income stream by simply selling options against stocks and cash I held in my portfolio, but since 2020 was an odd year I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good long term strategy as volatility and thus option prices were much higher in that year. You&#x27;ve been able to survive 3 years so I&#x27;m wondering what you do.')
