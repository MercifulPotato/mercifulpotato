It&#x27;s neither a particle, nor a wave, it&#x27;s something else entirely!&quot;<p>&quot;I accept that it isn&#x27;t either of those two things, but then describe the thing that it <i>is!&quot;</i><p>&quot;I can&#x27;t do <i>that!</i> You have to study a pile of textbooks this high to understand what it is!&quot;<p>&quot;Why? I understand relativity without having to have read a pile of textbooks! That&#x27;s also an unintuitive physical concept with no classical analogy with which we are familiar with in every day life. Despite this it has intuitive visualisations to aid understanding! [1] Why can&#x27;t you do something similar for quantum mechanics?&quot;<p>&quot;Wave-particle duality just has to be understood through the mathematics, there is no simpler way&quot;<p>&quot;Okay, okay, never mind. Now what about Spin?&quot;<p>&quot;Go away.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DYq774z4dws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DYq774z4dws</a>')
