Even if you search for your own specific address, you don&#x27;t really get anything out of it; there&#x27;s no guarantee it was you, or a friend of yours, or an automated address scraper. There isn&#x27;t much you can get out of a search string without more information connected to it.<p>The rest of your criticisms are too powerful for the topic at hand; they don&#x27;t prove we shouldn&#x27;t use DDG, they prove we shouldn&#x27;t use the internet at all.')
