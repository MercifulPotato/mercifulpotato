That&#x27;s much easier data to gather, since you don&#x27;t actually have to pinpoint specific genes, just do a blood type test on people who get severe covid.<p>For this research - just because you&#x27;ve identified a gene linked to risk, doesn&#x27;t mean you can say anything about why or how that happens. We likely don&#x27;t know much about this area of the genome - how it&#x27;s expressed, etc. and so they went with the angle we DID know - that it&#x27;s inherited from neanderthal. No doubt more research in this area will be done now that they&#x27;ve found a region of interest.')
