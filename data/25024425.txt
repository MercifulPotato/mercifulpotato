I can say, &quot;First the communist, then the gun people, and if neither of those, finally go for a major party.&quot; if that suits me. That means our voices get heard, and the major parties listen.<p>In NSW government for example we had an unpopular law put in place that killed our nightlife, so an entire political party was created just to fight that one law. They got lots of first preference votes, and the votes for all who did that were routed back to candidates that actually won because of the preferences. Being able to allocate our votes back to major parties with our voices being heard is important. Liberal then realised this wasn&#x27;t a hill they were particularly keen to die on, so they repealed the law.

They have to by law. So there&#x27;s no need to stoke the base to get turnout. Stoking the base makes you scary to everyone else and you get the smack down at the polls for it.<p>We currently have Greens members in our house of reps, and many many 3rd party candidates in the senate. It&#x27;s nowhere near perfect, but having your voice heard clearly, having that reflected in law, and ensuring there&#x27;s no apathetic middle that lets the extremes dictate policy cuts the crazy right down.')
