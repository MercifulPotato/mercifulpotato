People their aren&#x27;t very smart, for a variety of factors: poor nutrition, parasites, life history factors, terrible education system, limited access to books and technology, limited access to factual information, a terrible suppressive government, etc.<p>Of course I can&#x27;t generalize to all of Africa, but saying everyone is equal intelligence everywhere doesn&#x27;t make any sense. Like as a thought experiment, if I locked a kid in a box and didn&#x27;t teach them anything, or interact with them at all, would they be as smart as the kid who wasn&#x27;t in the box? Probably not.')
