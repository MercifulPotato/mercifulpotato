I&#x27;m still on WhatsApp but reduced my usage by 95% in favor of Signal now that most of my thread or individual users switched to Signal. It will take time but hopefully WhatsApp will become irrelevant in the long run.<p>It was very entertaining seeing all my group chats move one by one to Signal now that there is a critical mass of users that agree that it is the right choice. I tried to make it happen in the past and it was too much a pain to convince people that Signal was way better than WhatsApp.')
