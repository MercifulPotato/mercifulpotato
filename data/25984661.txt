That&#x27;s just not good reporting to try and spin that as a negative and Ignore the needed viability of that EV market.<p>The Air Pollution impact on the health of the population and a reduction in the respiratory illness&#x2F;other heath impacts must be figured in as part of the equation regardless of who is helped by the credits. The Credits will indirectly help to reduce pollution especially in crowded urban areas and reduce the overall rates of sickness related to ICE Pollution! That ICE pollution also takes its toll on Building facades and statuary and even has an affect on roads and bridges so that&#x27;s another reason to have the credits until the EV production can become viable on its own without the need of any credits&#x2F;assistance.')
