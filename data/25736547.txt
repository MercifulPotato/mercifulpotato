The Russia narrative followed a path of legal investigation into questionable situations. Trump did not get impeached for the outcomes of the Mueller report. Dems did not force their way into political buildings. They (at least the mainstream ones) never called for violence.<p>So, it seems that the left, in the end, did believe it was a fair election in terms of ballot numbers, and never suggested that the democratic election be overturned.<p>The last part of your statement says something entirely different than the first part. I don&#x27;t think anyone is claiming that Dems haven&#x27;t worked hard to undermine Trump during his time in office. Just like I don&#x27;t think anyone claimed Republicans weren&#x27;t working to undermine Obama when they took control of the Senate. That&#x27;s politics, good or bad. But that does not correlate to a belief that a fair election should be overturned.<p>Not really an apt comparison in my opinion.')
