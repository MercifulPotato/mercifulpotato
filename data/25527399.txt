Item(by='st1x7', descendants=None, kids=[25529188, 25527734, 25527629, 25528390, 25527808], score=None, time=1608817786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527291, text='&gt; Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<p>Man... there is way too much deus ex machina at every plot point of that book to give it any credit. If you have the end of the 6th book as a starting point and the end of series that Rowling had in mind as an end, then Deathly Hallows is just connecting those two points using plot conveniences at every single opportunity. Too many fortunate coincidences in a very short period of time. (Half-Blood Prince is still peak Harry Potter IMO).')
