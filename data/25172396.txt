But first I am curious if you really believe that the election was &#x27;stolen&#x27; by the Democrats.<p>&quot;When they are doxxed and their families are threatened (I saw the videos making the rounds and the tweets afterwards), it doesn&#x27;t make it okay.&quot;<p>Again, they are public officials so calling them by name isn&#x27;t Doxxing. Secondly, there is an angry Twitter mob saying all kinds of nonsense on both sides, so I think that cancels itself out. Are you saying Trump supporters have never asked for violence at all? Maybe you need to browse thedonald.win a bit first. So let&#x27;s keep it focused on what was actually stated by the politicians in question.<p>&quot;Everything isn&#x27;t attributed to race. You are trying to tell us the intent of these individuals without knowing what they are actually thinking or why they chose to make this decision. I suppose this is the definition of bias.&quot;<p>You haven&#x27;t really answered my question. If not race, then what was the metric, exactly, that made them question the validity of these black regions when by the same metrics the councilor was so concerned about several white communities with worse numbers were certified. But sure we can give them the benefit of the doubt and say they&#x27;re not racists they&#x27;re just trying to block votes from the party they don&#x27;t like.<p>&quot;Many Democrat officials still believe the Russian collusion conspiracy theory. Should we discount everything they say as well?&quot;<p>There&#x27;s two major problems with this.<p>1) There <i>was</i> real evidence that there was a russian conspiracy. In case you forgot several members of Trump&#x27;s team, including his ex lawyer got arrested for crimes linked to this! Robert Muller didn&#x27;t say Trump was innocent by the way, he said a sitting president couldn&#x27;t be convicted for crimes by the investigation! \n2) For all their whining on social media, Hilary never refused to concede the election, and called Trump the next day.<p>Look I&#x27;m fine if you want to say this wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;fair&#x27; election, you can even make a good argument for that. Tucker Carlson, who I really don&#x27;t like, has made arguments to this. But for this to be a &#x27;stolen&#x27; election, for the president to routinely say this without any evidence beyond affidavits is absurd.')
