The president is blaming social media for his election loss and seeking to repeal section 230 as the remedy.<p>No matter how many times this comes up, it&#x27;s extraordinary. First, because the president owes his 2016 win to social media company protections under section 230. Second, because the president almost won a second term thanks to it. Third, because section 230 is from what I gather a lonely diamond in the stinking pile of rubbish that is the Communications Decency Act.')
