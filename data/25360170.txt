Why do you too try to deny the facts, while shifting the blame to one of her accusers, without providing any evidence that his accusations are inaccurate or unfair?<p>It&#x27;s such a shame how people with dark personality traits always crawl out of the woodwork to baselessly defend and whitewash the actions of other &quot;successful&quot; self-aggrandizing people with even darker personality traits.')
