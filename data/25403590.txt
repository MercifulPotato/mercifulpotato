The first 3 times I ran Throne of Thunder for transmog, I got &quot;Clutch of Ji-Kun&quot; to drop. I thought it was a high-chance drop until a friend told me he was trying to get it for years. (2.69% chance according to Wowhead) I was subbed for a while, started playing a while before then, nothing to suggest it was gamed to keep me going.')
