Scott does know how to use chopsticks and is so proud of his “skill” he insufferably tutors chopstick maladroits regarding technique.<p>However, Scott’s technique is both suboptimal and childish, his grasp of the sticks conforming to how children are taught to use chopsticks and offering less precision than techniques which adults use. [0] Furthermore, Scott’s not actually very skilled at using chopsticks. He’s a step above stabbing food with them or using them with one in each hand, but his mastery of the kids’ way of using chopsticks is barely better than rudimentary.<p>Often while lifting food from his from his plate and into his mouth, Scott will clumsily drop the morsel back onto the plate and chomp at empty air. Watching Michael Scott eat with chopsticks is to be embarrassed for him, while he himself remains oblivious and proud.<p>Michael Scott will replace his chopsticks with a spoon for the last 25% of his meal.<p>Lastly, the linked article is a marvelous troll guaranteed to rile even the most self-assured (and they are nothing if not self-assured) member of the Whytian Clueless.<p>[0] In my corner of South Korean culture, the kids’ way of holding chopsticks involves the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers.
