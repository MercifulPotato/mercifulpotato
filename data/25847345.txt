As it doesn’t prevent a function from constructing both a result and an error and only returning the error), but I don’t see how optionals force handling errors more than returning a pair <i>(value, error)</i>.<p>Surely, you can just check whether the optional has a value, use it when it is available, and ignore the other case.')
