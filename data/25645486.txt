It&#x27;s really only started getting any traffic at all in the last 12 months or so, and it&#x27;s now a few hundred sessions per day, up from a handful per day a year ago. (Granted, I don&#x27;t invest a whole lot of time in it.)<p>Some fluctuations are explainable: a bit over half my traffic is from the US, so you can clearly see the effect of Thanksgiving. Most of the rest of my traffic is from the UK, western Europe, and Australasia, so holidays such as Christmas and New Year stick out like a sore thumb.<p>But sometimes I&#x27;ve seen pages disappear from the search index, or be heavily deranked for a week or two, before popping back up again. Often this has happened after I&#x27;ve published a (relatively speaking) large amount of new content to the site, but sometimes it&#x27;s not easily explainable.<p>I also, every few months, get &quot;invalid traffic&quot; warnings in Adsense, even though the majority of my traffic is organic search traffic that Google itself is sending me. Generally revenue will drop to zero for a week or two before climbing back up, and shortly after the warning will disappear. Every time this happens I check Google&#x27;s policies and sometimes have to fix the odd problem. Mostly though, I have no idea why this happens.<p>The site makes so little revenue it doesn&#x27;t even cover its own hosting costs so it&#x27;s not a big worry. However, I do see the potential for it to earn more were I to invest more in it. Still, I&#x27;ve realised that I&#x27;d have to be out of my mind to rely on Adsense revenue from this website as my sole source of income.<p>I&#x27;m not complaining at Google for this - any money the site earns is a bonus and, as I say, at the moment it doesn&#x27;t even cover its own hosting (which at least keeps my tax return simplier). Still, if I were going to build some sort of indie business around it I&#x27;d have to think pretty hard about ways I might be able to get multiple channels for revenue. Unfortunately, like goodcheapandfast.com, the reality is that the source of every one of those streams would likely originate with organic search traffic.')
