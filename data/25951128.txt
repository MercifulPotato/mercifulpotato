Juniors will almost always be stuck with something trivial you can answer within a few minutes. It gives you a break and it is something they really appreciate. If you communicate to them that they&#x27;re not expected to know anything and that the first few years on the job <i>is</i> their real world education and a chance to ask questions without raising eyebrows, they&#x27;ll be far more likely to do it.<p>Juniors are nice in my experience, you can mold them into something half-decent if they&#x27;ve got a bit of a brain and their mistakes are ones of innocence, not cunning or apathy. It&#x27;s the &#x27;senior&#x27; devs who don&#x27;t know shit that you have to put up with that&#x27;s almost always a disaster. They&#x27;ll be well versed in lying and politics, wasting everybody&#x27;s time.')
