Item(by='mauvehaus', descendants=None, kids=[24902541, 24902135], score=None, time=1603750115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901633, text='Would shellac work or traditional lacquer[0] work? They both cure by drying, not polymerizing, and can be removed decades later with the original solvent: alcohol in the case of shellac, or lacquer thinner in the case of lacquer.<p>I haven&#x27;t had any experience with lacquer because traditional lacquers almost have to be sprayed, which I am not equipped to do. I have plenty of experience with shellac because you can brush it and get a pretty decent finish off the brush, or French polish for a more refined finish. French polishing takes advantage of the aforementioned properties of shellac: besides laying another thin layer down, you&#x27;re also redisolving the existing layers and smoothing them as you go.<p>Traditional varnishes cure by polymerization, and generally cannot be removed with mineral spirits. That isn&#x27;t to say you won&#x27;t ruin the finish trying, but you&#x27;ll need a different solvent if you want it gone cleanly.<p>[0] lacquer has become an almost meaningless term. There are products that might or might not technically be lacquer that are called lacquer or water borne lacquer or some other phrase that includes the word. I&#x27;m referring to the stuff that uses lacquer thinner for the solvent. You&#x27;ll know it if you smell it: it smells like it&#x27;s giving you cancer right now, not in 30 years.')
