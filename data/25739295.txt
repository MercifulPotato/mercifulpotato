How she feels is important. I definitely have a tendency to listen to that type of protester.<p>The armed BLM protesters that come only in the dark of night to loot and burn? No. How they feel is irrelevant to my response to them.<p>Same with these self proclaimed &#x27;patriots&#x27;. The ones at unarmed peaceful protests matter. But, quick question for you: How many do you see at unarmed peaceful protests? That pretty much tells you all you need to know.<p>I&#x27;m only ashamed I that I had to see the Capitol fall to realize that how these violent people feel shouldn&#x27;t matter.')
