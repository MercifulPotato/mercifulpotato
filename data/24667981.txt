I also maintained cperl-mode for many years, and honestly the editor support for this functionality never quite worked right.  It is hard to parse, and even harder when you are doing a heuristic-based incremental parse.  (The challenge with text editors is that you have to provide correct syntax highlighting even when the document contains parse errors that the compiler would have bailed out on.)<p>Because editor tooling is important to me, I&#x27;m willing to see an ugly &quot;\\&quot;quoted\\&quot; string&quot; from time to time, if it means that I get better tools as a result.')
