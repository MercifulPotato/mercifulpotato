That&#x27;s probably another big mistake of the google experience.You can&#x27;t just change completely the organizazion and expect everything to work fine the next day. Change should be done gradually, ideally I would gradually assign responsibilities to the team, while leaving a manager there to supervise and slowly fade out.')
