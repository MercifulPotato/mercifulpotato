There is no way to consistently detect lies, which is also unfortunate for anyone arguing for censorship as then you cannot ascertain which claims should be censored and which should not.<p>&gt; Lies about, for example, the stab-in-the-back, tobacco and WMDs in Iraq got the liars what they wanted at the cost of millions of lives.<p>I don&#x27;t know what &quot;stab-in-the-back&quot; is but tobacco and WMDs are examples of lack of speech. If we&#x27;d all had access to secret documents then the lies about WMDs wouldn&#x27;t have worked quite as well, I reckon.<p>&gt; Overall this whole &quot;free speech kills lies&quot; idea sounds like religious dogma to me<p>Which is ironic considering you&#x27;ve stated it again, and again without reason to back it up.<p>&gt; its proponents never feel the need to cite any actual evidence or address the horrific consequences of the edge cases<p>There are no edge cases because it&#x27;s not promising utopia, it&#x27;s promising freedom, and it does that because the alternatives are worse - I would rather choose free speech for all than your idea of censoring people based on which method? The abilities of the high priests to divine it, perhaps?<p>Now <i>that</i> would be religious thinking.<p>Edit: typo')
