(wireguard is itching for a nice ui or cli tool for managing configs.... if anyone knows one please let me know...)<p>Wireguard is simple point-to-point, I have an iptables rule that masquarades the tunnel interface to the internal interface of the &#x27;vpn server&#x27; but it&#x27;s all so simple that don&#x27;t feel bad at all that someone down the road will inherit this system and have to mange it. It&#x27;s obvious, the stuff I wrote around it is simple enough to grok in an hour, and that&#x27;s a world of difference from openvpn, where you can easily deploy it with some ansible-galaxy role, but actually maintaining it for 200+ devs requires you to actually undersand it which is a different thing.<p>I&#x27;m not really contributing anything here, apart from -- everywhere I&#x27;ve used wireguard I feel better for it. If you&#x27;re weighing up options, I suggest you go wg. :}')
