Apple is a fashion company, it&#x27;s time to wake up to that fact. Think back to their old iPod ear buds (if you&#x27;re old enough), the white wires were a statement that you were affluent (why do you think they had them so prominent in their commercials with the dancing silhouettes?) Those earbuds were horrible. That was fashion, this is the same.')
