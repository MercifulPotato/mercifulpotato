I was optimizing for contentment.<p>If you are worrying about the value of an asset at a particular moment, and even mildly thinking of selling it, spare yourself the worrying. If you bought in at a high price, and you are going to sell it now, it will still be a small profit. If you bought in at a low price before, you can likely afford to wait. Even if the value goes down, you will still have made a profit. But thinking this way gets the worrying part of taking such a speculative decision out of the way.')
