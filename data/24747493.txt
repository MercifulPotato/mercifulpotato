But I do think that they disagree with the way other commenters on this thread have portrayed it.<p>For example, let&#x27;s examine the claims made by the person you replied to:<p>&gt; There are parts of this country that are not coming back economically for a decade after what happened.<p>Is this actually true? Can you find a citation saying that these businesses will not &quot;come back&quot; for a decade? Given that recessions, natural disasters, and pandemics cause <i>even more damage,</i> and businesses are able to begin operation usually within a year, I find it hard to believe this specific claim.<p>For example, Axios estimates that damages caused by rioting could be around $2 billion (from the Insurance Information Institute) [1]. Axios also notes that natural disasters such as hurricanes can cause more than $3-$5 billion in damages. Hurricanes also cause their damages in a localized area (as opposed to nationwide rioting), so I would assume that it would be even harder for businesses to recover from hurricane damages. But my impression is that businesses in areas hit by hurricanes tend to recover within a year or two.<p>&gt; And if a right wing group had done 1&#x2F;10th of what these groups did we would never hear the end of it.<p>Wikipedia says that right wing extremists have killed 114 people since 2001 and injured dozens more [2]. It also claims that one person was killed in a far-left attack. If we consider the monetary value of a human life to be $10 million [3] (let&#x27;s ignore that assigning monetary values to human lives may be problematic), we find the damages caused by right-wing extremists in the last twenty years <i>in deaths alone</i> has been $1.14 billion. I sincerely doubt that left wing rioting and looting has caused more than $11.4 billion in damages since 2001, so the right wing <i>has done</i> more than a 1&#x2F;10 of what &quot;the left&quot; has done -- but we aren&#x27;t &quot;never hearing the end of it.&quot;<p>Again, nobody here is saying there is no violence caused by the left. But I am criticizing how other commenters have exaggerated that violence, while ignoring the violence caused by the other side.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a455-4067-b06a-66f9db4cea9c.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a4...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right-wing_terrorism#Post-2001" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Right-wing_terrorism#Post-2001</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;843310123&#x2F;how-government-agencies-determine-the-dollar-value-of-human-life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;843310123&#x2F;how-government-agen...</a>')
