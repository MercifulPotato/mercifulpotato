Gather up copies of all employment agreements etc + directly related correspondence for them to review. Don&#x27;t sign anything, don&#x27;t discuss this issue more with your cofounder until you get advice. Also don&#x27;t read too much into anonymous internet commenters who don&#x27;t know the details of your situation. You can be fired but you have some leverage because this kind of dispute is a red flag for any prospective investor. Feel free to e-mail me.')
