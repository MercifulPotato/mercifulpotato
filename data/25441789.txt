And if someone tries to be sneaky and move the release tag, the checksum will no longer match, and your build will fail.<p>If you want to upgrade the version of a dependency, that is doable (with plenty of toll assistance), but it requires a positive action.<p>Theer is, however, no good solution for the &quot;first use&quot;. But, that is pretyt much standard.')
