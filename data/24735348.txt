That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that _overall_ the CPI has gone up over time.  Wages have been having an inverse relationship with prices overall.  This is not a case of &quot;prices are cheaper so the wages are less too&quot;.<p>&gt; The only way to prove that “market forces do not reduce prices”<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re putting in quotes something I didn&#x27;t say.<p>&gt; Only true for landlords, but that&#x27;s because the supply of housing is artificially constrained by zoning regulations. If we fix that, then this becomes less true.<p>No it&#x27;s true for all employers that would have had to pay a living wage and now don&#x27;t because the middle class will subsidize their labor costs.')
