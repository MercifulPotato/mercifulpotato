Item(by='zach_garwood', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611590666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904242, text='First off, it&#x27;s ridiculous to me that our industry calls five years of experience &quot;senior.&quot; In what other industry is a twenty-something with a handful of years of experience, barely out of college, a senior? I&#x27;ve been at this for only a decade and I bristle at being called senior. In my opinion it&#x27;s pure ego-stroking.<p>Secondly, old programmers become managers and consultants. Programming is a young man&#x27;s game, seemingly by design. We invented a hiring process that&#x27;s roughly equivalent to fraternity hazing, that only younger folks are willy to out up with. We weed out the olds by only seeking out coders who are &quot;passionate&quot; (have no other real world responsibilities) and that are more easily cowed by &quot;Agile&quot; and &quot;Scrum&quot; to become line workers in a feature factory. But the older they get, the less willing they are to out up with the bullshit. I, for one, realized that I wanted to find solutions to tough problems instead of bang out features that no one but the project manager asked for. And as a programmer, you have surprisingly little say over how problems get solved, unless you go into consulting. That&#x27;s probably where you and I will end up.<p>I believe, because our industry skews so young and inexperienced, that is why continually get caught in hype cycles. Some kid comes along and &quot;invents&quot; some new technology that&#x27;s actually been around forever, they&#x27;re just too young to remember. If there were more adults in the room where happens, maybe the kids would stop getting excited over recycled tech.<p>But now I&#x27;m veering into oldman-yells-at-cloud.jpg territory, so I should probably stop here.')
