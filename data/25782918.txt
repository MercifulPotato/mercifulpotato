North Carolina was where most of the world&#x27;s lithium was mined and refined.<p>Pretty much all mines for lithium closed in the US because it was simply cheaper to get from either South America brine and then Australian spodumene mining.<p>While the US stopped mining lithium however there is still a lot of lithium refinement in North Carolina. And more refinement capacity is already planned both there and other places in the US.<p>The main reason it is in China is because China made EV and the supply chain a priority.<p>However, most of the downstream refinement of the downstream for actual battery materials actually happens in Korea. So a lot of lithium is mined in West Australia, transported to China and then the Korea&#x2F;Japan until it is shipped to Nevada where it turns into a battery.<p>In the next few years you should see the whole supply-chain from mining to battery in the US.')
