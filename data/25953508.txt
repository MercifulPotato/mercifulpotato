Whether they lent it to you or not doesn&#x27;t matter, because if the bad trade were going the other way, then you, the sucker, would absolutely be on the hook.<p>Whether it&#x27;s fraud or flawed or whatever else is beyond my experience or knowledge, but after today I think ending up on the wrong side of the deal with Robinhood again will rightfully be met with suggestions that you should have known better.')
