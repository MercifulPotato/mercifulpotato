Have you been on Parler? Moderate is &quot;I think universal healthcare is dumb, minimum wage is bad for business, we need more oil pipelines, etc.&quot; Positions that are reasonable and can be discussed using more reason. What&#x27;s on Parler is not moderate, it&#x27;s pretty much nothing but calls for a violent overthrow of democracy, to be replaced by a society where anyone they deem as a &quot;liberal&quot; can be put to death.')
