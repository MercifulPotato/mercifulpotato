Many RISC architectures have a &quot;zero&quot; register, so a canonical &quot;move short immediate&quot; instruction could be &quot;OR Rn, R0, #n&quot; (&quot;OR R0 which is always zero with n and store into Rn&quot;) or the same with ADD. Then clearing Rn will usually be &quot;OR Rn, R0, R0&quot;, &quot;ADD Rn, R0, #0&quot; or something like that.')
