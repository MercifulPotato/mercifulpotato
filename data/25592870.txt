The ML image classification stuff it does took a few hours for sure, I left it go overnight, but then in the morning the ability to filter for specific classifications or jump to a specific date was pretty much as fast as you&#x27;d expect it to be (almost instant). This was using the default SQLite config.<p>The one thing I wished was that the ML Classification stuff it did was better - because it was nowhere near as good as what Google does with Photos, and nowhere near as useful for that reason. I still deeply miss Google Photos.<p>For context, my setup is pretty old fashioned these days. I plug my phone in, and use Shotwell to import the photos into my local photo library. Duplicati does a backup of all my photos once a week to Backblaze. Photoprism reads from my local copy and allows me to effectively browse my photos at home.')
