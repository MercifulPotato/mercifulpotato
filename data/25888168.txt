Often it’s as simple as asking “What would we give up by using a monolith here instead of microservices?”<p>Forcing people to justify, out loud, why they want to use a specific technology or trendy design pattern is usually sufficient to scuttle complex plans.<p>Frankly, many engineers want to use the latest trends like microservices or NoSQL because they believe that’s what’s best for their resume, even if it’s not necessarily best for the company. It doesn’t help that some companies screen out resumes that don’t have the right signals (Microservices, ReactJS, NoSQL, ...). There’s a certain amount of FOMO that makes early-career engineers feel like they won’t be able to move up unless they can find a way to use the most advanced and complex architectures, even if their problems don’t warrant those solutions.')
