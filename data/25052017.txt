My 2012 mbp15r uses glue and solder, not screws. Maxed out the specs when I got it, which is why it&#x27;s still usable. Would&#x27;ve been delighted for it to have been thicker and heavier to support DIY upgrades and further improve its longevity while reducing its environmental impact, but that wasn&#x27;t an option. Needed the retina screen for my work, bit the bullet. Someday maybe there will be a bulletproof user-serviceable laptop form factor w a great screen, battery life and decent keyboard, that can legally run macOs... glad to say my client-issued 2019 mbp16r checks most of those boxes. &#x2F;ramble')
