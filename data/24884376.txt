Even domestic violence aside. And I still find the way HN started to bring up old Greeks lately all the time completely obnoxious (which is my another central point).<p>&gt; It seems, uh, strange to fail to notice Marx&#x27;s influence in particular given what happened in the 20th century and what continues to happen in China. Furthermore, the idea of the government as an instrument of violence used by the ruling class (which is so common these days, on HN too) is clearly straight out of Marx.<p>This is not even mentioning class warfare, biggest issue right now in China is that genocide they have. The origin of &quot;class warfare&quot; expression is not relevant to anything, that is just later attempt to move discussion toward different topic.<p>Second, they had &quot;estates&quot;. Three estates system in French and four estates system in Russia.  Those had different legal code, different rights, different justice system, different duties to people based on which group they were born into. We can completely avoid the word &quot;class&quot; or &quot;class warfare&quot;. The violence between them did happened. They did thought about them as about groups and even legalized that.<p>We can talk about John Brown and slavery and still have group of slaveholders against slaves. He interpreted it as a war, but no one called it class war. In practical terms, as socioeconomic group of people being dominated or killed by other group of people, we really do not have to wait for Marx to start figuring this out. We can talk about French revolution and old regime, we can talk about slavery, we can talk about estates.<p>Even freaking Greeks had groups of people, which I will not call classes, dominating other groups of people doing a lot of violence to them. And we can see that even tho opinions of their slaves or women or non-citizen males are unavailable to us.')
