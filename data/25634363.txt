I&#x27;d be interested in seeing one. Off the top of my head:<p>* In many languages, monomorphization is impractical. Eg, in C it requires macros or external code generators. Java and Go don&#x27;t even have macros. So it&#x27;s rarely done. Instead, stuff uses type erasure, dynamic dispatch, more heap allocations, and tables like the ones described in that dave.cheney.net link. Maybe some JITs or even some ahead-of-time compilers do monomorphization internally in some cases, but I&#x27;m speculating rather than speaking from knowledge.<p>* In C++ and Rust, monomorphization is easy. You don&#x27;t have to do it, but it&#x27;s easy, so many people do. The containers in the standard library are monomorphized. This code can perform very well in any particular case, but in aggregate it&#x27;s large enough that I have doubts about whether it&#x27;s always worth it for the whole program.')
