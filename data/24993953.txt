That finally did happen. I would love to add more double precision compute capacity without being robbed; it’s getting tough to find 1st  gen nvidia titan cards. Here’s hoping this discrete unit will have strong fp64 performance.<p>Edit: It had been a while since I checked into current-model GPU fp64 throughput. The Titan V has outstanding DP performance!!!
