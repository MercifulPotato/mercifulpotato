Found a blue chip company that grows weed which was very funny to me, so I decided to buy some of the stock, by now it has grown my ~250%, which is pretty nice and even more funny because the stock is _high_<p>Secondly, crypto mining, I do this because I have access to _free_ electricity and internet, thus all profits are mine.<p>Thirdly, crypto earned from mining I transfer into BlockFi, which isn&#x27;t insured in anyway, but it does work like a saving account where BTC has a yearly interest of ~6%, other crypto currencies have more and some have less, you can also set that the interest is paid in any other crypto currency.<p>Fourthly, one that I&#x27;m probably most proud of, Quanloop, they are a lending company but us _investors_ work kinda like a buffer for them so it&#x27;s not directly us that are loaning the money. On Quanloop I have a yearly growth of ~15.6% with monthly payouts, they also pay you what you have lost due to inflation and what you had to pay for income tax. It&#x27;s really amazing.<p>Here&#x27;s my referral link:\nbit.ly&#x2F;InvestLove\nIf you deposit 0.01€ or more you&#x27;ll get 5€ reward, but if you want to avoid that, you can just Google Quanloop and do it that way.<p>I don&#x27;t work for Quanloop, I just really find them interesting.<p>Fifthly, while currently not active I do plan on putting money onto it and that&#x27;s Iban Wallet, it&#x27;s a saving account that pays out interest every day, which seems very interesting to me!')
