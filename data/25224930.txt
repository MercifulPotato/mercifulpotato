Even the most vocal gun advocates in Canada have come to agree that the exact reforms currently on the table in US are reasonable; they’re good for responsible gun owners, good for reducing gun violence, and have not in fact turned out to be a slippery slope to totalitarian gun-grabbing.<p>But it&#x27;s because of this misalignment across a variety of issues that it’s difficult to have a straight discussion of cross-border political alignments— you need to have at least some semblance of a picture of how the Canadian left and right differs from the US left and right. (Another key one, for example, is that the Liberals in Canada officially strive to be a centrist party; the &quot;real&quot; Canadian left is the NDP and Green party, neither of which have ever held power at the federal level, though the NDP have come close a few times.)')
