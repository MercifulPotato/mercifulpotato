After all, the page size of the PGM-index can be tuned to match the one of the media you are storing your data to (or to match the default setting of the RDBMS).<p>About the paradigm shift to use smaller pages, it&#x27;s worth mentioning technological innovations like the Intel&#x27;s Optane DC Persistent Memory, in which the access granularity is 256 bytes. I expect that similar products will be available in the near future and that new&#x2F;updated RDBMS implementations will take advantage of them.')
