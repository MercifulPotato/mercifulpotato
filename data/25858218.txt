When I write functional code (the compiler can enforce purity) in D I can usually get it running fairly quickly, but because of various things (memory locality, memory usage, etc.) I can see it being a problem in problem in the more traditional functional languages.<p>Ultimately for single-threaded applications avoiding state is usually just slower, however, it also buys correctness. Eliminating mutable state in composition can also massively improve the parallelism available to the programmer without making changes to the implementation.')
