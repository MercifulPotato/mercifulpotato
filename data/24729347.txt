Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[24729455], score=None, time=1602247731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729273, text='a) Costs&#x2F;prices in the US are inflated in the entire industry for a bunch of reasons that basically boil down to half a century of lack of incentive to control costs<p>b) Your cost isn&#x27;t actually $100.  Your cost at the point of service is $100 but you&#x27;re paying more taxes which subsidize your healthcare (among other things).<p>edit: And before some snarky jerk tries to score some cheap virtue points by saying something to the tune of &quot;well I am perfectly ok paying more taxes for healthcare&quot;.
