The US has used their forces pretty much exclusively for offensive means in the last decades. Even if the US would be reducing to their capabilities to only defend themselves and their allies they could likely cut military spending in half (this has become a bit more complex because how the US is using its military has caused China to massively expand their spending as well), but that would mean they could not enforce their economic interests everywhere in the world.')
