The power consumption will be tremendously higher than a dedicated device.  The cost for the electronics will be tremendously higher than a dedicated device.  The cost to get an SDR which transmits certified for sale as a wifi device in every country you wish to sell it in will be expensive, especially compared to a dedicated wifi dongle which already has modular certifications.<p>Based on my experience, expect to pay upwards of $5k for an FCC compliance test report from a lab for a not intentionally emitting device which incorporates a certified wifi module.  Expect to pay upwards of $25k for an FCC compliance test report for a device which is an intentional emitter (ie: you put an SDR inside your product as a wifi radio).  If you want to sell outside of the USA, the ratio of costs is (in my experience) fairly similar for many other countries&#x2F;regions of the world.<p>If you feel that you cannot find a reliable off the shelf pre-certified wifi module for your product, I think you would be best served to contact some lower volume wifi module vendors and to speak with them about why you feel their offerings are not reliable.  They will likely be happy to help you, especially if they&#x27;re competing with a multi-hundred dollar SDR for the design win.')
