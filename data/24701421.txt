My little demo covered the difference between F and Shift+F to show how it is case sensitive, and I navigated through multiple pages without using a mouse. I assured them that they don&#x27;t need to learn all of its commands, and they can open a cheat sheet on any page just by typing a question mark.<p>This non-disruptive introduction into Vimium made me think about my old Firefox setup. Back in the XUL days, I was hoarding dozens of add-ons that altered the Firefox UI to the extent that others could not use my browser anymore. They would click on a link and wonder why it is not working while my browser would amass many new tabs at a customized, designated place. The browser worked as I intended, but the extent of my customizations made it unusable for regular Firefox users.<p>Therefore I think that these new, more limited extension APIs offer an overall better experience for end-users. Maintaining usability for &quot;regular users&quot; should be the upper bound for the amount of customization an extension API provides. If it goes beyond that, it seems to get out of control.')
