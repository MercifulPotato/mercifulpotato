This is different.<p>The 2 are interlinked insofar that the counterparty (2) may react to the perceived credit risk (1) , however these are 2 separate risks at play.<p>**\nTo go back to the milkman, the correct analogy would be:<p>Your son wants milk. You go to the farmer&#x27;s market - but you can&#x27;t hand over cash to farmer. Remember, his milk is spoiling, there&#x27;s a huge line to buy, and he just doesn&#x27;t have time to count bills, square exact change, or screen for potential fake bills. He only accepts bank transfers, and you dont have a bank acct. So you buy milk on credit, and agree to settle when he&#x27;s not too busy (as you have always done).<p>Now, the farmer has been noticing you are buying a lot of milk for your son, and the empty milk bottles you left with him on deposit (&quot;float&quot;) are not sufficient to carry all the milk you are buying....so he&#x27;s now asking for many more bottles, which are expensive. He refuses cash collateral - he will only take more bottles, because he&#x27;s concerned about all the cash you seem to be handling recently.<p>You don&#x27;t have extra cash of your own, for bottles. You can&#x27;t commingle funds. So therefore, you stop taking milk requests from son...and the other 10M children')
