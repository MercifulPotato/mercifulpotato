A huge advantage of LLVM is that it is quite easier to rebuild the runtime libraries without rebuilding the compiler. With GCC that&#x27;s a pain, unless one takes the time to re-package GCC very carefully like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;richfelker&#x2F;musl-cross-make" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;richfelker&#x2F;musl-cross-make</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exherbo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exherbo.org&#x2F;</a>.<p>Maybe getting some new GCC devs in there with projects like this would help with that?')
