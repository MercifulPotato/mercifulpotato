I suppose to be really protected you&#x27;d need to go that route.<p>We live in a townhouse with a garage on the main level, so the water comes in on the main level, but basically all of our plumbing is on the upper levels. I&#x27;ve had several times when dealing with different plumbing issues where I turn off the main water valve, then open all the faucets and let the water drain out through our water heater.<p>I guess the weakness in that approach would be if there was a bend in the pipe somewhere to not let the water drain fully out, it would still freeze. I guess that&#x27;s probably why people do the antifreeze method when actually winterizing water lines.')
