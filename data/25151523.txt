Item(by='implying', descendants=None, kids=[25151916, 25162095], score=None, time=1605805322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148000, text='I&#x27;ve been looking for an off-site cloud storage provider that takes encrypted zfs sends, so I believe I&#x27;m in the target market for this. My use case is a home storage server with a zpool of several hundred terabytes.<p>However, there are some product compromises that would preclude me from using this. First, I already manage drive purchases, parity, dealing with scrubs and errors, etc. for my pool. I don&#x27;t want to duplicate my effort for a second backup pool. ZFS sends are, ultimately just a long binary, and I simply want them stored, without much hassle. If I&#x27;m planning a zpool expansion, the work in using this service is now doubled, having to (non-trivially) determine the best pool geometry for my own pool, and for a backup pool made up of differently sized drives.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand why someone would want to give you their encryption passphrase. A service like this should just take encrypted sends, and send them back when requested. I don&#x27;t want my plaintext anywhere other than my own hardware.<p>That said, your main competitor suffers from all of these problems as well.')
