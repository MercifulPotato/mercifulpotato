Air travel in its current form should be more expensive. It should cost a lot more to fly from coast to coast.

Something in between getting stuffed into a tube like cattle, or paying for extremely expensive first class tickets which you may not get anyway even if you can afford them because there&#x27;s so few available on each flight.')
