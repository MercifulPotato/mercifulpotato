Basically it means the party that issues permits, usually the local sheriff or police department, can deny a concealed carry application for any reason. States adopt this policy as a way of punting CC policy making down to the local level.<p>In practice the may-issue policy has repeatedly proven to be an irresistible opportunity for graft.
