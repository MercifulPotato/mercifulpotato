When do you retry?  5 seconds later?  5 minutes?  An hour?  When is the message requeued to send?  When do you stop trying, when the remote side has already said &quot;Hey, this user has no account here!&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, the end user sent a message to bod@ by accident, instead of bob@, and your mail server keeps retrying to send mail, even when the remote mail server said &quot;Hey!  That account doesn&#x27;t exist!&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a typo, but you&#x27;ve decided to &#x27;make things better&#x27;, so now, until that bounce happens, the end user won&#x27;t find out they made that mistake.<p>Things work as they do for a reason, and the people saying 5xx means bounce! are right.')
