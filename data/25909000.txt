Old enough to have used the very first laptops on the market, was looking for a Libretto-like machine, settled with this.<p>What drove me to GPD Pocket 2 was the key size, massive RAM and SSD and that it is extensively supported in the new Linux kernel and several mainstream distros (Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, Linux Mint, Arch). Delighted to report that I type faster on this than a lot of fellow engineers on a standard PC.')
