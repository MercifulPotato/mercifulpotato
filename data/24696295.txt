I would say more adaptive or controllable (which is probably very hard to do). Nature&#x2F;biology has been doing that by trial and error for years, but it takes time and it is not very efficient.<p>I am more interested in #2 as this could significantly improve and make robust detection&#x2F;sensing systems, since viruses constantly mutate changing the binding affinities of detection&#x2F;sensing systems. My background is in bioanalytical chemistry, so as soon as I read about the commonality of viral spike proteins among viruses that idea crossed my mind.<p>Definitely, the human body is a complex system. So if you block the viral spike protein of a virus (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), that could have some adverse effects in some people? Interesting.<p>Thank you for your comments! Very helpful!')
