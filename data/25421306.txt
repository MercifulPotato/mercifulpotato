But, this is an editorial decision and not an absolute.<p>We used to get better news when we paid straight up for it (newspaper cover price&#x2F;subscriptions). But, lets not forget, those papers had advertising too. The difference is that the ads were not the only form of revenue and the papers with the best journalistic integrity were responsible to their readers more than their advertisers. Therefore, news was optimized for readers.<p>Now that most news is paid for by advertising, and because advertising pays out based on impressions and&#x2F;or clicks, we get news that is optimized for impressions and clicks -- which is obviously much worse news than we used to get. This shift in incentive means that news organizations are now more responsible to their advertisers than their readers&#x2F;viewers (and they don&#x27;t like that either, but it is a decision that helps keep the lights on).<p>I don&#x27;t think you can get rid of all advertising. I mean, there will always be advertising. If it&#x27;s not overt, it will become more and more covert. So, I don&#x27;t think the government would be successful in trying to control it further than they already have. Their current approach of transparency is on the right trajectory at least, but it&#x27;s not much of a solution either. It&#x27;s probably ok to allow: overt, paid, and responsible advertising. The key there is &quot;responsible&quot;. No responsible editor should allow an advertisement that interrupts the content in any way!<p>I have worked in all of the industries involved in this issue so I can assure you it will be a difficult problem to solve. Either the incentives have to be flipped, so that the news organizations are incentivized to create the best content for readers (simply inform the public at large in an unbiased way -- the original purpose of &quot;journalists&quot; in ancient Greece). Or, the tastes of the readers&#x2F;viewers has to change so that they reject clickbait news.<p>I don&#x27;t have a lot of faith in readers, myself included, because it&#x27;s often difficult to see that something was clickbait until you read it. I also don&#x27;t have faith in news organizations being innovative enough to get ahead of this problem and fix it. So, I believe we need some kind of third party solution.<p>We need something like those content summary bots that can distill an article into a paragraph, but can rewrite clickbait headlines into boring but factual headlines. Then provide that bot as a browser plugin so the clickbait headlines are replaced for those of us who want a more honest approach to news. Again, not a perfect solution either... I&#x27;m not sure one exists for this problem.')
