Item(by='tekknik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607909214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25408855, text='I agree with you, but one point is (and clearly these are not accurate numbers you posted) these 0.02% cost increases add up. One regulation may only increase the cost 0.02%, but 1000 at the same industry increases it 20%. And all of them increase the cost of entry. If you increase the cost of entry, then you’ll get less competition as smaller business that could turn into flourishing enterprises simply never take off or even get started because someone in their garage can’t find a profitable path. Or afford a lawyer to explain the legal hoops you have to jump through. Recently I was quoted $10k to have a lawyer explain to me 2 points about importing liquor. The result, I didn’t start the business.  This is more of a problem IMO')
