Shia-vs-Sunni Muslims, Mexican drug cartels, endless tribal wars in Africa. Sponsored by the local &quot;top ladder&quot; successfully running the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. I don&#x27;t see anything good in bringing that standard of living to the 1st World countries.<p>And, mind you, China is completely unaffected by the processes tearing the U.S. apart. They are more than ready to take the place, and also they don&#x27;t give a slightest damn about human rights, freedom of association and many other Western virtues. Read about Uighur camps if you have any doubts. Be careful for what you wish for.')
