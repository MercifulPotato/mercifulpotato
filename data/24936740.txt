Item(by='fao_', descendants=None, kids=[24941428], score=None, time=1604009681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934329, text='I mean Extinction Rebellion a racist middle class group, you can tell this by how they blatantly broke with over 200 years of protesting protocol and said to their members that they should get caught by the police, knowing full-well that black people would overwhelmingly be nabbed and have charges thrown against them, and lower-class people would not be able to afford good defense against said charges. I don&#x27;t really know what else to call such a blatant disregard of the lives of those people.<p>They have also been known to collaborate with cops, which as a protestor is the exact &#x2F;last&#x2F; thing you should be doing -- since the state&#x27;s motivation is simply to put down all protests regardless of their method of protesting. You can see this in the UK with the laws against even peaceful protests. And have shown a blatant disregard for taking advice by more experienced protest organizations, some of which have been around for almost a century.<p>All of that being said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very possible to compare youtube-dl, which is a bundle of source and the surrounding contributors, to an on-the-ground protest movement. While there are similarities, there are also many disparities.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, youtube-dl is in a much easier position. Their main website is still operating, and all they have to do is prod people that they know to silently take over, and have those people make an announcement. IANAL but someone that they trust but who is not primarily involved would be ideal. They don&#x27;t have to hand over the keys to the website, just allow those people to make public notifications stating they are the primary replacement, and have them continue the project -- under perhaps a different name and branding. Like ffmpeg and avconv.')
