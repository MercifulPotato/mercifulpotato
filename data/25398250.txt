Experiment just enough that you catch a glimpse of its true power and you become a snob. Your workflow is amazing and anybody who uses Windows&#x2F;IDEs is a lesser mortal.<p>I will say that, while vim has a great, great many advantages, I&#x27;m often honest with those I&#x27;m trying to convert. Like the article said, there is a learning curve and you probably shouldn&#x27;t try to gain the efficiency offered at peak work times, for e.g. with a deadline looming. Also, you accidentally hit a letter key and you can do something far less obviously wrong than inserting that letter into your text. But these are like getting a runny nose from a medicine that saves your life.')
