I think a plan like you&#x27;re suggesting is perfectly compatible with net neutrality goals - I just think there&#x27;s not much of a market. But Google Fi is pretty close - as in not throttled and constant per-GB prices, and you can get extra sim cards for free for your other devices.<p>&gt; Notice that &quot;unlimited data&quot; is once again, however inaccurate as it is, nearly the only way to buy wireless service in 2020.<p>Note that this is not the case in situations where bandwidth is actually scarce, such as satellite internet plans.<p>I think you&#x27;re saying that these businesses have externalized the cost of bandwidth to consumers. I agree that ISPs charge a ridiculous amount, but are you sure this is actually the reason? I would have assumed it&#x27;s more due to the lack of alternative providers that most in the US face.')
