Kids that age need lots of attention and interaction.  At least this one does--I was fine sitting by myself reading a book for hours at that age.  It&#x27;s really hard to maintain focus with that entropic agent running around.<p>That said, I&#x27;m in a fairly high-risk group so lack of focus is a whole lot better than death. As bad as lockdown is for my kid it&#x27;s better than losing one or both parents to COVID.')
