Every time I start Firefox, I&#x27;m turned off by how unpleasant it looks. The UI is just bad. Sharp corners, asymmetrical margins, crowded menus, lack of whitespace. The rendered colors don&#x27;t match Chrome. Fonts aren&#x27;t as smooth. It&#x27;s like switching from MacOS to Linux. Things just don&#x27;t look good, and that matters.')
