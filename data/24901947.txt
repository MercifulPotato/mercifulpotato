It really is, but that tells you nothing about the equipment a contractor needs to operate a construction business.<p>The majority of programming tasks don&#x27;t need anything better than Java, and don&#x27;t need anyone more expensive than the typical Java coder.<p>Low-latency trading is not one of those tasks. In low-latency trading, as in poker or any other zero-sum game, you either rip the other guy&#x27;s heart out and stamp on it, or get your own heart ripped out and stamped on. Using any but the best tooling and programmers means you will be that second guy.<p>So, anybody serious is using C++17, coded by people who understand cache interactions, branch prediction, TLB shootdowns, and core isolation, and who avoid lockless queues because of the cache-line pingponging. If you don&#x27;t know what all that means, you are not the right person to code low latency trading.<p>They are not the hardest core: the sharpest players farm the simplest, most time-sensitive operations to FPGAs. But FPGAs take tradeoffs that make them not right for everything, and FPGA coders are not just programmers.')
