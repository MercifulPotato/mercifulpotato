So yes this represents an economy but the denizens of that economy would be impoverished and miserable, constantly waiting for some outsider to come solve their problems. This is seen in the fact that most people do this as long as their pre existing savings can sustain it because they are doing it at a loss and then they give up when they have eaten through their existing wealth.<p>So yeah, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of a profound insight to point out the similarities to other economies just because of the existence of people engaging in trade with each other. The quality of the trade is the issue, not its existence.')
