I quit it myself several years ago.<p>But recently I&#x27;ve found myself being genuinely inconvenienced by not being on Facebook. My gym for example, uses a Facebook group as its main forum. Several sports clubs and businesses I use now have a Facebook page as their main &quot;web site&quot;. Friends tell me that Facebook marketplace is overtaking Gumtree as the best place to buy and sell. I am missing out on participating in all of these groups.<p>I don&#x27;t blame any of these organisations for opting to use Facebook. They&#x27;re all too small to employ anyone to maintain a website. Facebook no doubt gives them a great CMS and makes everything easy.<p>But it seems completely wrong that I have to submit to Facebook, with its real name policy and abuse of my data, to participate in these groups.<p>The markets for startups in any of these areas must be hugely stifled by Facebook&#x27;s monopoly. Who would be brave enough to start a business building a CMS for gyms at this point?<p>I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but I don&#x27;t see how this is different from Microsoft bundling a browser with an OS. In many ways it&#x27;s worse.')
