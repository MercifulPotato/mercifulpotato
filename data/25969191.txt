Thanks for trying to understand even if I wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear in my wording.<p>Indeed, maximum efficiency is achieved after 12 days in Pfizer data (and similarly in the Israeli data). That&#x27;s the reason some countries consider giving just one - they suspect it won&#x27;t be as-long-lasting without the booster, but that&#x27;s from prior experience, not anything specific for this vaccine.<p>I&#x27;m incredibly frustrated at the amount of people parroting &quot;yes, two weeks after the first vaccine it&#x27;s 50%, two weeks after the 2nd it&#x27;s 95%&quot;. Yes, that&#x27;s what Pfizer said, and I think I managed to reproduce their calculation - and if I did, it is intentionally misleading.<p>It seems a lot of people are religiously believing the headlines without looking at the publicly available data.
