There&#x27;s also a clear advantage that right now, there&#x27;s nothing on Mars, lots of land to place said solar panels, but IMO, that&#x27;s not going to be an issue. We will probably master nuclear fission within the next few decades. Lots of progress has been made, and it will solve our energy needs. What if we run out of deuterium or tritium? Not a problem, by that time, in a few centuries, we&#x27;ll likely be able to build bigger, better reactors that can fuse &quot;normal&quot; hydrogen and maybe even helium.<p>As for the great filter, I&#x27;ve always thought that the real danger is something that would cause say, one person, to have an outsized destructive power. Imagine if we successfully invent nanobots that can self-replicate, for example, and anyone with the right set of skills could program them. In that scenario, it&#x27;s within the capability of any individual to create a deadly disease. You just need one unhinged person to trigger a horrible disaster. Nanotech could be much more dangerous than nukes, and if you combine strong AI and nanotech, I could see that being an immense survival risk.')
