Does Julia have a good desktop programming library?<p>I guess I am wrong. However when I looked at the website (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;julialang.org</a>), in the Ecosystem section, they listed these things:<p>Visualization, General Purpose, Data Science, Machine Learning, Scientific Domains, Parallel Computing.<p>I think they should market it in a different way. &quot;General Purpose&quot; should be expanded to &quot;Web Programming&quot;, &quot;Desktop Programming&quot;, etc.')
