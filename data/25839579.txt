Corruption encourages people to get rich by doing what ever is possible to get an extra buck versus doing what ever is needed to get rich by producing needed goods. Making everyone poorer including the people that steal the money thinking they are better off.<p>I read a story of a government in Central America that was allocating money for ten years to build a hospital in a rural area. 5 years later nothing had been built and the money was gone because the money had been diverted to corrupt officials.
