Item(by='ratww', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609502595, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25602263, text='I&#x27;m not really disputing sales, I&#x27;m more disputing the claim that it <i>changed music</i> or <i>made synth music mainstream</i>. Synth music <i>was</i> mainstream before the DX7. And I don&#x27;t really remember non-musicians talking about the DX7 the way most prog music fans (and also Clockwork Orange fans) seem to know Moogs. Or Hammonds. 80s pop music fans don&#x27;t seem to be the kind to do reminisce about synths.<p>About 909s and 303s, like I said, they were special when they were in their heyday. Most people knew them by name, since there were lots of track titles, there was a TB-303 reference in Ghost in the Shell, and there are some TR-909 and TB-303 tattoos if you search Google... I&#x27;m not disputing that 808s are more famous now that hip hop is very mainstream, the 808 kick drum is in vogue for years and Kanye albums have 808s in their title. My point is that you have to keep those things into context when making a comparison, that&#x27;s it.')
