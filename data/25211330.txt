The behavior I&#x27;m calling out are, for example, the people who get abusive <i>immediately</i> when faced with an out group member.<p>I can work with people whose personal views I consider morally bankrupt. If they start threatening others because of who those others are, that&#x27;s a problem. And it&#x27;s an uncomfortably common problem.<p>People have asked about my politics, and I&#x27;ll often say simply, &quot;I&#x27;m a democratic socialist.&quot; and I&#x27;ve had people tell me I&#x27;m &quot;a cursed person who has drunk from the trough of the demons&quot; and that I&#x27;m &quot;here to destroy freedom and the constitution.&quot;<p>Those aren&#x27;t exaggerations, those are real quotes in response to a short introduction. I&#x27;d be thrilled to get to the point where I could work alongside those types of people.')
