He said that was the greatest thing ever.<p>- - - -<p>You&#x27;re right that &quot;something&quot; is threatened.  I once tried to offer to help people quit smoking on a &quot;quit smoking&quot; support forum and my God did they ever give me hell for it.  I&#x27;m sure that if it had been IRL I might have been in physical danger.<p>I had found a technique that helped me quit smoking and I wanted to try it out with other people.  The folks on the forum were outraged.  Howling mad.  They called me a scammer and worse, and clucked to each other about &quot;how dare he?&quot;, and basically did their best to make me feel like shit.<p>It was shocking, I was shocked.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine (despite being something of a &quot;fringe&quot; character) what it would be like for a major portion of your life to fall into the burn-the-heretic category.  You have my sympathy!  Hang in there!   &quot;Don&#x27;t let the turkeys get you down!&quot;')
