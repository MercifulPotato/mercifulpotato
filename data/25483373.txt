As far as I know, the NIH has only one mechanism for directly supporting staff scientists: the R50. I think the NCI is the only institute that does them, and there aren&#x27;t many.<p>You&#x27;re right that staff scientist can, theoretically, be funded by research project grants...but it&#x27;s tricky. Students and postdoc funding comes from many sources: institutional training grants to the program, individual fellowships from the NIH, NSF, and private foundations, and sometimes even internal money (either as a RAship or in exchange for TAing). Virtually all of these are limited to those within a few years of their PhD[0]. Anyone more senior needs to be paid from research funds. The &quot;workhorse&quot; grant of the NIH is an R01. Most labs have 1, maybe 2, and their standard &quot;modular&quot; budget is $250k&#x2F;year [1]. Profs with soft money jobs typically have to cover much of their salary from these grants. Adding on another $75k + 25-30% fringe for a staff scientist therefore puts a pretty big hole in the budget, even before you&#x27;ve started to buy reagents, equipment, scan time, etc.<p>This biases labs towards hiring trainees. Even if you are paying several of them them with grant money <i>now</i>, there&#x27;s a decent chance that some of them can be moved onto a non-research grant funding stream <i>later</i>. In contrast, the staff scientist costs more now and will definitely cost even more later. Some places are also wary of letting staff scientists write grants[2], which makes it even harder for them to defray their own costs.<p>[0] The CZI-funded &quot;Imaging Scientist&quot; is one notable exception, but for a fairly specific type of person.<p>[1] You can do some extra paperwork to request more than this amount, but people&#x27;s advice on whether this is wise is all over the map and depends on your study section, career stage, and the phase of the moon.<p>[2] Ghostwriting one for the prof to submit is an option, but an unsatisfying one since it won&#x27;t show up on your CV, which makes it harder to (eventually) move on.')
