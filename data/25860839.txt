After a year onboard the USS Honolulu, I remember thinking, &quot;If this is the top 10%, I&#x27;d fuckin&#x27; hate to see the bottom 90...&quot;<p>I did end up spending some time with the bottom 90%, briefly. After the Hono, I was transferred to Patrol Coastal Crew Charlie. At the time we were still attached to SOCOM, so it was a really great, if hard, life. The last 6 months or so of my time in the Navy, we got folded into &quot;Big Navy&quot;. Not fun. At the time, each crew simply flew to an available PC boat, usually to relieve another crew, as 3 PC crews generally operated out of Bahrain and Kuwait at any given time. It was cheaper to ferry most of the PC boats over by large ship instead of trying to sail them, as you generally need to refuel a PC boat every 7 days, give or take.<p>Having to actually do maintenance on our equipment instead of spending hours every week at the range shooting and hours at sea practicing on the twin-50s and the 25mm autocannon was a real drag. I&#x27;m glad I got out when I did. It was all of the fun with none of the work, and then become all of the work and 5% of the fun.')
