Sorry, you have claimed copyright &amp; intellectual property, but we are just going to go to duckduckgo.com and google for whatever we&#x27;re looking for. Your insistence that this (google, noun) is your word has failed; we all know it, why deny it.<p>Whatever the owners of &quot;Muzak&quot; wanted, whatever they thought of it: the dog is out of the yard. It&#x27;s free. Your claim may be legal, but it is, by all accounts, incorrect and false. This word has a meaning now, this passive easy listening background vibe, humming nothings, it embodies something more real than what the owner intended. It&#x27;s falsity &amp; a lie that we let law &amp; property dictate to us the terms by which we think. It&#x27;s said that a rose would smell just as sweet by any other name. Well, society knows these roses, far better than whomever came up with the name. Let us not let the first-comers shape &amp; dictate to us our usages.<p>(Velcro, I am coming for you. Your hegemony over this idea is coming to an end! We will not fall back to &quot;hook and loop&quot; forever, like animals! We all know we need a word. That you own it? Bah! Poppycock! The resistance of your lawyers does not cow me, does not frighten us!)')
