Their devices can be nice if you want something that&#x27;s hardware-standardized and you don&#x27;t care about price-value ratio or ethics or their lobbying or closedness. But you are relying on them being successful in setting the device up exactly how you need it. In OP&#x27;s case, standardized hardware failed to guarantee good performance and now he&#x27;s stuck with a high-priced device with poor upgradeablity.<p>Also, the Lightroom subjective experience as a measurement is a bit problematic, because Adobe products are the kind that prioritize featurefulness (aka bling) over performance and stability. I know it&#x27;s a popular product suite: feel free to express opposite impressions. Adobe&#x27;s answer to this (and it&#x27;s not really fair to single Adobe out) is that you just need a beefier machine; that way the performance issues are offloaded to the user. I suspect that they constantly buy the fastest machines for their developers, because that way developers don&#x27;t notice performance problems, so no time is spent on fixing performance.<p>I wish these developer companies would have a limit on how recent their dev hardware can be (or how powerful). That would cause them to address performance and save users a lot of money on upgrades. There would be other desirable secondary effects because addressing performance might lead to addressing technical debt (Adobe Photoshop has color management bugs dating back decades).')
