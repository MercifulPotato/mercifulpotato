If you read on average 1 book per month and are aged 50, that&#x27;s at most 600 books you&#x27;ve read.<p>There are thousands upon thousands of books that have received awards and are worthwhile (obviously that is subjective but even if you consider 10% to be &quot;worthwhile&quot;, there is still a huge corpus), so to say you&#x27;ve been exposed to all the good fiction is unlikely.<p>I think you need more influences if you are out of ideas. Or you&#x27;re not trying hard enough.')
