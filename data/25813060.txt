Create a few dense population clusters like our current cities on select planets and space platforms and leave the rest to &#x27;nature&#x27;. We already have a declining population growth rate of 1.1 as more people are opting out of starting a family and children due to technological advances and better global socioeconomic conditions. And maybe our current power fantasies of galactic colonization may seem trivial and &#x27;ignorant&#x27; to our future generations. One could also call this a great filter. The possibilities are endless and allows one to enjoy it as a bunch of inconsequential thought experiments. Actual problems that require solutions are usually not fun to think about.......')
