But this choice will not make sense for everyone. If your project includes its own persistence functions, you&#x27;ll likely want a test to get a &quot;CouldntWriteException&quot; immediately from a mock rather than go through all the layers (that you own) to get an IO error (you don&#x27;t own the fs dependency) and all layers back. It&#x27;s a tiny difference for a single test, but once you get to hundreds, it will be a difference between devs getting immediate feedback and &quot;going for coffee, my code is testing&quot; which really impacts productivity.')
