The fact that people are working through the content (of which 80+ hours is plenty, IMO) and then setting it aside to wait for DLC is perfectly in line with my expectations of how people engage with a game like this. Maybe they invited the comparison with grindy looter-shooters by having looter-shooter-style loot, but at its heart it really isn’t that kind of game.<p>Fact is that right now criticism of this game will get engagement, so people are doing it with criticisms that sound spicy regardless of relevance.')
