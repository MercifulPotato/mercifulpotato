Only the &#x27;appearance&#x27; thereof.<p>Moreover, I really don&#x27;t think Apple users in any conscious way are into this - I have never in my life heard a single user hint at this.<p>If you were to ask Apple users &#x27;If you could have a bunch more apps right now, that you do not have because of Apple&#x27;s closed model, and that having those apps would in no way affect the security or integrity of your device&#x27; - would they say yes?<p>Of course they would.<p>This is getting absurd - the &#x27;restrictions&#x27; on Apple, while based on some degree of legitimacy, are also, unambiguously a vector for them to pursue leveraging the control they have on their platform to make money.<p>This isn&#x27;t conspiratorial, my gosh, this is <i>exactly</i> the kind of position every business wants to be in, it&#x27;s like the &#x27;whole point&#x27;.
