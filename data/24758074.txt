Understandably AirBnb wants to create a story of how they brilliantly pulled the plane up at the last minute, and despite laying of 25% of the company, are still healthy and fine.<p>These temporary boosts in one small sector are just blips that mask the fact that the leisure travel industry is in major, major trouble.<p>There was a temporary boom in younger people looking to get out of cities and find some space this summer, but as more and more people lose jobs, or have jobs that are threatened there is going to be a smaller and smaller group of people willing to pay much less for travel.<p>On top of this I&#x27;m still very bearish on leisure air travel. There have been numerous articles on HN about the two major drivers of airline revenue: credit card miles and corporate travel. Corporate travel will never return to pre-covid levels, and credit card miles are a big part of this as well.<p>Airlines are already starting to have major layoffs (when I mentioned this months ago the comments were that this wouldn&#x27;t happen, but here we are).
