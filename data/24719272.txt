You bet Apple will sell your privacy if the deal is good enough.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t think anything can be secure, we must treat everything as potentially compromised and act accordingly. I diversify my emails&#x2F;bank&#x2F;HDD&#x2F;etc... So if one gets hacked, I didn&#x27;t lose everything. Edit- Also those Superstars may be known, but you bet there are experts that would take the money rather than prestige.')
