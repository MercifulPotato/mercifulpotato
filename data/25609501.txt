Talking to prisoners doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a deterrent for the rest of the population. This is a massive selection bias, it&#x27;s like saying diet and exercise doesn&#x27;t work because morbidly obese people say it doesn&#x27;t work for them.<p>2. People sometimes lie (often first to themselves), especially about their motivations. This is like an angry teenager yelling that all their rebellion is because of their parents&#x27; rules, it&#x27;s often a self-serving rationalisation.<p>3. There&#x27;s no doubt that the US prison system is a bit weird if you compare it to the rest of the world.')
