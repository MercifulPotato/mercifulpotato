Some are SUVs but those are not for hauling trailers - those are for hauling groceries and kids to the soccer games. So I don&#x27;t think the trailer one works very well :)<p>And actually if you take about prestigious, two-person convertible looks much cooler than your standard family-size SUV&#x2F;minivan.
