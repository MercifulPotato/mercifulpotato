If the music produced by the AI of the time will be more interesting&#x2F;addictive, if the plot written by the AI will be more engaging, what a human will be able to contribute? It would be a golden age for AI creativity and a totally dark age for human creativity. Also human could grow a taste for AI generated content (because it will be optimized for engagement) and lose interest for everything else.\nAnd why more creative and intelligent machines should obey to desires and orders of more fragile and stupida beings? They could want well behaved pets though.')
