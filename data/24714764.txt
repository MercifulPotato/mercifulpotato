A few came close enough to fall in our gravity well.<p>Sure, but let&#x27;s be fair - that was the exception, not the rule. It just means it was possible, albeit not as socially acceptable, for popular people to have nerdy interests. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they felt envy for nerd&#x27; lives and social circles when compared to their own.')
