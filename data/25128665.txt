It&#x27;s basically the same moat as Facebook. It works better than Uber, I think, because Airbnb is much more travel-oriented so it&#x27;s hard to have a local competitor (who wants to install an app for every city you visit?)<p>VRBO can theoretically compete by being cheaper but comparison shopping between apps is a pain (there&#x27;s no kayak or google maps aggregator).')
