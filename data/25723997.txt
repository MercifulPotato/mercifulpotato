Simply putting up a photo of a traffic light is going to be detected as, well, a traffic light as the car approaches. Maybe with a blind curve or with some other similar obstruction you could create a situation where the photo of the light isn&#x27;t seen until the last second but you can do the same with human drivers and a fake stop sign.')
