Item(by='xpe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610549408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758771, text='&gt; how do you fix this when the leaders of your country are unwilling to do anything<p>We have to find and grow new leaders! :)<p>My general comment is: please, pick one issue you care about, study it, find the leverage points, and make time to get involved. This might mean joining an organization, volunteering, making a tech project to share what you&#x27;ve learned -- even running for office.<p>Based on your username, I would guess perhaps you are already involved to some degree around pollution or environmental issues [1]. Let me know if you want someone to bounce ideas off of. I also can offer this perspective: ongoing dissatisfaction, properly harnessed, can be a great motivator for change.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;niosh&#x2F;npg&#x2F;npgd0576.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;niosh&#x2F;npg&#x2F;npgd0576.html</a>')
