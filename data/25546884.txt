Item(by='alistairSH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609021164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545424, text='In the US, 4WD (4x4) means when the system is engaged, the center diff is locked.  Sometimes there&#x27;ll be some combo of front and rear lockers or LSD units, but not always.  When engaged, the center diff is locked, so these systems are typically only engaged off-road or in snow.<p>And AWD is any system that drives all 4 wheels permanently. In fancy systems, the ratio sent to front vs rear might vary from 50&#x2F;50 to 0&#x2F;100, but it&#x27;s always engaged to some extent.  These systems are safe for regular on-road use.<p>Pick-up trucks and truck-based SUVs usually have 4x4 systems (with a few exceptions like the Land Cruiser and Lexus GX which are both AWD).<p>Cute utes and cross-overs, plus the odd-ball sedans and wagons (Subaru, VW 4Motion, Audi) are usually AWD.<p>Edit - as noted in a sibling comment, the line has definitely blurred with fancy electronically controlled and viscous couplings, but generally &quot;truck&quot; = 4x4 and cross-over&#x2F;wagon = AWD.')
