Item(by='susam', descendants=None, kids=[25324413], score=None, time=1607254006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322611, text='Thank you for the detailed feedback. Some of the styling choices I have made in this CSS come from my own preferences and idiosyncrasies. After all, like I have mentioned in the README, I use this CSS while quickly developing new personal, hobby websites or web-pages which happen to be mostly text-based.<p>Having said that, your feedback is well-taken and I will indeed consider them during my next update to the CSS. In particular, I went ahead and added the style for :focus right away.<p>Thank you for noticing the incorrect case in &lt;h2 id=&quot;Blockquote&quot;&gt;. It was a typo caused by careless yank-and-copy. I have fixed it now.')
