Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609218773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25566538, text='This is roughly what I&#x27;ve been telling the HODLers among my friends and acquaintances for years: there is no intrinsic, fundamental reason why BTC has value.  It has value because people <i>say</i> it has value.  And, if that sounds awfully like the &quot;fiat currency&quot; they tend to heap so much derision on, well, it should.<p>The USD is nothing more than an &quot;economy token&quot; to show how much one is winning capitalism.  Likewise, BTC is some sort of economy token, but I&#x27;m not sure what it means.  I&#x27;m sure the bottom will fall out of BTC far sooner than the USD, and I will welcome that day, because then we can repurpose the electrical power that runs the BTC network toward productive uses, rather than propping up some financialized mirage.')
