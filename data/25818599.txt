A previous paper they mentioned had found a similar relationship but did not extend well down to lower mass galaxies. So these folks created a more general model they are saying. Net result is that the new model affirms that dark matter plays a major role in describing the location and accelerations of the stars in galaxies.<p>It sounds like they are aiming to target smaller galaxies because there is a greater chance that they can more fully understand all of the parts in the galaxy so their are less places for the dark matter to “hide” in the models they build up.')
