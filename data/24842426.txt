Yet, I think with properly recovered meta-data you do not need to splice long videos into separate clips, use ffmpeg to stream from a given file at given place. You keep just 45 .mp4 files (one per tape) and a single .csv (or whatever format you store your meta-data in). Programming tricks will let you reorder or fix clips on-the-fly just by editing your meta-data. That&#x27;s what I plan to do with my video archive :)')
