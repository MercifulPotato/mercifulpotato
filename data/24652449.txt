We combine large-scale synthetic biology, functional genomics, multiplexed assays, high-throughput chemistry and computation to design multi-targeted drugs towards some of our most vexing diseases.

We have many computational scientists and biologists who code, but we now need to get more serious about laying the foundation for our software stack. You will design and build internal products and tools that push the boundaries of synthetic biology, genomics, and drug discovery; manage and improve our codebase, data models, warehousing, pipelines, software architecture, and systems.<p>To give some examples of what we do on the software side, check out our recent open sourced work for COVID-19 testing called SwabSeq: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octant.bio&#x2F;swabseq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octant.bio&#x2F;swabseq</a> or our plasmid sequencing workflow called Octopus: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octant.bio&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;9&#x2F;29&#x2F;octopus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octant.bio&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2019&#x2F;9&#x2F;29&#x2F;octopus</a><p>We are also hiring for a Synthetic Biology Platform Engineer.
