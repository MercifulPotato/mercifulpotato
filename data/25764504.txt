Item(by='traverseda', descendants=None, kids=[25766761, 25764578], score=None, time=1610556330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764177, text='That&#x27;s fine, and I get that gnome is a platform. The problem is that they&#x27;re forcing their platform&#x27;s choices on <i>every</i> GTK-3 app, which makes it really annoying for people who use GTK (not gnome) apps but which don&#x27;t like the Gnome platform.<p>The problem is that GTK was used as a generic toolkit, and they&#x27;ve added a bunch of weird customization&#x27;s to make it work better with their platform. That fucked over a lot of people who used that toolkit on non-Gnome platforms, and for non-Gnome uses.<p>Most people using GTK didn&#x27;t sign up to be part of the gnome platform. Firefox isn&#x27;t a gnome app. They (and everyone else) assumed it was being developed as a generic and cross-platform gui toolkit. Bit of a bait and switch there.<p>The tight integration between gnome (the platform) and GTK (the cross-platform GUI toolkit) seems an awful lot like a betrayal, like taking something that was for everyone and well.. taking it. Making it all about themselves, and burning the commons so other people can&#x27;t use it. Or at least like a heavy-handed attempt to force people to write Gnome apps instead of GTK apps.')
