I maintain a large django app, heavy on the back end and light on the front end. We&#x27;ve been discussing modernizing the front end, which is based on jquery and bootstrap, but the instability of the JS ecosystem really frightens me. As a very small startup, we can&#x27;t afford the overhead of keeping up with everything that&#x27;s going on.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re right.
