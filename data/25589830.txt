Item(by='nsajko', descendants=None, kids=[25593487], score=None, time=1609391780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25589420, text='&gt; evangelizing that technology within the organization<p>Ever heard of the term &quot;architecture astronaut&quot;?<p>&gt; Your typical architecture astronaut will take a fact like “Napster is a peer-to-peer service for downloading music” and ignore everything but the architecture, thinking it’s interesting because it’s peer to peer, completely missing the point that it’s interesting because you can type the name of a song and listen to it right away.<p>I mean, I guess it&#x27;s true that once one understands a certain problem area better than most peers, they will be able to find better alternative tech to solve the problem at hand. But, the other side of that coin is embracing or evangelizing a technology that is not appropriate to the problem (and thus possibly harmful to the business). &quot;Hype driven development&quot; and&#x2F;or &quot;resume driven development&quot; are some instances of this.<p>BTW, I stumbled upon a relatively recent and relatively unknown development in CS (with potential real-world applications in parsing formal languages) some time ago, and evangelizing the technology is on my todo list since then. How to do this without seeming like an architecture astronaut? The fields of parsing and formal languages are actually quite unloved in both industry and academia in recent decades, so a more general question is also pertinent: how to get people interested in something that is widely considered boring, or even a solved problem? I guess starting a blog would be a good idea?')
