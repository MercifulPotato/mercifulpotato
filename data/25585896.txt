Anything out of the ordinary is covered by renter&#x27;s insurance.\nIf you get an awesome job opportunity somewhere else that significantly increases your compensation,\nat best you can hot-swap to the new place for no extra cost; at worst, you pay 1x rent to break the\nlease.<p>The ($2500-n)&#x2F;month for a mortgage doesn&#x27;t include those things.<p>You could get homeowner&#x27;s insurance, but the quality of that coverage is all over the map and\nusually have high deductibles anyway. This is an unpredictable cost. (I suppose you _could_\nadd the deductible into your monthly budgeting, but it&#x27;s still unpredictable for uncovered events.)<p>If you need to move for that opportunity, you either have to rent the house out and hope that your\ntenants don&#x27;t trash the place, or you have to sell it, which can take a long time.<p>Then there&#x27;s property tax, which increases yearly by an unknown amount, just like rent.')
