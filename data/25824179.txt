On the other hand, the OECD defines outpatient care as care that &quot;comprises medical and ancillary services delivered to a patient who is not formally admitted to a facility and does not stay overnight.&quot; Thus, studies like this try to break out &quot;inpatient and outpatient care&quot; as an attempt to represent the &quot;real&quot; service in question, while isolating things like administrative costs.')
