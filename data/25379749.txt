That isn&#x27;t the same thing.<p>I have a counter example to your example. Say the New York Times on Monday runs a opinion column saying trees cause cancer by the Anti-Tree foundation .  It is accompanied by a opinion column arguing trees prevent cancer by the Pro- Tree foundation.<p>(I&#x27;m trying to pick a silly, non-partisan example rather than a political one)<p>It&#x27;s clear the NY Times opinion section cannot be trusted because the opinions are mutually exclusive and make claims on facts.<p>I am saying rather than chop down a tree (before it&#x27;s too late and you get cancer) or plant a tree (to prevent yourself from getting cancer) you should assume both articles are fiction and ignore them.')
