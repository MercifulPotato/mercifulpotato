In that time it didn’t seem like there were any major improvements in functionality to the core Drive, Docs and Sheets (and poor, forgotten Draw) apps. In fact most changes made things worse.<p>Drive’s search is so poor that it’s often easier to get a colleague to resend the invite to a doc than it is find the thing via search.<p>Docs is pretty much stagnant, with the only noticeable new feature being the section navigator on the side.<p>Gmail went from being a stunning demonstration of the possibilities of web technologies to a bloated, over-JavaScripted hog that takes ages to load.<p>Chat services came and went but none of them were particularly better than their predecessors. Just a slightly different arrangement of deckchairs.<p>It’s amazing that Google have left room for competitors like Airtable, Notion and Miro to both flourish and fulfil some of Google docs’ early promise.')
