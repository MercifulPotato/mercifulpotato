Oops. So GitHub wasn&#x27;t legally required to restore access at all even after 10-14 days, since no official counter notice was ever received.<p>That makes it more significant (not merely symbolic) that GitHub chose to short-circuit its DMCA process to restore access and open themselves up to liability in this case.')
