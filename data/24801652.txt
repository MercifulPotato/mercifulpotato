To me this moving of the goal posts invalidates the quality of the RCT. This study from an independent body without a moving of the goal posts is a more trustworthy result.<p>With that being said, anti-virals often only work well when given very early (sometimes even as a preventative) and right now from looking at this study it doesn&#x27;t seem like this was done. So this study may only be confirming what we already know about how anti-virals should be used (at a very early stage) but it will hopefully have the good effect of stopping improper usage.')
