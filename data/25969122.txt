It&#x27;s a test flight of an enormous brand new rocket! It exploded! It doesn&#x27;t matter what the flight plan is or what SpaceX claims is enough clear airspace. Launches of this sort endanger every flight in Texas and several surrounding states. It also endangers many civilians. While the danger can be monitored and controlled to acceptable levels, every single government in the world would want close oversight of this. It would be deeply irresponsible to let SpaceX proceed unhindered with an experimental rocket launch. As a US taxpayer with family in Texas I would be very pissed off if the FAA wasn&#x27;t enforcing the terms of their test licenses.<p>... especially when the rocket EXPLODED. This &quot;the government needs to get out of the way of our billionaire spaceship overlords&quot; mentality would be insane even if the launch was an unqualified success.')
