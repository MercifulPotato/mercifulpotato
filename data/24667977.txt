E.g. if someone has extensive use from NY-USA IP address and the requests came from a Paris-FR IP address then 99% it is an attack and you block or send out email&#x2F;SMS (just in case) or 1% that person&#x27;s company guest WiFi surfaces in another country (e.g. mega-big insurance company in London has corp internet exiting in Chicago and guest network exiting in London).<p>In any case, it is better&#x2F;safer to cause some slight inconvenience to prevent data leak.')
