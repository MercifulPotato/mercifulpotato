But code boot-camp &quot;ML&quot; engineers being all over-hyping is really, really annoying and contribute to the problem far worse.<p>These people are easy to spot: go to an ML&#x2F;AI meetup or community that also shares latest tech. Since those does not understand the underlying math, they cant follow the paper, the talk or the discussion, so they quickly try to shift the discussion to &quot;AI ethics&quot; or &quot;AI will take over the world&quot; hypothetical useless discussions. These seems to also be the first to run out to promise big things with &quot;AI&quot;.')
