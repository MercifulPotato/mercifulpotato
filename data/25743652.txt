Item(by='Born_Again', descendants=None, kids=[25744005], score=None, time=1610438010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25743406, text='&gt; A sequence of neurons firing is not equivalent to the sensation of red.<p>Have you seen videos where people perform experiments on people&#x27;s brains while they&#x27;re awake? The subjects experience sensations that are inseparable from their neurons firing.<p>I would say the sensation of red and neurons firing are the exact same thing to the person experiencing it. It&#x27;s like saying a flashlight that is on is different than photons traveling away from a light bulb with a battery and a current. They&#x27;re the same thing to the observer. The sensation of red is caused by and is only possible by neurons firing. The neurons firing causes and only results in the sensation of red. The observer does not know the difference.<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t even tell you anything about the nature of the sensation of colour more broadly<p>I don&#x27;t think seeing red tells us about the sensation of color more broadly either. I think that&#x27;s a concept created through human discussion, not by our senses.<p>&gt; or why the sensation of red looks the way it does and not like, say, the sensation of blue or yellow instead.<p>I was talking to your point of &quot;but whether that experience of redness itself is information&quot;. I don&#x27;t know why red looks the way it does, but I imagine the reason exists in the physical world and we could find out if we understood the brain.<p>I do think in the future we could activate someone&#x27;s neurons and have them experience red, blue, and yellow in any combination we want. And we could give someone else the same experience (hypothetically we perfectly understand the brain) by activating neurons in their brain. I think that is perfectly communicating color.')
