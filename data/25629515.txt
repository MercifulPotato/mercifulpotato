It doesn’t close HTML tags, it’s just ignored by the parser for XML compatibility. I advise against including it, because it’s simple visual noise, and misleading (people may come to think they can close tags that way, as in XML; but you can’t, and it’s only valid on empty elements like &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt; and &lt;img&gt;).')
