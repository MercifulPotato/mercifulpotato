This usually lands in the 14-18 point range, though if coding on my work MBP directly I have to sacrifice having the file tree visible to get a comfortable font size.<p>I used to as a teenager coding on a 1366x768 laptop use a 8px font size, as that was the only way to get 2 editor panes side by side. I&#x27;m in my late 20s now, so not an old age issue, but would not describe such a font size as comfortable these days. Part of that is monitors today are higher DPI, and part of it is that I now sit reasonable ergonomic distances from my monitors.')
