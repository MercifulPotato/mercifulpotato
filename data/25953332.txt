What is the point of having $1B instead of $100M, or $10B instead of $1B, or $100B instead of $10B?<p>Sometimes the answer is given, that it&#x27;s the same impulse as playing a computer game and money is the score.<p>But the last few days, something else occurred to me, watching the kind of disarray of various billionaire hedge fund types. A big attraction of wealth on that level must be the sense that you&#x27;re smarter than nearly anyone else.<p>This situation punctures that and it seems like a lot of quotes in the news are about scrambling to save face and protect peoples&#x27; self images. I don&#x27;t think they are actually outraged over monetary losses as such.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that people are comparing it to Occupy Wall Street.')
