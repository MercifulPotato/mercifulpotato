And that&#x27;s a valid point.<p>For some topics.<p>RMS has a history of defending or being actively supportive of pedophilia.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a matter of RMS being incapable of speaking about a sensitive topic with grace. If I start raising questions about how smart non-white folks <i>really are</i> and supposing that perhaps only white folks can be in leadership positions, <i>multiple times</i> in <i>multiple venues</i> -- well, folks are going to think I&#x27;m a white supremacist. And the harm I&#x27;ll have done to the non-white folks in my community <i>will have already been done.</i><p>And no amount of (pp.) &quot;carefully phrasing every word because it&#x27;s an extremely charged subject&quot; is going to change that.')
