My point is not to prove anything in court, or to argue that anything related to the election can be proved in court. It is to argue that it&#x27;s completely reasonable for right-leaning people to doubt the integrity of the election. Probably you are aware that a lot of crimes are very difficult to prove in court. That doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t happen, or that people should not believe they happened.<p>&gt;Don&#x27;t spam us with links and tell us to &quot;look at the evidence&quot;.<p>I did neither of those things.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s what the courts are for.<p>I have no standing in court to sue anyone over this.<p>&gt;If Trump is so certain that he&#x27;s right, he should say all he&#x27;s saying under oath. Surely he&#x27;s brave enough to do that right?<p>I don&#x27;t know or care how certain Trump is of anything. I know many on the political right are certain, for excellent reasons, that the Democrats were motivated to bias the election against Trump, and had the ability to do so, and so many on the right are not going to trust the results.<p>&gt;But compared to that complex story<p>Is cheating in elections really a complex story from your point of view? It happens all of the time across the globe.<p>&gt;&quot;liar continues lying&quot; is far more likely.<p>Can you point out something I&#x27;ve said that relies on taking Trump&#x27;s word for something?')
