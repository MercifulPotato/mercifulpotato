I haven&#x27;t had the urge to upgrade from it. However, sometimes I feel guilty for partaking in content that I have ad blocked as the creators lose out.<p>Then I think about how it is that adverts might zonk out my brain, thereby rendering me unable to write helpful pleasant comments that are hopefully well received by the content creators. So being an advert blocking person isn&#x27;t all that bad if you contribute with engaged comments.')
