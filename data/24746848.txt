If you have a script tag with integrity enabled, and the cryptographic hash doesn&#x27;t match, what happens next?<p>From some quick research, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the script tag has built-in support for this. One could imagine something like multiple src attributes (used as a search order for the first valid file), but that doesn&#x27;t seem to exist. So it seems like the web page has to do it manually.<p>Which I guess means you have to have some javascript (probably inline, so you know <i>it&#x27;s</i> loaded and for performance?) to check and fix the loading of your other javascript.<p>If it&#x27;s really that manual, it sounds like it adds cost to implementing this correctly. in other words, it might be one of those scenarios where correctness is achievable, but it&#x27;s a whole lot simpler to just not do it that way.')
