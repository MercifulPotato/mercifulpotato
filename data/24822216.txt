No more than you are the victim for tripping on your shoe laces.  You make choices and those choices have consequences.  Don’t tie your shoes? Trip!  Go out in a sketchy area late at night? Robbed!  You put yourself in the situation, and if you didn’t like the result, you change your actions.  Seeing it as something done to you I think is the exact opposite of the main message.')
