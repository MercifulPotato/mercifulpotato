I sought it out in many cities I&#x27;ve traveled to, to recreate the experience, but either I am unlucky or it is a rarer flavor and many places use ice cubes and not blended ice.<p>It is amazing that the industry has grown to the point where most medium sized cities now have a place where you can purchase boba tea.<p>But for those still lacking, I highly recommend you try making it yourself. You can find the ingredients in just about any Asian market or order the flavor and pearls online. If you go this route, try to get the extra wide straws as well.')
