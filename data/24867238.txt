And of course they&#x27;re not separating those roles. Like Google protecting you from other companies&#x27; ads but not their own, or Microsoft pushing ads on an OS that you paid money for.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve really wanting to get into the phone&#x2F;laptop manufacturing and OS development industries to design better ones that are designed to serve the user. Basically do what Apple does, but more honestly and more open source. No walled garden unless the user wants it (because some do).<p>Of course I have no way to actually start doing that, and I certainly lack the expertise. It&#x27;s not an easy market to enter.')
