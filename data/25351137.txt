The discussion makes sense when designing a language, but when choosing a language, it&#x27;s more important to just look for &quot;compiler makes it possible to enforce that a value isn&#x27;t null.&quot;<p>BTW:<p>In Rust, calling unwrap() on an Option can panic. It&#x27;s just that the compiler will prevent you from passing None to a function that expects a value.<p>C# has nullable scalars: (int? char? float?, ect.) They compile to a Nullable&lt;T&gt; struct, so you can do a lot of generalizing like you can with Option&lt;T&gt;.')
