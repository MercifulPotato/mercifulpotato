For example, coin acceptor that detects what kind of coin you dropped in has x milliseconds to figure out if the coin is to be accepted or not. If it can&#x27;t do it within the time you get unhappy customer.<p>Realtime systems don&#x27;t have to be very performant, but they don&#x27;t have something like 99th percentile latency shooting up. All events must be processed within deadline.<p>Low latency systems are soft realtime PLUS performance.<p>In a low latency trading system you have to respond to market within a deadline to have a chance to do something useful but if you don&#x27;t normally it doesn&#x27;t mean lives are lost, metal is bent, etc.')
