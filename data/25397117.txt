These people really do need anonymity to protect themselves.<p>To reiterate, I was specifically talking about circumstances where people broadcast to mass audiences. If people of a certain minority want to congregate together in a private space to discuss things important to them as though they would in their own house, then they should have every right to do so in private.<p>&gt; And no amount of laws can protect someone from a hate mob attacking them, that doesn&#x27;t care about the consequences. One of the only ways for many of these people to protect themselves, is to be anonymous.<p>I don&#x27;t know what world you live in, but I haven&#x27;t seen a hate mob running down my street for a while.<p>&gt; Actually, it is possible with basically no amount of tech savviness. All you have to do is click the create new account button, on twitter, and you have just been given a pretty large amount of anonymity.<p>&gt; In order to have your twitter account de-anonymized, the government has to take pretty extreme actions, such as court orders<p>That won&#x27;t offer you much protection at all from the government. So you seem to have a lot of trust in warrants being issued justly, but also a great fear that the government will turn against you.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard to get a court order if the government has probable cause that you&#x27;ve committed a crime. There have been 55,000 warrants for US Facebook accounts since the start of 2020. This is not including national security requests, which Facebook is not legally allowed to disclose.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.facebook.com&#x2F;government-data-requests&#x2F;country&#x2F;US&#x2F;jan-jun-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transparency.facebook.com&#x2F;government-data-requests&#x2F;c...</a><p>&gt; Also, the original point that I was countering was this &quot;pseudo-anonymous political discourse on open mainstream mass-broadcast social media&quot;.<p>&gt; So I am talking about specifically why anonymity, in the form of having the ability to do what people do now, which is create anonymous twitter accounts, and engage in political discourse.<p>I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re back on the same page, so would you say that the culture of anonymous political discourse on social media has resulted a constructive political discourse? Is there nothing you&#x27;d change about it?')
