It may eb &#x27;hard to censor&#x27;, perhaps even &#x27;impractical to censor&#x27;, but a powerful enough government will be able to censor anything it wants. Do your think that, if people started somehow publishing &#x27;bad&#x27; stories about the CCP in the bit coin block chain, the CCP wouldn&#x27;t act to remove that content or censor any acces to the block chain itself?')
