It demands a constant upwards curve of resource consumption, otherwise it breaks down.<p>The first thought in most people&#x27;s minds when they hear of a crisis is &quot;what can I buy to help?&quot;, and many others go straight to &quot;what can I sell?&quot;<p>At the very least, they could sell something that is actually useful, instead of crap merch that serves no other purpose than to sit on a shelf for a while before being thrown in the trash.<p>Even better, start using Patreon to fund their media content directly, and offer non-physical bonuses for higher tiers, like early access and exclusive content.<p>It&#x27;s hard to break out of the current consumerist paradigm, especially for the average content creator. But they should as least try to do the least possible damage within that paradigm, while advocating for a better way.')
