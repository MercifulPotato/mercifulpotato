Things like 3 4k subsurface maps on 500 patches maps on a black skinned creature that is mostly covered by fur is grossly unnecessary no matter who tells you it&#x27;s needed.<p>We both know that stuff isn&#x27;t showing up on film and that the excess becomes a CYA case of the emperor&#x27;s new clothes where no one wants to be the one to say it&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>&gt; When working the artist uses 6 paint layers for each channel ( 6 is a massive underestimate for most interesting texture work).<p>This is intermediary and not what is being talked about.')
