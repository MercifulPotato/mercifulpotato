IIRC, Hoefler &amp; Co. and Emigre do this (though it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve looked, so I may have changed this). Their rationale is that since it&#x27;s possible to extract font from a PDF, they need to pay for any font piracy that results from that.<p>(never mind that anyone who wants to pirate the font would just go and find a torrent instead of ripping it out of a PDF... and there are torrents of every notable foundry&#x27;s entire libraries)')
