Partly it&#x27;s because I view being wrong as a temporary state of affairs, that doesn&#x27;t reflect poorly on me as a human, and that I can grow from. Partly it&#x27;s tactical: by conceding, I can focus on more substantive territory, make the conversation less adversarial, and build credibility with others both in the conversation and observing it. I&#x27;ve found it works better than arrogance or insistence.<p>I chose the sentence I responded to because I thought you <i>were</i> putting focus on the term, specifically where you say people are &quot;technically wrong&quot; because functional languages are &quot;less powerful.&quot; My mistake. I was trying to encourage you to consider that the people saying that may be correct in what they mean, even if what they mean doesn&#x27;t correctly align with the use of &quot;powerful.&quot;<p>Just to point out, as well: you have also had the opportunity to acknowledge that <i>I&#x27;m</i> right. If these people are arguing from an incorrect definition of &quot;powerful,&quot; as you say, then they are indeed arguing from a different definition of &quot;powerful&quot; than you are. That fulfills what my original comment set out, which is that you and these people are arguing from different definitions.<p>Perhaps you should have anticipated my focusing on the conversation itself, not because you had boxed me out, but because that was the substance of my comment in the first place.')
