It doesn&#x27;t matter if 95% of your beliefs are similar, if you happen to be in a situation where that other 5% are relevant and express them, it certainly seems like there&#x27;s a good chance the people around you that are less acquainted with you are going to assume you&#x27;re part of whatever group generally expressed those opinions, and categorize you as such.  That can have repercussions at work, where there are often many people you have a passing acquaintance with, but may individually or together have an impact on your work life.<p>I think what this really means is that the more moderate you are, the more likely you are to feel stifled.  Whether you&#x27;re a liberal or conservative, the farther you are to one side the easier it is to know when and around who you can speak.  Either you&#x27;re in a stronghold for your respective group, or you wait until you&#x27;re within the safe-haven of like-minded people in that area.  As a moderate, you hold some views of both sides, and all you ever want to do if discussion comes up is explain how there are reasons why you hold these views that are you believe are rational, but to do so risks people categorizing you as &quot;the other&quot; from both sides.  You learn to keep you mouth shut at all times, not just in one place or the other.')
