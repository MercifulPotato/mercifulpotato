I just think reducing dimensionality of really complex stuff is a waste of our time unless your purely talking about investing&#x2F;gambling and increasing your odds on many bets.

We aren’t an average of a simulation, we are just one scenario.<p>Analogy (because I love analogies): “Seems like people over 7 feet tall make great basketball players.”  This is great but it’s much more interesting that a guy named Muggsy Bogues made it to the NBA at 5 foot 3 inches.')
