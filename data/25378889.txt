MasterCard could report PornHub to the police and still keep them as a customer.  The police (well, FBI, probably) could decide what to do from there.  They might investigate and find that PH isn&#x27;t violating any laws.  Or maybe they are, and get fined or some of their employees prosecuted.  Either way, &quot;this company is doing crimes&quot; should have nothing to do with whether or not they can be MasterCard&#x27;s customer.<p>(Ignoring, for a second, KYC-type laws that can make MC criminally liable for not policing their own platform... laws I think are mostly garbage.)<p>Your analogy doesn&#x27;t fit, because the current scenario (MC kicking PH off their platform) would be like if a daycare discovered criminal activity involving one of the kids they watch and then refused to watch the kid anymore.  (Which would be a bad thing that might make the kid less safe!)')
