It makes little sense to try to write your SQL queries to run fine on multiple different DBMSs. Different SQL DBMSs should be treated as different languages.<p>Presumably the idea is based on an analogy to code portability: it can be good to ensure your C++ code compiles fine with multiple different compilers. Really though, it&#x27;s more akin to writing code that compiles as both C# and Java; clearly madness.')
