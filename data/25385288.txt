The standardization benefited them greatly.<p>Now that ARM Holdings is owned by NVidia I hope \nJensen Huang sees that if ARM is to take over the desktop it makes sense to bring that same level of standardization that allowed the PC industry (and NVidia) to dominate.<p>I think ARM Holdings needs to be the one to spearhead the initiative. It will help industry-wide adoption of ARM (for desktops, laptops and servers) which will benefit them greatly.')
