Shorter buildings (the majority) are up shits creek too.<p>There&#x27;s also a 30M fund for waking-watch relief... Which at 150k per alarm, you can get 200 alarms.<p><pre><code>  &gt; The House of Lords has proposed an amendment to the bill stating that leaseholders won’t be made to pay (note: not forcing the tax payer to pay, just ensuring the leaseholders don’t) and the Housing Committee (namely MP Robert Jenrick) are rejecting this on the basis that the tax payer shouldn’t foot the bill.\n</code></pre>\nAFAIK It was initially rejected because it was worded in such a way that would make freeholders liable for other fire-safety things such as failsafe latches. Prioritizing freeholders paying out hundreds of pounds every decade over bankrupting thousands if not millions of people.<p>It&#x27;s a farce. The building has industry paid millions in donations to the Conservative party since Grenfell. And at every turn despite parroting &quot;leaseholders should not pay&quot; it has been obvious that they really meant &quot;should pay&quot;.<p>Meanwhile, in a fit of hypocrisy, Jenrick has been campaigning for a (Labuor) council to fix a bridge &quot;because they own it&quot;.')
