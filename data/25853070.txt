Debian has existed for quite some time without any need for a corporation. Are there problems? Yes, but Debian isn&#x27;t going to suddenly announce that it&#x27;s going to kill itself either. I would suggest getting involved in the Debian community (without trying to take it over), and making meaningful contributions.<p>If you don&#x27;t like Debian, pick an open source distribution that is not backed by a business and begin sending the money you would&#x27;ve dumped into subscriptions as donations.')
