Each noun in the sentence has at least two different interpretations, and the choice of verbs is poor imo (but maybe [title] English has evolved over 25 years). If you don&#x27;t know that this is about tennis <i>and</i> that there is a Cyclops product in that market, you&#x27;ll probably be lost.<p>Translation for those who don&#x27;t want to read an entire article just to reconstruct the meaning of the title:<p>Context: Tennis<p>Cyclops (&quot;the &#x27;magic eye&#x27; service-line machine) is no longer the only machine helping with tennis rulings. A new machine can now determine if the tennis ball touches the net during the serve.<p>This does not replace the umpire (who now operates this machine via a button), but only another person (the net cord judge) who would have to sit close to the net, in danger of being hit by 100+ mph shots.')
