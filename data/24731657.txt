If you check metrics on HDI indices, economic and social freedom indices and other institutional performance metrics, you will see those countries having multiple problems. Those who emigrated are not doing so in the name of science but because they happen to have desirable, transferable skills and <i>can</i> leave their homelands.<p>&gt; Note also that a significant portion of the current problems bogging these nations down stems from conflict along religious and sectarian lines<p>By the same token this is an oversimplified mischaracterization. Problems are due to authoritarian regimes with corrupt institutions; from higher education to a lack of functioning justice system, which both hamper things internally but also reduces foreign investment in those countries.')
