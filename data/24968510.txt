There&#x27;s a natural path from small instances -&gt; bigger instances -&gt; load balancers&#x2F;ELB -&gt; reserved instances (or spot if it fits your workload). For a smaller company, any savings you&#x27;d get from owned servers would be offset by much higher dev ops costs.<p>Plus, as mentioned, you get a vast menu of services to choose from, all of which are managed. Just in terms of databases alone, you could go with RDS (raw MySql&#x2F;PG), Aurora, Dynamo, Elasticache&#x2F;Redis, DocumentDB (Mongo) and more. Plus managed backups, failover, multi-AZ, security, and connectivity built-in.<p>If your team is filled with devops engineers, then, sure, go with the non-AWS route. But it&#x27;s a lifesaver for agile companies who can&#x27;t afford a lot of infrastructure work and need easy levers to scale, and can afford a modest markup.')
