They are wildly inaccurate and unreliable indicators of power draw under <i>any</i> circumstance. For example, here&#x27;s a &quot;58W&quot; TDP Celeron that can&#x27;t seem to get above 20W: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;IanCutress&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345656830907789312" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;IanCutress&#x2F;status&#x2F;1345656830907789312</a><p>And on the flip side, if you&#x27;re building a desktop PC with a more high-end Intel processor, you will usually have to change a <i>lot</i> of motherboard firmware settings to get the behavior to resemble Intel&#x27;s own recommendations that their TDP numbers are supposedly based on. Without those changes, lots of consumer retail motherboards default to having most or all of the power limits effectively disabled. So out of the box, a &quot;65W&quot; i7-10700 and a &quot;125W&quot; i7-10700K will both hit 190-200W when all 8 cores&#x2F;16 threads are loaded.<p>If a metric can in practice be off by a factor of three in either direction, it&#x27;s really quite useless and should not be quantified with a scientific unit like Watts.')
