There&#x27;s still a lot of excellent engineering being done at Intel that you can&#x27;t find elsewhere. It&#x27;s not like Apple where their core product had eroded into irrelevance, they were making tons of undifferentiated products and they literally had nothing of value except the dying embers of fan loyalty to sustain them.<p>Amongst other things:<p>- SGX is really far ahead of AMD SEV. The latter is probably easier to sell because it&#x27;s marketed as &quot;drop in&quot; (encrypts whole VMs), but SEV has been repeatedly hacked or shipped with obvious gaping design holes that they patch later and call features. SGX is a lot more focused, a lot more flexible and frankly a lot more secure.<p>- Optane NVRAM is completely unique, as far as I know. It&#x27;s only 10x slower than DRAM which is nothing, but it&#x27;s persistent! It totally changes the whole IO hierarchy.<p>- AVX512 &#x2F; DLBoost are able to hold their own against mid-range GPUs for some AI tasks, which is impressive and useful.<p>- Their core chips are still very fast. AMD chips are selling more for less, which is a good position for them to be in, and TSMC&#x27;s process advantage is helping them out for now. But they don&#x27;t have a truly massive edge in tech like Apple&#x27;s competitors had when Jobs returned.<p>- Intel have a long tail of obscure features that AMD doesn&#x27;t, although it&#x27;s often hard to know this. SGX and AVX512 are high profile but there are others that are less well known.<p>I don&#x27;t count side channels as an issue because it&#x27;s also an issue for all their competitors, and frankly I found the near single-minded focus on Intel by the security community to be rather misleading. I even read a side channels paper that admitted they suspected AMD had the same problem but they didn&#x27;t bother to check simply because they didn&#x27;t have access to any AMD hardware in the first place, which was unusually honest.<p>Apple&#x27;s M1 is very impressive in its space, <i>but</i> for high performance cases like servers it&#x27;s only quad-core - you can&#x27;t use the little low power cores for much. Apple have shown no interest in making server parts for a long time, and Apple&#x27;s engineering is bespoke so it tells us nothing about what other ARM vendors can do. So in that space it&#x27;s still just AMD vs Intel and Intel is a long way from being on its back yet.')
