The people that post the messages, telegram for allowing people using their platform to post some messages, or apple for allowing an app to allow it&#x27;s users to post a message. Why does apple have anything to say in this matter. It sounds crazy to me.<p>Or maybe, who knows, the violence is being caused by an opressive regime. Since Apple feels it as the right to interveen is it also taking actions agains the Belarus government?<p>Apple please let me know to which mail should I start sending the mail messages I send from my macbook, so I can get your approval.')
