Unless you’re claiming there is some doubt that she should have had access to that system to send that message, then yes it is hacking. Plain and simple.<p>I run a SaaS business. As part of logging into that company my users send their username and password to my servers which my servers see in clear text.<p>Just because it would be absolutely <i>trivial</i> to save all those passwords in clear text and use the 50% of them that are re-used credentials to login to my customers’ accounts doesn’t mean that it wouldn’t be illegal to do so.<p>The complexity of the hack is irrelevant. Whether you have the correct password is irrelevant. Whether it was authorized access or not, and whether the perpetrator believed it was authorized access or not, is what matters.<p>And as part of the process to determine that, serving a warrant on the home of the IP address of the person who performed the action is appropriate.<p>And waiting at the door for 23 minutes while making multiple phone calls with the homeowner to try to serve the warrant is more than reasonable. It’s frankly how I would hope they would treat me in the same situation if for some reason I refused to come to the door. (Plenty of time to destroy evidence, that’s for sure)<p>They haven’t even <i>charged</i> her at this point. It was serving a <i>warrant</i> as part of the investigation! What, you want them to <i>not</i> investigate? This is bizarre-land politics and disinformation campaign territory.')
