Disinformation and disenfranchisement in our election process is a quick ticket to an erosion of public confidence in an already tenuous electoral process. Whoever you voted for, whether they won or not should be decided within the constraints of the system, and it’s important for those in positions of power to respect that. I think improvements could be made with ranked choice, elimination of the electoral college, etc, but these institutions have served us fine so far. The voting system already has many levels of failsafes, and you can imagine that any opportunity for fraud or malfeasance would be exploited roughly equally by both sides.')
