This + neck rehab resolved my post concussion symptoms very rapidly. They had persisted for months until that.<p>Now I’m wondering if continuing to do those exercises can affect the odds of brain lesions. I know my visual tracking is still not 100%. Do things go in both directions: lesions —&gt; vision issues, improving visual tracking —&gt; cause brain to improve lesions through focus to that region. Or would it only be one way? Very interesting to see the retina&#x2F;optic nerve are from the same tissue as the brain.')
