Declaration that YouTube&#x27;s rolling cipher isn&#x27;t an effective access control or copy control<p>2. Declaration that my actions don&#x27;t count as marketing in violation of 1201(b)(1)(c), or alternatively that any marketing was not in violation of that section.<p>3. Declaration that my fork of youtube-dl isn&#x27;t primarily designed or produce for the purpose as in 1201(b)(1)(a)<p>4. Declaration that youtube-dl has substantial commercially significant purpose or use beyond circumvention on copyrighted content, as per 1201(b)(1)(b)<p>I don&#x27;t think access controls is a winner, although I&#x27;d probably throw in the analogous declaratory judgement counts for 1201(a)(2) just in case.<p>Depending on how RIAA defends it, I could add declaratory judgement counts addressing their specific claims.')
