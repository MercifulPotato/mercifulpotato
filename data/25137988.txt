I think the main thing you lose is popularity and ranking from other people&#x27;s past searches - that could be built in but it relies on trusting the individual indices, which would be distributed and so could be modified to fake popularity or return results that were not wanted (though then one could just cut off that part of one&#x27;s search network).')
