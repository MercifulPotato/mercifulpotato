Barring blatantly illegal stuff, when and why should a platform like this (especially like this) itself enforce its self-made policies and act as a censor?<p>If it&#x27;s an open vox populi platform, and if something isn&#x27;t illegal (as in quotable in law), why should a platform have its own police? Leave it to, err, police? Of course, that opens up a question of whose police and laws if the platform is global... However, my point is, if the platform is non-moderated, why censor on your own?')
