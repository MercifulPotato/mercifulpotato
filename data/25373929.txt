The world is in CONSTANT change and I couldn&#x27;t care less how many jobs Morgan Stanley shifts out of the UK or how many offices Netflix opens in the UK. Things change. Instead of being anxious about every change we should be looking forward to the future, think about what we want it to look like and then regardless of what is happening around us now take baby steps towards that future which we want now. Honestly, the world as it stands now if complete full of bullshit. The idea of globalisation is bullshit. The idea that all countries in the EU have the same goal is bullshit. The idea that companies being able to register in the most tax friendly country in the EU, produce goods where factories are the cheapest and ship goods freely to where they can sell the highest is good for anyone except the execs of those companies is complete bullshit. None of the 4 freedoms of the EU is actually beneficial to regular people, who have no choice where to pay their tax or under which employment laws they want to be employed. The current status is bullshit so any change should be celebrated, even if it seems detrimental in the moment. Only change will get us to a better place, whatever that might look like and if it won&#x27;t then at least it was worth trying. Life is too short to live in a pre-defined box for all our years and never be brave to do something crazy different. I&#x27;m not English, I was an immigrant my whole life wherever I was and maybe that made me see through the majority of bullshit or just tougher in my approach to life and realise that nothing is more depressing than not going through change.')
