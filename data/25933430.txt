Imagine a &quot;gas station&quot; being able to store at least 10-20 of them, as well as all the machinery that swaps them. Then figure that the value of 20 battery packs is roughly $15K each. Then add the facilities cost, rent, staffing, insurance etc. A gas station is pretty cheap overall, just tanks and self-service pumps with a stooge selling cigarettes inside. The value proposition just isn&#x27;t there.')
