When we give our birth date, we are effectively lying, as we don&#x27;t know, even though we were there.<p>I believe that there is a past that was laid down.  But I don&#x27;t think we know it.  We are told and taught is what is most expedient in order for our behaviour to be managed.  (Take a look at Star forts to see what I mean - you weren&#x27;t taught about this global build style at school.)<p>As we don&#x27;t experience evolution, why should we believe it is true?  We can experience selection of the best fruit etc, choosing and breeding the best tomatoes - but this is not evolution.  This is just selective breeding.<p>In the same way as I think history is whatever is expedient, I think the same about science (and religion).<p>I personally believe that the scientific method is a fantastic way to better understand the world.  But it has to be done personally.  The problem is that science does not use the scientific method, regardless of how much it pays lip service to it.  Science relies on trust and scientists have faith that all the steps are there - its just they were taken by someone else.  But the steps are not there, and no one is checking anything.  These are mistaken assumptions, or stories and no one seems to care or notice.<p>If you want an example of how little we know in science, try and make water out of the 2 gases, in controlled conditions.  I will pre-empt any further questions on this, until you have looked online, or put up an experiment of your own.  There are lots of loud pops, but what I see is water already in the air condensating against the glass.  If you find a good example of water being created - and we should be able to create buckets of the stuff right? - please run it past me and see if I agree.  I promise to be fair, and explain my reasoning if I disagree.<p>My view is that we live in a fabricated reality, where we have created types and classifications - but that these are ideas in our own minds.  We are not describing reality, we are describing our classifications.  We are lost in our stories.')
