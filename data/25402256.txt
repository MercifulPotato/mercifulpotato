Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25402577], score=None, time=1607811239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402070, text='&gt; This logic makes sense, with one exception: this assumes that the standard for release quality remains unhindered pre&#x2F;post swapping the position of RHEL &#x2F; CentOS.<p>There&#x27;s another issue, which I haven&#x27;t seen talked about so far. With CentOS downstream from RHEL, there were the Release Notes: before updating from CentOS 8.x to CentOS 8.y, you could read the CentOS release notes (and the voluminous RHEL release notes corresponding to it) to see if there was any breakage to expect for your use case. For the security updates within a release, you could follow <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.centos.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;centos-announce&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.centos.org&#x2F;pipermail&#x2F;centos-announce&#x2F;</a> (sadly non-working for CentOS 8) and&#x2F;or the voluminous RHEL errata pages corresponding to it.<p>With Fedora, before every update I glance at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;admin.fedoraproject.org&#x2F;updates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;admin.fedoraproject.org&#x2F;updates&#x2F;</a> to see if there is any known issue with the update I&#x27;m about to do; this has saved me more than once (for instance, there was a broken selinux-policy update which would relabel the whole &#x2F;home not long ago). I recall Debian had something similar (which shows you any release-critical bug recently filed for the packages you&#x27;re about to install). Will CentOS Stream have something like that? If I run &quot;dnf update&quot; and see it&#x27;s about to update bash, is there anywhere I can look to see what changed, and whether someone complained about the update?')
