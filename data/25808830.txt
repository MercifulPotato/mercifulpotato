General liability law was evolving in ways which were starting to make that clear at the time the Communications Decency Act was being drafted, which is why Section 230, a protection that was seen as essential to prevent the imminent destruction of the participatory net, was included in the CDA as a major tool to get political support for supporting the state censorship that made up the rest of the CDA. (Perhaps ironically, Section 230 is the only operative part of the CDA not struck down as unconstitutional.)')
