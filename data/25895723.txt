I really can&#x27;t see how living in a boarding house is anything like co-living?<p>A boarding house is generally someone&#x27;s primary residence where the owner lets out one or two spare bedrooms to lodgers and often provides them with meals and the like.  They were mainly used by the transient, single and&#x2F;or poor.  Boarding houses hardly exist any more in the west.  The classic boarding house owner was a widow back in the day when employment opportunities for elderly women were fairly bleak.<p>Co-living has grown in the last decade in many wealthy western cities and provides accommodation which is somewhere between staying in a motel and renting a studio apartment.  It&#x27;s generally more expensive than renting a studio - because of the flexibility - and typically targets visiting professional workers or wealthy students.')
