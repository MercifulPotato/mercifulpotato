Maybe I just forgot.<p>&gt;people who are actually good at bringing people together<p>From the essay (in a footnote):<p>&gt;It&#x27;s interesting how many different ways there are not to be earnest: to be cleverly cynical, to be superficially brilliant, to be conspicuously virtuous, to be cool, to be sophisticated, to be orthodox, to be a snob, to bully, to pander, to be on the make. This pattern suggests that earnestness is not one end of a continuum, but a target one can fall short of in multiple dimensions.<p>The closest thing on the list to &quot;bringing people together&quot; in my mind would be being cool, which isn&#x27;t very close IMO.<p>&gt;In a world where we increasingly realise the dangers of big tech companies making decisions that impact all of us, including people completely outside of the original tech bubble, I don&#x27;t think this is a very good position to take.<p>I don&#x27;t trust the general population to make decisions either--see our current president for an example of what they can sometimes go for.')
