Google completely redesigned their App Engine pricing scheme in 2011. In practice this meant a 65x price increase for one of my small services. [1] Among the changes was that the 2008-2011 pricing was based on CPU usage, while in 2011 they stopped charging for CPU usage and instead introduced a slew of other pricing metrics, including the classic VM instance idle time.<p>While the pricing changes frustrated me, they did not drive me away. What ended up having a much bigger impact was that Google just deprecated everything. Some parts of classic App Engine still run in legacy mode, but get no updates and instead you get constant notifications that you should rewrite your app to fit the new Google Cloud model.<p>--<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaurkuut.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;google-app-engine-is-a-classic-bait-and-switch-scam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaurkuut.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;google-app-engine-is-a-classic...</a>')
