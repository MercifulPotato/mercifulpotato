It sounds great in practice, but simple things like showering, defecating and preserving food become very difficult.<p>I suspect that with farming or homesteading, you forego things like financial safety and the ability to take vacations. I value those things a lot.<p>In my opinion, the best way out is a lifestyle business, or spaced out consulting gigs. Work all winter, play all summer. Alternatively, spend a few hours a week on your project, and the rest of your time doing what interests you.<p>This is what I do, and it made me realise a few things:<p>- I really like programming when it&#x27;s not for someone else. It&#x27;s what I end up doing the most with my free time.<p>- The biggest benefit is having so much free time to fill with things you enjoy. This probably isn&#x27;t the case if you try to live off what you grow.<p>- I don&#x27;t spend nearly as much time in the garage as I thought. Woodworking or motorcycle repair are hard, and the initial setbacks are extremely demotivating. You won&#x27;t hit the ground running, so you better prepare for disappointment.<p>My initial dream was to work on motorcycles all day, but I can barely find the courage to work on my daily ride, let alone the 40 year old Honda gumption trap that&#x27;s spread all over the shelves. It&#x27;s hard to jump from something you&#x27;re proficient at to something that you completely suck at. I&#x27;m just glad that my life doesn&#x27;t depend on it.')
