Or the one who insists on expensive message queue tech when async&#x2F;await is more than sufficient. The bro that mansplains directed graphs at a PhD because she comitted the cardinal sin of being a woman. The infrastructure manager that micro-manages a developer because that manager was too lazy to stand up the test environment on time.<p>We all know someone like that, and after 30+ years in this industry it seems it&#x27;s worse now than it was in the 90&#x27;s. Back then all we had to contend with was Windows v. Unix and bastard operators from hell(1). Today it&#x27;s more insiduous. Often well-dressed, veiled in charm and confidence and hiding behind a big pay check because they&#x27;re adept at managing upwards. I can deal with it, which has another unfortunate side-effect - other developers want me to manage, I just want to write code.<p>Amusingly (sadly?) these problems(2) were identified in the 80&#x27;s if not earlier. Books were written about dealing with it (2 and 3, amongst others). But still we allow the behaviour and often organisational&#x2F;industry culture encourages it (fintech, anyone?).<p>(1) <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bofh.bjash.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bofh.bjash.com&#x2F;</a><p>(2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wicked_problem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wicked_problem</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;013590126X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;013590126X</a><p>(3) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peopleware%3A_Productive_Projects_and_Teams" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peopleware%3A_Productive_Proje...</a>')
