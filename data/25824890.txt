GraphQL might seem like an interface to query the database, but I think it’s the reverse: an interface to populate the front end.<p>It is a constant struggle advocating for that when everyone seems to default to expect the GraphQL schema should just model the database tables. But I think it’s worth it. It gives you a fighting shot at heading off otherwise inevitable spaghetti UI code.')
