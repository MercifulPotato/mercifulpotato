I do not find them bizarre. Their diversity or bespokeness doesn&#x27;t register as a hindrance to me. The options are visible all at once, or are a couple of clicks away. Contrast this with the command line where I more or less have to memorize each application&#x27;s interface or look online or browse the manual for answers.<p>GUI lets me use keyboard + mouse. CLI is keyboard only.<p>Regardless of any rationale, my experience is what it is. No amount of counterpoints are going to change what I&#x27;ve felt using CLIs.')
