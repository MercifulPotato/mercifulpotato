It takes time and practice and honest connection. How I see it is that the core message should really be about open communication, and not a trick that you use to get feelings out of another person or make them do what you want. In the beginning I was quite unskillful and used the lines a lot as guidelines, but now I can sort of listen better and I don&#x27;t really need them so much anymore. But talking about that you&#x27;re trying to apply NVC or methods that help to connect with the other already opens up empathy usually.<p>Also some days I connect more, and sometimes I do less. Sometimes I trap myself that I&#x27;m not really wanting to talk just to be angry and make point but after some time  I&#x27;m just like &#x27;What the heck am I even doing&#x27; this is not gonna help at all. And then I switch to listen mode, and try to express my worries and try to find a connection.<p>It is practice but it made my life a lot better.')
