Local police can be <i>extremely</i> petty and <i>extremely</i> violent [1]. If a police officer told me he&#x27;d let me off for a bribe, I would probably pay it. I wouldn&#x27;t be paying to get what I want. Rather, I would be paying to  avoid the appearance that I disapprove of the bribery (and the possibility of resulting reprisal).<p>E: And, of course, I would report that bribe as soon as it was safe to do so. And, of course, I&#x27;m referring to a scenario where I, as an individual private citizen, am told to pay money to a person with a gun who controls my immediate safety... which, importantly, brings us to the second half of this comment:<p>But this isn&#x27;t that.<p>A high-level exec at one of the world&#x27;s most powerful companies paying off a local LEO for a permit instead of, IDK, contacting the State or the Feds, is beyond inexplicable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oklahoman.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;5666549&#x2F;woman-recognizes-attackers-voice-in-threatening-messages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oklahoman.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;5666549&#x2F;woman-recognizes-attac...</a>')
