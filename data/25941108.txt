My prediction is reddit will shutdown wsb because that&#x27;s what reddit does. And there will be more laws made targeting individuals engaging in this sort of activity (basically coordinating with groups of people). This may hurt newsletters and other financial venues. The large hedge funds will be fine, we might see a few bailouts, and life will go on.<p>I totally agree, but it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a level playing field now. If the new regs enshrine the current reality in law then maybe there&#x27;ll be more hope for fundamental reform.<p>Basically what we probably have now is a behavior that is legal so long as no one engages in it. Losing a fake option is not losing anything.<p>&gt;  I don&#x27;t see how this is different than what is constantly being criticized such as flash crashes, contagion and large moves based on rumors, other than the group benefiting (fiscally irresponsible internet strangers vs fiscally irresponsible professionals)<p>Isn&#x27;t that the whole point WSB is making? This <i>is</i> not different and the media treating it as something crazy or new is disingenuous.')
