It&#x27;s not too hard to find pockets of areas that will have &quot;better&quot; weather for humans.  I live in the middle of nowhere where it is expected at least in the next 80 years even with the doomsday 8 Celsius temperature change scenario that the water aquifer will rise (more freshwater for humans and agriculture) and the weather will be more mild.  Evidently some people are paying attention - lots of people moving here from the coastal US for a variety of reasons, I&#x27;d imagine climate being a small factor to move.  No reason to be excited to move to the middle of nowhere but people are already watching and listening for where to move evidently without any large-scale planning at the moment.')
