Only engineering is heavily male dominated, with slight male leads in business, philosophy, history, and religion. But they are a majority in everything else otherwise, sometimes even more than men in engineering.<p>I&#x27;d argue that this is the problem. There has been a weird conservatism about education, with &quot;men are from mars and must go to STEM (but we want girls too) and humanities as well as everything else is for venus.&quot; The whole &quot;durr hurr basket weaving major&quot; posturing has kind of dissuaded men who aren&#x27;t into STEM (and there are a LOT of them, the stereotype that all men are STEM or greasemonkey types is one of the most obnoxious ones out there) to probably not go into those fields.')
