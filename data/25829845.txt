One example that I am familiar with is Interstate 84 across the Poconos in North-Eastern Pennsylvania. I located one section of this highway in Google maps [1]. Using the distance-mearsuring tool to mark out a square kilometer, it was clear that, if these blocks were square kilometers, or some other compact shape of that area, the highway would not appear as thin as it does, and one would not be able to pick out the wiggles in the highway&#x27;s route, which actually show up in considerable detail.<p>Maybe these roads (and also streams, which show even more detail) are additional features on the map, unfortunately also colored green, but if so, the selection of which ones to show seems rather arbitrary.<p>Regardless, there are also several sections where it seems implausible that there is any dwelling within a kilometer&#x27;s distance of the highway - for example, either side of I-84 at [2], yet, on the census map, the highway threads through here as a thin green line on a white background ([3]; south-east quadrant.)<p>At the very least, it seems unlikely that the blocks are arranged as a uniform square grid.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapsbynik.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;census0pop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapsbynik.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;census0pop&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;41%C2%B020&#x27;59.2%22N+74%C2%B056&#x27;47.7%22W" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;place&#x2F;41%C2%B020&#x27;59.2%22N+74%C2%...</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapsbynik.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;census0pop&#x2F;tiles-140420&#x2F;TileGroup150&#x2F;9-376-44.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapsbynik.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;census0pop&#x2F;tiles-140420&#x2F;TileGroup1...</a>')
