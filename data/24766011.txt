Item(by='greggyb', descendants=None, kids=[24766916], score=None, time=1602600112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24763247, text='And the &#x27;cetera&#x27; means essentially &#x27;the rest&#x27;. Though it is common in modern usage to to use &#x27;et cetera&#x27; to imply a continued list of items not named. A stricter interpretation would only use &#x27;et cetera&#x27; to refer to the rest of a full list that has been previously explicitly enumerated earlier in the text.<p>As an example:<p>The authors of the text were James, Malik, Susan, Srini, and Ying. ... &lt;some more text goes here&gt; ... This was the primary finding supported by Srini, James, etc.<p>Above, the usage of &#x27;etc&#x27; is to shorten the sentence, by avoiding a second instance of the full list.<p>A simple translation to English shows that the common usage can leave much up to the interpretation of the reader.<p>As an example:<p>I like sweet foods: cherries, apples, grapes, and the rest.<p>So, do I actually mean fruits? Do I mean all other sweet foods that exist? This sentence leaves a lot of interpretation to the reader, and depends on shared context to have any useful meaning. This usage of &#x27;et cetera&#x27; generally means &quot;and more in a sequence made up of items categorically in line with what I&#x27;ve named, which I assume, you, the reader, can infer.&quot;<p>This reply is not meant to critique modern usage. Language is a fluid thing, and the use delineating implication, rather than eliding a fully enumerated list, is perfectly acceptable in the vernacular. I just wanted to share some additional nuance regarding the phrase.')
