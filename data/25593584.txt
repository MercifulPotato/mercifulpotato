It very much seems like this is a matter of perspective.<p>&gt; Taxpayers aren&#x27;t subsidizing the company. Taxpayers are subsidizing themselves.<p>Again this seems like perspective. The taxpayers as a group may be subsidizing themselves but the individual making enough to support themselves would be subsidizing others. So from their perspective they are paying for a companyâ€™s unwillingness or inability to pay a living wage.')
