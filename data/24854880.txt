And actually read her what I&#x27;d written (a Hacker News first for me). And she helped me see that I come off as sort of a woman-CEO-bashing programmer dude.<p>And yeah, I don&#x27;t think any of us want that. It&#x27;s fascinating though how we (not the OP, but perhaps myself and others) so easily jump on the criticism bandwagon for Marissa Mayer, Ellen Pao or now Meg Whitman. I don&#x27;t think we do that for male CEOs as much.<p>Anyway, just noting it for those reading this later. Poor choice in wording in the above (I actually love my dog a lot - but the wording probably comes off as insensitive). Which was not the intention, but a good learning moment for me.')
