They also tend to be quite lenient on unintended bills.<p>Additionally, bill cutting is not that easy. Should they shut down current services? Stop sending in the middle of a newsletter? Delete your S3 Storage? Even then, a large company might accumulate hundreds or thousands of dollars within a second ; even if they decide to cut at all cost, minimal delays might break the limit.<p>I fully agree that it sucks for experimenting; it is very much the reason I don&#x27;t have an AWS account. But I can see why they don&#x27;t have it.')
