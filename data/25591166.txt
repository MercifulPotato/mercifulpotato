Before the virus, just like before the housing crisis and other issues, people have pointed out failings of the U.S. and they were brushed off by people with the attitude of “nah, can’t be, the U.S. is the greatest country”. But now with COVID-19, it has shown what a complete mess of a state that the U.S. is in, as clear as can be. It is barely functioning it seems and really shows that no, all these questions about the U.S.’ ideology, operations, organization, etc. are not just conspiracy theories. The failings are very real and apparent. But yet, I see almost no real concern among anybody. It feels like a twilight zone in which everyone’s just seemingly cruising along while all these warning signs are everywhere. Unemployment is a nightmare, supply chain inefficiencies are high, gun sales are at an all time high, stock market is bullish, real estate and small business are tanking, etc. I just don’t understand what’s going on, and it is very scary.<p>My check for paying my landlord was late this month because it was in the mail for over three weeks. It took the RMV almost two months to reply to my inquiry through their official email system (their phone system just hangs up on you and tells you to call back tomorrow). I haven’t seen my fiancée in almost a year now because of lies and inefficiencies in the visa system. Just nothing is normal. Everything is slow. There is <i>no one</i> to get help from. The only option to even attempt to rectify an issue in the U.S. is to hire (i.e. dump thousands into) a lawyer. We, the people and poor, are rather powerless.<p>It’s just all confusing and scary as to how powerless and vulnerable we all are to the giant corporations and few politicians who run this country. And now with COVID-19, it’s even scarier because of how little anyone cares. There’s a real sense of just burnout or apathy or both.')
