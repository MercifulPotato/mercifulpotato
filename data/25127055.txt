It&#x27;s summary of ROC&#x2F;PRC argument, which predates others and had garnered major international support in a time when these disputes had no geopolitical relevance.<p>This is what I don&#x27;t agree with. It seems you were referring to those treaties to show that the world accepted China&#x27;s argument. But I don&#x27;t see the evidence of that; at most they were just non-committal.<p>Of course it matters how good their argument is â€“ if it was stronger than enough countries would be interested in maintaining stable international order to back them up.')
