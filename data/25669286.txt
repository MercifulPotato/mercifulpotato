Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25670519, 25669510], score=None, time=1610013797, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668351, text='&gt; The people who invaded the capitol today, at least some, probably thought they were protecting democracy.<p>What they thought is irrelevant in a country that believes in the rule of law: they were attacking the highest institution of one branch of government with the express purpose of forcing them to overturn the legal result of the election and install their preferred president. This is an (attempted) insurrection, and there are no two ways around it.<p>Comparing this to an attack on a courthouse is patently absurd. Especially since the courthouse was not attacked for &#x27;toppling the government&#x27; - I can&#x27;t even imagine where you came up with that - but because it was known that arrested&#x2F;kidnapped protesters had been held inside the courthouse building. In general, none of the BLM or Antifa protesters are interested in &quot;toppling the government&quot; - they are interested in &quot;toppling&quot; the police and in stopping the white nationalist fascists that police are openly supporting from taking over the country.')
