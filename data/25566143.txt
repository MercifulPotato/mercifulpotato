Choosing what to report and how to report it. Which facts, how they are presented, etc. Listening to mostly left leaning shows, even when they think they&#x27;re just reporting the facts I hear in their voice, their choice of questions, how they ask the questions, how they respond to the answers, which ideas they agree with and which they don&#x27;t and in essence which ideas they want you to believe and which they don&#x27;t.<p>PS: if that wasn&#x27;t clear I don&#x27;t listen to many if any right leaning shows. I listen to radiolab, this american life, flash forward, no stupid questions, etc....')
