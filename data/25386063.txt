Item(by='mncharity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607696477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383575, text='&gt; goes back many years<p>I&#x27;ve sometimes wondered what might have happened if 9&#x2F;11 had occurred a couple of months later.  My fuzzy understanding is that through 2001, US DoJ was working up a major effort, a &quot;War on Porn&quot;.  Mid September, shortly before kicking off, that focus became an embarrassing liability, and was quietly shelved.  So instead of a big explicit declared War, with associated societal reflection, we&#x27;ve had a long quiet shadow war, with misdirection integral.  Though hoping for societal political reflection seems increasingly quaint.')
