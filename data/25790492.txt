Or any other coin for that matter?<p>Price in which terms? USD? USDT?<p>Suppose it turns out tether is a fraud. What will happen? Tether holders will try to sell it for USD or Bitcoin. High supply of tether will lead to higher BTC&#x2F;USDT and higher USD&#x2F;USDT rate. Those who managed to convert tether to BTC will likely try to convert BTC into USD. This will lead to relative over-supply of BTC versus USD and BTC&#x2F;USD will decrease.')
