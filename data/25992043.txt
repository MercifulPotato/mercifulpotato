Making a routine and developing habits is a good way to do this.<p>Big items to automate:<p>- Food: I have roughly the same meals a couple of days in a row. This makes cooking easier and takes the overhead of figuring out what to eat when I get hungry.<p>- Exercise: I got for a run in the middle of the day before my meeting. Having it in the middle of the day means there is not a lot of time to second guess. It creates time limit in my morning cause I want to be at a good stopping point before I run.

Before that I do the dishes and clean the kitchen. It’s a routine that helps me get in the right mindset for rest.')
