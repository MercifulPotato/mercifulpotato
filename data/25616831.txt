(No Carrier Peering enabled).<p>I was then told &quot;is caused by VM-to-VM egress when both VMs are in the same Google Cloud region, regardless of zone, when using the external IP addresses (per GB). &quot; (Only a single VM in the account).<p>I was then told &quot;VPC Network is not included in the Free Tier program. You are running an external IP addresses that is causing the charges on your account. Regular network pricing still applies to all traffic.&quot; - I suspect a little disingenuous as a VPC is zero cost. I expected Egress to be billed but only to certain regions outside of the free tier and only after 1GB of traffic to other regions. Neither of which are the case.<p>Is any one able to shed any light on this?')
