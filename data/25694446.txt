That&#x27;s patently silly. Your life and liberty do not depend on you owning a smartphone. This is an app on an app store. Do I think it&#x27;s a great precedent to set? Not really, despite my political beliefs being heavily progressive. But this overblown reaction is bananas.<p>Like, my life is proceeding just fine without either WhatsApp or Oculus products. Or a Facebook account that I use, for that matter.<p>(edit: For the record, the reason I am not happy with the precedent is that isolating communities like this seems to usually just serve to increase radicalism rather than remove it.)')
