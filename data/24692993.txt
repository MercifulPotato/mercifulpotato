You can&#x27;t arrest people who don&#x27;t want to be arrested without the threat of violence and you can&#x27;t deter them from engaging in criminal acts that benefit them without giving them a credible threat of enforcement.<p>the social function of handling sensitive situations is also inseparable to a large degree, and we already have social workers who handle this function when it can be separated. frequently police are called to a domestic violence report that where there has been no dv, or a neighbor trouble report where the neighbor causing the alleged trouble is mentally ill. there isn&#x27;t always a way to know, and dispatching social workers to these incidents in the past has resulted in the social worker being a victim of violence.<p>&gt; Finally, joining the police force means willingly taking on the social function of violence and intimidation for the state<p>Indeed, and among the individuals who find this prospect attractive are some of the people who are also potential organized crime participants. Those people aren&#x27;t going away, the best you can do is to channel their aggressive tendencies into a force for social good that is constrained by norms and incentivized by the prospect of a steady income.<p>&gt; as well as forces you to engage in corrupt behaviour against the interests of society, the so called thin blue line.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that this behavior would go away if you changed their uniforms. Organized crime has a long tradition and predates the beneficent social order we have fought to replace it with.<p>&gt; As long as these social functions and social constructs permeate law enforcement it will be a problematic institution, and once they aren&#x27;t anymore it will be a tremendously helpful and appreciated institution.<p>respectfully, I suggest you articulate a way to enforce the law in a way that doesn&#x27;t involve violence or the threat of violence. I would be very interested in such a social order if it were possible.')
