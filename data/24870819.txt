If someone makes a software change you don&#x27;t like, you (or someone else) are free to revert that change. Forking Firefox to remove the Megabar is certainly possible. Hell, there&#x27;s forks of Firefox that revert process separation so that XUL Addons or NPAPI plugins still work!<p>(Also, I never noticed this Megabar thing or understand why people would hate it.)<p>&gt;Threats and Using guilt<p>Maybe, but the way this is described is wide enough to describe basically all political advocacy. Merely advocating for your cause by stating that the option of no action is worse is not in and of itself abusive. Did Mozilla act in such a way as to bring about the situation where Gecko is the only practical Blink alternative?<p>&gt;Digital spying and Denying something you know is true<p>I&#x27;m not going to complain about people wanting to not have telemetry involved with their computing experience, but I am going to complain about the abuse of the word &quot;spyware&quot;. No information is given as to what features of Firefox are being objected to in particular; just a link to another website with a &quot;spyware removal guide&quot; that, among other things, considers OCSP to be spyware.<p>What brand of alternative facts are you high on to think that certificate revocation is an inherent privacy risk?<p>&gt;Financial control<p>Oh hey, an actual problem with Mozilla as an organization!<p>However, this does not directly affect people who just use Firefox. If you donate money to Mozilla, then this is a far more valid concern, but people who use Firefox need to be concerned with if their software is going to continue to be supported rather than if their money has been absconded with.<p>&gt;Unpredictability<p>This is the first thing all over again. I&#x27;m starting to think the author of this post really just hates the Megabar and wrote the rest of the article around that.')
