So you buy an insurance company for $1B - you another few billions to invest on their behalf, which greatly increases your return rate.<p>Secondly, he has a strategy to often invest in private companies, leaving old management in place, and hold for a long time, and benefit from profits, not from stock changes(means he can hold the company for the long time).<p>So for private companies, one major reason owners prefer him - his that this business is their &quot;baby&quot; so even after cashing out, they still get to manage it.<p>This is unlike what most private equity investors do.<p>So when he goes to make a deal with those companies, there&#x27;s little competition from other investors, so he can buy at a lower price.<p>So he just seems like genius stock picker, but he really isn&#x27;t.<p>As for predicting who in tech will become profitable ? i doubt that someone will share that information freely.')
