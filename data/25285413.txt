If I buy btc with dollars and then trade that for eth and then trade my eth for neo, each of those transactions is taxable. If I finally trade my neo for dollars again, that transaction is also taxable.<p>Definitely still a potentially very profitable asset class but the taxation method is brutal, versus a system like stocks where you buy the stock and when you sell it for dollars that&#x27;s the taxable event.')
