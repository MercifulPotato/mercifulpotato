Item(by='forest_dweller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605874062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159295, text='There are loads of games with characters from every corner of the planet as playable characters. Why do people always pretend they don&#x27;t exist?<p>Just having a cursory look over my collection on steam:<p>* Streets of Rage had black, white, asian, men and women.<p>* Street Fighter had every nationality on earth represented.<p>* Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Almost all the characters were black.<p>* Grand Theft Auto V - One of the main playable characters is Black (there are 3)<p>* Sleeping Dogs which is set in Hong Kong so they are Chinese.<p>* Yakuza Series - Japanese.<p>* Prey (the first one) you play a Native American.<p>* Prey (the new one) you appear to be of Asian decent (probably chinese if I were to guess as the surname is Chu).<p>* Assassins Creed - Altair is a Arab.<p>* Assassins Creed 3 - Ratonhnhaké - Mixed Native American and White.<p>* Kratos - Greek<p>* King Pin - Black<p>* Aladdin - Arab<p>* Loads of Micheal Jackson games (Black)<p>The Grand Theft Auto series on its own has sold million and millions of copies.<p>I am still not including all the games where you can literally design your character to be anything you want. Or all the strategy games where you can choose your historical factions such as Age of Empires.<p>&gt; If I were nonwhite I think I’d want to be included in some games, yes.<p>Have you ever thought that other people don&#x27;t judge or identify characters in their entertainment on what race they are? I couldn&#x27;t give a monkeys the race of a game protagonist. It literally doesn&#x27;t enter into my mind. Why are you soo pre-occupied with it is the real question?<p>It only seems to be rich white people in the US (nobody cares about this shit in Europe btw because our identities are based on our nationality) seem to care about it.')
