I design semiconductors and I have worked at two companies that had their own fabs (I didn&#x27;t work in the fab)<p>Back in 1997 the new technology was 0.25 micron (250nm) but we still operated fabs at 0.35, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 micron.  I believe these 4 lines operated at 6 different factories.<p>The next year we shut down the 1 micron fab.  The building itself still had all the air filtering and cleanroom facilities.  The old equipment (steppers, testers) was removed and new equipment for 0.18 micron was installed.  I think this took about a year.  At the end we still had 6 factories but the building that used to have all the old stuff was now the cutting edge fab.')
