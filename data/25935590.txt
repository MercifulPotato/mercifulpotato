At some point X became so close to the monitor&#x27;s resolution that not maximising the window is just extra work. I&#x27;m not happy about having to maximise my browser, but I would be less happy about having to scroll horizontally.<p>There are definitely some people who just maximise everything out of habit, but I don&#x27;t think there are enough to have created this trend of ultra-wide webpages.<p>Thankfully modern webpages being responsive at least somewhat fixes this issue, even if many sites still manage to screw this up.')
