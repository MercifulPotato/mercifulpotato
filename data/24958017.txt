In other words driving straight lines for a million miles even with the driver saving the situation hundreds of times will count as a million &quot;self driven&quot; miles. Under these conditions student drivers are the absolute best since their accident rate is pretty much zero, because there&#x27;s someone next to them to supervise and correct.<p>And that&#x27;s not a floor on how inadequate the system is, it&#x27;s a ceiling on how much risk the drivers are willing to take. Right now most drivers do not explore further and anyway never let the whole situation unfold. Those almost crashes in the most basic of driving conditions are where the humans draw the line because they now know that&#x27;s the upper limit of what it can do, the lower is facing <i>real</i> traffic or less supervision.<p>The AP gets a free pass because we want to let the technology evolve but unless we treat its &quot;driver&#x27;s license&quot; like we do a human driver&#x27;s, then the only option is to never allow more than a few seconds of &quot;hands off wheel&quot; on the road. Allowing the human to completely disconnect should be illegal.<p>We don&#x27;t allow manufacturers to put a switch that disconnects the pollution control devices because &quot;the driver is responsible for this&quot;. We should at least try to technologically prevent the driver from <i>not</i> driving because a system with a fancy name will. And Tesla is doing the absolute minimum there to get better stats and leave the impression the car drives itself. Every car drives itself straight to the crash site.')
