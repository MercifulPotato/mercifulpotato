The vaccines are going to put &quot;something strange&quot; in your body that &quot;resembles&quot; the virus, but it&#x27;s not the virus (it&#x27;s either a deactivated version of it, or some proteins which identify it...) and then is YOUR immune system the one which &quot;attacks&quot; this pseudo-virus. In this way, your immune system is learning how to defend to &quot;this kind&quot; of strange agents.<p>In a future if your immune system sees the virus, will defend you.<p>If you get the two kinds at the same time, maybe the two doses are too much for your immune system to handle it properly and the side effects may affect you (e.g. you can get fever because your immune system is under too heavy load).')
