I asked why they weren’t shot. I never advocated for it I am merely pointing out the inconsistency in response. There is no doubt in my mind that if these were BLM protestors they would have be fired on with rubber bullets and possibly even live rounds. That is all. I purposefully reserved my own opinion on whether this is desirable or not as it is irrelevant to the topic at hand.')
