The age of current TDFs is skewed by the fact that they are created with a specific time horizon; Vanguard&#x27;s 2065 fund was only created in 2017, for example, for obvious reasons.<p>TDFs are just funds-of-funds, so you only need to know the characteristics of the underlying funds to understand their makeup and performance. Vanguard&#x27;s TDFs, for example, are composed of some of the most highly respected index mutual funds in the business.<p>There are <i>other</i> arguments for not holding target date funds, but generally speaking I think they&#x27;re the best investment that your average retail investor can make.')
