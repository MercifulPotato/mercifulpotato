I bought routers on amazon for $10-15 bucks about 5 years ago and they were fine. No issues and just some cheap brand. Then one day I stepped into a best buy and a guy came up to ask me if I needed anything and I said &quot;do you have any routers cheaper than well...$40?&quot; The guy scoffed and said &quot;Not if you want a good one.&quot; He then proceeds to show me a $100 one made for like 1gigibit internet and like 10 ports. I said &quot;Nah I&#x27;ll just go on amazon, thanks.&quot;')
