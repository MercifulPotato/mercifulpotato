Item(by='davorak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602996359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810379, text='&gt; This is already an issue on platforms like Twitch. All Twitch streamers are required by the Twitch ToS to moderate their chats and the streamers face bans if they fail to do so.<p>Currently twitch is not held legally responsible if the streamers fail to follow ToS due to Section 230. If Section 230 was dropped however asking the streamers to moderate would not protect them from legal consequences.<p>I do not see how twitch&#x27;s current rules would provide them legal protection or provide a solution for moderation of one to many realtime communication if Section 230 was dropped.<p>Maybe you have some assumptions about how new laws would be put in place post Section 230 that make this work?<p>&gt; This is where I feel everyone here is taking things too far. You don&#x27;t lose communication - you become responsible for the communication you allow to be made pubic.<p>It increases the barrier to entry so many, if not most, forms of one to many real time communication would have to be discontinued due to lack of the ability to moderate in real time. Hence they would be lost along with the value they generate.')
