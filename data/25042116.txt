A peasant could absolutely <i>kill</i> a knight but probably not in battle, and the opportunity to do so would be unlikely to arise because the knight would probably not be in a position to be ambushed. For most peasantry the very thought of going after a knight would also be almost unimaginable.<p>Seems like a not-unreasonable comparison today would be &quot;could a civilian kill an armored vehicle?&quot;')
