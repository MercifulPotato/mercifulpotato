The proof that the halting problem is decidable has a self referential component and most programs aren&#x27;t self referential like this, nor do they make any library calls to halting problem deciders :). I think it&#x27;s OK to do this simlification in a simple post like this, but important to keep in mind that it&#x27;s a simplification.<p>To make it more concrete, if you take a bunch of heuristics like scanning for while(true) {}, scanning whether there are any loops at all, discarding primitive foreach loops that have a linear relationship to the input data amount, etc, you have built a rudimentary halting problem decider that has 3 outputs: &quot;will halt&quot;, &quot;won&#x27;t halt&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;. You can make it better with lots of research, SAT3 solvers, etc, but ultimately you will have to accept that there will always be programs that the decider will output &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; for.')
