They would have almost perfect compatibility with Intel hardware and they would not need investing lots of money to develop chips.<p>Now they either need to halt some Mac lines or develop all kinds of CPUs, from mobile (which they probably can do, because they should be similar enough to iPhones) to server-grade (which they have no experience at all). And there&#x27;s no way Mac Pros would sell enough to offset development costs. I just don&#x27;t understand how they are going to manage that situation.')
