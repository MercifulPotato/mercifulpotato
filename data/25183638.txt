You might accidentally capture someone on run from an abusive ex who works for the police department with access to the video feeds.  They already have facial and license plate recognition, why wouldn&#x27;t the police be using it on the ring feeds as well?<p>Don&#x27;t sue the cops, sue the people shooting the video and indiscriminately distributing it.<p>For a little background, I built a system to share video exactly like this around 1995 in a very popular restaurant I worked at.  I also interned at a local ISP, so I had unlimited dial-up and FTP&#x2F;WWW space for free, so I set up the accounting laptop in the back office with a Snappy video capture device that would take a crappy still image every 10 minutes from the security cams, dial into the ISP on one of the 3 telephone lines, and FTP the image so it would show on the restaurant homepage to let people know how busy it was.   It was very common to get shoulder to shoulder crowded, so I figured people would like to know in advance and wait 20 minutes to make everyone&#x27;s lives easier.  This was like 320x200 resolution on crappy multiplexed security cameras.  You couldn&#x27;t make out faces.  I contacted the local media to let them know that the website was going to launch soon.  There were other features for other local businesses to create their own pages, sort of like geocities or myspace.  They called me back and said they never do website announcements, but the live video stream was very interesting to them.  We did an interview, and they sent me the article they were going to run after I launched, it painted the still image service as &quot;1984 is here&quot;, and you would give up your privacy if you went to the restaurant.  They must have told other people, because by the end of the week I had lawyers contacting me and threatening me with lawsuits if I launched.  The website launched without the live image.<p>No one cares anymore.   All of the people the media were trying to scare are the same people uploading their entire lives to for-profit corporations like facebook and instagram, and they&#x27;re doing it in full HD with their names attached.<p>So, I completely see how cool this technology is, and some good that can be done with it, but anyone involved is setting themselves up for trouble.')
