They find the &quot;best&quot; products and give you referral links to buy them.<p>Sometimes your site searches will show lists of things (&quot;looking for a jacket? see our list of the best cold-weather gear&quot;). This isn&#x27;t a dark pattern. It&#x27;s not targeting you the individual, it&#x27;s targeting you the person who just explicitly showed intent to buy X.
