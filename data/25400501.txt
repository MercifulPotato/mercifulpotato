In it, the narrator explains the contemporary scientific understanding of whales and describes all their varieties then known.  My favorite bit is the part where he explains the numerous differences between whales and fish (they have lungs, are warm blooded, they breast feed, have eyelids, etc.)  The narrator explains that men of science have decided whales are not fish for these reasons.  Then the narrator delightfully argues that despite all these differences, fish are animals that live in the water, and therefore whales are fish.<p>I love this; it is common knowledge today that <i>&#x27;whales aren&#x27;t fish&#x27;</i> but few ever stop to think twice about that.  There is no contesting that whales are surely mammals, but who says some mammals can&#x27;t be fish?  In the traditional biological nomenclature, &#x27;fish&#x27; is a paraphyletic classification with arbitrarily excludes tetrapods (those lobe-finned fish that climbed out of the sea and became the four limbed animals we see today, including ourselves.)  Why does fish exclude tetrapods?  For cultural reasons clearly, it seems obvious to us that humans, dogs, lizards, birds, etc are not &#x27;fish&#x27;, because they lack the distinctly fishy quality of living in the water.  So we say the tetrapods, the fish that left the water, are no longer fish.  But some tetrapods returned to the water, regaining that distinctly fishy attribute.  These are the whales.  Tetrapods are not fish because they aren&#x27;t aquatic, but whales are tetrapods which <i>are</i> aquatic, and I therefore declare them fish.  (And in the cladistic system of biological classification, we are fish too.)<p>Incidentally, when you make this sort of argument people tend to get pretty cross.  It seems important to many people that whales not be called fish.  Why is this?  Is it because they think people will empathize with whales more if their mammalian nature is emphasized and their fishy nature is denied?  Probably they&#x27;re right about that, but it&#x27;s hardly a scientific argument.  Then again, &#x27;fish&#x27; is hardly a much of a scientific classification since it has an exception carved out of it to accommodate our cultural &#x27;knowledge&#x27; that people are &#x27;not fish&#x27;.')
