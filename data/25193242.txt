I don&#x27;t remember the details, but the installation through Homebrew failed. In the end, I got rid of Homebrew entirely and created a MacPorts package, which took me around 2 hours with no previous knowledge on MacPorts packaging. It was accepted upstream too :)<p>Since then it just hasn&#x27;t seemed necessary to try out other package managers. MacPorts fills that need for me and I prefer to spend my time elsewhere.')
