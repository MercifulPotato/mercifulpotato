So it depends on what his salary cut was, and for how long. I&#x27;ve been thinking of starting a company for ages, but there&#x27;s no escaping this fact -- I have to give up a substantial amount of money, and the most likely scenario is my company won&#x27;t take off (much less make a profit, and even less an exit). I agree employees should be compensated but ultimately, if they get a salary on day one, it is a very different calculation. I&#x27;ve worked as an early stage employee, and the salary cut I took was ~30% for ~1 year. I may get a payout from that, perhaps 1-5x and to me that seems a pretty reasonable balance.  ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
