I don&#x27;t bother with the competition aspect, but I do have a few people that I bounce solutions off of.<p>This year I&#x27;m taking a different approach though, I&#x27;m going to use it to re-learn an old language - UniVerse[0] Basic[1].  In my first IT job, I supported an in-house system that ran on UniVerse.  I then moved on to working with a commercial system built on UniData[2] (a close cousin to UniVerse).  These products mainly exist to allow Pick-style MultiValue applications to run on modern systems.  They are closed-source commercial products, but there is a limited-use personal edition available.<p>One nice thing about these is that they don&#x27;t just emulate a Pick environment, they also give it features that Pick systems never had.  For example, UniVerse Basic is capable of making HTTP&#x2F;HTTPS requests, parsing XML and JSON, and at some point UniVerse Basic even gained the ability to interact with Python objects.  One of the first things I built in preparation for this was a subroutine to retrieve the input data, downloading it and caching it if required.<p>It&#x27;s been about 10 years since I&#x27;ve worked with this technology, so I&#x27;m really looking forward to re-learning it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rocket-universe-0&#x2F;rocket-universe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rocket-universe-0&#x2F;ro...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;nxt&#x2F;gateway.dll&#x2F;RKBnew20&#x2F;universe&#x2F;v12.1.1&#x2F;universe_basic_user_guide_v1211.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;nxt&#x2F;gateway.dll&#x2F;RKBnew20&#x2F;uni...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rocket-unidata-0&#x2F;rocket-unidata" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rocketsoftware.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;rocket-unidata-0&#x2F;roc...</a>')
