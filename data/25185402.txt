Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606128066, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172101, text='&gt;&gt; Mammals rarely engage in repeated stereotypical behaviour when presented with\na task wherein they cannot directly obtain their goal, but will change their\nbehaviour and attempt different strategies. This could provide one possible\ndefinition of intelligence in animals: the more complex the improvised\nstrategy, the more intelligent the animal. Other behaviours can also be used\nas markers of intelligence and there are gradations in intelligence.<p>This is very tempting to accept. I have no idea how accurate it is (not a\nspecialist in the subject) but it certainly rings true to my experience.<p>I might have told the story of the Light Fixture of Death on HN before.\nThere&#x27;s a light fixture where I stay in the summers, shaped like a quarter\nsphere, on the wall inside the living room. In the summer, large, orange\nhornets that have their nest in the chimney start coming out of the fireplace.\nIn the nighttime, if the Light Fixture of Death is on, they will, invariably,\ndraw a, well, beeline to it, stand on its edge, slide on its smooth interior and\nimmolate themselves onto the (incadescent) light bulb with a horrible sizzling\nsound. The fixture has to be changed every once in a while because it fills up\nwith dead hornets.  There&#x27;s a black imprint above it, like you&#x27;d expect to see\nover a candle or oil lamp, because of all the smoke of burning insects that\nemanates from it.<p>There is no exception to this behaviour. As soon as a hornet enters the living\nroom via the fireplace, it will always, always fly to the Light Fixture of\nDeath and burn itself to death. If they come in from another side, say the\nbalcony doors, then they often miss it.<p>I&#x27;ve started to think that this is some kind of hallmark of insect\nintelligence: they have a set of behaviours that are adaptive in the sense\nthat they can cope with the variations in an environment but that are also\nlimited in that they only work in specific environments- and outside of those\nenvironments, an insect&#x27;s very survival is basically down to luck. Again, I&#x27;m\nno expert on this so I&#x27;m possibly talking bullshit, but I can&#x27;t imagine the\nsame kind of stereotypical behaviour in cats or dogs. I mean, I see dead\nstrays on the edge of the road all the time, but then again I see so many\nstrays that are <i>not</i> hit by cars. There must be <i>some</i> variation in their\nbehaviours. Maybe not.<p>It&#x27;s tempting also to see insect behaviour as the result of some kind of\nmillion-years&#x27; optimisation process, not unlike gradient-based optimisation in\nmodern statistical machine learning. But that&#x27;s stretching things way too far.')
