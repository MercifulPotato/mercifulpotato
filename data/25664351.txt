It was absolutely fucking eerie and insane and every time I think of doing something risky, I think about the sound in that video.<p>Unfortunately in this context, it is illegal to film people in a hospital. I think that&#x27;s a fair rule but I really would like to have a few videos floating around with no voiceover and no commentary just to scare the shit out of people. I think it would work.')
