R. Martin is a <i>storyteller</i>. There&#x27;s a difference. Stephen King is a writer. Michael Crichton was a writer.<p>Crichton summed up what it is to be a writer in the most simplistic and eloquent-in-its-brevity language I think I&#x27;ve ever heard: &quot;If you&#x27;re going to be a writer, then you have to write. You have to wake up every day and sit down and write. Can you imagine if a pilot woke up one morning and said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t feel like flying the plane today.&#x27;&quot;')
