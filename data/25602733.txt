Even Fairphone is up to their eyeballs in Chinese suppliers and they say in their own literature they can&#x27;t account for all their upstreams.<p>Apple are always the ones that get walloped publicly on issues like this, and actually I&#x27;m ok with that. It&#x27;s good these issues get air time at all, if Apple didn&#x27;t exist and it was all Microsoft, Samsung and such none of this would ever get out and if it did nobody would care. But pretending this is all about Apple, slagging them in a comment and then going and buying the next Chinese made gear from Amazon or whoever is just brushing this under the rug.')
