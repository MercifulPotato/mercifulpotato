How strange, that the very thing which makes us human, makes us so anti-human, and yet… In that case, is our anti-human-ness not also the most human thing possible? Never did I think it would pay to make such bad decisions, and never did I think that, had I made better decisions, I might have been worse off. Perhaps the very things that put me here are the challenges God has set out for me to face, and that means that I am right where I should be, and I always have been all along!</i><p>&gt; <i>So what is there to do? Should I adopt a strategy of total non-action, of being a passive observer to my thoughts and my bodily emotions and my neuroses? Should I somehow elevate myself to a point beyond my own mind, where I am exposed to fewer neuroses?</i><p>&gt; <i>No… I am in a checkmate, a cosmic checkmate. And the only thing to do is to do what I can as best I can, and hope the rest of my life may continue unfazed.</i><p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedaring.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;free-writing&#x2F;2020-12-21&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bedaring.org&#x2F;post&#x2F;free-writing&#x2F;2020-12-21&#x2F;</a>')
