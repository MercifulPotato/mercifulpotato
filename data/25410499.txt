If you want to require resources for people to determine if their subgroup (race, preexisting conditions, weight, gender, etc) then just set up a website for people to understand what the more personalized risk assessments are. Many subgroups will not be well represented even in large trials, but we can use techniques to show people relative risks. Which in vaccines cases, are basically always very low.<p>The FDA is supposed to issue EUA if the &quot;benefits likely outweigh the risks&quot;. That bar was crossed after phase I trials, frankly, definitely after phase II, and is 1000x safer after a phase III trial (even if you don&#x27;t love everything about it). The FDA is clearly not abiding to this standard, and is instead going with &quot;almost no conceivable downside&quot; standard. That has cost many lives.')
