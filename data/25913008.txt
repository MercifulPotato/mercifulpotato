Someone gave me an old unlocked Android phone that had almost no apps installed.  Playing around with it, I removed all the installed apps and somehow I managed to also disable (break) PlayStore so that it does not work, refuses to update.  If there is way to fix it, I surmise it is well beyond the capabilities of the average Android user.  AFAICT PlayStore cannot communicate with the mothership to heal itself nor send user data; anyway there are no PlayStore apps installed.<p>I installed a few useful F-Droid apks.  Installing from &quot;untrusted&quot; sources seems far more reliable than any &quot;app store&quot;.  Besides the F-Droid apps I use it like a dumb phone with maps on a different cellular network.  I wish there were more reliable sources for apks, like F-Droid, including apks for older Android versions.')
