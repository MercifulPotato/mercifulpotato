This is a huge accomplishment and arguably many steps in the right direction.<p>We are very excited to get our hands dirty with .NET 5 sometime in Q1 next year. We currently run on .NET Core 3.1. I expect our migration from 3.1=&gt;5.0 will be a total non-event, but we don&#x27;t want to risk any regressions during our current crunch phase. Our migration from 4.7=&gt;2.0 was the most difficult, but once we got everything off Framework and onto Core things have been going really smoothly with the incremental upgrades. Really hoping this trend continues indefinitely.<p>The only part of .NET 5.0 that has left me disappointed is the continued lack of polymorphic deserialization support in System.Text.Json - a la Newtonsoft.Json&#x27;s TypeNameHandling enumeration. This is the only thing holding us back from migrating to this first-party dependency. I have already left feedback regarding our use case in the appropriate dotnet&#x2F;runtime GH issue.<p>The biggest new features I am looking forward to are the performance enhancements surrounding startup time, GC, etc. Improved P95 latency is something that will be very welcome in some of our busier environments.<p>In terms of the overall package that .NET brings to the table, we couldn&#x27;t be happier. Sure, VS could run a little smoother and some of the configuration&#x2F;DI stuff can be very aggravating (at first), but overall its a fantastic experience.')
