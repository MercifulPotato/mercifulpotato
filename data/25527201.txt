Item(by='blueflow', descendants=None, kids=[25527315, 25531182, 25529699], score=None, time=1608816198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527112, text='I find the VT520 more pleasant to look at than a LCD screen. The VT has a CRT and no backlight - when its dark, the screen doesnt &quot;glow&quot;. The brightness and contrast are adjustable via two potentiometers, allowing eye-strain-less reading during the night.<p>The terminal bell makes an audible beep, i use that to signal stuff happening in IRC.<p>Probably because its a CRT, it also doesn&#x27;t inhibit me from getting tired in the late hours like a phone or laptop does.<p>Last but not least, the hackability: You can interface the VT via uart, and thus can use it as user interface to an arduino or other retro computers. KVM-like switches are also easy to DIY for serial connections.')
