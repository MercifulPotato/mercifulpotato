When they moved here at first, they were being exactly the same as the poster that you&#x27;re replying to. Criticizing the locals for being racist and not giving poor gipsies a chance to prove their virtues to society. Well, guess what, a couple of years later, those foreigners that had moved here from the West now behave in more racist ways that us mere locals. I guess the minority in question has succeeded beautifully to prove their &quot;virtues&quot; to the naive people from the West. ;)')
