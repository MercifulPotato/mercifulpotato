Theres a fundamental misunderstanding of the value of CRISPR that would take another article to correct.<p>This is one of those posts thats unfortunately inseparable from who its coming from. For those not aware, Josiah Zayner is, to put it mildly, a controversial figure. He&#x27;s best known for injecting himself with CRISPR. I find it interesting that he now claims he knew about CRISPR being hype from the beginning considering how much money he made off if it in the meantime. There&#x27;s this idea that the word &quot;biohacker&quot; describes people who are more style than substance, which is unfair, but also not unwarranted given the examples the public often sees.')
