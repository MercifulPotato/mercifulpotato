We could maybe find a way without it but it would be a bog hassle. At minimum we would need an email adress for when the render is done.<p>For now, we have a very basic pricing scheme. We add a subtle watermark to the video. If you pay to remove it, all the renders (also new ones) for that project will be without watermark. For now, we don’t put any limitting, except on audio length and file size.\nDo you think this is a fair model? Or would something else be better?<p>Legal -&gt; it’s your video. But we’re not responsible for storage.')
