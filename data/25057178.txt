From a .NET Framework position, .NET 5 is a huge breaking change by loosing capabilities and using different base libraries (which will not be recovered later). From a .NET Core 3.1 perspective, it is a minor update.<p>.NET 5 reality is: They ported 90% of their app models (e.g. wpf, winforms, ...) and dropped some other (e.g. WCF, WWF, AppDomains, ...). That is not going to change.<p>.NET ecoysystem reality is: What is not ported until now, will not be ported. .NET Core is now 6 years old (2014?) and everything new is currently .NET Core. Someone who wants to stay in business, has ported already 2-3 years ago.')
