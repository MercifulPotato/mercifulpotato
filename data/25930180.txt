One of them is legal and economically encouraged, the other one is an accusation of a crime.<p>Also, most people learn this in high school. Calling it evasion when it is avoidance only confuses people as to what you mean, and makes people think you don&#x27;t know what the terms mean.<p>&gt; My neighbor, a self-employed painter, claiming his work truck (that he also uses to pull the family camper) as a depreciating business asset is tax avoidance, and I can get behind that. Ikea registering as a nonprofit with 99% overhead is tax evasion, and it&#x27;s scummy.<p>But objectively speaking, you are aware it&#x27;s the exact opposite? It&#x27;s like trying to defend a function in C that causes UB by claiming it works on your machine. Yes, ok, but it is still UB. Your opinion does not change that, or what other people assume you mean when you say things.')
