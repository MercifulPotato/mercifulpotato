Gaming has also been effortless and honestly just the most delightful surprise about the whole thing. I can write code AND play games... on the same machine... and it&#x27;s running Linux?! I would&#x27;ve lost that bet ten years ago.<p>I was&#x2F;am totally prepared to use GPU pass-through to a Windows VM to get native gaming performance or work around bugs-- but I haven&#x27;t needed to.<p>I&#x27;m using PopOS but am pretty indifferent toward the distro I use. I honestly got it confused for different distro, but it was still Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu based so I&#x27;m chill (ha).<p>Really, most modern Linux distros are pretty god damn nice. It&#x27;s a little weird to even think about dialing in the aesthetic more to my liking coming from the world of MacOS. But I&#x27;ve found themes like Nord (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnome-look.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;1267246&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnome-look.org&#x2F;p&#x2F;1267246&#x2F;</a>) provide some visual familiarity while maintaining their own unique aesthetic qualities.<p>Making apps, or interacting with the OS, is absurdly easy using GTK and Python vs anything Microsoft or Apple have to offer. I have the same effective level of support which is to say none-at-all or via the community of volunteers. I can&#x27;t ever imagine calling Microsoft or Apple for meaningful help (roflcoptr and we say we pay for support).<p>Linux is rocking the desktop hard, if you haven&#x27;t tried it in a few years or just maintain a Windows installation to play games-- seriously give it a try. It&#x27;s wonderful.')
