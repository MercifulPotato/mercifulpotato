It’s load or workload.<p>I’ve been lifting for 2 years and have not experienced any long lasting pain and have not been injured. My progress is slow, 330&#x2F;225&#x2F;360 S&#x2F;BP&#x2F;DL at 220 BW (gained 30lbs) but I’m not in a hurry. I’ve been doing round back deadlifts for a while now (my spine has completely lost it’s natural lordosis due to a lifetime of sitting, my lower back has a slight rounding that I just can’t force into extension, my discs are completely fine and I have gained 2 inches to my height since I’ve started training) and have never experienced any back pain.<p>People start obsessing over their progress and start doing too much, either load or sets.<p>My well-being improved by a lot. Sitting for 8+ hours a day stopped being an issue and all the weird pains I had before disappeared.')
