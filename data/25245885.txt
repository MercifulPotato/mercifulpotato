Opening apps from my phone on desktop: yes, I can see utility at that. But opening standalone phone app installations on my desktop? Why? There is almost no phone app I can think of that doesn&#x27;t have a much better desktop equivalent - save, maybe, for games, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be aimed for that.<p>Since app developers need to make extra effort here to make it work (repackaging, maintaining store presence) and the experience is definitely worse, I don&#x27;t see why big brands would do so. Microsoft should instead aim for improved general Android integration, like what they did for Samsung phones.')
