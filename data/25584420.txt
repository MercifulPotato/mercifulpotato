However there are downsides as well.  Cost is a big one, but that&#x27;s becoming less of a issue over time.  Another is sensitivity to rain, fog, blowing sand, etc.<p>A complicating factor is human driven cars will assume cars to act like they have human limitations.  So higher speeds when humans can see well, and low speeds when humans can&#x27;t.<p>Not sure Tesla&#x27;s current sensors will do it, but seems like camera based systems are likely to be quite competitive with LIDAR.  Maybe instead of 3 forward cameras, 6 or 8 so there&#x27;s overlapping views (for stereoscopic vision), handling failures better, and allowing a narrower field of view at a higher zoom.<p>More range will be a huge help, that way an autonomous car can slow more gently when uncertain and drive more like a human.  After all superhuman reflexes aren&#x27;t much use if you get rear ended all the time.')
