I&#x27;ve also put significant thought into how we can change the hiring process, if only to get better candidates.<p>Simple solution: Be very clear what kind of candidate the company actually needs, e.g. do you need<p>- a genius in algorithm design<p>- a person who knows the subtle details of a specific language&#x2F;platform&#x2F;standard X<p>- a nice person vs a person that will fight for &quot;doing the right thing&quot; (e.g. is possibly strongly opinionated)<p>- how important is it really that the person is also nice to hang up after work<p>- an allrounder vs an expert for X, Y<p>- a person who creates solid code that will be good to maintain vs. a person that &quot;simply get things done&quot;<p>- a person who is is already good at X vs a person who has a high potential to become good at X')
