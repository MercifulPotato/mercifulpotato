I was a chip architect for the shader core at a major GPU company. I worked on simulators and modeling performance for next generation chips where we changed the ISA for each family of chips. The big reason why Apple Silicon is so damn fast is because they were able to shape the design at modeling time exclusively around Mac system level workloads. At best, Intel would have some subset of traces come from Apple for important traces to optimize for. Combine getting to narrow traces down exclusively for one platform, and heterogeneous design space (cpu + coprocessors) and you can really tune a monster.')
