I urge the admins to stop this practice. I wish to hear such points of view and consider things from such perspective.<p>It is very logical to assume that once you have no direct access to the sources of software, that software could do things that malware does. Yet this obviously logical reminder get downvoted like it is irrational or off topic.<p>It is on topic, it is rational, it is a good reminder and we see Microsoft and Apple consistently disrespect a right of a person to control own _Personal_ computer(PC). On recent M1 you can’t even have own OS without Apple permission, which makes it useless brick for me. Do some people still understand what ‘personal’ means ?')
