I&#x27;m realising that we not that rare in HN..<p>I would say that learning architecture is a bit like learning chess. To grow fundamentals you need time to study the basic moves, general strategies and specific tactics. A good mentor helps a lot.<p>Computer languages are a good analogy for styles. You have battle tested styles, like Java or C++, that you are sure will do the job but they don&#x27;t excite anyone anymore. Then you have Haskell or Clojure or Rust..<p>To have an idea where the Architecture fringe stands nowadays, look at my blogs [0][1], specially the one on architectural drawings. Stuff there had won or can be a basis to win prizes. I believe that for a layman it&#x27;s not an easy task to understand why most drawings there are interesting like it&#x27;s not understandable for a layman what makes a piece of code&#x2F;software great. It takes years to fully understand all the nuances in a field of thought.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archimodels.info" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archimodels.info</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archidrawings.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archidrawings.tumblr.com</a>')
