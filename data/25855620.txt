But, after poking around the site, none of the exercises demonstrated ‘isolate’ specific muscles. They are all free weight and body weight moves.<p>These moves will never isolate specific muscles, and do precisely what you suggest. They work many groups, and smaller stabilization muscles at the same time.<p>The only way you can really isolate specific muscles is to use static machines. Still better than not working out, but not optimal.<p>So fear not, these are all great moves to learn! Just be careful to take it slow, and practice good technique. Not worth getting injured from being careless.<p>This seems to be more of, pick muscle I want to improve, and learn a few moves that involve those muscles. As you would expect, a lot of moves apply to multiple muscles.<p>Edit: I found a few machine workouts on there, mostly leg stuff. The large majority are free weight moves though.')
