Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606801225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262571, text='I could broadly agree with your first two sentences, even though it&#x27;s not actually true that ray tracing didn&#x27;t have global illumination before the Rendering Equation came along. Recursive ray tracing, diffuse inter-reflections, distribution ray tracing, all these things existed before the term path tracing came along. Path tracing is more of a unifying formalism than a distinction between global illumination and direct lighting.<p>I&#x27;m completely stumped by your last sentence though, I have no idea where your anger is coming from. But it fails to explain why you want to make the distinction in this thread, since, as I already pointed out &quot;Ray Tracing in one Weekend&quot; is doing both (for example chapters 1-7 are the mechanics of ray tracing, no path tracing concepts are used until chapter 8). Are you referring indirectly to any specific products that have marketing you don&#x27;t like? Your story can&#x27;t explain people who use the term &quot;ray tracing&quot; since they&#x27;re being honest about not necessarily doing path tracing. So are you talking about someone who uses the term &quot;path tracing&quot; when they&#x27;re not doing global illumination?')
