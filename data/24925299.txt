We are not estimating anything about average retractions about papers. We&#x27;re talking about a specific story.<p>As it stands, there is no evidence that the specific story requires retractions.<p>You ask for evidence. The evidence is the laptop, and the text messages, and the emails. If you disagree that these things are evidence, the burden of disproof is now on you. That&#x27;s how it works.<p>And so far, there have not even been as much as basic denials by the Bidens.<p>Yes, I have lived in NYC for several years, and I still read the Times more than the Post. But this is, once again, meaningless criteria.<p>You keep trying to make it about the paper, when the discussion is about this specific story.<p>And you&#x27;re wrong.')
