Gov contracting is a rare, specialized skill. That&#x27;s why the same big companies keep getting big contracts over and over. If you&#x27;re a company without these skills you have no chance at landing one of the giant contracts. The CYA and auditing requirements are too insane to even write the proposal without a full-time staff of contracting specialists and a long track record of prior contracting.<p>(As a new contractor you might be able to get a small-money contract from e.g. the SBIR but those max out at roughly $100K.)')
