The first is to receive dividends. The second is to sell the shares at a higher price. Note that companies can (and do!) buy back their own shares to reward their shareholders.<p>In theory, the meaning of a stock price, or rather, the total market value of a company is how much one should rationally be willing to pay to acquire the company: this is the value of its total net assets plus some accounting for future profits. However, stock prices are also seen as a metric in and of themselves. Upper echelons of most companies are rewarded mostly in stock rather than cash, and so keeping the stock price artificially high can be the easiest way to keep their jobs, which isn&#x27;t helped by a political emphasis on keeping the stock market from collapsing (it isn&#x27;t entirely rational that the S&amp;P 500 rose 16% in a year when the economy crashed by several percent).')
