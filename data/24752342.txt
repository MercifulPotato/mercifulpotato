I&#x27;ve used an app called &quot;Ada&quot; before and it&#x27;s a very similar concept.<p>However, I just made a try with some symptoms I&#x27;ve had last week of what was probably a common cold and I ended up with a long list of diseases, ranging from multiple sclerosis and other rare diseases, along with that common cold, but presented with no likelihood order. Also, no warning were displayed.<p>I think this is quite dangerous as many people who will use such service have a tendency to hypochondria, to present them with such a long list of rare diseases because of a symptom related keyword present somewhere.')
