Item(by='repartix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610628947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773632, text='Yes, the key idea is to show skin in the game. Check out some usecases in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repowcha.com&#x2F;use_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repowcha.com&#x2F;use_cases</a>. It&#x27;s nothing fancy, just simple tech that might work better.<p>Ordinary CAPTCHA tries to tell humans and bots apart, to stop bots from abusing a service. rePOWCHA does something different: it tries to tell if humans have good intentions using the oldest trick in the book. It asks the user to deposit some crypto as collateral. Honest users who don&#x27;t abuse the service get their deposit refunded, and spammers don&#x27;t.<p>Another difference is that it&#x27;s not rePOWCHA who decides who gets back their deposit. It&#x27;s the customer (you) who decides. Think of rePOWCHA as giving control back to humans instead of hoarding it for the bots. It&#x27;s also free and you make money from the fees.<p>The big problem I see with CAPTCHA is that verifying if someone is human isn&#x27;t enough to guarantee they won&#x27;t abuse your service, like what happened with repl.it a couple of months back (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.canny.io&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;p&#x2F;add-captcha-to-new-post" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.canny.io&#x2F;feedback&#x2F;p&#x2F;add-captcha-to-new-post</a>). The key insight is to make spam expensive enough that it&#x27;s unprofitable, instead of merely less likely.<p>I want a similar way to stop spam for email. Crypto works better than a credit card for this since you can find the sender&#x27;s address in the blockchain to refund their money, and also to reward them for sending good emails.<p>And then there&#x27;s the world of online forums. Don&#x27;t like getting downvoted on HN? Threads getting out of hand? Built a new online forum that requires paying to post, reply, and vote.<p>You can pay customer support for responding well or responding fast.<p>You can send rePOWCHA links to friends to pay you back lunch money.<p>Proof-of-work for the web is inevitable. This is a new mechanism.<p>I&#x27;ll be hanging around in the comments this morning if you have questions or feedback. Feel free to reach out directly at repowcha@protonmail.com')
