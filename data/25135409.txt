An apartment will cost several thousand dollars a month. Non-native food that gets imported, such as olive oil or cheese, will be very expensive.<p>So which is the definition of &quot;cost of living&quot; of a city? Is it how the average person lives there, or is how much it costs for the same lifestyle as where the company is based?')
