This site described how rich the guy owning this site was and how you could become rich too. How? By just buying his book, of course. I was mesmerized by this site and it&#x27;s audacious design for a solid hour or two. I searched around the web for more information and ended up in this circle jerk of sites promoting each other. None with any substance.<p>This feels similar. The blog post and the site is beautifully designed (really!) but I have a hard time figuring out what I&#x27;m buying. Is it access to a chat where everyone tries to sell you their &quot;startups&quot;?<p>I guess it&#x27;s not for me, but congratz to your success!')
