The challenge is: how?<p>Laissez-faire is a decent default, though obviously companies can cetralize power a lot.<p>Regulation seems reasonable, but it implicitly requires you to give some government power, and they tend to expand the scope of that power over time.<p>I think it&#x27;s best when government is decentralized, and the smaller units of government can do what they want; while something as big as the US givernment would be highly constrained.<p>Allowing individual, smaller governments to regulate makes it harder for companies to take over. But if the government amasses too much power, you just move a few towns over.')
