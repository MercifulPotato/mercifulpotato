Left, Right, Center is a false trichotomy. There is no such thing as objective journalism because the news is a filter. Even if one reports &quot;just the facts&quot;, the facts one decides to report impart a bias.<p>I might report that &quot;a woman is suing McDonalds for spilling hot coffee on herself&quot;. That is an unbiased fact. And it implants a story of runaway litigiousness. If I also report that &quot;McDonalds was warned many times about the temperature of its coffee and even sure once already and the woman sustained 3rd degree burns&quot; the story becomes one of corporate malfeasance.<p>Compound this further. I now state that the woman won millions of dollars, you may be tilting back toward over litigiousness. But if I report that she only sought damages and the jury awarded her punitive damages of its own accord the we&#x27;re back to corporate malfeasance.')
