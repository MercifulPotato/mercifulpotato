Item(by='disgu', descendants=None, kids=[24990747], score=None, time=1604505637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24989956, text='Germany: Every person over the age of 18 is automatically registered to vote. The right to vote cannot be lost.<p>Every registered voter gets a letter some time before the election and if you want to vote by mail you have to send the letter back for free and they&#x27;ll send everything over. The ballots have to be received by the end of the day of election. There&#x27;s a lot of time so you won&#x27;t miss that date. The letter you get to remind you of voting also contains information about where you have to be to vote in person.<p>There&#x27;s very little last minute changes in Germany. The election is not decided in the last couple of weeks before the election, people have made up their minds at that point.<p>I think the crucial part is that there&#x27;s absolutely no effort involved. You basically show up at the polling place on the Sunday of the election and you&#x27;re good to go. If you&#x27;re too lazy for that you can to everything by mail. If you decide to vote by mail and then forget to send it via the post you can just drop it off at the polling station as well.')
