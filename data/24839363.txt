So if you happen to have some firewall rules that block internet access, no default route will be applied until the internet check times out.<p>So if the default route doesn&#x27;t exist yet since it&#x27;s still checking for internet, it would let you use the keyboard. DHCP probably runs every time the NIC is turned on (like from sleep), and they could just disable this function if you&#x27;ve set a static default route (since they may not be able to reach their NTP server on that route).')
