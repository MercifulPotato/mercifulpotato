I didn’t know anyone who had their kid stab themselves on any needle of any sort. The only people that screamed at me were blue collar workers that hated tech workers. The worst experience in SF was the human excrement in the streets and watching it happen, but as I said, it’s amazing such a wealthy area can’t even provide such a basic service as public toilets.<p>Edit: The tech workers that I knew very much so cared about not allowing high density housing to keep their house prices inflated.')
