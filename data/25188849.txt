In the case of Poe&#x27;s writing, the approach is at least <i>thoughtful</i>. In the Panzer case, it seems to just blithely throw players into the ranks of Nazism with no interest in exploring what that means. You could argue that games are more of a blank slate than literature, onto which people can project several experiences orthogonal to the authors&#x2F;developers intent, but I think that&#x27;s probably being too generous.')
