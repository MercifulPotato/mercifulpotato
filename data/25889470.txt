Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25889508], score=None, time=1611464846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889442, text='&gt; New deployments will break once pip is updated.<p>No, they won&#x27;t.<p>&gt; The error here is you think the people doing this even have programmers to port to 3.x or admins with the wherewithal to make sure an older version of pip is used.<p>What wherewithal does that take? PyPI will just provide the last version of pip that supports Python 2. It takes no extra effort to not install a Python 3 version of pip on Python 2.<p>&gt; Nobody wants to keep Python 2.x in use or force the Pip maintainers to keep 2.x support.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are people who do want to do the former. And they can, but it has no bearing on the latter.')
