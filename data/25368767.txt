Obviously I&#x27;m betting emotionally on the latter. Granted I could go on and on about the facts that I think back up my assessment, but in the end I think you and I both know it really comes down to hunches, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>My hunch is that your argument is the equivalent of Steve Ballmer&#x27;s famous â€¢shrug* about the iPhone. But I could be wrong, of course.')
