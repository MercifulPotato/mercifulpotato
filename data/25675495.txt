There&#x27;s an argument to be made that says you should treat a blog as a series of pages, each modeling something corresponding to what you might call a &quot;publication event&quot; in the real world, e.g. printing a magazine or passing around a physical memo.  The consistency angle is probably overvalued (not worth its cost).  When a newspaper or magazine changes its masthead, old issues don&#x27;t get updated.  You might say that this reflects a limitation of the physical medium and that you would if you could (as is the case with digital editions), but what does it get you, really?  Your links to external sources are already going to lead to wildly different forms of presentation outside your control.<p>If an internal link leads to a page published in 2014, and it still matches the way it looked in 2014, is that a problem?  (And if so, e.g. due to changes in fashion&#x2F;trends that have led to it being intolerable, it&#x27;s worth asking, &quot;what makes it so?&quot;, &quot;was it ever really tolerable, even in 2014?&quot;, and &quot;is the material I&#x27;m publishing right now guilty of the same thingâ€”its presentation only squeaking over the threshold of acceptability because of something else that&#x27;s currently en vogue but soon won&#x27;t be?&quot;)')
