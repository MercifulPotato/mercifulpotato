A fine-tuned Yolov4 model is used to get the location of the ball. Then, I implemented SORT tracking algorithm to keep track of each individual ball. Lastly, I will apply some image registration techniques to deal with slight camera shift on each clip.<p>I&#x27;m still trying to improve it! Feel free to follow this project, also check out the Todo list.<p>BTW, I just want to point out that did anyone notice that the pitcher throw the ball with the exact same posture but it turned out to fly on a completely different path. It&#x27;s just amazing!')
