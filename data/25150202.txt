I&#x27;m more than happy for Google to use loading speed as a signal in their search rankings. The issue was that sites were penalized for not using AMP <i>even if they had equivalent or better performance</i>.<p>If AMP becomes a lower bound for performance and non-AMP sites slim down their pages to compete, great. If sites that don&#x27;t compete on performance die off as their search ranking decreasesâ€¦ also great!')
