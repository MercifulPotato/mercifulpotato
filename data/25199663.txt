In the case shown above, as long as `otherFunc()` is strictly typed, the manual annotation is simply duplicating information that&#x27;s already there. At no point did I argue against having types, I&#x27;m opposing needless duplication. As perhaps a simplified example, annotating `Foo` in the below example is similarly redundant:<p><pre><code>  const foo: Foo = new Foo();</code></pre>')
