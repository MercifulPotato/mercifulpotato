Such as:<p>a) using a proxy from a residential ISP somewhere<p>b) never putting two or more sock puppets behind the same IP. Or assuming exclusive ipv4 use, not even any two clients from within the same &#x2F;20 to &#x2F;18 sized netblocks.<p>c) a reasonably varied selection of ISPs. Also variation in ISP netblock geolocation (maxmind geoIP database or similar) based on ARIN, RIPE, APNIC etc registration data. Obviously if you&#x27;re promoting something that&#x27;s very tech&#x2F;startup industry oriented it would not be as suspicious if you had a bunch of posters &quot;authentically discussing it&quot; that geolocated to the SF bay area and Seattle.<p>d) a reasonably varied selection of common user agents. Also intentional variation on operating system and browser fingerprinting variables.<p>e) intentional training to avoid writing patterns and phrases that might seem similar, when one person is driving ten accounts<p>f) not doing dumb stuff that gives away your time zone, like if you have a bunch of people in a GMT+4 time zone that post things regularly on a 9-5 daytime work schedule, when they&#x27;re supposed to be pretending to be ordinary internet users in a USA time zone.<p>From a black hat network engineering perspective there are a lot of ways that one human driving 30 sock puppets can appear from 30 distinct locations, as if there were 30 real humans with 30 different operating systems&#x2F;computers&#x2F;browser user agents and browser fingerprints.<p>As to what level of analysis tools are run on the server side to detect &quot;low effort&quot; sock puppets, that&#x27;s another question.<p>From the point of view of a place where fake accounts&#x2F;sock puppets post things, obviously an organization like twitter has a lot more staff resources to devote to writing custom analysis and correlation tools. Specifically for the purpose of identifying common patterns in inauthentic accounts.<p>I <i>presume</i> that dang and the people who run the ycombinator admin interface can see the IP address of every poster next to the post&#x27;s timestamp, and might notice in a manual fashion if a lot of suspicious posts started showing up all from the same netblocks. But then again maybe not.<p>If you want to see the tip of an iceberg of one method for running sockpuppets, go google &quot;residential proxies for sale&quot; and start looking through the slickly presented marketing material.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=residential+proxies+for+sale" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=residenti...</a>')
