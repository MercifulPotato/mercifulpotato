Adobe tried to make a go with Flash on Android to spite Jobs and it was a train-wreck. While Android makers were willing to put giant batteries in to support sloppy code, Apple wasn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; The iPhone might have taken a few more iterations, but eventually they would have figured out how to support flash well in their phones.<p>Apple shipped a phone with <i>barely</i> a day&#x27;s battery life and it remained that way for years as features and performance caught up. If they&#x27;d shipped Flash, it would have cooked the CPU on every site it visited ruining the limited battery life the phone had. This is one of those cases where shipping less made a better product.<p>&gt; In the end, the reality is that Jobs made a tech forecasting mistake assuming HTML5 (not js) will eventually catch up with flash.<p>You are splitting hairs. Nobody has made a perfect technology prediction 10 years out.')
