I don&#x27;t use bulky software (XCode, Adobe suite, Office, etc), so if you use any of that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but for software dev it&#x27;s been plenty fast and a real joy to use.<p>The only time I&#x27;m speed constrained is deep learning, but generally I just run tiny test sets locally and then run full jobs on a cluster or the cloud.<p>In the mid 2010&#x27;s I had a desktop with like 64GB of Ram and four million processors, and I found programming on the Air I was still more productive. Productivity wise I think it&#x27;s a very high dimensional space to consider.<p>(P.S. Can&#x27;t wait to get this new Air!!!)')
