Item(by='Foxboron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604181073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955215, text='&gt; Arch definitely has separate packages for runtime and development libraries. It doesn&#x27;t have as many, but they exist and can be found by simply searching for `-dev`.<p>They are an exception to the rule, where the benefits outweights the negatives. It&#x27;s been done to ensure we have smaller container images, or if the maintaine thinks it makes sense. But as a rule, we do not care while debian does.<p>&gt;Arch has `any` and then architecture specific packages:<p>How is the `any` arch related to package splitting?<p>&gt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;32-bit_package_guidelin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;32-bit_package_guidelin</a>...<p>&gt; There are also distros of Arch for ARM and 32bit, however if you&#x27;re looking for a more integrated multi-arch PKGBUILD-comparable distro then Alpine is it and probably what I&#x27;ll be migrating to at some point.<p>Those package guidelines exist, but are dated and not used by us, the packagers.<p>Arch ARM and 32bit are also seperate distirbutions that isn&#x27;t affiliated with the 64bit Arch Linux distribution.')
