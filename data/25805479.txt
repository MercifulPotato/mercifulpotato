So if starting a new project and I just want people to be able to build it and I want them to use exactly a specific version of gradle I can create a 1 line build file and it works for just about anybody who runs it on any platform.<p>So on the one hand, its the easiest way to get started, and on the other hand its a turing complete language so there isn&#x27;t anything it <i>can&#x27;t</i> do so once started, people can always keep going.<p>And then, yes, Maven is complex and mysterious in completely different ways but almost to the same extent as Gradle.')
