It&#x27;s a pretty expensive process.<p>So, in the US it&#x27;s over the counter if people will seek it out.  This way they can charge more.  If it&#x27;s not over the counter it&#x27;s something generic that people will not go out of their way to a doctor for.  In the last 10 years in the US I think the only prescription drugs moved to over the counter is allergy medicine, which seems to fit this pattern: People will not go to a doctor for seasonal allergies typically.')
