You define views of the DB that you want. Then the DB keeps those views as tables for you, and the DB does all of the hard work of keeping those view tables consistent with the denormalized data. Essentially the DB does the atomicity, cache-invalidation, and cache-updating for you.<p>You get performance, and you get the certainty that invalid states are un-representable.<p>I guess the biggest blocker here is in automatically determining what fields do and do not need to be update automatically?')
