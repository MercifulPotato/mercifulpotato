But the whole point of stories are that they are fiction, and yet we often see them as reflecting the real world. Pop culture influences our behavior. You may not care about these issues but the article is merely pointing out that the issues exist and how to mitigate them - should the storyteller choose to do so. There&#x27;s nothing ridiculous about that.')
