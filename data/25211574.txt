So urban is 17% of cropland, or 7% of all farmland. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s that high to be honest, compared to plane-window impressions. Surely a majority of urban area is post-1950, how much is former crop&#x2F;ranch&#x2F;forest I&#x27;d struggle to guess. Would be interesting to have better numbers, and over time.')
