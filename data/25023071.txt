The US, by the most generally accepted definition, has had continuous governance as a democracy since 1788.  Just one more election, and not the most contentious or momentous by a long shot.<p>2. Current reported spread in votes between D and R are pretty slim, 75.0M v. 70.7M Wikipedia 11PM EST 11&#x2F;7.<p>3. Whatever your partisan opinion, at least 70M American adults, 48.5% of those voting, disagree with you and think you’re an idiot.  Try not to confirm the fact with your comments.<p>4. Challenging the validity of the voting process is a time-honored tradition during tight races.  Stop sounding like newbies.  This is the only time that the validity of the electoral process gets enough visibility to figure out if anything’s broke.  Seriously broke?  See 1.<p>5. A paper trail is a beautiful thing.<p>6. And what a wonderfully fertile field these comments are for use as examples of propaganda, inflammatory rhetoric and logical fallacies.  Wish I was teaching a course right about now.  Timely for the application of manure on fields too...<p>7. It would be nice if the mods kept the discussion away from an r&#x2F;politics-ization of HN.  The sides are pretty obvious and enforcing an arbitrary quota of half blue hurrah&#x2F;half red  hurrah would lead to a better flow and balance.  Heavy-handed, but appropriate in these few cases IMHO.<p>The brilliant, stupid, wise, foolish, angry, mellow, old, young, rich, poor, naive, cynical, kind, nasty, sophisticated, brutish American people have spoken.  Whether you agree with the results or not, it’s a beautiful thing.')
