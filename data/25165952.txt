Germany is built on private insurance (on top of something similar to Canada&#x27;s government insurance) and it works just flawlessly. Usually they pay everything, you don&#x27;t need to do anything. You skip all lines at the doctor, can directly go to specialists without asking anyone, etc. And on top of that private insurance in Germany is considerably cheaper than government insurance, while providing like 10 times the benefits.<p>If I had to name one thing I really miss from Germany, it&#x27;s private health insurance. This was just like being in heaven.')
