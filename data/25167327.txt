In short, it&#x27;s BS, and supporting tracking&#x2F;data mining is agreeing that tracking&#x2F;data mining is the natural, expected behavior and thus an opt-out &quot;feature&quot;.<p>&gt; Nobody should ever agree to this.<p>&gt; I see it differently: tracking is opt-in, and the ideal is that users are in full control of their privacy by default. Those who want to track&#x2F;data mine you should ask you to opt-in, along with all the detailed information of how the data collated from you will be used and monetized (lists all entities to which your data is sold), in the spirit of informed consent.<p>&gt; Currently the way for users to enforce their privacy choice is to use all the tools at their disposal to prevent their data from ending up in the hands of the trackers&#x2F;data miners, and DNT is not one of these tools.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;issues&#x2F;827#issuecomment-153749923" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gorhill&#x2F;uBlock&#x2F;issues&#x2F;827#issuecomment-15...</a>')
