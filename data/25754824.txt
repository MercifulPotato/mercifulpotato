But this doesn&#x27;t strike me as a problem unless people are really confused and choosing CS programs in order to get experience building websites. From what I saw when I was in college a decade ago, even most of the smaller schools were starting to have special &quot;Software Engineering&quot; tracts since they recognized the growing popularity (or at least prestige) of programming jobs. I chose CS because I was fascinated with the actual science and math, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with the same fascination to skip theory courses.')
