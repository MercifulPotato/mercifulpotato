I think &quot;monopolies&quot; have their place in standardizing things that we do and it makes it convenient.<p>(Side note: if fucking Apple would open up iMessage on android&#x2F;windows they would OWN the chat market in a matter of minutes in the US)<p>But there does get to a point where you cannot say &quot;people use it because they like it&quot;.  Most people use it <i>solely</i> because everyone else uses it.<p>Just like Facebook.  There is no &quot;alternative&quot; for real-life profile social media. If you want to use that <i>type</i> of social media, Facebook is the only thing whether you like it or not.')
