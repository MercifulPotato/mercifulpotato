These are examples of launch-aborting bad bugs.<p>If we try to characterize the &quot;perfect&quot; example of technical debt:<p>- There is a spec, say: v1, of how the product must behave to the user.<p>- The product behaves exactly as defined in v1. I.e.: There are zero bugs.<p>- The very next iteration (v2) of this product has some cost to achieve.<p>- There is a counterfactual set of decisions that could have been made, which would make achieving v2 have the minimal possible cost.<p>Debt is the delta between the set of decisions made in implementing v1 vs the counterfactual set of decisions not made in implementing v1 that would have made the cost of implementing v2 minimal.<p>This definition has all the familiar mechanics of technical debt.<p>- You don&#x27;t need to pay the debt to achieve v2 perfectly - it would just be more expensive.<p>- If all you ever want to do is v1, ie: there is no v2, then there is no technical debt, no matter how ugly the code is for v1.<p>- You can choose to reallocate costs between v1 and v2 freely. The distribution of costs will affect launch timelines, but will have no effect on the user-visible quality of either version.<p>It&#x27;s dangerous not to understand the difference between bugs and technical debt. I lost interest in reading this article after it seemed like the author did not understand this basic difference.')
