Many of the driving forces behind drug development or healthcare decisions arise in business priorities, practices, and regulations that are complex and unintuitive to outsiders.  Unless I reinforce my POV with explanation of why and how these subterranean forces drive outcomes, I&#x27;m likely to find myself downvoted â€” presumably because readers discount my perspective as insufficiently plausible or wrong outright, perhaps because I haven&#x27;t offered enough explanation. But since longwinded explication of arcane background minutiae is tiresome to write and for others to read, so I often demur to the detriment of my score.')
