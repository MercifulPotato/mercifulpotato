Apple tends to operate similar to a criminal enterprise - they sell defective products &#x2F; products which become defective after barely any use.<p>I bought the 2015 Macbook Pro which developed the &quot;staingate&quot; issue. In first world countries, I hear that Apple replaced the screens for customers for free (I&#x27;m not sure if this is true or whether it&#x27;s astroturfing). There is no such system here. Both speakers in this Macbook developed tearing and are no longer audible. Other laptops - Samsung, Lenovo, etc. in my household have worked perfectly. One laptop developed an issue with the keyboard, which was replaced for $50.<p>I received Airpods as a gift this year in February. One earphone stopped working within 8 months. Apple told me they weren&#x27;t going to do anything about it. I must have used them about 20 times total. I also own knock-off Airpods. They work perfectly.<p>I follow Louis Rossman&#x27;s YouTube channel where he opens up the devices and showcases the various corners that have been cut in the manufacturing process. He also exposes the unethical behaviour of the Apple &quot;Genius&quot; employees who overcharge customers for simple repairs. In one case he just plugged a loose connection back in and charged the customer for 20 minutes of labour whereas Apple said it would require a screen replacement for roughly ~30% of the cost of the device.<p>Repairability is becoming near impossible with these products now. At one point in time you could salvage together parts from dead devices to gather spares, but now Apple is working on technology to ensure that parts from different devices will not be compatible with each other.<p>Without legislation they will continue to operate like this with impunity. If enough key markets push for something like &quot;right to repair&quot; there is a small possibility that something will be done about this, otherwise the way things are headed, there will essentially be no accountability for cases like this.<p>I would not be surprised if there will come a point where they make devices stop working if you open them, and only they can restore the device back to a working state.')
