For one, there was no plan whatsoever for what they would have done next had the troops they addressed actually joined the putative rebellion.<p>Mishima had precisely one objective: to die like his own ideal of a warrior, at the peak of his physical prowess.  And I know that sounds weird, but if you read his books, <i>every single one</i> harps on this theme almost obsessively, in particular his final &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; tetralogy.  He was born a sickly misfit, but he spent a good portion of his adult life bodybuilding and practicing martial arts to perfect his body, so he could die the perfect death.  Fetishistic?  Absolutely.  Political?  Not really.')
