They also know how many person-years of work are required to turn a new language from a toy into something others would want to use.  So, it&#x27;s unlikely that such a person, needing to write a program, would create a language to write it in.  There would have to be some use case that no extant language handles well.<p>On the other hand, when someone who doesn&#x27;t know all that needs to write a program, they&#x27;re much more likely to say, I know!  I&#x27;ll create a new language!<p>Therefore, most new languages are created by people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.')
