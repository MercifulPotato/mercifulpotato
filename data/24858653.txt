Instead of buying gas from the gas company you contract with any number of 3rd parties and they turn around and pay the gas company to deliver it.<p>It&#x27;s not clear how this is better.  The gas company still exists and takes the bulk of my payment.  The 3rd parties tack on their service fee.  And they basically all run a bait and switch where you sign a contract for a fix term and then the price gets jacked up if you forget to sign a new one.<p>It&#x27;s the worst of both worlds.  The gas company still has a delivery monopoly.  And now we&#x27;ve got a bunch of scummy 3rd parties running what are basically scams.')
