I&#x27;m not qualified to evaluate its historical claims but its claims about the current state of science in the Muslim world don&#x27;t agree with what little knowledge I have in that area.  That knowledge comes from having been acquainted with a number of Muslim students and scientists both in the US and in France.  I did not at all get the impression that they came from a culture that does not value open rational inquiry, despite several, at least, being devout Muslims.  I&#x27;m sure Fundamentalists are deeply opposed to anything resembling science but as far as I know they are a minority in most of the Muslim world.  I should qualify these statements by noting that most of the Muslims I knew came from the Maghreb rather than say the Persian Gulf area so maybe things are very different there.<p>There are also some other possible explanations for the relative lack of success of scientific research in Muslim countries today that the article does not consider.  First many of these countries are relatively poor and under-developed so if you are born there and have the opportunity to study science you are likely to be encouraged to go into more practical fields, like engineering, rather than pure research, which is very under-funded in these countries, again mostly due to overall lack of resources.  Secondly if you really want to go into research your best bet is to emigrate to the west if that is at all possible. Again some of this doesn&#x27;t apply to the oil rich states of the Persian Gulf, but I think the brain drain effect is at work even there.')
