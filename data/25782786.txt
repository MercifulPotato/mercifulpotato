Item(by='52-6F-62', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610659411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25781724, text='Opinion columns are a curated forum of ideas, including agendas, sure.<p>But the publishing of them does not represent them as being anything of any validity any more than publishing &quot;letters to the editor&quot; asserts the opinions therein are of any practical value other than the exposure to the fact that they are indeed held. It&#x27;s an attempt to hold an even remotely civilized, and <i>detached</i> discussion at length.<p>No single opinion column is a conclusion, except maybe that of the writer&#x27;s. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;ll see debates go on for extended periods of time-columns and papers written back and forth on singular ideas sometimes for years, decades even.<p>But I&#x27;m not here to defend opinion columnsâ€”I rarely read them myself outside of a few more local polemics. I was discussing the dishonest treatment of an &quot;MSM&quot; that is only &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot; because of a misreading and lack of media literacy in general. (If only many people who frequented forums like Parler treated those discussions with as much deference rather than planting bombs and bludgeoning a federal officer to death)')
