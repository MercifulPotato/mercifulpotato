I don&#x27;t understand how people convince themselves that it&#x27;s productive to write so many tests and (say) check types at runtime etc.<p>Totally agree, although I think strong typing is also important, not just static typing. C&#x2F;C++ has a weak type system because of the automatic conversions it allows.<p>The problem with this discussion however is that the people that push for dynamic languages usually do it because it&#x27;s &quot;so fast&quot; to do something in Python, and they won&#x27;t test their software anyway.')
