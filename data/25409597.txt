Anyone that design hardware knows that specialized hardware is orders of magnitude more power efficient than software.<p>Custom Silicon -&gt; Programmable Logic --------------&gt; Software.<p>You see that in RF design where tech is developed with software defined radios, then moved to FPGA&#x27;s&#x2F;Gate Arrays, and then custom silicon. And the power requirements drop by 95% each step.<p>Also microprocessor manufacturers have always pushed back against specialized coprocessors as much as they can. Apple bringing it all in house allows them to nullify that impediment.')
