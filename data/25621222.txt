It was one reviewer (potentially two reviewers) interpreting the guideline in a weird way, and the publicity caused someone with both a functioning brain and authority to take a look and fix it.<p>This is the root cause behind sooo many &quot;big company bans X&quot; decisions. Each step in the review&#x2F;appeals process has a false positive rate. If you have a 1% false positive rate, and 10000 apps, one of them will not only be taken down for no good reason, but the takedown will even be confirmed on appeal, purely due to human error.<p>I still always upvote the outrage posts, because they&#x27;re the only way to get a third person to look at it.')
