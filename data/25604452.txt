Now instead of cover bands having additional members or multi-instrumentalists to play brass or fiddle or whatever, they could just have the keyboard player fill that role too. With the DX7 it became &quot;good enough&quot; for a single synth to cover all of those sounds. It unlocked a door that later on the M1 and many other sample-based synths walked through.<p>On the 909&#x2F;303, I don&#x27;t dispute they were incredibly influential in the rave scene, especially in the 90s. I am one of those people with a 303 tattoo so I know very well what a reputation they had. But also I have some perspective on how small and dynamic that scene turned out to be in the greater scheme of things. Most of the ravers I know from back in the day couldn&#x27;t pick a 303 in a song and don&#x27;t even listen to acid or techno music any more.<p>I think a good comparison to an 808 is a Theremin. Lots of people, even people who don&#x27;t listen to electronic music or hip-hop know the names of these instruments and can probably pick one out of a song. I&#x27;d see the 909 or 303 more like a Strat or a Tele - still very influential and recognizable to people who are interested, but perhaps not so much in the mainstream consciousness.<p>But this is all opinion just based on anecdotes, so I am open to the idea I might be overestimating the cultural impact of one bit of gear or the other.')
