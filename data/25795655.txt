As you can imagine from an unmoderated community, it sucks and a lot of people say shitty things there.<p>A common refrain the author heard from people defending the group is &quot;They&#x27;re the nicest people in real life!&quot;, which may absolutely be the case, but publicly, they are presenting abusive versions of themselves.')
