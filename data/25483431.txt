In cloud tooling, my team of people all with zero experience doing vm provisioning can get production systems up, add logging, add alerting, add networking, etc., all very easily or with just low touch overhead from teams that manage best practices or compliance. Creating the same internal developer tool experience with data centers is SO expensive and requires a major headcount investment.')
