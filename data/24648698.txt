I am quite willing to concede that some languages may have it. After all, it is rather hard to know all languages out there. But it also seems that people are a bit too eager to add languages to the list. If you either have to use &#x27;using&#x27; or something like it it really does not count. My question would be whether you can do the HtmlElement example that I mentioned in my post. If you cannot, for instance, because the closing tag would be written whenever the garbage collector feels like it, it really does not count.')
