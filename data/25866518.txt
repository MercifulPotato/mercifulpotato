Their claim is that sync support was always an &quot;internal API&quot; and that it&#x27;s basically been an overlooked policy violation this whole time, which is now being &quot;fixed&quot; by disallowing distros from implementing it in Chromium.  (Chromium is the open-source-only bits of Google Chrome.)<p>Chromium installs must clearly be an insignificant amount of the overall Chrome user base, but it&#x27;s hard to not view this as yet another move from Google to neuter the open source Chromium project to push their own properties.<p>Gmail and Chrome (to a much lesser extent) have been in no small part about Google wanting to own your web identity.  It&#x27;s a clear part of the value proposition for a browser to remember your bookmarks, history, preferences, passwords, credit cards and more across all of the devices that you use.  Removing this support directly pushes users to Chrome, where Google can monetize all sorts of tracking activity through their proprietary bits.  All of this reeks, and is hostile to the user community as well as to the Linux community.')
