If the police comes knocking, the only thing that can be done is to shutdown or seize the servers.<p>The police must have something against some users of guerilla mail (not a surprise given the nature of the service), they probably went against the servers because they couldn&#x27;t get a reply or any action from guerilla mail. I checked and found no contact information and no ownership information on their website.')
