In fact, the atom itself isn&#x27;t really somewhere definite.<p>On the other hand, just because they don&#x27;t exist somewhere specific that doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t exist. That charge and mass can&#x27;t just disappear, so if we ever observed the atom, we know that it still exists in some sense. Even with QFT, you may dispute whether the particle exists or not, but its conserved properties certainly do, regardless of how non-localized they may be.<p>And again, this is just an interpretation of QM that were discussing. Adherents of MWI would say that the particles are perfectly real, perfectly localized (in a particular world) and move essentially like classical particles, but they happen to interact with all different versions of themselves in all the different worlds, as long as they keep the same phase.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like MWI, but it is still consistent with all observations.')
