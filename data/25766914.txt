Apps generally ship their own copies of libraries inside of the app bundle, and it&#x27;s perfectly common to have multiple copies of a library as a result. I&#x27;m sure I have at least ten versions of the Sparkle framework for instance!<p>This conveniently avoids most of the downsides of dynamic linking, except I don&#x27;t think you get any of the upsides, eitherâ€”which is to say I&#x27;m not sure what the point is. I kind of like it because, since I don&#x27;t mind breaking code signatures, I can replace the frameworks in third party apps with updated copies. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not Apple&#x27;s intended use!')
