I believe Ad hominem attacks are in violation of your TOS, who do I report your post to?<p>Good luck at your attempts to create a walled garden of civility while the world burns. I&#x27;ll admit to being more antagonistic than needed be at times, but this idea that you can stay above the discourse happening everywhere else is silly.<p>But you&#x27;re small enough to ban your way to a nice uniform echo chamber of non-controversy. You will drift further away from accurately representing the world we live in, but I don&#x27;t think that was ever your goal.')
