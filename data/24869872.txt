There is no realistic series of errors that would lead you to really design an app with hardcoded sqli looking credentials or somehow return a cookie with a malformed header, let alone one that somehow automatically authenticated the user.\nI am extremely onboard with the idea that pentesting as a whole has a lot of scanner jockeys (and a lot of my current work is finding people who aren&#x27;t.) But you&#x27;re not testing for vulnerabilities that would actually show up in the real world, and it is hurting your analysis.')
