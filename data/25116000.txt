Item(by='gojomo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605555357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113482, text='We&#x27;ve backed into a particular default, more via path-dependencies than conscious choice, that:<p>* emails between major email providers have this lingering semi-authenticity indicator that authors didn&#x27;t explicitly choose<p>* to the extent the providers keep their DKIM keys non-public, only those providers (or those who exfiltrate such keys) can forge old emails<p>Both of these have problems if considered from 1st principles:<p>* Users should be able to control if they&#x27;re creating non-repudiable messages.<p>* No one, not even Google, should have the power to create authentic-seeming forgeries.<p>This article&#x27;s author, Matthew Green, suggests rapid expiration &amp; disclosure of DKIM keys to narrow the window of time the user is subject to a non-repudiation they didn&#x27;t choose. (Green here only specifically requests disclosure of years-old keys to invalidate older message archives, but conceivably a rigorous expiration-and-disclosure schedule could be chosen to limit the risk to weeks or days.)<p>And via public disclosure, Green intends to indirectly address the risk of privileged parties forging emails, by giving <i>everyone</i> the same power-to-forge older emails - so no particular forgery can be too convincing.<p>But these new defaults are nearly as ad-hoc – reactive without conscious design – as the DKIM problem they purport to solve.<p>Many would prefer that their emails, or at least some of them, be non-repudiable for a while or indefinitely. Many recipients would like to maintain their own private authenticity records – which as Green notes, can be bootstrapped into existence (even with rapid-expiring DKIM keys) by secure-timestamping messages &amp; current DKIM keys at the time they&#x27;re received.<p>(To the extent Google &amp; other providers have internally-trusted tamper-proof logs, they may already have de facto secure timestamping happening on all inbound&#x2F;outbound email. Thus any amount of DKIM key fouling wouldn&#x27;t stop <i>their</i> unique internal ability to authenticate older messages, for their own forensic or political purposes.)<p>I&#x27;d prefer users be given some visibility into, and choice over, how much durable authentication is added to their email messages – before adopting either Green&#x27;s quick fix (publish old keys ASAP), or defaulting all users to his potential longer-term solution of explicitly &quot;non-attributable email&quot; (per his KeyForge paper or other schemes).')
