When I flew Delta for the 4 years before the pandemic, anytime a pilot used the restroom, it was mandatory that a flight attendant take their place -- for exactly this reason.  Sit in first class long enough you begin to get comfortable with common flight procedures.<p>Keep in mind it&#x27;s not that the flight attendant can pilot a plane, it&#x27;s that they can unlock the door to let the other pilot back in the cockpit.<p>While it is unlikely, it&#x27;s still a possibility, and one that Delta, at least, is worried about happening.')
