How should anyone know that it might take <i>six months</i> for their bank to know whether a check is real or not?  Does anyone who isn&#x27;t actually a bank employee know that?  (What percentage even of bank employees know that?)<p>It seems to me that a person ought to be able to reasonably rely on a bank acting like a check has cleared, at least after some clearly stated period of time.')
