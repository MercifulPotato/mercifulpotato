For example, simulation results, deep learning models, graphs that you need to include in your LaTeX documents (which can be considered partly source code, partly generated content).<p>Also, deep learning training data often consists of large image files, and can also be considered &quot;source code&quot;, and in any case it can be very useful to put these under version control.<p>And finally it can be useful to put external dependencies as tar-files into your source tree.')
