Particularly the bit about being a pessimistic saver and an optimistic investor.<p>I&#x27;m 34. It&#x27;s dawning on me that I have been a pessimist all of my life. I have saved and saved, cut expenses here, minimized consumption there. I have known a bit of poverty in my earlier days and while my minimalism may reflect an on-going poverty, I have done ok for myself by two metrics: I own a home and I never let a price tag prevent me from buying what I want at the grocery store.

I have noticed that the successful ones are usually the optimists. Surely all enterprising begins with hope. But obviously, like any pessimist, I see myself as a realist, and I am sincere and frank in my discussions with others, but at what cost? It&#x27;s realistic to acknowledge that pessimism drives away opportunity, so I must become an optimist. But how?')
