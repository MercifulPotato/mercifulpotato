He walks through what &quot;programming&quot; means and how the concept of &quot;programming&quot; has shifted in little evolutionary leaps.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?t=167&amp;v=8pTEmbeENF4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?t=167&amp;v=8pTEmbeENF4</a><p>&quot;There can be a lot of resistance to new ways of working that require you to unlearn what you&#x27;ve already learned and think in new ways. ... And there can even be outright hostility.&quot;<p>Programming Baduk used to involve expert systems. Now convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can hoist a computer to superhuman performance, even doing so without pre-programmed rules (see MuZero). We no longer &quot;program&quot; computers to play Go, chess, shogi, or even Atari games.<p>Some people have difficulty keeping code structures in their mind&#x27;s eye. Here&#x27;s a conceptual development environment for navigating code visually, ending with a dual text editor:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u3QqjhzhnAw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=u3QqjhzhnAw</a><p>Is that programming?<p>What&#x27;s the difference between _typing_ instructions into a computer to place a graphical user interface widget on a screen and _telling_ the computer you&#x27;d like to put a toroid on the screen? Computers can use CNNs to fill in knowledge gaps. Even though the computer wasn&#x27;t told the colour, size, shading, material, or location of the toroid, it can still show us the ring.<p>Is telling a holodeck that you&#x27;d like to replay a scene from a novel a form of programming?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d7dfsLfWJvc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=d7dfsLfWJvc</a><p>Each evolutionary step in programming has given us more powerful ways to express ideas in ever terser forms. Few people code in binary anymore. Did Picard need to tell the computer where to put every chair, table, glass, and machine gun?<p>What is programming?')
