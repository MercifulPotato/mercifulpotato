Goes by without any issues, stuff still works.<p>There is change and then there is change. Yes, I understand that some things don&#x27;t need to change, and why do they always have to. Do I need my Desktop to still resemble 3.11 because &quot;Why did it ever change&quot;? - No.<p>Some things in life simply change and they always have. I try to keep up where change is necessary.<p>And if I would be shipping appliances to customers, why should I have &quot;forced updates&quot; of any kind outside of my control? I would never sell anything without my own repos, quality control, etc.<p>Do you seriously sell Debian devices to anyone and support them, if anything outside of your control breaks? I seriously don&#x27;t understand the argument.<p>And if I ship software of any kind that relies on some libraries, I have to maintain it, of course. This includes going with the major releases.<p>If this is embedded hardware, where there simply are only two or three updates in its lifetime, everything is different of course, but how on earth would I then have forced updates from RedHat??')
