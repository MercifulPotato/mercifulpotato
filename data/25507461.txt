Alternatively, just pretend the vesting was happening monthly.. how much is that 9.16%? The surviving founder does need enough incentive to continue. The OP should make sure it is hard equity of the same class as the investor&#x27;s shares, where there are tax liability distributions and other preferences. If the OP is before the vesting cliff and your co-founder is fixated 4%, then perhaps think about the balance as unpaid sweat equity, disbursed as deferred compensation at a reasonable interest rate, as a percentage of revenue, to be paid off before co-founder raises their owner draw? Critically, the OP should assume best intents and look for win-win situations. Finally, seek competent legal advice!')
