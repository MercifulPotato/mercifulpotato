Think of the present project as a study, a way to have a zero-tooling set-up that allows us to work on this without having to worry about platforms and other fast moving targets. The idea is to first make it work <i>very</i> well and to address all of the valid concerns raised in this thread (of which we for the most part were already aware, but HN wouldn&#x27;t be HN without its brutal reception of any piece of work). Then when it is bullet proof against such criticism it can be launched to a much larger audience.')
