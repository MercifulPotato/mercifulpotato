Let alone tactics, support&#x2F;logistics, force-projection, or whatever other strategic uses they intend to pursue?<p>2) I didn&#x27;t intend to make a political statement, just a hypothetical of &quot;What would an art-of-war destabilizing campaign look like?&quot;<p>I obviously share many of your concerns, but even <i>if</i> most of that is true, I don&#x27;t necessarily think a declining society will weaken the country militarily, at least not initially. If anything the US military is good at training and making use of people of all beliefs&#x2F; political leanings&#x2F; levels of intelligence&#x2F; etc. As long as technology is roughly on par, and the money printing presses run, the military will do fine. The <i>political and civilian</i> side of the (non-DOD) government, however, is an entirely different question.<p>3) &gt;this is how you get so many Republicans supporting $2,000 stimulus checks<p>Partially and&#x2F;or maybe. But there&#x27;s an alternative, conservative-consistent reasoning, in that mandatory shut-downs constitute a <i>government taking</i> (or even expropriation) under the law, and therefore &quot;victims&quot; should be compensated.<p>In practice, the SBA and PPP programs had this more of that type of structure, while of course the stimulus checks were done as a social welfare program.<p>But also, yes, there are many &quot;conservatives&quot; that seem to approve of populist social programs now. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see the ultimate party&#x2F;policies realignment.')
