You don&#x27;t get political or social brownie points for helping disabled people the way you would for other minority groups who are struggling. We are constantly ignored and forgotten.<p>I was in a situation where I needed money for healthcare that will never be covered by insurance, especially government sponsored universal insurance (EDIT: it will be covered eventually, maybe in 10 years). Gig jobs played a key role in my ability to purchase that healthcare and survive.<p>Regular employers will never hire me. Unions will never let me join them, because I can&#x27;t meet their requirements and make life harder for their able bodied employees. Gig work is the only option.<p>Healthy people aren&#x27;t nearly as caring as they&#x27;d like to believe, especially progressives.')
