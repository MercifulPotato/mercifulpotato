Mostly since you are free to boot (or work on doing so at least) NetBSD and countless other things on practically every Mac they&#x27;ve ever released, including the latest ones. They&#x27;re doing a horrible job at communicating this strategy too, because they&#x27;re communicating the opposite. For this Apple Silicon phase, it seems they&#x27;ve also missed a huge opportunity to finally execute on this strategy by spending a little time and money to develop the tools to do the <i>opposite</i> of that strategy and give users a way to boot unsigned kernels.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy it, sorry. I don&#x27;t even get why Apple would <i>want</i> to do this outside of sheer malice.')
