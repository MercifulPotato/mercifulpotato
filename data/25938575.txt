Where do you think the rest of the 14 billion is owed?  Probably institutional investors and HFT guys that have been playing market volitility, as they do.<p>There&#x27;s a couple guys that are fucked, but most of that money is going back into the pockets of &#x27;the big bad fund managers&#x27;<p>Same with Tesla, I don&#x27;t think the institutions that profited handsomely in that run up think it&#x27;s worth the price, but they think that the real gains are good for their funds.<p>Also note, retail guys are still probably pretty close to the one percent.  Who else has 50k lying around for something like this.  Sure he might not be a hedge fund, but he&#x27;s probably not working a minimum wage job and fixing inequality with his trades.')
