When you have a president who&#x27;s openly calling immigrants thieves and rapists, immigrants and their American kin become afraid of saying anything against the president. If you have a president who openly calls your religion &quot;a religion of death&quot; you&#x27;re going to be afraid. I support firing Trump supporters, of course I do I&#x27;m the son of the an immigrant and people like me are being locked up by him for nothing. Why would I ever want to work with someone who openly wants to throw me in jail?<p>Edit: ug I mean identity politics has really been tainting the discussion! Who could be causing this?!')
