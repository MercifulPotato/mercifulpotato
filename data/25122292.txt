Rhythmic variations can be highly irregular and even seemingly random, yet follow an underlying logic and be stylistically essential to the performance, which means they would merit notation in some form.<p>And I&#x27;m sorry, but regarding samba, you have absolutely no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. I assume you&#x27;re referring only to the surdo&#x27;s backbeat, but the essence of the samba rhythm is the sixteenth-note groove played by the pandeiro, and that sound is pretty much as far from &quot;extremely regular&quot; as you can get while still maintaining a consistent pulse. I found the style relevant to bring up, as it&#x27;s a commonly given basic example of a groove featuring microrhythmic variation.')
