Just as all of the BLM protesters weren&#x27;t a part of the riots, evidence shows the same is true for those that rallied.<p>Certainly. If you protested and didn&#x27;t breach the perimeter, you were doing exactly what BLM protestors were doing. Disclaimer: I say this as an objective statement on the action, and not a commentary on the relative merits of either movement.<p>You breached the perimeter, and entered the Capitol? Now we&#x27;re somewhere else.')
