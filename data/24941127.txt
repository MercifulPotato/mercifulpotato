While I have used it for many years now and not had a problem, it still may have problems on edge cases I haven&#x27;t touched on.  I mainly mention it here because it took me a while to find a nice small simple library that can be easily embedded in smaller microcontrollers and uses no dynamic memory.  Often a hard thing to come across anything done well.')
