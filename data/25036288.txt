Item(by='daxfohl', descendants=2, kids=[25036766], score=3, time=1604938603, title='Ask HN: What is a good side income for retirement?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='45 now and it&#x27;s hitting me I&#x27;m 10 years from a plausible retirement age.  I have a cushion of stocks but would like something a bit more income generating.  Doesn&#x27;t have to be a unicorn, doesn&#x27;t have to be software.  Just something to generate a reasonable amount of moderately-passive income so I&#x27;m more comfortable retiring at 55.<p>My wife wants us to go into real estate, but for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me.  It seems debt-funded and one bad renter or contractor can blow through your earnings.  Is there anything else anyone here has had positive experiences with?')
