PC gamer folks are going to have to put down their pitchforks for a second, and bear with me.<p>From the business perspective if you want to make money you <i>must</i> target the lowest, most common, denominator.  Game studios that do cross platform launches do the <i>vast</i> majority of their sales on console.  It&#x27;s not even close.  Even with TW3, 70% of their sales were on console, and that was considered low by industry standards.<p>What CDPR has done here by shipping a broken game on last gen is to light a pallet of $100 bills on fire.  It&#x27;s possible they don&#x27;t survive this as a studio, but it could very well be deserved.')
