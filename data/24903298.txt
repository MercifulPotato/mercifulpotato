The RIAA issued a notice in reference to section 1201 of the DMCA and Github has a specific complaint process for violations of that section, and I quote &quot;Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology&quot; [1]. That was the form that was used to make the complaint to Github. A link to the details of that complaint along with instructions on how to submit a notice for such violations can be found below. So what exactly is Microsoft or Github suing the RIAA for given that it is Github which provides a complaint process for technologies that circumvent section 1201 of the DMCA.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-...</a>')
