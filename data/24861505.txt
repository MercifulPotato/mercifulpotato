Most simple tools I&#x27;m aware of do not require elevation, or even installation for that matter. That said, a lot of tools do insist on elevation even when it is unnecessary.<p>I agree with the overall point: Mac does it better with Application Directories. You don&#x27;t even need to drag them to the Applications folder, they run anywhere including off of removable media.')
