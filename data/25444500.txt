Even if we assume that these businesses exist thanks to facebook, the ends do not justify the means. The economic value added doesn&#x27;t offset the privacy violations. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;make up&quot; for it.<p>&gt; Facebook&#x27;s access to user data should be curtailed significantly, and sadly, businesses likely will suffer. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good, evident third option just yet.<p>There doesn&#x27;t need to be a third option. Facebook and businesses who rely on such granular data, which is able to be gathered only by massively violating privacy, can and should pay equally massive penalties and&#x2F;or be wiped out.<p>Yes, people are behind those businesses, and rely on data collection&#x2F;tracking for their livelihoods, but honestly, they deserve no sympathy. They can get a job at Subway instead. The ends do not, and have never, justified the means.<p>Whatever apple can do to drive a stake through the heart of Facebook (and goog and others, honestly), is a positive.')
