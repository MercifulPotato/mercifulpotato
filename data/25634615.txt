While those ModRM bytes popping up everywhere is annoying as f* (too easy to flip an instruction into a form with almost-guaranteed-to-be-invalid memory access), at least due to the density there won&#x27;t be reserved bits. For example, in AArch64 if bit 28 and bit 27 is both zero the instruction will almost certainly be an invalid one (hitting unallocated area), and with a single bit flip all branch instructions will have [28:27] = b&#x27;00...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ddi0596&#x2F;h&#x2F;top-level-encodings-for-a64" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ddi0596&#x2F;h&#x2F;top-level-encodings...</a>')
