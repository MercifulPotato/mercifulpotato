Stripe is trying to reduce that $775.<p>Non-sequitur. And no, I believe that&#x27;s a marginal rate.<p>&gt; Assuming all energy comes from coal<p>all=&gt;any, coal=&gt;hydrocarbons<p>&gt; All plants die and decay, returning carbon to the carbon cycle.<p>How do you think the fossil fuels got underground in the first place?<p>Okay, yeah, it&#x27;s complicated, but the planet has sequestered carbon from volcanic eruptions over billions of years before anyone tried pumping it down a mine shaft. Really it&#x27;s mostly done by clouds, which absorb CO2 into H2CO3 and then plankton build their shells out of it, and deposit it as lime at the bottom of the ocean. Land-based carbon also washes away as acid or gets buried or turned into ash by oxygen-poor heat from fires.<p>Now the whole problem we&#x27;re concerned about is not exactly carbon, but global warming, which is caused firstly by low albedo, and secondly by greenhouse gas absorption of surface heat remissions.<p>The most significant source of albedo is clouds, as is the most significant source of carbon capture. So it&#x27;s really too bad that we&#x27;ve been waging a global war on clouds. We seed clouds for aviation, for farming, for ski resorts, tourism, whatever; we hate clouds. Everybody does it.<p>It seems to me that I see less of them today than decades ago, but I don&#x27;t know. (Okay, I just checked, and yes, this is true)<p>&gt; we need to put carbon back<p>Sorry, but no, no, no. _We_ do not need to do anything. _We_ are not helping. Do you have any idea how much carbon emission it takes to build a sequestration plant? We need to do less of everything. Less driving, less building, less industry, and less buying junk you don&#x27;t need, even if 1% is going to some feel-good slush fund to pump up revenues for someone&#x27;s misguided eco-startup investments.')
