Purely informational banners would be enough, but the directive already _should_ have passed but was delayed, and since gdpr spooked everyone, everything and everyone is using cookie banners now anyway<p>The ePrivacy Directive passed in 2002. It was amended in 2009 to include the cookie rule. The ePrivacy Regulation which would codify cookie requirements as an EU-wide regulation has not passed yet.')
