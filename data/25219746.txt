They saw me promptly, the treatment was fine, the free meal was typically British.<p>I&#x27;ve been twice to Danish hospitals, and I think the experience is very comparable.  The staff in Copenhagen seemed kinder (a bit more time to reassure the patient etc) but otherwise there wasn&#x27;t much difference.<p>I trust both countries in 2015, and Denmark in 2020. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened in Britain since 2015. My family aren&#x27;t complaining (at least, no more than the usual British amount), but the British people keep voting against their interests.')
