And while algorithmic improvements are certainly needed, I think we could manage to use way more processing power too. Think of the Tesla self driving system - a beefier processing system is a big reason its even possible. And on their backend? Gobs of video data crunched in what must be a huge dataset. I think thereâ€™s plenty of room to throw more power at the problem and make traction. At least in robotics.')
