In the case of Cerulean, it&#x27;s also as a test jig to test out threading in Matrix for use in Element and other clients.<p>Meanwhile, just because one person (kegsay) spent a few weeks putting together Cerulean doesn&#x27;t mean that the other thousands of people in the Matrix ecosystem were idle.  For instance, Fractal merged matrix-rust-sdk support 2 weeks ago, which implements full E2EE (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;fractal&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;626" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;fractal&#x2F;-&#x2F;merge_requests&#x2F;626</a>), so your complaints about pantalaimon should shortly be irrelevant.  (Plus it seems pretty miserable to complain about pantalaimon&#x27;s dependencies; the fact that the project exists at all as an E2EE stopgap is unusual - XMPP has no equivalent for instance, as far as I know).  In terms of other clients supporting E2EE: weechat-matrix, Mirage, FluffyChat, Seaglass, Nheko, Gomuks, Daydream and more have support.  Complaining that there are clients which don&#x27;t have E2EE is like trying to denounce the Web because there are browsers out there which don&#x27;t implement HTTPS.<p>Element Android still has work to be done, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, but it is growing rapidly (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-android&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;contributors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-android&#x2F;graphs&#x2F;contribu...</a>) and if development continues at this rate you should see perf, encryption bugs (almost all caused by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2518" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2518</a>), and even the &quot;wonky file picker&quot; and &quot;off look and feel&quot; and &quot;captioned images&quot; fixed.<p>Ironically, Cerulean is the first Matrix client to implement captioned images (after a fashion), so your captioned images on Android might benefit directly from Cerulean&#x27;s work there...')
