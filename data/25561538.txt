You demonstrate very well what the problem is with the Haskell community, and that in a topic about Haskell adoption.<p>For a language to be adopted it must be beginner friendly. And by beginner friendly, I don&#x27;t mean easy. It can have a steep learning curve as long as it enables the user to be productive, otherwise the beginner will give up quickly.<p>For the experienced user things like, &quot;don&#x27;t use lazy IO&quot;, &quot;there are partial functions on the Prelude&quot;, &quot;String is slow&quot;, and &quot;code may throw exceptions where you don&#x27;t expect&quot;, may be obvious, but are not for the beginner. I don&#x27;t remember exactly how I ended up using &quot;lazy IO&quot;, but trust me it wasn&#x27;t because I ignored a big fat warning that I should <i>NOT</i> be using it.<p>It&#x27;s gotchas like these that prevent the beginner from being productive.<p>Then the beginner reaches out to the community sharing his experience and gets a defensive and passive aggressive reply like yours. It&#x27;s enough to make them not want to touch that language ever again.<p>You think you are defending your favorite language, but actually you are doing more harm.')
