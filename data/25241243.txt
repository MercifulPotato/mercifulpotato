No fault of yours; it&#x27;s so deeply infected our culture as to be practically invisible to anyone who&#x27;s a part of it.<p>That&#x27;s also why I mention the patently ridiculous level of backbiting and backstabbing that takes place in our culture - when people who taarof find themselves having to go through with a false offer, especially one that puts one in a substantially disadvantaged position (the &quot;losing&quot; end of the social transaction), the person on the receiving end often ends up subject to undue scorn down the road, or worse.<p>It&#x27;s pretty universal. I&#x27;ve seen it in Tehran, Esfahan, Shiraz, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver, Great Neck NY, and DC, and every time I&#x27;ve seen both the taarof social transaction as well as borne witness to the resulting backbiting days later. I can count examples on many more hands than I physically have, and while these are all anecdotes, I&#x27;ve got a high level of confidence based on just the sheer volume of interactions I&#x27;ve witnessed that this is one of the single worst aspects of our culture.<p>I apologize if my passion on the topic is coming off a bit too strong. I&#x27;ve seen livelihoods ruined because of it.')
