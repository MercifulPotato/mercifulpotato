That is really low to bring that kind of stuff up in this context. the fact that this is the highest comment speaks to how toxic this community has become.<p>His &quot;VC&quot; fund is a social good company that prioritizes people&#x27;s wellfare over profits. and who cares if its a success or failure, VC is hard.<p>He isn&#x27;t a hero and he isn&#x27;t a &quot;Dickhead&quot;. He&#x27;s just a human.<p>If you don&#x27;t know him personally you really shouldn&#x27;t be making these kinds of baseless adhominem attacks.<p>Reading your comment history, its nothing but black and white opinions and pointless preferences.<p>I am leaving this community forever. This whole place has gone down hill. There are no more hackers here. There is no more real discussion of anything. I feel bad for paul graham. This website is a disgrace.')
