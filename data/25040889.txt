The type of proctoring software used here was trivially bypassed only a few years ago, when the last of my friends were finishing up college. I haven&#x27;t been exposed to the topic since the last of them graduated, and from ProctorU&#x27;s help center it looks like the vendors have wised up to the VM trick (in some fashion). But it can still likely be subverted relatively easily, rendering all of those onerous environmental requirements moot since they all explicitly ignore the computer itself.<p>I sort of wish I had access to it, so I could probe around myself and write up a tutorial. Not that I&#x27;m an advocate of cheating, but more so as a big &quot;F<i></i>* You&quot; to the entire draconian process.')
