They were opened for consultation after an employee of Albert Einstein Hospital disclosed a list of users and passwords that gave access to the databases of people tested, diagnosed, and hospitalized by covid in the 27 states. According to Einstein, the hospital has access to the data because it is working on a project with the ministry.<p>With these passwords, it was possible to access covid-19 records released in two federal systems: the E-SUS-VE, in which suspicious and confirmed cases of the disease are reported when the patient has a mild or moderate condition, and the Sivep-Gripe, in which all hospitalizations for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are recorded, that is, the most severe patients.<p>The data exposure was discovered by Estad達o after a report received by the reporter with the link to the page where the system passwords were available. The spreadsheet with the information was published on October 28 in the personal profile of Wagner Santos, Einstein&#x27;s data scientist, on the github platform, used by programmers to host codes and files.<p>The report accessed the system to check the veracity of the data. When verifying that the passwords were valid, it searched for records of authorities who had already publicly disclosed diagnosis or suspicion of covid and confirmed that the data were correct.\nThe Ministry&#x27;s databases bring, besides the patients&#x27; personal information, details considered confidential about the clinical history, such as the existence of diseases or pre-existing conditions, among them diabetes, heart problems, cancer and HIV.\nSome records of hospitalized patients brought information from the medical records, such as which medications were administered during hospitalization. In Pazuello&#x27;s registry, for example, it was possible to know on which floor of the Armed Forces Hospital he was hospitalized and which professional he discharged during his stay.<p>Both public and private patients had their data exposed. This is because the notification of suspected or confirmed cases of covid to the Ministry of Health is mandatory to all hospitals.<p>For the lawyer Juliano Madalena, professor of Digital Law and founder of the righitodigital.io forum, the leakage of passwords and exposure of data that should be safeguarded by public authorities is worrying. According to the expert, the information can be used for commercial purposes by different companies. &quot;Health data can be used by companies in the industry that want to create specific products aimed at a public, by life insurance companies or health plans in an improper way, often even with discriminatory aspect, because you have the information about the health history of the person,&quot; he says.<p>The lawyer says that, considering the General Law of Data Protection, it is duty of who controls and accesses the data to adopt measures that avoid leaks. In this case, both Einstein and his employee and the Ministry of Health can be held responsible for collective damage for having exposed information from millions of people. Even when they do not act purposefully, those responsible for leaks of personal and sensitive data may be compelled to pay compensation for collective damage.<p>Ministry of Health and Einstein to investigate responsibility<p>After being reported by Estad達o about the leakage of passwords from federal systems, Albert Einstein Hospital and the Ministry of Health said that the access keys were removed from the Internet and exchanged in the systems, information confirmed by the report. They also stated that an internal investigation will be opened by Einstein to ascertain the responsibilities.<p>Einstein stated that it was only communicated yesterday afternoon, after contacting the report, that &quot;a collaborator would have filed information of access to certain systems without the adequate protection&quot;. The hospital says to have communicated the Ministry of Health so that &quot;the measures were taken to assure the protection of the referred information&quot;.<p>Einstein also stated that all its employees undergo digital security training and that &quot;it will take the appropriate administrative measures&quot;. Asked about the type of service it provided to the ministry, the hospital informed that it is a project of the Institutional Development Support Program of the Unified Health System (Proadi-SUS) in which epidemiological data were used to make predictive analysis of the pandemic.<p>The report questioned the institution why it had access to personal data and not only unidentified information and was informed that the database is not available to Einstein and only to the hospital employee who was based at the Ministry of Health itself.<p>The federal agency confirmed the partnership and said it held a meeting with Einstein to clarify the facts. He said that the professional Wagner Santos, who published the passwords, is hired by Einstein and works in the ministry since September as a data scientist. &quot;In the scope of the ministry&#x27;s security measures and in compliance and confidentiality protocols, he signed a term of responsibility before accessing the e-SUS Notifica database,&quot; said the federal folder.<p>According to the ministry, Einstein confirmed that there was human failure of one of his collaborators - and not of the system - and informed that he initiated the process of ascertaining the facts. The agency said it is performing &quot;the tracking of possible sites or cyberspaces where the data may have been replicated.<p>The folder also said that the SUS Computing Department (DataSUS) immediately revoked all access to logins and passwords that were contained in the aforementioned spreadsheet released by Einstein&#x27;s employee. &quot;The Ministry of Health emphasizes that all technicians who have access to their information systems sign a term of responsibility for the use of the information and all are aware that the disclosure of personal information is subject to criminal and administrative penalties.<p>Also searched for the report, Einstein&#x27;s employee Wagner Santos confirmed that he published the password spreadsheet in his profile on the github platform to perform a test in the implementation of a model, but forgot to remove the file from the public page.')
