All German phone plans I&#x27;ve ever seen renew for 12 months, not 24. Only the very first period after signup is 24 months. And you most likely have to cancel while at least 90 days remain in the current period, not later. You can even sign up and immediately cancel in the future at the 24 months mark.')
