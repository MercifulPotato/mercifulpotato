Assuming a two 10TB drives are $300 each  (actually can get them for less than $200) and last 5 years or warranty expires. ($300*2 drives &#x2F;5 years &#x2F; 10 TB = $12&#x2F;TB-Year). So AWS glacier is still ~4x the cost of buying physical drives with RAID 1 and keeping them at a friends house.<p>Honestly if there is any cloud storage that trades resiliency for price that would be awesome. As long as the cloud storage can tell me if any of the storage has been corrupted&#x2F;lost, I&#x27;d except a 10% yearly failure rate. If my home raid is 95% and the cloud is 90% then I have an effective yearly data loss of only 0.5%.')
