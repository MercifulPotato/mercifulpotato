They would have got me on board if he hadn&#x27;t shown up.<p>All the game developers I applied to were incredibly slow in their communications. It would take weeks to arrange an interview and subsequently get a response back from them. I often thought, &quot;Can I afford to take the time to apply to another games company?&quot; Eventually I got into web dev with a couple of friends of mine, and work on games in my own time.')
