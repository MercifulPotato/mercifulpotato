Is this the case? If so, this represents an enormous threat to privacy. It should not be possible for people at a bank or law enforcement to do a db query without judicial consent, find out everything someone owns, and illegally leak that data to their friend &#x2F; reporter &#x2F; relative &#x2F; lawyer &#x2F; PI who asked. I don&#x27;t care if that makes their work harder or more expensive; unless someone has reasonable suspicion that a person is engaging in illegal activity, there are good reasons for that data to be private.')
