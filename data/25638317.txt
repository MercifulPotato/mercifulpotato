DNS and LDAP are robust tree-structured replicated attribute stores; mix in Kerberos for a complete foundation of general purpose directory services.  NNTP supplies a straightforward Gossip protocol for eventually-consistent distributed pub&#x2F;sub.  MQTT is still good for lightweight telemetry.  I have services I authenticate with via Lamport&#x27;s mostly forgotten scheme (S&#x2F;KEY).  And so on.<p>There is a current fad of HTTP+JSON as a generic protocol substrate, but it&#x27;s almost always a mediocre fit for the problem at hand.  Go read the RFC archives, there&#x27;s diamonds to be found.<p>On the other hand, and perhaps even by the same token: using EC2 metadata isn&#x27;t a completely terrible idea if it&#x27;s the infrastructure you already have and the semantics line up with specific needs.')
