I have all the old order details for CDs from 20 years ago and they&#x27;ve definitely got cheaper. I also have my old gig tickets from back then (I kept them despite some being a bit sweaty), and gigs have definitely gone up in price, maybe even 2 or 3 times the amount.<p>I am not sure recordings should be seen as the marketing for live performance though - what about bands in another country? They will never tour here. And I will never get to see The Beatles...<p>Also, recorded songs can sound very different to live songs, hence the &quot;thin&quot; nature of some of the live recordings. The ability to create a sonic soundscape on a recording is what makes it so special.<p>Recordings should be seen as art you are paying for. Nobody seems to mind buying a painting but objects to spending money on a CD. Baffling.')
