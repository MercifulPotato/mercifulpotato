Do you have studies to back this claim up? I don’t trust that the medical system is more grounded in their thinking- the Public Health Service purposefully withheld medical treatment for  syphilis for hundreds of black men for over 40 years. They willfully decided to target black men with this disease and then refused to treat them when a cure became available, going so far as to prevent the military from informing or treating these men during war time. Even at the time the experiment began, the ethical guidelines recommended syphilis be treated with what they had at the time, and the doctors knowing ignored this ethical recommendation, and continued on passing through the hands of multiple doctors working on preventing healthcare from being issued to black men for over 40 years. The medical community promoted people participating in this act and it was only after repeated whistleblower attempts was the extent of this horrific behavior uncovered. Indeed it was only when the <i>media</i> started to cover it that the full extent of the inhumane, unjustifiable behavior at the hands of doctors came to light.<p>To this day we know that the medical field is systematically unable to accurately treat black and female patients equivalently to white and male patients. (Unable for example to realize heart attacks in female patients represent differently for decades).<p>I don’t buy without formal study that the average deviation from basic opinions of reality deviate more in certain fields of study than others. Claiming it without any evidence is itself a form of deviating from observed reality.')
