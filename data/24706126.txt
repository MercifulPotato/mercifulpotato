A block-level element cannot be within another block, but you have to know that &quot;p&quot; and &quot;ul&quot; are block-level. Explicit closing does not require you to know the structure and thus makes the processing simpler.<p>It&#x27;s as in JavaScript: you can omit the &quot;;&quot; at the end of a statement and the parser will figure it out, but it only makes the parser more complex and introduces subtle differences you have to learn. If JS parser were more strict, it would be simpler both internally and conceptually.')
