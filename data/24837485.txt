The power of being able to visualize where your code is spending its time is so obvious and I&#x27;m glad people are building tools to make that easier.<p>As a quick compare and contrast between py-spy and pyinstrument it looks like py-spy has the advantage of being able to attach to an already running process which is super useful when your program is stuck and you don&#x27;t know why. I haven&#x27;t used pyinstrument yet but I do like the fact that it can do its flame graph in the console, sometimes I find saving down an svg file and opening up the browser a bit arduous. Excited to give it a try.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benfred&#x2F;py-spy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;benfred&#x2F;py-spy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;08&#x2F;an-awesome-new-python-profiler--py-spy-&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jvns.ca&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;08&#x2F;an-awesome-new-python-profil...</a>')
