No doubt it would not work with lots of teams in practice, but I think it would work for a lot if they were ever given the option.<p>Of course the way to do it is not to completely let the team go untethered with monthly checkins. You can still monitor progress, at the tech-lead level. But micromanaging the team members has always seemed hugely detrimental to me. In particular, let the team deliver in chunks: a prototype, a major feature, a reduction in bugs. But let them follow their passions in their day-to-day work.<p>In my experience, plan B gets something done, but you pay for it by shipping half as much and it&#x27;s half the quality, plus everyone is unhappy. I guess if all you want is to ship something for a deadline go for it.<p>edit: to be clear, I don&#x27;t think you should turn the team totally loose. I just think the right level of external micromanagement is at the scale of weeks, rather than the &#x27;hours&#x27; I see useless managers doing in practice.')
