Swagger&#x2F;OpenAPI theoretically help with this on the REST side of things, but it&#x27;s up to the person publishing the Swagger as to whether it is actually 100% correct, or just a first order approximation.<p>But, I agree it&#x27;s easier to have one protocol than two inside a company, so that would definitely be a downside of having both REST and gRPC in one organization.')
