I really, really hate working for other people but the things I would like to work on instead are time-consuming and the core work is not easily farmed out.<p>I&#x27;m currently saving up to do just that and its like, &quot;I could buy a house with this money&quot; or &quot;I could go on sabbatical with this money&quot;, or &quot;I could bet everything on a business that may or may not succeed and potentially lose it all&quot;<p>And if I do? There is nothing except going back to the tech grind, or homelessness, or another (far less lucrative) career. Unemployment won&#x27;t help me (which is complete and utter BULLSHIT for the amount of money I&#x27;ve paid into it), and I&#x27;d be ineligible for social security due to that previous tech income hanging over my head. There are no, &quot;sorry you failed, here&#x27;s some money to get back on your feet and try again&quot; grants<p>It really underscores the reality that most of these founders have rich family or friends to fall back on.')
