A data center, in the office, with $250k of retrofit.<p>3. A LAN network that can support 2Tbps cross talk; about $250k.<p>4. Data center control software; four engineers for a year @ 1M all-in.<p>So you’re talking about $2M just to turn the lights on for a data center test suite, and about $10k&#x2F;Mac installed.<p>I’d guess $5k&#x2F;yr is justified in just not having to write you own “EC2 for Mac” or deal with hybrid clouds.')
