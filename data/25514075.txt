In most cases you wont be getting 1Gbps from WiFi.<p>But having said that, WiFi is improving at the rate simply because there is a much larger market to drive its volume, and amortised R&amp;D. WiFi is included in every laptop, tablet, Smartphones and many other applications. That is nearly 2 Billion devices a year. Compared to Ethernet, you are looking at Desktop PC, Servers and other much smaller niche like NAS. \nNot to mention faster WiFI ( aka WiFi 6 ) is an easier sell to consumers than faster Ethernet which is really only aiming at prosumers.<p>First draft of WiFi 7 will arrive in a few months time.<p>&gt;is Ethernet&#x2F;wired still a sane choice<p>Always use wired if you have a choice.')
