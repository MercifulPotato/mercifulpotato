You remove the engine and use it somewhere else for a few years. If that engine breaks within the warranty period of the SUV, can you take <i>just the engine</i> to your local Ford dealer and ask them to fix it? Probably not.<p>Arguably, you can put the engine back into the SUV and take the entire car to a Ford dealer for repair. But would that constitute fraud on your part?')
