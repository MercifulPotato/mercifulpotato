I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re necessary, and I find use of &quot;informal IM style&quot; (eliding capitalization and final periods) to be much more telling of tone, personally, especially among young people.<p>Periods + capitalization (when writing in English) over IM comes across as &quot;cold&quot; to me, whether or not someone&#x27;s using emoji; unless they&#x27;re above a certain age, of course.')
