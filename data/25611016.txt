He decided to get out of anything involving dealing with people and focus on cryptocurrencies.<p>Likewise, I had my run at management and saw how my best intentions and positive support for growth in others inevitably blew up in my face. Even people who “have everything” at work may have problems outside of work they bring to the job. And now those problems are YOUR problems.<p>There is a story arc for peoples careers in a company.
