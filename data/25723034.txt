Item(by='rubycon22', descendants=None, kids=[25723567], score=None, time=1610328653, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722955, text='Hello, just wanted to let you know you should probably use a different word instead of &quot;niggling&quot;, just to be safe in case some day in the future someone may find your post and try to cast you as a racist. Or worst, it may be detected by an algorithm and your post could be demerited based on that parameter and you would not know why. While niggling is a legitimate word and has no racist origin, people may construe it as insensitive because it might trigger someone due to the similarity to a certain word. Also, actual racists sometimes use a variation of niggling to refer to black children. Sorry that it has to be this way.')
