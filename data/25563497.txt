To take this example further: of the 700 initial applicants, how many would be _adequate_ for the position? You had the opportunity to have quite detailed interviews from the pick of the bunch - is the goal to find the very best of the lot because you can afford to be picky; or there are genuinely only 3-4 in the 700 who could _adequately_ do the job?<p>My preexisting mental model is that from the 700 applicants, 30 could have filled the position adequately, with perhaps a ~5% gain across them. Each additional step in the interview process yields increasingly diminishing returns but is still worth it because ... you can choose to be picky in this market. The risks associated with a mishire are also presumably greatly reduced with each diminishingly selective step. Or is it that there genuinely exists only 2-3 people in that pool who are a good fit for the role, and you have little choice but to engage in kissing a whole load of frogs to find your prince?')
