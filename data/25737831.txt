Did Trump violate this or not? If you&#x27;re looking for a simple factual answer, you cannot get one, because this is a legal question, and will only ever (if ever) decided by an actual court case. There are arguments that he did, based on some data, and there are arguments that he didn&#x27;t, based on beliefs that the data isn&#x27;t relevant. Only an actual court case will ever come to a conclusion (and even that will be disputed by many).<p>There&#x27;s a tendency for some of us (I include myself in this) to want the world to offer clear, black-or-white, yes-or-no, true-or-false answers to things. But the world doesn&#x27;t offer this most of the time, certainly not in the realm of human affairs. There are no hall monitors or gods sitting on thrones to decide if Trump did or did not break the law or do terrible things. Only other human beings, whose opinions, clearly, diverge.')
