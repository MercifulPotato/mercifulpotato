So you put them near grocery stores, or coffee shops, or a mall.<p>Gas stations are typically not located within walking distance of any kind of retail. They are set off a ways because they are nasty, smelly business. No one hangs out at a gas station, you run into the convenience store for maybe 60 seconds, and hate it every second you&#x27;re there.<p>I would assume gas stations also have a fairly low electrical draw, so not likely to be located near transmission lines. Versus a mall or major retail outlet probably already has decent transmission capacity to make adding an additional few MWs for charging a lot easier.')
