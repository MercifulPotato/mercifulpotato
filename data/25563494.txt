I&#x27;m one of the co-founders at Seam (YC S20) and we try to NOT be that. Specifically, this past fall, we received probably 200+ engineering applications and we genuinely try to respond to every single one. At times, it&#x27;s exhausting and time consuming, especially when there are other pressing things to handle. I&#x27;ll admit that we are not always perfect either (and I am genuinely sorry if you haven&#x27;t heard back from us yet!). Yet our philosophy&#x2F;culture is simple: always be gracious and grateful that people think enough of Seam to want to come work with us, and the best way to show it, is to spend a few minutes getting back to them with yes&#x2F;no + reasons for passing.')
