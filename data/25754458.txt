I thought the typical goal of hackers and startups was to &quot;change the world&quot; and &quot;make a difference&quot;. How does selling to Visa accomplish those things? Isn&#x27;t expressing sympathy with Plaid&#x27;s staff for not getting a payout effectively saying &quot;sorry that you might actually have to deliver on the lofty promises this time&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s also kind of indicative of how small startup ambitions have become. Acquisition has become a measure of success, not failure.')
