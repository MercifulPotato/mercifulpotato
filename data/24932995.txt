This is why these arguments aren&#x27;t taken seriously by anyone and why they are entirely ignored by those without an ideological motivation for the basis, which is that economics is not a social science but instead a transcendent discipline which can ignore both epistemology and empirical evidence and thus come to more convenient conclusions that completely ignore all the inconvenient conclusions of social science, experiments, history, and real life.')
