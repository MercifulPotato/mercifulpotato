I&#x27;m also new to Django but not to web dev, and it&#x27;s been a pain the ass. I haven&#x27;t been stuck with any Django aspects (great framework otherwise) but rather issues with the libraries.<p>In the end I think I will make it work, and robustly. So I don&#x27;t want to diminish the work of all the open-source devs who have worked on those libraries; I count my lucky stars that they&#x27;re available in the open and for free.<p>But it&#x27;s been painful nonetheless, and I am shocked that a better and more streamlined dev experience is not available, especially in such a popular stack.')
