That&#x27;s not exactly a &quot;huge immigrant population&quot; by my account.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migrationpolicy.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;data-hub&#x2F;charts&#x2F;us-immigrant-population-metropolitan-area" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.migrationpolicy.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;data-hub&#x2F;charts&#x2F;us-...</a>')
