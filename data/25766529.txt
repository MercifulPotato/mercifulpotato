Consider that computer chess tournaments do not start with the pieces in their initial positions. The first 5-15 moves are predetermined by human master players to achieve positions that are imbalanced while not having a side with a clearer advantage. Otherwise it would be even more of a draw fest.<p>This makes things a bit worse for black, typically, because playing for the win as black means making some positional concession (that white can exploit after successfully defending) in exchange for the initiative and a chance for an attack.<p>In human play, black has a little more ability than white to steer the game towards their opening preparation[1]. If they want to win, they will try to get have a position that they know in and out from (computer-assisted) home preparation. But there are still a lot of draws in classical (many hours per game) chess.<p>[1] Chess openings that white chooses are typically called &quot;attack&quot; (King&#x27;s Indian Attack) or &quot;game&quot; (Scotch Game), while those that black chooses are called &quot;defense&quot; (Sicilian defense). You&#x27;ll find that there are a lot more &quot;defenses&quot; that black can choose from than &quot;attacks&quot;.')
