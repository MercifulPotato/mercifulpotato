You could ace the degree but not have the experience to deliver real projects until you have practice.<p>Besides that, a lot of job titles are arbitrary, made up and not consistent between companies. Call yourself what you think you&#x27;re qualified to do and want to do. Same if you&#x27;re freelance or a consultant, because nobody is going to give you a title.')
