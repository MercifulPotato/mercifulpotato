While fantastic for the community, they can be expensive. Operating as if your Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc is expensive when you don&#x27;t have the money printing machine.<p>I think it&#x27;ll be a long term lose for Mozilla, but things don&#x27;t seem great in the short term so maybe priorities needed to shift.')
