The Protobuf RecordIO &#x2F; TFRecord formats are very unhelpful for this use case.<p>Enter Protobag: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StandardCyborg&#x2F;protobag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StandardCyborg&#x2F;protobag</a><p>Protobag is a library that helps you write and read time-series and other collections of Protobuf data using the standard Tar and Zip archives as containers.  Protobag also includes code for leveraging self-describing messages to embed schemas in archives so that you never have data on disk that you can&#x27;t read.  Hope somebody finds Protobag helpful.')
