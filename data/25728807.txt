One should not underestimate the effort in that, though. Some time ago I covered some two thousand lines of code completely in tests. As in, all code paths, checking all side effects. Kind of an effort in the spirit of &quot;dealing effectivly with legacy code&quot; by Michael Feathers. They were quite non-trivial and it took me about two months. Doing such a thing may not always be feasible. Also if code is written by others they may have covered fewer code paths in tests than one would have liked. A type checker will check all code paths but the tests that your predecessor failed to write are not checking anything.')
