I&#x27;m so allergic to it. I&#x27;d rather write my own 2D tile tree format, with a simple flex-like rendering layout, than to work with HTML and expect reliability. HTML was never designed for interactive applications.<p>The historic reality is that HTML served as a &quot;backdoor&quot;&#x2F;gateway to let the linux community compete with microsoft: linux devs could ship their code for windows clients.<p>Now, HTML webapps cannot run properly on a mobile platform without depleting expensive batteries. So each mobile platform are making bucks on the back of developers who have to work twice as hard.<p>I have very high hopes that webassembly could somehow solve all those problems, but there are several problems:<p>* Not all browser vendors like WASM and I doubt that any WASM progress would be supported equally.<p>* WASM toolchains are not really mature for most languages. Compiler makers don&#x27;t have a lot of incentive working with WASM.<p>* The DOM would still exist.')
