My trust of neighbors is more social and less technical. I am less likely to run into bots (and predators) on social media because local administration means those people <i>must</i> be within the jurisdiction of local law enforcement.<p>&gt; The locality is a worst of both worlds, arbitrarily limiting discovery if they want to see and be seen and not providing any security as anyone could bridge access within or likely spoof an identity.<p>Part of the point would be to disallow this bridging. If you wanna be seen on both the internet and locally, that would be easy to do. But bridging outsiders into the local network means taking responsibility for them and their actions. And no one would want to do that unless it&#x27;s people they know.')
