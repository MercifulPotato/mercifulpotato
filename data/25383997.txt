I&#x27;d also want to add something for this:<p>&gt;  Businesses above a certain size overwhelmingly use pcs unless they are in specific arty sectors. M1 won&#x27;t change that, or at least not rapidly.<p>Besides the fact, which many HN users working for FAANGS or startups don&#x27;t encounter, that big enterprises are both rigid and also quite locked into the Microsoft&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;Office mono culture, big companies tend to have very elaborate purchasing processes.<p>Things with just 1 vendor tend to be completely ignored, if they&#x27;re meant to be used throughout the company. There is a certain irony with my previous paragraph, but Microsoft stuff is usually grandfathered in, the rules for new acquisitions don&#x27;t apply to them. On top of that Microsoft has super solid backwards&#x2F;forwards compatibility, migration paths and an amazing history of working with enterprises, as much as they are hated especially by the Open Source community for other things.<p>So you can expect ARM Macs to be adopted and used, but most likely frowned upon by IT departments and CIOs if too many people want them. With Intel they can have a bidding process or at least a product comparison between Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc. With Apple it&#x27;s... just Apple. Also Apple&#x27;s B2B side is super underpowered and their history is very chequered due to their frequent breaking changes.')
