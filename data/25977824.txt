And that if those extra fees are not paid, then any armed assaults are fair game, should be consequence free and really is the fault of the speaker?<p>2) This has been debunked time and time again. It was not Antifa assaulting the capital. It was Trump supporters. Stop trying to blame this on your enemy just because your attack failed.<p>3) Demonstrations are a integral part of a healthy democracy. An armed assault on the capital is not a demonstration. When Trump won, there were plenty of demonstrations against him, both in the US and across the world. That is perfectly fair. The opposition however did not assault the capital in an attempt to overthrow democracy. And the fact that mainstream republicans canâ€™t tell the difference between those two is extremely scary.')
