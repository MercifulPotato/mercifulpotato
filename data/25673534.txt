Nobody has the ability to prove everything to themselves and everyone else from first principles. Everyone takes shortcuts by repeating things they were told by others, thus &quot;lying&quot; is occasionally the 5-year old type of lying where someone just makes something up on the spot and tries to avoid looking guilty, but these are not the meaningful or common types of lies. In reality &quot;lies&quot; refer to the personal threshold someone has for edges in a sort of transitive PageRank over the graph of all claims made by all people.<p>A good way to see this is by looking at what news organisations call &quot;fact checks&quot;. Almost always, these are simply repeating the claims of some random academics or government institutions, which are taken to be true by default. A lot of people really do assign a very high prior to &quot;member of the establishment saying something makes it true&quot;, but a whole lot of other people do not. If the latter go and dig in and discover the underlying claim seems false, and start saying so, then the news orgs will claim it&#x27;s &quot;disinformation&quot; and the others will say it&#x27;s the &quot;lying media&quot; and yet nobody is literally making things up maliciously, even if a claim is objectively true or false.')
