These may vary per country (E.g. Scotland vs England), I&#x27;m only familiar with England.<p>For example a contract to sell&#x2F;buy property must be done by deed, which among other things requires special wording and witnessed signatures.<p>Owners are also registered with Land Registry and there is a limit to 4 legal owners. If there are more owners a legal instruments like a trust must be setup in order to create beneficial owners.<p>Bottom line: it is not simple. Whatever this website allows to sell and buy it is unlikely to be actually shares in properties, but rather some contractual rights to receive a share of profits based on level of investment (however that might be calculated as it&#x27;s not clear), like property investment funds, which this effectively likely is.<p>Values of properties do go up and down. How can they adjust on a daily basis? They cannot. Best one can do is to hire a Chartered Surveyor every 6 months or so to get an independent valuation.')
