UIC limits our trains to 750m top, we don&#x27;t have the space required for train yards that can handle longer trains, and the signal blocks are too short apart to handle trains longer than that (basic railway safety, a train must always have enough free space in front so that it can brake from full speed to zero in case of crossing a red light without crashing into the train in front). US trains run in multiple kilometers of length, so they have vastly greater capacity.<p>2) our car height is limited because our networks are largely electrified which means you can&#x27;t double stack containers on them<p>3) our infrastructure is densely packed which means that you can&#x27;t just run a train uplink to a random warehouse, and for those industries that do have a train uplink, the shunting required is expensive (need to maintain locomotives and trained drivers, which are in rare supply compared to truck drivers).<p>&gt; Being government subsidised, often nationalised, there&#x27;s no innovation anywhere, nobody cares, all the usual problems of socialised infrastructure<p>WTF? That&#x27;s just flat out wrong and ideological. There is no real innovation <i>anywhere</i> in railways, the only thing that the US makes different is that freight trains are prioritized and longer, but that&#x27;s hardly innovative (and again, as Europe is smaller and denser, impossible to replicate).<p>With smaller innovations (I&#x27;d call these &quot;improvements&quot;) the situation looks different - e.g. the digitalization of train control aka ETCS, automated couplers, more efficient&#x2F;silent braking systems... the tech exists, vendors exist - but good luck getting <i>all the private freight companies</i> to on-board to that new tech, as they don&#x27;t want to bear the cost of progress! That, and solely that, is why Europe is still stuck with screw couplers and dumb freight carriages.')
