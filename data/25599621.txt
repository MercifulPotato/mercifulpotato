Reversibility, transaction speed, increasing and decreasing the supply.  The problem is that centralization creates an investment contract.  We already have a medium for exchanging those.  It&#x27;s called the stock market.  Bitcoin operates out of the control of any government or regulation.  Thus, the decentralization imposes limitations on its design.<p>XRP tried to make a centralized cryptocurrency that solved those problems and now the SEC is basically telling them they have to give all the money back because it&#x27;s an investment contract.')
