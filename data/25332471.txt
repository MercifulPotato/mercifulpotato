Item(by='AndrewUnmuted', descendants=None, kids=[25335755], score=None, time=1607351829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331470, text='&gt; Your reaction to my post is to ignore and dismiss my experience.<p>I did no such thing. In fact, I directly addressed your scenario before you even replied to me (<i>emphasis</i> added):<p>&gt;&gt; To have died of COVID, you had to be on death&#x27;s door already, or <i>so statistically unlucky as to make your suffering a rounding error</i>.<p>I then also reminded you of this here [0].<p>&gt; Then go to a damn hospital<p>I&#x27;ve already done that. I&#x27;ve never seen the hospitals so empty and inactive. Now, would you cease your pearl clutching?<p>I presented at the hospital with appendicitis back in mid-April - remember mid April? - requiring surgery immediately. I was told to go home and wait 3 weeks because they couldn&#x27;t operate on me. During this waiting time I nearly died due to contracting sepsis. But yeah, great thing we didn&#x27;t expose me or any of those nurses who were sitting around <i>DOING NOTHING</i> to the virus that causes COVID-19. I was the 2nd person in all of NYC to receive &quot;elective&quot; surgery after the ban on doing it was lifted. I&#x27;m lucky to be responding to you right now.<p>Nonetheless, I am starting to see how obvious the lockdown&#x27;s effects have been on you. You can&#x27;t be seriously trying to compare with me a warlock from colonial Massachusetts?<p>&gt; Excuse me if I don&#x27;t want to be part of that footnote.<p>If you want to be excused, I&#x27;m going to need some evidence of this &quot;friend,&quot; because, my apologies in advance, but I think you are making it up.<p>Until then, I will continue to survive this terrible infringement upon our basic human rights by remaining exactly as I am. It&#x27;s been working, after all. I will:<p>1. Never wear a mask - in public or in private.<p>2. Not care about #1 because everyone I encounter wishes they had the courage to do what they want.<p>3. Live a healthy life with an strong immune system.<p>4. Socialize with the people I love - a lot. In-person. On my own property, where law enforcement requires a warrant to enter.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25327365" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25327365</a>')
