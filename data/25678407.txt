It&#x27;s ~700% of their 2019 EBITDA (they had a pretty bad year revenue-wise in 2019) and I expect they will have a significantly negative EBITDA for 2020 (it&#x27;s -$4.6 billion for the 12 months through 2020-09-30).<p>Looking at historical trends at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;BA&#x2F;boeing&#x2F;ebitda" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;BA&#x2F;boeing&#x2F;ebitda</a> it \nlooks like it&#x27;s something like 25% of an eyeballed &quot;average year&quot; for Boeing.<p>I suspect you&#x27;re right that this is a little low given what was going on here.')
