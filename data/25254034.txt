Most people I know who aspire to own one work in finance and consulting roles, and don&#x27;t really care that much about the environment, they just want something cool.  The poser environmentalism just comes along for the ride.<p>Likewise, when people upgrade to the latest iPhone every generation, they aren&#x27;t thinking about their recycling program, let alone the environmental cost of extraction of rare earth materials, or the workers at Foxconn.<p>That Elon Musk didn&#x27;t bother working on the waste part of the equation, doesn&#x27;t surprise me.')
