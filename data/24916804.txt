Amazon asked the seller for the receipts from the manufacturers to prove that they were real; he gave them, but Amazon said they didn&#x27;t count because they were more than a year old.  But that&#x27;s when he actually bought the merchandise, so I&#x27;m not sure what Amazon expected him to do.')
