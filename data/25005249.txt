I think we agree on more that we disagree about, but we happen to be talking about Prop L.<p>The question on L is what&#x27;s any of this have to do with the amount of money made by a CEO&#x27;s employees? Should a CEO of a small number of highly paid employees be taxed less than the CEO of a large number of blue collar employees? That doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>People talk about the ratio of employee to CEO pay because it&#x27;s a quantifiable indicator of underlying causes. Trying to change the indicator directly misses the point. Why is the city so unaffordable to the working class? That&#x27;s not being solved by this.')
