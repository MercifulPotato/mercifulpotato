I imagine a decent effort to make an OSHW laser printer would gather a lot of interest. Even if the first printer was slow, expensive and had shitty resolution.<p>Printers are synonymous with trouble. The market is saturated with shitty printers with anti-consumer products and features.<p>If you need a printer now, by all means, avoid the bad brands, and go for a laser, preferably monochrome, with an ethernet port, postscript support and IPP support.')
