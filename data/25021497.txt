At some point rating of some sources is going to be too low to even consider them, and some will be Ok-ish. That&#x27;s how I will know what &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; to consider. They might end up not being &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; altogether (like conspiracy theory that Iraq does not have WMD).<p>Hope it helps.')
