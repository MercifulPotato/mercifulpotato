When people predicted inflation from QE, they were predicting consumer price inflation. And depending on how you look at it, they were either right and that was entirely the point of the policy (if you look at the <i>difference</i> between actual results and what was predicted without the policy) or wrong because they failed to consider the deflation that would happen without the policy (if judged by a net standard rather than delta from without-the-policy expectations.)<p>Pointing to asset price inflation to say “there is the predicted inflation from QE” is the fallacy of equivocation; shifting definitions to suit the argument.')
