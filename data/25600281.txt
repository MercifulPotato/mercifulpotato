Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25600294], score=None, time=1609468677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600228, text='&gt; &gt; Deflation inhibits economic activity because money saved is worth more tomorrow than today even when not invested in productive enterprise.<p>&gt; What is the rationale for this?<p>The rationale is explicitly stated.<p>&gt; Because by that token, nobody would ever buy computers, because the money saved by not buying a computer today can go into buying a better computer tomorrow.<p>No, because then you lose out on the utility of the computer today.<p>The argument was about financial investments; that it discourages investments in productive enterprise since holding cash produces a real gain at low risk. Putting off buying <i>future potential money via investment in productive enterprises</i> because <i>holding money</i> gives you <i>more value of money in the future with less risk than investment in productive enterprise</i> and the liquidity of money now is not parallel to deferring buying a computer to buy a better one later.<p>&gt; if anything, deflation is fantastic because it makes you think twice before rampantly consuming shit,<p>While you call it “fantastic”, that&#x27;s just <i>another</i> way deflation depresses economic activity, discouraging consumption as well as productive investment. (Of course, discouraging consumption also further discourages investment itself.)')
