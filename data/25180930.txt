Instead I think the more effective approach is to be more visible - don’t have one email address, have 100,000 email addresses that are signed up for all the spam and loyalty programs, then anyone wanting to spy on your communication has to sort through all that, plus be on the lookout for your 100,001st email address. Sign up for publisher’s clearing house and a NY Times account with a hundred different addresses per state. Submit five thousand mail forwarding cards moving from those addresses to other addresses. Have a Google bot for each address do a lot of Google searches about moving to random foreign city in random foreign country. Do the same for ten factious roommates that live at the same addresses.
