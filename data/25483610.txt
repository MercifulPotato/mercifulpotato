That’s the real tradeoff here. If you devote all of your silicon to one big general purpose machine, you need to use it for everything and so it’s always powered.<p>If your general purpose machine can do every task but nothing well then it’s essentially always wasting a lot of energy. A collection of special purpose cores, on the other hand, might power on and off at different times, depending on the need. Each one could perform its task with a great deal of speed and energy efficiency. The whole system would then be much more energy efficient because it would only use the resources it needs to perform its tasks.<p>It’s like choosing to own either: a) a Ferrari super car or b) a minivan and a super sport bike. In the former case, you can go really fast if you want, but you’re going to be wasting a lot of fuel getting groceries or picking the kids up at school. In the latter case, you have one vehicle for mundane tasks and another for high speed fun. Your fuel costs will be way lower and you’ll be much more energy efficient!')
