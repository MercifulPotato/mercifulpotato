The engineers writing <i>that</i> code need to test it on full-scale projects (probably projects on loan to them from companies like Pixar.)<p>But moreover, changes to foundational macOS libraries can cause regressions in the performance of this type of software, and so macOS developers working on systems like Quartz, hardware developers working on the Neural Engine, etc., <i>also</i> work with these apps and their datasets as regression-test harnesses.<p>See also: the Microsoft devs who work on DirectX.<p>All of this testing requires &quot;workstation&quot; hardware. (Or servers, but Apple definitely <i>isn&#x27;t</i> making server hardware that can run macOS at this point. IIRC, they&#x27;re instead keeping macOS BSD-ish enough to be able to write software that can be developed on macOS and then deployed on NetBSD.)')
