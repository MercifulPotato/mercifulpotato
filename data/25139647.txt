More supply of money (loans) means prices will always go UP. This is common economic sense.<p>To correct this imbalance, the higher education market needs more competition and that only happens if prices go DOWN, which only happens if LESS money is loaned to students from the government. This would cause tuition to go down because there would be less applicants who have a loan for tuition.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;d also add that it doesn&#x27;t help there are many, many, many generations of young people who think that they <i>need</i> to go to college to be &quot;successful&quot;. That couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth and it&#x27;s shameful that society continues to push this idea.')
