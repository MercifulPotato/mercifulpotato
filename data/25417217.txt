If you drive the autobahn you will curse that any of it is unrestricted. There is enough changing between limits and no limits to create additional cognitive load. It seems like more than 30% is restricted as time traveled on the unrestricted bits is less per km. I never received more speeding fines in my life than when I drove from Berlin to Austria and back.')
