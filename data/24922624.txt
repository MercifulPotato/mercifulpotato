That&#x27;s where they get you. I agree it&#x27;s very anti-consumer, but it&#x27;s going to get worse.<p>&gt; Imagine if you bought a car and then 5 years later company rep would come in and welded the wheels so that you wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade your tires.<p>Did I mention it will get worse? Maybe not with the silly welding tires example, but we&#x27;re basically there.
