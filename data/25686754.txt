They think that destroying all chats is a reasonable thing to do when things get hard - which is the exact opposite to many WhatsApp users, which deeply value images and texts sent to them on that platform.<p>As such, they&#x27;ve been very very resistant at making the backup process for Signal easy for people. This is also why deskop app regularly happily just trashes all its state and fails to resync. This is why they will never let you make the backup process easy and portable.<p>It&#x27;s not a technical issue - they just think you&#x27;re wrong when you want to keep your conversations.<p>Unfortunately that&#x27;s can also be a significantly bigger issue than privacy for a lot of people.')
