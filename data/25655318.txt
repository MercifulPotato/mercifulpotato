You might be adjusting the Redis concurrency instead. And if I remember correctly even with sidekiq you’re still using normal Rails and ActiveRecord, so a process that’s running 25 sidekiq jobs simultaneously is going to need 25 active record DB conns from the database.yml. I doubt the sidekiq config is overriding it in some way.<p>But basically if your sidekiq workers and app servers are using the same database.yml values, you’ll need to set the greater of the two on both. I assumed you have different settings on app servers and workers.')
