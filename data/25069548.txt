Of course they would also compete in terms of how nicely they presented this data and how easy it was to create a profile.<p>One approach for stopping spam would be to limit the number of messages that each profile (owner) can send per time period.  For example, the profile could contain a &quot;send-introductions-to&quot; field, specifying the node that stores their inbox, and a &quot;max-introductions-per-month&quot; field which tells a sending node how many other introductions a user can make while still being allowed to contact them.<p>As usual with federated systems, there is then the problem of nodes deciding which other nodes to federate with, but it should be fairly easy to test if a node is not enforcing spamminess limits.  The other problem is stopping people from generating profiles on multiple nodes, which might require either a centralised service or some sort of economic system like &quot;proof of burn&quot;[2], unless email providers were to all start issuing time-limited anonymous tokens.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geek_Code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geek_Code</a><p>[1] I&#x27;m imagining using the taxonomy of Wikidata, allowing statements like { &quot;has&quot;: &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q202466" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q202466</a>&quot; }<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;99bitcoins.com&#x2F;what-is-proof-of-burn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;99bitcoins.com&#x2F;what-is-proof-of-burn&#x2F;</a>')
