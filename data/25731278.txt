The technology makes previously impossible arrangements possible.<p>There will be repercussions, changes in work and family habits, but how far reaching they will be is unsettled.<p>This, as of now temporary arrangement, does give workers options.  There can be more even sharing of parental responsibilities, more options for work and more options for education for those who have kids.<p>For those with kids there is the possibility of more traditional oversight (fewer kids coming home to an empty dwelling) maybe greater parental oversight of curriculums.<p>So we’ll have to wait and see how it pans out.<p>I don’t think families will have four kids again, but some who struggled wit one may have two instead.')
