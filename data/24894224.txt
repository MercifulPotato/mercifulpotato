Just throw more stuff on the problem and hope it goes away. If some thought is put into it, it might actually work.<p>Garbage landfill? Cover it with some soil and build buildings on top!<p>Trash in the oceans? Gather it with (more) automated ships!<p>Water levels rising? Build dams!<p>Too much CO2 in the air? Use more energy to get rid of it!<p>Global temperatures getting too high? Build a solar shade for the whole planet (bonus points if it also generates electricity)!<p>Actually hoping that last two become a reality soon, because we all need it, and the ideas are actually feasible.')
