Pretty sure newspapers were re-publishing other media for quite some time now, centuries.<p>&gt; with a _massive_ increase in censorship and a _massive_ reduction in the ability for the average person to publish opinions<p>I don’t think they can do that. People will just leave. I don’t read twitter, but I do use facebook. I don’t subscribe for influencers or other media. I personally know vast majority of people I read there.<p>&gt; how making Twitter the publisher is any different is how would having the ability to sue Twitter for libel be any different than suing CNN or Fox right now?<p>Increases costs to run Twitter by orders of magnitudes. I think the only way forward for them is charging users. When users will become paying customers as opposed to product, this change incentives of twitter.<p>Currently, a public outrage like this or any other might be a PR and political nightmare, but financially it’s a gold mine for social media platforms. In the current model, their profit scales with page views. If the profit will only scale with count of users, I believe they gonna do many things completely differently. For instance, will be no point in tuning their algorithms to promote controversial content, quite the opposite, it would then increase their servers load for no good reason.')
