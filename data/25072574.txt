All of the issues in that post appear to arise from the fact that they expect the locator to need configuration before it will work, while my reading of GP is that their configuration is which type the method returns, no registering a class or allocator necessary. Yes, this restricts you to a series of services known at build time, but... it seems to me that you knew what your services were anyway, whether it was directly in the locator, in an xml file, or in a registration call.')
