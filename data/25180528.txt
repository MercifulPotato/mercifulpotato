Item(by='john_moscow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606075182, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179150, text='&gt;while the silent (conservatives) are silent because they don&#x27;t seem to care as much.<p>Most of the conservatives I know are silent because they are busy. Busy raising and teaching their kids. Busy taking care of their property. Busy making their own life better. It doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t care. They just believe that each person should be first and foremost responsible for their own well-being. If someone asks for help with a specific quantifiable problem, they will gladly help.<p>Most vocal liberals, on the contrary, are priced out of having a large enough property to take care of, or a large family that takes a lot of energy. Because they have extra time and energy, they tend to spend it on the causes that the media presents to them as important. Note that their salary expectations will be lower, compared to conservatives, since family, property and retirement plans are one&#x27;s biggest expenses. I would dare say many of them feel jealous towards the conservatives and believe they got an unfair advantage.<p>In short-term, it&#x27;s beneficial for companies to support political activism, because it keeps the employees busy with projects that don&#x27;t increase their monetary demands. In long term, this ends up with tribalism, where people spend most of their energy attacking their peers over growing number of differences.')
