No one person&#x27;s actions on the margin are really making much difference to society-wide spread and assuming you don&#x27;t want to completely isolate yourself indefinitely, then your personal risk of contracting COVID is very sensitive to the level of infection in the society around you. In theory, we could achieve a higher average standard of living all around if we could coordinate everyone reducing their risky behavior by 30% (a number I just made up).<p>This is the point that I think often gets missed in the discussion around &quot;lockdowns&quot;. I would bet that we could actually reduce the spread of COVID quite substantially without a massive change in the living standards of most people. The problem is that there is a segment of people who refuse to do anything at all to reduce the risk of transmission so we end up having to take more extreme actions to compensate.')
