That is the great problem of our day. All these political ideologues espouse beliefs contrary to the good of large numbers of people in our society. They give speeches about how it&#x27;s not &quot;us&quot; but the other side who are the bad guys, but then they all send their pet terrorists out to riot, loot, and in the case of the capitol attackers gather intel to hand over to our nation&#x27;s adversaries.<p>These political extremists are simply bad people all the way around. No matter what way you look at it.')
