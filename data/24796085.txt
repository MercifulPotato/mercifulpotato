The more I see around me and our nation at large, the more I am forming the opinion that greed is THE defining attribute of our time. The way the economy and society is structured, there is absolutely no breathing room left for anyone to perform any activity except to exist in the service of a paycheck. Why? because of greed. Because of greed and the blindness it brings with it, any attempts to build even a slightly more benign economic arrangement gets immediately labeled as &quot;socialist&quot; or some such. Not to mention the absolute beating our natural environment and habitat is taking in the process of servicing this greed to accumulate as much as you possibly can.')
