The main divergence between the two is the price point and how the communities are run. As for fragmentation, well, if you want a choice in distro, then fragmentation does kind of happen as a result of that.<p>But overall a lot of the momentum is in the same direction. The biggest sticking point I see happened years ago, when Purism opted to make Phosh + PureOS and make it GNOME based instead of rallying more effort to the UBPorts project. That said, it&#x27;s free software, so this happens all the time.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, I really love what Ubuntu Touch has become, and the UBPorts community too!)')
