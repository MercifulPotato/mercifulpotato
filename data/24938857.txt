That&#x27;s quite obvious from the context.<p>Nobody ever brought up legal <i>ownership of content</i> at all -- that&#x27;s 100% your misinterpretation.<p>It&#x27;s kind of amazing how you misunderstand comments and then go on to insult <i>others</i> for supposedly misunderstanding comments... and then proceed to then do it all over a second time! Amusingly ironic. Better luck in the future, my friend... ;)')
