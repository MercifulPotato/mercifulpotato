We have a collective government that has more money than any other country EVER.  Yet they can&#x27;t balance a budget and are massively in debt.  If you have people who are very bad at spending money giving them more money isn&#x27;t going to solve any of their problems.<p>We have corrupt officials who are well entrenched in their positions who profit off of it by selling out their constituents to their donors.<p>More government isn&#x27;t the answer.
