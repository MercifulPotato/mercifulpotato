I first heard the term from other people my age when I was in grade school, and I&#x27;ve heard it constantly since then. I&#x27;m surprised the term hasn&#x27;t been cancelled yet, given everything else that&#x27;s going on. I guess it&#x27;s technically not racist when used by people of the same race&#x2F;nationality? But it&#x27;s still gross.<p>I always found it really weird because it&#x27;s supposed to denote inferiority due to being an immigrant, but then it&#x27;s being used by people whose own parents are immigrants with the very accents they&#x27;re demeaning. But no one will call you a fob if you were born in China, immigrated to the west when you were 10, and don&#x27;t have an accent. &quot;Dressing fobby&quot; is no longer really a thing as you see plenty of ABAs crossing over fashion-wise, but it used to be something that would get called out.<p>But if you were born here, left early on in your childhood, and came back with an accent, you&#x27;ll get labeled, just because of the way you talk.')
