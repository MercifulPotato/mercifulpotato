Item(by='matz1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605328212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086674, text='&gt;The USA has the highest number of deaths from Covid of any country on Earth, by far<p>The number include people who die with covid not just due to covid. So its inflated.<p>&gt; How you can look at those numbers and think &quot;yeah, but wearing a mask is, like, annoying&quot; is beyond reason.<p>Not just mask but also the business capacity restriction, business not allowed to open, kids not going to school in person, unemployment, bankruptcy, delayed treatment for other diseases, some suicides, some  domestic violence, some horrible mental health impacts, some livelihoods destroyed, some people dying alone, some relationships ending, some relationships never starting, etc<p>All those for the risk of covid ? Yeah very very not worth it.<p>&gt;there are many restrictions that we accept to make driving safer<p>Right, but even then still many people die, and that number can be reduced by banning car altogether but the damage is not worth it.<p>Similarly for covid, there are huge downside due to lockdown. The risk due to lockdown compared to the risk of covid ? very very not worth it.<p>Both option is sucks but the point it to choose the less sucks among it.<p>If for you, you think the risk is worth it and you want to isolate yourself then its fine I won&#x27;t force you but the issue is if you trying to force other people to isolate too.<p>If I can choose I would gladly choose to live in the country like Sweeden, where life pretty much normal and hardly any masks or any other country without any restriction right now.')
