Even Doom 3 was (IMHO) a cutscene horror. For me the only game in the spirit of Doom (with enemies attacking en masse, with meaningful weapons, without pretending there is some interesting story) was Painkiller. Otherwise, games got slower, even ones I otherwise enjoyed immensely (e.g. Half-Life).<p>Doom 2016 &amp; Eternal are back to the game - with fast-paced mechanics, and (though, I cannot bear Doom Eternal demon pi√±ata glitter, vide <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@pmigdal&#x2F;doom-2016-vs-doom-eternal-ui-side-by-side-8058e996baae" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@pmigdal&#x2F;doom-2016-vs-doom-eternal-ui-sid...</a>).\nDusk has a nice, gloomy mood, fast (and respecting players - in terms of challenge and difficulty). Ultrakill has g(l)ory kill mechanics, IMHO better than from Doom Eternal (even if not as visually appealing).<p>&gt; Second, one forgets very easily how games could have poor mechanics.<p>Mechanics is hard. Kudos to Szymanski for polishing the mechanics, not the story or graphics glitter.<p>&gt; [T]here was one Carmack only. Today there are plenty.<p>Well, Carmack is unique. His focus and attention to detail are second to none. Plus, there was another John - Romero. In Doom, he was designing and obsessively tweaking all parameters.\n(To the extend, I compare these Johns to John Bell, and Albert Einstein.
