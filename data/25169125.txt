I think a good middle ground is having offices in neighbourhoods, within walking&#x2F;cycling distance where people from different companies come to work. They get the benefit of social interaction, &quot;getting out of the house&quot;, and avoid a car journey.<p>Living in the UK, I think that would also help restore the feeling of community, as a gathering point for people within a local area.<p>Personally I prefer working from home and have done so for 20 years, almost all my working life- but I understand why people have reasons for preferring an alternative.')
