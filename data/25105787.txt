Of course, this shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising.<p>But the interesting part is if one happens to wade into such a conversation, drawing people&#x27;s attention to the manifestation of these abstract behaviors <i>within the current thread</i>.  At this point, one would logically expect a reaction something like surprise and then realization (due to HN being largely composed of highly logical people with above average levels of integrity and honesty).  <i>However</i>, this is not what actually occurs, the majority of the time (in my experience as an ideological outlier).  What actually occurs usually more so resembles what one would see on &quot;less high quality forums&quot; than here (rhetoric, &quot;mental gymnastics&quot;, insults, logical fallacies, etc etc etc).  Of course, this is just human nature in action, but still - it&#x27;s weird, I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t do better (than other communities), and I <i>really</i> can&#x27;t wrap my head around why we <i>wouldn&#x27;t want to</i> do better than other communities.  And yet, here we are (not you...I am speaking <i>in general</i>).<p>&gt; To elaborate on why I am not willing to empathize further than I have, I have no wish to empathize with bigotry.<p>&gt; But I have zero tolerance for intolerance, and will call it as I see it.<p>I completely agree with the sentiments of what you&#x27;ve written here.  However, I wonder if you are as good at exercising these beliefs as you perceive (I&#x27;m making no accusation, I am merely discussing the idea - I too deserve the very same cross examination, and encourage anyone to do so).<p>Let&#x27;s start with defining some terms:<p>bigotry - stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one&#x27;s own<p>truth - the true or actual state of a matter; conformity with fact or reality<p>epistemology - the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope. Epistemology is the investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion<p>perception - the act or faculty of perceiving, or apprehending <i>by means of the senses or of the mind</i>; cognition; understanding.<p>prejudice - preconceived judgment or opinion; an adverse opinion or leaning <i>formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge</i><p>So, a non-controversial example of bigotry would be <i>racism</i>, which typically involves some variation of racist individuals forming negative <i>conclusions</i> of POC (individually, or as a group) based on preconceived ideas, without just grounds or before <i>sufficient knowledge</i>.  Racism is a pretty easy one to spot, everyone here has consumed plentiful educational material, and most likely engaged in several conversations on the matter.<p>Now let&#x27;s examine another group that is often subject to bigotry, even here on HN:  <i>conspiracy theorists</i>.<p>1. Do you happen to have a personal opinion on conspiracy theorists?<p>2. Do you have an opinion on the nature of typical discussions here on HN related to conspiracy theorists?<p>And before you answer, please note:<p>a) I went to the trouble of stating definitions for <i>several terms</i> above, but really only made use of [prejudice] thus far.<p>b) It has been my experience that such questions are typically responded to with rhetoric, evasiveness, character attacks (insinuations of bad faith, gish-galloping, etc).  I would prefer that this conversation does not fall victim to that pattern, but rather, follows a more honest, <i>curious</i>, and productive path (which I believe is one of the more important things that is missing in the world).')
