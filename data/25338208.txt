I would expect this is a much higher rate than non remote workers who are commuting past that mom and pop store every day, where it would be convenient to stop in and grab something on their way to work or home. Remote workers in a rural town have little reason to leave their house and go to town, which in a rural town might itself be a 10-15 min one way drive on unlit (and frequently unplowed in winter) roads that typically lack a sidewalk.')
