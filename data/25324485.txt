So in the event of a bad fire you just evacuate. Probably the fire can be extinguished, but maybe it can&#x27;t, either way you aren&#x27;t inside, your insurer is on the hook for any increase in costs from products that did not perform. Maybe &quot;the invisible hand&quot; will fix that, maybe it won&#x27;t, but nobody dies.<p>In a high rise residential building it&#x27;s a nightmare to evacuate, so until that becomes necessary (as it did at Grenfell and one of the other phases looked at whether emergency services were wrong to delay so long and why that happened) the preference is to compartmentalize as you would on a ship (can&#x27;t evacuate those either). As a result of this approach to fire fighting it&#x27;s <i>critical</i> that fire cannot spread between compartments. Flat #1 is on fire, a team comes out, they fight the fire, maybe Flat #1 is completely ruined, but the people in Flat #2 are just annoyed by the smell of smoke and the debris, they aren&#x27;t actually in danger. At Grenfell this cladding meant the fire was able to spread outside the building defeating compartmentalization, in hindsight once that happened it would be impossible to contain it.<p>So the height of the building isn&#x27;t just why this is news, it&#x27;s also why it was a problem.')
