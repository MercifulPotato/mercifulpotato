You&#x27;ve posted a whole bunch of posts which are both legally wrong, and show either fundamental, basic reading comprehension issues with your sources similar to the one in this thread, or you&#x27;re intentionally spreading misinformation. I&#x27;m not sure which. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s dangerous. You made false claims about the DMCA, github&#x27;s ToS, and in other threads, about the EFF.<p>I&#x27;ll post cites to sources, and then I&#x27;m done here.')
