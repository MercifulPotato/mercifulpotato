Arguably, it&#x27;s much more straightforward to categorize the characters as:<p>1. Pictograms: 人 &#x27;person&#x27;, 木 &#x27;tree&#x27;, 日 &#x27;sun, day&#x27;, 月 &#x27;moon, month&#x27;<p>2. (Simple) Ideograms: 上 &#x27;up&#x27;, 三 &#x27;three&#x27;<p>3. Compound Ideograms, or Meaning-Meaning Compounds: 休 &#x27;rest&#x27; (人 &#x27;person&#x27; next to a 木 &#x27;tree&#x27;), 明 &#x27;bright&#x27; (日 &#x27;sun&#x27; and 月 &#x27;moon&#x27;) - note that the pronunciation of the compound character is unrelated to either component<p>4. Phonetic-Meaning Compounds: 晴 &#x2F;qíng&#x2F; &#x27;clear (weather)&#x27; (日 &#x27;sun&#x27; as a meaning cue, and 青 &#x2F;qīng&#x2F; as a pronunciation cue) - the vast majority of Chinese characters belong in this last category<p>More categories can be (and historically were) distinguished, such as when an additional component was added to a character to clarify its meaning, even though the original character already had that meaning, but that primary meaning became overshadowed by a secondary meaning it acquired later; however such distinctions are mostly useful for understanding the evolution of Chinese characters rather than the way they currently are.<p>Of course the above classification, even with only the basic four categories, is still largely subjective, for example 娶 &#x2F;qǔ&#x2F; &#x27;to marry (a woman)&#x27; can be thought of either as a meaning-meaning compound (取 &#x27;to take&#x27; a 女 &#x27;woman&#x27;), or as a phonetic-meaning compound with the phonetic component 取 &#x27;to take&#x27; pronounced &#x2F;qǔ&#x2F; as well.<p>It also has to be said the pronunciation cue is often not very helpful anymore, as the sounds in Mandarin Chinese have shifted, and guessing the pronunciation from similar characters can end up being hilariously wrong. Besides, sometimes it is not even clear which component of a character is supposed to be the phonetic cue. Now I don&#x27;t know about Japanese but I imagine these pronunciation cues must be even less helpful than in Chinese.')
