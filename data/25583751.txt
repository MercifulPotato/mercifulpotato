Doesn&#x27;t give examples or much of a &quot;when to use this&quot; usually, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s better than nothing.<p>For me personally, even though I dislike these auto-generated docs since they&#x27;re quite terse (and tend to display niche parts of the API just as prominently as the parts you likely want to use), I tend to find them much more reliable than more detailed guides precisely because they tend not to desync, so I often don&#x27;t even bother with well-written guides anymore, since they are much more likely to waste my time (or at least be inaccurate).<p>I&#x27;d expect many other developers have the same level of trust issues I do, to the point that those shitty auto-generated docs are in some ways better than really nice, detailed docs, because they are easier to trust. I&#x27;m unlikely to break the habit of ignoring detailed docs&#x2F;guides unless it&#x27;s coming from some big project where they&#x27;re uniformly good. Otherwise, reading them tends to be a waste of time IMO.')
