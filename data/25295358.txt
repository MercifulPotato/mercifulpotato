Of course the index.html is still referencing the index.js file - what do I need to do?<p>Edit: It does work for e.g. pages&#x2F;about&#x2F;index.js to rename to index.tsx - so maybe it&#x27;s just the main index that won&#x27;t work as Typescript?<p>Also it looks like there is no default definition provided for imported CSS modules - the import resolves to a string so &quot;styles.about&quot; doesn&#x27;t compile')
