If you have 4 people in the house and they might want to each stream different 4K UHD movies at the same time, for example, you&#x27;d need 100 Mbit&#x2F;s.<p>For video conferencing you should have about 3 Mbit&#x2F;s upload for a group conference. That&#x27;s where you will probably hit lower speed plan limits if you have multiple separate people doing group conferences, or one person doing a group video conference while 2 or 3 others are doing big downloads or streaming 4K video.<p>A lot of residential internet services seem to set upload speed to not much more than is necessary for the ACKs needed when someone is downloading at the maximum download speed, and so someone doing an upload focused activity can have a big impact on other users in the household.')
