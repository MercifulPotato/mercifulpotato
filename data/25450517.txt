It&#x27;s a common refrain that comes up again and again.<p>We build a SaaS web app with a MERN stack deployed to AWS. Local development usually involves running about 12 containers.<p>Personally, I got fed up and installed Ubuntu 20.04 in Parallels and have been running the Docker containers there for several months. What a night and day difference... the entire VM sits at about 13% CPU when idling, whereas Docker for Mac would whine my fans at around 150% CPU continuously when idling, and spike up to 300+% when clicking around the app.')
