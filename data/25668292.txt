There hundreds (and many more upvoting) of people concurrently promoted the event and outwardly said that the states, congress, and courts failed them, so they were going to pick up arms and forcefully take power.<p>Surely, the federal government with its vast resources should have had a guy checking such a prominent website, right? I&#x27;m sure there were have darker parts of the &#x27;Trump media&#x27;-verse with even more explicit calls to arms, if such a thing were possible.')
