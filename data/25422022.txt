When I was a SWE I compensated by not showing up to work until lunchtime.  I get up early.<p>Accepting this was liberating.<p>(I attend work for 51.5 hours a week as a high school CS teacher.  I do a fair amount of coding.  Some of it, to their delight, live!  More than a first tier manager at a tech company can jam in, although my responsibilities are similar.)')
