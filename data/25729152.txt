Item(by='t0mas88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610375080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726779, text='It shows up in other places as well, The Netherlands has a lot of traffic islands at crossings, they often have a metal &quot;fence&quot; on it around schools to force kids on bikes to zig-zag (slowing them down instead of crossing at speed). It&#x27;s very manufacturer dependent how these are handled. The systems I have experience with are Volvo, Tesla and BMW and they handle things quite differently.<p>My girlfriend&#x27;s Volvo was very trigger happy on the emergency brake feature, it would hit the brakes for traffic islands all the time because it didn&#x27;t know you were going to steer around it. It nearly caused us to be rear-ended at 50 km&#x2F;h a couple of times.<p>My BMW and previous Tesla on the other hand almost completely ignore stationary road-side kind of objects. Both have never braked for a traffic island in the few years that I drove them.<p>The downside is I guess that there are known cases of Tesla Autopilot driving into things (the famous lane-divider incident comes to mind). BMW doesn&#x27;t sell their system as autopilot, but their manual also has a big warning to be aware of things blocking the road and not to rely on the car to stop for those. So I expect their system, faced with that same lane-divider would probably also crash into it.')
