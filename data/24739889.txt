The clause where the employer has to pay the govt the remaining salary if the employee leaves early sounds like it&#x27;s designed to encourage employers to pay more to discourage that, but I&#x27;m not sure what incentive other employers would have to pay more than the H1-B market rate to hire H1-B visa holders who are already here when they could pay the market rate to hire a new visa holder.')
