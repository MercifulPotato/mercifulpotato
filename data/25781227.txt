The elite athletes and professional researchers - sure that happens.<p>I guess I&#x27;m trying to say - if it&#x27;s not your career - if you spent 7+ hours per week training for your physical body, practicing your sport or doing research nobody would say anything about it.<p>So and so is fit and exercises a lot. They look good, that&#x27;s their jam. So and so is researching a lot or working on a really hard problem. Nice. Good for them.<p>You work harder than the average on your brain and&#x2F;or business - &quot;you work too much&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure why people can&#x27;t differentiate that for many:<p>1) going above and beyond is necessary to level up (especially to make your business a success)<p>2) people can find that process enjoyable and rewarding (especially if they do it with people they like)<p>I think the self-employed specifically get a bad rap about &quot;working too much&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there are some fortunate souls, but I don&#x27;t know any business owners that clocked in and clocked out average work weeks to success.<p>Although I agree that there&#x27;s a workaholic problem for many as they scale the ladder or consume themselves with work to avoid some other issue in their life.<p>I just don&#x27;t like the notion that if you work more than the average Joe you don&#x27;t have a work&#x2F;life balance or it will cause all these issues.<p>Just pulled this up and its worse than I would have guessed - &quot;Only 15% of workers are engaged at their job&quot;. This is globally. In the US it&#x27;s 30% engaged [1]<p>That&#x27;s pretty telling to me then. If you aren&#x27;t engaged at your job - you will think 7 more hours a week is a bad idea and a workaholic. And probably make yourself feel better about using those 7 hours for your hobby or whatever is not your &quot;engaged job&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;chairman&#x2F;212045&#x2F;world-broken-workplace.aspx?g_source=position1&amp;g_medium=related&amp;g_campaign=tiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;chairman&#x2F;212045&#x2F;world-broken...</a>')
