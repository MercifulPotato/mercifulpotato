Item(by='oefrha', descendants=None, kids=[25047403], score=None, time=1605021232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045422, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secureappy.com&#x2F;security" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.secureappy.com&#x2F;security</a>:<p>&gt; Any data you save in the app is protected by military grade encryption (AES256 + PBKDF2). SecureAppy uses your passcode that only you know to encrypt and secure your data. This way, no one, not even SecureAppy can unlock or see your data.<p>Sorry, but 4-digit (seems to be the default) &#x2F; 6-digit passcodes are trivially brute forced (for any usable PBKDF2 iterations), so that statement does not inspire a lot of confidence.<p>Also, I would recommend an actual security white paper detailing the design. Saying “we use AES256+PBKDF2 and end-to-end encryption” probably isn’t enough.<p>Another thing: passwords being default visible at rest (when you click to open an entry) may not be the best idea.')
