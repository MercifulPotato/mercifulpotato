Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603382453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858936, text='I&#x27;ve never watched babylon 5, so I can&#x27;t comment too much on it.<p>a common trope in sci-fi is that jumpgates (or something similar) were built by some ancient super-advanced civilization, while the current civilization understands them to the minimum extent necessary to actually use them. this is a good way to sidestep the issue, since any inconsistencies can plausibly be the result of missing knowledge in-universe.<p>as to &quot;whether it&#x27;s still sci-fi&quot;, imo it depends a bit more on the setting. if FTL has already existed for 100+ years, it makes sense for it to be a background detail. on the other hand, if you have a story where FTL was discovered recently and it doesn&#x27;t profoundly impact the plot, I would consider that to be pretty bad sci-fi.<p>like I said, this is just how I personally categorize things. to me, sci-fi is not just lasers in space. it&#x27;s a genre where science&#x2F;technology drives the plot, rather than being made up after the fact to justify the plot you want to have. it can still be sci-fi if the tech is totally implausible from a modern physics perspective; it just needs to be consistent.<p>star wars is usually my go-to example of &quot;not sci-fi&quot;. there are no consistent rules for how anything works in-universe. all the technology works in whatever way is necessary to justify the current scene and will likely contradict itself later for a different scene. it&#x27;s still a very enjoyable franchise, just not what I would consider sci-fi. a show like the expanse is almost the opposite. there&#x27;s some unrealistic stuff in there, but it&#x27;s internally consistent. once you nail down what&#x27;s possible given &quot;the rules&quot; in-universe, the plot almost writes itself.')
