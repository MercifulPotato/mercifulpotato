It&#x27;s such a weird experience - simultaneously sterile and massively overhyped in almost every possible way.<p>I&#x27;d started enjoying theatre more because that has a real magic - possibly because clever physical stage effects and real people acting in front of you engage the imagination in a way a projection can&#x27;t.<p>But that&#x27;s not any more likely to survive this than cinemas are. Although low budget theatre productions are more likely to restart more quickly because they only really need a large empty room, some lighting, and some props.')
