This is why people refuse to accept that prayer doesn&#x27;t work. This is why in the 50s governments were corrupt, incompetent, wasteful, racist (plus all the other prejudices imaginable) and yet people had huge faith in them.<p>When you live in a rural village and can&#x27;t really communicate or interact beyond the village, you NEED to believe there is a government out there keeping things working, keeping the enemy away and running stuff. So you do.<p>When you get a mobile phone and need to complain about something and talk about how you&#x27;re a self made person and how those bozos in &lt;capital city&gt; are IDIOTS, and it seems like you can access more resources by complaining louder, guess what you believe then?<p>That&#x27;s a big part of the rise of neoliberalism: the modern economy requires us all to be self starters and entrepreneurial (or at least to switch jobs regularly and make out own way in the world). To do that, it really helps to think of government and other people as morons and obstacles and yourself the a randian hero of you&#x27;re own story. So we believe that. Because belief isn&#x27;t based on evidence, its based on utility.')
