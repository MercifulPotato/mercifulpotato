Item(by='arcturus17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608752286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518603, text='a) Haven&#x27;t done much A&#x2F;B testing in a while, but Optimizely has what seems like a huge library for React, which suggests this is false.<p>c) I can attest that this is complete bollocks, I have React apps in production that are blazing fast, and I have seen many others in the wild. I&#x27;ve also built a few prototypes in Next.js and got near-perfect speed scores without optimizing anything. I can only imagine it&#x27;s gotten better in the last year or so.<p>d) I guess depends on definitions of &quot;decent&quot; analytics, but I&#x27;ve seen a few analytics solutions working with React in production and they worked more than decently.<p>As a closing thought, Facebook uses React all over the place. They are massive on personalization, analytics and A&#x2F;B testing, for better and for worse, at hyperscale. I guess you think it&#x27;s just the exception that confirms the rule?')
