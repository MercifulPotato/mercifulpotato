You can get up and running very quickly by just giving someone a URL (probably with a pre-unpacked image). Setting up a VM on the other hand, can be daunting if you don&#x27;t already have the infrastructure setup. This might be a benefit of running this WASM VM vs a local VM.<p>Second, you get the security benefit of running the code on your local computer as opposed to a remote VM. This may not be a big issue, but for some circumstances, it could be.<p>Third, by running it locally as opposed to on a remote VM, might be more interactive, in that you don&#x27;t have the round-trip time client -&gt; server -&gt; client. But this depends on how performant the WASM VM is.<p>This isn&#x27;t something you do for performance. The WASM VM seems &quot;fast enough&quot;, but this isn&#x27;t something that will be faster than many cloud-based VMs. For me, the major benefits would be setup&#x2F;maintenance and security.<p>Personally find this to be a pretty cool project, but I&#x27;m not sure of where I&#x27;d use it outside of teaching... but it&#x27;s quite impressive.<p>For the scrolling -- I found that once I scrolled to the bottom once, it auto-scrolled.
