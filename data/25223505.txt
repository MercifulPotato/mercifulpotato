Ragya.com just quietly sits there waiting for the user to click play. I mention that as a positive because other sites are way worse: I&#x27;m occasionally annoyed by a video streaming site where I have deliberately enabled auto-play, but when establishing the connection takes a second longer than expected, it throws up a pop-up wrongly informing me that I have auto-play off — and the pop-up needs to be manually dismissed even when the video is already playing behind it.<p>Honorary mention: Twitter. Every video is muted by default; you have to enable audio every single time. This option always exists, even when the video has no sound at all. Because life&#x27;s like a box of chocolates.<p>Sorry about the off-topic rant; the point is that the issue is more nuanced than ‘noise bad‘ and you&#x27;ll get a better experience when the site and your user agent are cooperating nicely.')
