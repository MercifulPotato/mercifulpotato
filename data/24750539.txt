I plan things in my head. I could be swimming for an hour in the lake and thinking about how to solve this or that situation. Overall thinking takes more of my time then the actual coding which I normally do very fast.<p>Distracting one&#x27;s mind from the immediate task can also be beneficial for the end result.<p>All this does not make me inferior. Rather the other way around. Luckily I&#x27;ve been my own boss for the last 20 years so I do not have to explain how I do things. I am only responsible for end results &#x2F;time frame and overall cost.<p>Granted there are situations when loads of code needs to be written that does not require much thinking. For this I usually hire subcontractors. Sometimes do it myself but it does not come very often.')
