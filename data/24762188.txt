I live in downtown Seattle where a cellular tower is visible from my house and the measured RF around me is quite noisy.<p>From my research it is definitely not trivial to pull off. There are RF shielding canopies you can put over your bed but they are 1k USD+ and quite unsightly. Then there is the possibility to paint the interior walls with RF shielding paint but you have to ground it correctly or you could be introducing more problems for yourself than you&#x27;re solving. With either solution, I live on the 3rd floor and it&#x27;s unclear if I would also have to ground the floor underneath me, or essentially &quot;trap&quot; RF emitting upwards into my cage which again would create more problems than they solve. After contemplating all of these possibilities and pitfalls, I decided to put it off for later until more tried techniques have been advertised.')
