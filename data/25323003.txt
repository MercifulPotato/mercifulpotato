Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607256693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322691, text='The book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; by Peter Wright documents fairly intensely the battle to both analyse and counteract the thing, and generally combat Soviet signals intelligence.<p>The latter parts of the book are very interesting too, e.g. Wright questioned Anthony Blunt intensely.  An insight into the game of psychological cat and mouse played between an aristocratic traitor and \na working class intelligence officer cleaning up the mess.<p>The veracity of his allegations about Roger Hollis is uncertain to this day, however the official line taken by MI5-approved sources is fundamentally flawed. I&#x27;m about 70% convinced, personally.')
