Hell, in Lisp I can do (let ((length (length <i>seq-1</i>))) ... (length <i>seq-2</i>) ... ) just fine and it still works as expected, so no special characters necessary either.<p>Plus, to have different scoping rules was considered a good idea? Weird scoping issues were why I gave up on Ruby fifteen years ago; perhaps it was a good idea that I got never <i>that</i> far with PHP. But I&#x27;m intrigued now; what exactly are the scoping differences in question?')
