All of the guests on the show were in favor of affirmative action (so much for all things considered), and when the &#x27;mismatch hypothesis&#x27; (which postulates that affirmative action may actually harm some of its intended beneficiaries by putting them in institutions where they are less prepared for the academic rigor than their peers) came up, the idea was dismissed out of hand as being outdated and debunked. This plainly misrepresents the state of the research, which has pretty conclusively shown that the mismatch effect appears in elite law schools and in STEM graduate rates.<p>When I heard this dismissal and noticed that no one pushed back, it made me realize that the guests and host were all ideologically aligned. I still listen to NPR, but I now know that they are much more biased than I previously thought.<p>To downvoters: do you doubt that this happened or think it isnâ€™t an apt example of NPR being aligned with Democratic Party positions?')
