The safest use for cocaine is to make sure the person is healthy enough for it (avoid heart attacks) and to do some work to limit quantities&#x2F;strengths to limit overdoses and hopefully addiction - and possibly, some education to recognize signs of addiction, though this could be told by the doctor or nurse giving a physical. You can buy it from a place trained to sell it, and have limits on how often and how much you can buy (Like sudafed was&#x2F;is in some states).<p>Part of the reason you make it more accessible is knowing how people use it, and to try to get people to do the less harmful thing in a class of things. So, you know, try to steer people to cocaine and way from meth while recognizing that cocaine isn&#x27;t alcohol or weed or caffeine.<p>On the other hand, you probably want anything involving needles to be administered by a nurse. Opiate pills after surgery? Prescription so you&#x27;ll have enough.')
