Just saying that if the sample rate is only supposed to be good enough for auto-focusing a camera every second within a 10-20 degree FOV on-center, then there&#x27;s still a deal of improvement needed before they can be used for self-driving cars. I think the tech will get there eventually, but this is an area where the sensor specs become really important.')
