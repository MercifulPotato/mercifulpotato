That&#x27;s because it is not based on any such analysis, it&#x27;s based on people myopically looking at RCT for answers and ignoring all other forms of reasoning.<p>To those that suggest we don&#x27;t have data on the regime are wildly incorrect. (1) we have data from the 2 dose trials in Pfizer and Moderna (2) we have data from Astrazeneca showing improved efficacy with a delay (3) we have priors based on other vaccines, where a delayed second dose almost always confers more immunity. (4) our models of the human immune response suggest delayed vaccination helps more.<p>So there is every reason to believe, and all data suggests, that delaying the second dose is better. We also have the ability to change our mind if it looks like it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>If the proposed standard for any medical treatment was to ban any use that has not had a randomized control trial, then we should issue fines for people who don&#x27;t complete antibiotic regimes, people who don&#x27;t show up to their follow up appointments, and disallow off label use.')
