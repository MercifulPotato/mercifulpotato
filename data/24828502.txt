Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24830248], score=None, time=1603127748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24828295, text='&gt; Stone + Parker may be assholes, but they are insightful assholes<p>&quot;Insightful&quot; about how people respond to messages in the same sense that a successful demagogue is, except that they are playing on &quot;easy mode&quot; where they don&#x27;t have to produce results of their own to be judged by -- or even, in classic demagogic fashion, to distract from by attacking some other target -- sure, they are definitely that kind of insightful.<p>Insightful beyond that...well, none of the evidence you point to is explained any better by adding that additional assumption.<p>They don&#x27;t hold peoples noses to the shit left behind, they are just masters of the clever juxtaposition of the cheap, easy, shallow (mostly recycled, but for the juxtapositions) attacks.<p>They are also good at crafting amusing stories, and welding the shallow attacks into the stories as a delivery vehicle. So I&#x27;m not saying that they aren&#x27;t <i>talented</i>, just that the talent has nothing to do with any substantive insight regarding the substance of their targets. Actually, I think they&#x27;d be a lot less successful at what they do if they didn&#x27;t have an absolute and total lack of interest in substance, which would be a distraction from the cheap, easy bomb-throwing.<p>EDIT: Rereading that, it sounds more hostile than I would like. I mean, <i>South Park</i> is great entertainment, there&#x27;s certainly value to periodic, momentary escape into the kind of cheerful,shallow nihilism it wallows in. My wife and I had Stan and Wendy figurines on our wedding cake. I&#x27;m not anti-Stone&#x2F;Parker, just against the idea that their work is insightful social commentary. Not only is it not, and not only is that central to its success, but, to the extent it is (personally, to me, and arguably socially) valuable, that&#x27;s also central to its value. Its not intellectually stimulating, enlightening, or insightful, its an escape from being intellectually &quot;on&quot; at all.')
