Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25897053], score=None, time=1611522258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25892758, text='&gt; do you want to make money from your product (rent) or from services around it. Rent is exactly how proprietary products make money.<p>I didn&#x27;t get this at all.<p>If I have a free software product (GPLv3), and I require that you pay me $100 for me to send you a copy, how is that characterized as &quot;rent&quot;?<p>I looked at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rent</a> for guidance:<p>1) &quot;Renting, an agreement where a payment is made for the temporary use of a good, service or property&quot;<p>Since you have a copy under the GPLv3, which is effectively permanent, that&#x27;s not really applicable.<p>(Also, proprietary software licenses can also be under a permanent license, so don&#x27;t count as &#x27;rent&#x27; under this definition.)<p>2) &quot;Economic rent, any payment in excess of the cost of production&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a complicated definition that I didn&#x27;t understand. I do see &#x27;the total income is made up of economic profit (earned) plus economic rent (unearned).&#x27; So why is my commercial transaction for you to acquire GPLv3-licensed software from me &#x27;unearned&#x27;?<p>That &quot;cost of production&quot; is not simply the labor+goods cost but includes opportunity cost. Which can be quite high when deciding to distribute free software instead of proprietary software. So I don&#x27;t see how choosing to &quot;sell free software&quot; (as RMS describes it) is reasonably described as &quot;rent&quot;.')
