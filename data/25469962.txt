You just approach them differently. Instead of doing a blocking call, you introduce a &quot;waiting for &lt;something&gt;&quot; state. You leave the &quot;blocking&quot; state when the correct event comes, or after a timeout. And while you are waiting for the event, you don&#x27;t just burn CPU cycles, but yield control quickly, so that other threads can execute in the meantime.')
