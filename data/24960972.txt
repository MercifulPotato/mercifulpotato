Amazing that they are fine with a government with zero transparency and zero accountability, despite their platform clamouring for exactly that. Regardless of the party in power, I would be equally as disgusted. I wonder if people will wake up when they see the bleak financial situation that comes to light post-COVID.<p>It is, but then also it isn&#x27;t really all that amazing if you sit down an examine the entire system.  People being &quot;fine with a government with zero transparency and zero accountability&quot; isn&#x27;t surprising, because these problem derive from the structure of the system itself, not any one individual politician operating in it.  One could Google up plentiful examples from history of all politicians leveraging the opaqueness of the particular political system they operate in (all systems on Earth are flawed in this manner, to varying degrees) - but at the individual level (politicians and voters), they all realize that &quot;these things are inevitable&quot;, and that even though technical wrongdoing has occurred, from <i>the aggregate perspective</i>, the ends justifies the means (which is a perfectly reasonable position to hold in my opinion, if we assume that the individuals in question are not aware that their perception of reality does not match objective reality, which is ~always the case).<p>I believe that to fix the problem, these systems must be completely redesigned to accommodate the obvious shortcomings.  But then to do that, it would require buy-in from both politicians and the media, who both likely enjoy the amount of power in their possession and wouldn&#x27;t be too keen on giving it up, so I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath on anything improving, <i>ever</i>.')
