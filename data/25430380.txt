I took that moment to finally really learn Vim.<p>Kate is lightweight yet versatile; despite what the screenshots might suggest. This is due to the extremely well-done integration in KDE: for example, the file browser is (was?) really just the file browser konqueror from KDE, Kate has to do hardly anything for that, just &quot;wrap&quot; it. Same for syntax highlighting, terminal, snippets, keybindings, windows chrome, and so on. Kate is really mostly a neat wrapper around a lot of existing KDE parts and libs (and that is an achievement, I don&#x27;t mean that negatively).<p>With Vim, I often say &quot;Unix is my IDE&quot;, with Kate that could be translated to &quot;the Desktop Environment is your IDE&quot;.')
