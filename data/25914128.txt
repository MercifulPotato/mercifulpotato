It&#x27;s neither minimalistic, nor does it have many features and it most certainly isn&#x27;t easily to customize.<p>I&#x27;ve been an Opera user from version 12 (the last good opera) up to twenty-something, then switched to vivaldi a few years ago and never looked back.<p>Even just in the current development version, vivaldi is getting support for calendars, mail and rss right in the browser, adding to the already present notes feature. What does firefox do in terms of UX innovation? Ant they certainly don&#x27;t seem to be pumping that money into the under-the-hood components either, seeing how they still haven&#x27;t managed to get @property working.<p>Firefox is turning into the next internet explorer and it&#x27;s not even googles fault. It&#x27;s sad, but completely deserved.')
