I pushed hard to get the powers that be to focus more on performance and payload, but it was a Sisyphean task. It was perhaps the most demotivating job of my career because I disagreed with virtually every decision that was ever made with regards to that UI, from technology choices (the inane choice to use RxJS despite literally no valid use cases, the 5+ Redux stores in the same page, etc) to UI layout decisions (insane whitespace, the baffling choices about which things go in the right hand gutter...).<p>The components were mostly handed down to us from a company-wide UI team whose main design goals were to bring commonality across all Atlassian products. This is a worthwhile goal, no one thinks that it makes sense that Atlassian has different editors and even markup languages between (and even within) products. But the result was dog-slow overweight components like the Atlassian editor which tried to be everything to everyone. So when you need to bring in a monolithic highly-customisable 12mb+ component for every text edit field then things spiral out of control quickly. One cool thing, though, is that these components are open source[0]. And it looks like some performance&#x2F;payload work has been done since I left, thank god.<p>In my new job I use Jira Server which hasn&#x27;t been infected with the updated UI, and it&#x27;s a shame because other than that terrible UI there have been big meaningful updates in Jira. But I&#x27;m dreading our inevitable migration to Cloud.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;atlassian&#x2F;atlaskit&#x2F;src&#x2F;master&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;atlassian&#x2F;atlaskit&#x2F;src&#x2F;master&#x2F;</a>')
