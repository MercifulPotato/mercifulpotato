Let&#x27;s see what one would need to do at a bare minimum:<p>- start manufacturing phones<p>- build own OS (or fork Android)<p>- develop own SDK<p>- develop own online store infrastructure<p>- manufacture other devices (e.g. Apple) and&#x2F;or develop other services (e.g. Google) to complete &quot;ecosystem&quot;<p>The barrier to entry in developing a mobile (and beyond) ecosystem is astronomical when competing with either Apple or Google. It&#x27;s practically impossible to break into a multi-trillion dollar market when it&#x27;s siloed to two multi-trillion dollar corporations.')
