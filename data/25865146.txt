Item(by='mhh__', descendants=None, kids=[25867808], score=None, time=1611267148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865020, text='&gt; DCS FA18 cockpit<p>One thing that&#x27;s particularly impressive about the F&#x2F;A-18 is that the Spec available in DCS (give or take a few features) is almost the same as the first batch from the 80s UI wise.<p>In 1983, serving alongside the almost completely analog&#x2F;60s F-14, the F&#x2F;A-18 had 3 pretty modern MFDs. Definitely more advanced than most Star Wars cockpits, for example.')
