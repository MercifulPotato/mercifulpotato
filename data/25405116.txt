I would often come into rooms and question why the client was spending money on a product that didn&#x27;t appear to suit their needs.<p>This was <i>incredibly</i> effective, as it meant that the client actually trusted us when we said something would work.<p>That being said, I&#x27;d normally avoid calling our products crap (even when they were) and just push the client to use something that wasn&#x27;t crap.<p>This only worked though, because we had a separate reporting line to sales, so any VP pressure had to go through our VP (which happened, but not as often as you&#x27;d think).<p>My understanding is that they changed this after I left, with predictable consequences.')
