As this is the business we are in, our reputation is INCREDIBLY important to us.  If we have a major breach we&#x27;ll most likely lose our customer&#x27;s trust, lose all our customers, and go out of business.<p>Since this is all I&#x27;ve done for the last 14 years, and my income and life savings is all wrapped up in Backblaze, I take this issue as seriously as a heart attack.  So do my business partners (Backblaze was founded by 5 equal partners.)  We&#x27;re also up to around 200 employees who all would suffer greatly if we lose the trust of our customers.<p>Internally, Backblaze has a &quot;Security Council&quot; of software engineers and technical operations people with something like a combined 150 years of security experience and obsession.  One of these council members got his CS degree from MIT and is both one of the smartest people I&#x27;ve ever worked with (we&#x27;ve worked together at 3 separate companies so far over 25 years) and also deeply paranoid and stressed out all the time.  Another of the security council members has a PhD in computer science.  And so on...  They watch over all the design proposals, the APIs, the technical infrastructure, everything at Backblaze.  They propose and implement new procedures, new programs like our BugCrowd program where we have external white hat hackers constantly trying to break in.  We are also going through an internal security audit right now paying consultants to get yet another perspective.<p>In addition to the Security Council, all software engineers and all technical operations people are expected to worry about security all of the time.  It is quite possibly our most talked about, most worried about, most important thing we do.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure their development practices will improve<p>We always, ALWAYS strive to do better and do more.')
