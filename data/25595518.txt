A strange place, but onto something: sharing process rather than end product. Individual progress tracking, open journal, comments — the coolest part though is the Daily feature in which you choose the journals (think activities) you want to do, well, daily... and then check them off every day. A more process oriented way of organizing your day’s work rather than time based, which I think is especially useful for free agents, artists, creators, etc.')
