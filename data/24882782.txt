From photo EXIF data you can figure out what phones and cameras you use, where you took the pictures, and dates and times you&#x27;ve traveled. With AI or looking at the photos you can ID people and other personal details. I sometimes take photos of personal documents that can be OCRed.<p>Sure, techies tend to be more paranoid than the average person, but I do think people undervalue the long tail of data. Years ago I was talking to my wife about avoiding sensitive info in email with our tax preparer. I mentioned that we could send an email and a decade later he could get compromised and it would be trivial to scan old emails for specific data like w2s, social security numbers, or bank accounts.')
