In some cases it is but in many it&#x27;s not. Whatever you think of his character, if Musk just threw in the towel at PayPal we wouldn&#x27;t have SpaceX. I can say the same thing for Jobs, eg if he gave up after Next where would Apple be.<p>Making money is generally a positive sum endeavour as long as you&#x27;re not generating unpriced externalities such as carbon pollution, and as such I don&#x27;t like the idea that rich people stop working after they&#x27;re rich. As long as they&#x27;re not creating externalities we want them to continue building and contributing to society. It&#x27;s a much better alternative to them relaxing on a yacht somewhere, which contributes  nothing.<p>It&#x27;s also inaccurate to think that making money by building crowds out other people from doing so. The opposite is the case. It&#x27;s the same mindset behind the &quot;immigrants took our jobs&quot; train of thinking.')
