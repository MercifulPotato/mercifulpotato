Swartz&#x27;s own lawyer believed, in writing, after Swartz&#x27;s death, that had Swartz gone to trial and lost, he wouldn&#x27;t even been given a custodial sentence, and you can look at the sentencing guidelines and see why he reached that conclusion. The <i>prosecutors</i> didn&#x27;t demand a lifetime in jail; at their grimmest, most hardball state, they were suggesting (a laughable, given the guidelines, the fact that it was a first offense, and a non-remunerative crime) 7 years.<p>You wrote other things, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t read them carefully, because I&#x27;m a nerd and a human and I can&#x27;t get past &quot;a lifetime in jail&quot;. I&#x27;ll try to revisit later and respond to them, and wouldn&#x27;t want to suggest my not responding to them is an indication that they aren&#x27;t good points.')
