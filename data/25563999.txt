However, they&#x27;re kind of just delegating that issue, too, since Apple, in contrast to Google, doesn&#x27;t provide a GDPR-compliant data processing agreement to business customers. It&#x27;s debatable if such an agreement is really necessary in this case but as with all things GDPR it&#x27;s better to tread carefully.')
