(You still have to meet the terms of the GPL in other regards, but you can ignore the system libraries.)<p>GPLv2 was stricter in that regard, in that the entity shipping the system libraries couldn&#x27;t be the one shipping the GPLed software; GPLv3 drops that and allows anyone to ship GPLv3ed software for a proprietary platform, as long as you still meet the other requirements of the GPLv3.')
