(Not LXD though which is more useful as a tool than as a teaching aid.)<p>If you have some IPv6 allocation to play with you can make some interesting infrastructure and have it do something useful on the Internet without relying on the lxc-net crutches of an automatically built bridge with NAT.  It all feels very well designed as a bag of tools to let one make things rather than a complete system that guides you in only one particular direction.<p>I use stand mixers and Docker all the time; sometimes it’s fun to get into the details too.')
