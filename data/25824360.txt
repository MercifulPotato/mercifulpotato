I can’t help but wonder if this might be due to survivorship bias: crossovers are, after all, self-selecting. Perhaps not all engineers would say the same, if forced to swap roles.<p>Regardless, I’m excited to hear more from these crossovers. As a (soon-to-be) recent graduate, I think there can tend to be a great difference in perception between CS students and Engineering students, particularly at institutions without rigorous CS programs. Many tend to view CS students in the same way that some CS students view bootcamp students- people motivated by an “easy path to success”. I’ve found this opinion is rarely held of engineering students, given the reputation of engineering programs. I think it’s very useful to profile the motivators, mindsets, and general attitudes between the disciplines, if only to see that perhaps the difference isn’t as large as one might assume.')
