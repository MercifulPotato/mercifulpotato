I personally think second tweet is not only a stretch it&#x27;s the exact kind of tweet POTUS should have been using Twitter. He just says, in a normal manner, &quot;I won&#x27;t attend X&quot; without SHOUTING or using weird adjectives like &quot;nasty woman&quot; or whatever.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to understand that Twitter needs to be very conservative here. All social media banned Trump, and twitter really is the last place his voice can be heard (via a famous privately-owned social media organ). Well, if Trump tweets &quot;I&#x27;m gonna nuke Iran&quot; tomorrow they don&#x27;t want to be the place Trump announces this.')
