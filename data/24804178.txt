Julia is a dynamic language looking for a compromise between interactivity and performance (from it&#x27;s origin on R&#x2F;Matlab), while Nim is one of the new batch of static languages that looks for the perfect balance between of easy of development and safety&#x2F;speed.<p>For example, if you want to do something more exploratory (like some research or data analysis) that can still easily scale up to HPC you can use Julia, if you want to create something reliable with small binaries and no start-up issues or use in more resource constrained environments you can use Nim.')
