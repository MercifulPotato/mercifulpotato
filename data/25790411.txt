Windows is not Unix and it uses PATH variable too.<p>That&#x27;s a whole additional world of arcana, since the Windows PATH variable works subtly differently, and is configured through a (fairly obtuse) GUI in an unrelated settings panel.<p>&gt; On most Linux distros you can simply run the equivalent to `sudo apt-get install nodejs`<p>The OP is however on a Mac, where there isn&#x27;t a default package manager. Now suddenly novices have to go learn about the differences between Homebrew vs MacPorts, and why neither one works properly on their shiny new MacBook.<p>&gt; Just as an aside, GUI installers are an absolute cancer<p>For us linux sysadmins? Sure. For the rest of the world GUI installers are just how computers work.')
