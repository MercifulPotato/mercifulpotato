Item(by='teekert', descendants=None, kids=[25669983], score=None, time=1610014847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668705, text='For a family that are all on the same server, Nextcloud Talk is also nice and &quot;relatively easy&quot; to set up (and 0 effort when you already use Nextcloud). I am still desperately waiting on Talk being able to use the federation features of Nextcloud (so you can chat to users on other servers). That would increase my usage a lot, my parents are on another server (which admittedly also runs from my basement) and I have colleagues with their own server...<p>I do use Signal and Telegram with some friends, I really find the difference between WA and Signal to be small. Telegram though is a lot nicer as a platform, it has some channels I&#x27;m part of and the desktop client is much better. But this comes with privacy&#x2F;security trade-offs as mentioned in this thread.<p>I also use Element.io for some channels and groups. I find it surprisingly nice. I may set up a server myself soon.')
