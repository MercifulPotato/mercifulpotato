It requires educating the user to a different mindset.<p>I advise looking into Argent[1] (Loopring is the same) or BrightID[2] as just a few examples of how this can work well.<p>If you have no friends for social recovery, Argent provides their own service that links to your email or phone for recovery. So it’s more like a typical account recovery that users are accustomed to today.<p>Similarly, ZenGo[3] provides just that email&#x2F;phone recovery service alone but it feels intuitive and safe depending on your threat vector. The cool thing about them is that it also uses facial recognition.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.argent.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.argent.xyz&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brightid.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brightid.org&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zengo.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zengo.com&#x2F;</a>')
