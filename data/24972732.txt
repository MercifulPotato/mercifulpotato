When two same-priority roads cross, the driver on the right has the right of way. Ambiguous intersections are governed by yield signs. Only in situations where there is actual danger (bad visibility, dangerous shape of the road etc), then stop signs are used.<p>When they&#x27;re scarce, people heed them. When they&#x27;re everywhere, people instinctively determine that they&#x27;re kind of meaningless, and respect them only to avoid fines from the police.')
