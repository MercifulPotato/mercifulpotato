There is a great deal of people who are happy working jobs that allow them to pick their hours, days worked, or even just stop working for weeks at a time with no notice.<p>Having healthcare tied to full-time employment is almost entirely incompatible with this type of employment, as it is priced at half-time &#x2F; full-time employment, not super flexible gig jobs.')
