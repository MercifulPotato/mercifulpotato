Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610388124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732796, text='&gt; Blocking does not scale if you interact with a lot of people (see many famous examples of celebrities quitting Twitter over harrassment), which is something Twitter would obviously want its users to do.<p>This seems to be viewed as a sort of &quot;bug&quot; of scale; I see it as a feature. If you become extremely popular and your voice is amplified, you&#x27;re going to have to contend with being criticized and scrutinized to a greater degree.<p>I fall into the Sam Harris &amp; Joe Rogan Greater Internet Reply Theory: &quot;Don&#x27;t read the comments. You can&#x27;t read the comments.&quot; Jamie Foxx said it best on why you don&#x27;t need to read them, &quot;Sometimes the comments&#x27;ll get in that ass.&quot;<p>I will simply never agree with removing someone for the content of their speech. I do think that you eventually reach a point of harassment (for example, if you reply to every single tweet of someone you don&#x27;t like with, &quot;You&#x27;re a cunt.&quot;), but by-and-large, a lot of the &quot;problems&quot; simply result in people not being able to ignore others, either by using a button on a website, or just by sheer willpower of not looking at a comment.')
