US life expectancy as of 2018 is 78.9 years. That is, approximately half the people who are dying of this would die anyway that same year.<p>You are confusing life expectancy at birth of 78.9 for life expectancy at age 78 of 0.9, that&#x27;s not correct. Life expectancy at age 78 is 9.43 years for males, 10.98 years for females.')
