If i say to you i&#x27;m buying GME and you should too, with clear disclaimers that this isn&#x27;t financial advice but rather a meme - i don&#x27;t think i manipulated you.<p>By &quot;normal&quot; definition manipulation requires some about of deception&#x2F;etc. I don&#x27;t think &quot;anyone&quot; <i>(within obvious reason)</i> is being manipulated here. It&#x27;s very clear what the community is buying into.<p>So i come back to what &quot;manipulation&quot; is defined as in the stock sense. Is it meaningfully different?')
