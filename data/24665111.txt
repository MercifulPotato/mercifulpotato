In a free market, they will just stop doing so, and production will drop to near zero.<p>You&#x27;re right that imports would make up the difference, but that&#x27;s where national security comes in. If you rely on importing your food and your trading partners become adversaries or shipping is disrupted due to war, you&#x27;re screwed.')
