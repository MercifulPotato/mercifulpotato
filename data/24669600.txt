Who&#x27;s to say your valuation is correct? This is the reason behind volatility.<p>But if you&#x27;re buying a broad market cap-weighted index, the behaviour of the price is less affected by individual valuations and more affected by macro-economic factors. And historically, a broad market cap-weighted index has had positive returns. This cannot be said about individual companie&#x27;s performance.')
