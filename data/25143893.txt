Of course you could use Lightroom, etc. but I am swearing off software subscriptions.<p>Get Info in Photos and add all the metadata you need.<p>For myself I try to set the date for the photo — at least get close to the correct year. I set the day&#x2F;month&#x2F;time to something like January 1, 12:00 AM as a sort of indication that I have no idea when during the year. And if I am not even sure about the year I indicate as much in the description for the photo.<p>I enter a description (on export this will populate either one of the EXIF or IPTC properties or both). I describe what was written on the back and&#x2F;or front (if any). Describe who I think the photo is of, maybe where the photo came from, etc.<p>I add keywords. Keywords for each person I recognize in the photo, keywords for the collection the photo came from, keyword &quot;Family Photo&quot; so I can differentiate from all other photos in my library.....<p>Any decent photo editing app should have a means to set the date, enter a description, add keywords. And all of these are exportable — are part of the EXIF and&#x2F;or IPTC spec. And, again, a decent photo editing app will preserve these on export.<p>The beauty of course is that you can then create &quot;smart albums&quot; to show your family photos chronologically where: keyword = &quot;Family Photo&quot;, sort by date. Or find all photos of &quot;Faye Coble&quot;.')
