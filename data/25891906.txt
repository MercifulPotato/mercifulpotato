Tribalism redistributes power and words can be leveraged distinguish a tribe.<p>Take for example calling a group of people &quot;guys&quot;. Always when I was a child, and still usually now, guys referred to both genders when speaking to a mixed gender group. But it is empowering to the feminist tribe to be distinct, and interpreting guys as a kind of insult to females has that effect. It converts a statement meant to be neutral into a kind of oppression, by giving it a different meaning than the speaker intended. It separates a tribe and gives them reason for solidarity and sympathy.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of mileage from a simple redefinition, and the result is positive where the resulting tribalism is a positive force. That it is a positive force is obvious to the tribe member. So I think this strategy will be a permanent feature of language evolution.')
