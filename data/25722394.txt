Only the icons showing the filetype. I don&#x27;t use a desktop environment, only a tiling window manager, so that&#x27;s probably it. But what pains me is as much as I search, I don&#x27;t know what the hell to install that will make the thumbnails work in the filepicker even though thumbnails work everywhere else.<p>Every time I must go through this, I want to cry. The linux community thinks they are so superior, yet they cannot implement this one little thing.')
