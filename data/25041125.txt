I got used to the reduced field of view and such pretty quickly.<p>&gt; - In games like BigScreen, I suppose you can&#x27;t play your own .mp4&#x2F;.mkv files? Or can you?<p>Yep, you absolutely can.  I&#x27;ve pointed it at an SMB share I have for such things, but you can also load it up with videos on the deviec.  It&#x27;s a little annoying to deal with DTS, but once you put the random .so it needs to decode it on the device, the hard work is done.<p>&gt; tranquility on top of a mountain or on a beach. Would it be worth it?<p>Personally, I think so.  It&#x27;s mostly what I used mine for.  It might not literally be a beach or whatever, but I really like the more tranquil apps like the VR painting ones or whatever that let me zone out and ignore the world for a bit.  Also, I forgot to mention Derail Valley.  I have many hours in that game, which for me is mostly about enjoying the train rides as I move cargo around.<p>As for more open:  I&#x27;m looking into the HP Reverb, but I&#x27;m not yet that familiar with the desktop side of things.  Given some of the quality of apps available, I&#x27;m guessing the programming side is pretty easy.  Getting 3rd party stuff on the Quest is a bit like an iOS device.  You need a developer account, then you can sideload packages (or use &quot;SideQuest&quot; to act as a third party store).  No clue what FB plans for that side of things, of course.')
