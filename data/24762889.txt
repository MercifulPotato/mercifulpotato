For something once per month, that seems like a reasonable conclusion for you.<p>I have a mid-sized car, and I go to Tahoe 3-4 times a year, and probably end up being the driver 2 or 3 of those times.  For me, it makes sense to rent a 4WD&#x2F;AWD SUV with snow tires for those 2 or 3 winter trips, especially since I&#x27;ll split the cost of the rental among the friends who ride with me.<p>There&#x27;s also the comfort&#x2F;style&#x2F;happiness factor: I <i>like</i> my car and generally don&#x27;t like driving big bulky vehicles that are high off the ground; having an SUV as my primary vehicle would make me unhappy.')
