Donuts and Porkbun are examples.<p>-  avoid abused TLDs such as .xyz. If a domain is sold at $0.80, that&#x27;s a good sign of one. This 0.80 was registry pricing (not registrar eating costs), and companies behind them did very bad things to say the least. Alpnames for example was shut down by ICANN because if this. And you know how much ICANN doesn&#x27;t care about people, judging by the .org scandal.<p>In my opinion, the safest ones are from your own country NIC, a generic TLD like .com or .net, or subdomains from an organization (js.org, eu.org, etc).')
