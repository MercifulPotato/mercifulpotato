Essentially ever official has said that there will be no enforcement, so the order effectively only applies to the persuadable.<p>My kid&#x27;s scout troop is still meeting, kinda sorta complying with the letter of the order. I have advocated multiple times with the leadership to stop the meetings or at a minimum restrict them to small, stable groups, but I am the only one who feels that way. Perhaps a more severe shutdown would persuade them, but perhaps not. I wonder if just a few token enforcement actions, such as pulling people over and asking if they are complying, or modest fines for the local megachurch with 95 cars in the parking lot on Sundays, would go a long way toward making people think twice. There&#x27;s a common feeling that if something is legal, it&#x27;s OK, and I find that&#x27;s rarely true. It&#x27;s legal to fart in an elevator, but that doesn&#x27;t make it right.<p>BTW, the &quot;bully pulpit&quot; specifically')
