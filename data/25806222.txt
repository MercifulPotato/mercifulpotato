I am just nostalgic for C because C makes me feel like I am doing something closer to what the CPU works with. I know there are several layers underneath all that, but with C you can do all manner of dangerous things that by any means you shouldn’t be allowed to do. I have used it for a few projects over the years but lately the only place I really get into it is programming Arduinos or similar. I am sure sooner or later we will get a good toolkit for a language that both does proper memory management AND can allow you to do all the things you can do with C on a microcontroller, but so far I haven’t seen that.<p>Also, I have it on my TODO to go back and redo the Capture the Flag challenges from like 10 years ago that dealt with things like stack overflows. I had a ton of fun working on those and it would be fun to revisit them. Anyone got a modern version of something like that?')
