It&#x27;s like a <i>majority attack</i>, on one side of wealth, on another of votes.<p>While the combined wealth of all voters exceeds that of the few lobbyists, in theory votes should win.<p>It&#x27;s good to recall that democracy didn&#x27;t come about in a vaccuum; It came about to displace monarchy. Because democracy is &quot;fair&quot;, the aristocrats are among us with <i>at least</i> as much power as any of the rest of us.<p>The greater the wealth disparity, however, the more power they can purchase by bribing the poor politicians. Which in turn begs the masses to pay politicians well enough that corruption becomes at best <i>unnecessary</i>. The only remaining cure for greed is transparency, accountability, and journalism.<p>Therefore it is in the wealthy elite&#x27;s interest to lobby for laws that erode any established amounts of the aforementioned qualities, steadily inching the power structures towards secrecy, carte blanche, and censorship.<p>Can you think of any government agency that has such powers? I&#x27;m thinking of several, and most of them are in the US. Capitalism is allergic to <i>wealth redistribution</i>, which is the true name for the action that begins to solve the issue. The only question is: How much?<p>One practical example is speeding tickets. AFAIK in the US speeding tickets are flat fees. So a wealthy person barely cares about speeding in traffic. In Finland, a more socialist republic, speeding tickets are <i>proportional to income</i>. So a wealthy person speeding will feel the hurt. Every so often some asshole with a Ferrari gets a million dollar speeding ticket. (possibly exaggerated, don&#x27;t recall exact amounts)')
