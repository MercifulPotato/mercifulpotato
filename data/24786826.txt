I was a massage therapist and I started learning to code in 2014, getting my first paid job in 2018. My experience is only in webdev, so depending on your discipline your mileage may vary.<p>You&#x27;re right in thinking that your lack of experience is going to be an obstacle, but it&#x27;s not an insurmountable one.<p>Everyone tells you to have a GitHub profile with portfolio projects and this helped, but most recruiters for entry-level positions didn&#x27;t know enough about tech to evaluate a project in a portfolio. They only speak &quot;years of experience&quot;. The only way you get past that is getting lucky enough to have somebody who knows what they&#x27;re talking about read your resume, which is what happened to me. I was 36, father of two starting in a brand new industry and it&#x27;s awesome.<p>The great thing is that once you&#x27;re in, you&#x27;re in. And being on the older side for the industry is actually an asset. I&#x27;m right in the sweet spot where I&#x27;m young enough to not cringe too hard when my company names all development teams after video game characters, but old enough to add a little gravitas behind my opinions.')
