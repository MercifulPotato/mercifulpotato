It&#x27;s a collection of many different strategies that are generally characterized by short holding periods, high portfolio turnover, and latency sensitivity. But depending on the specific strategy, the degree of latency sensitivity could vary by orders of magnitude.<p>A desk trying to gain first queue position at the opening auction is probably running in FPGAs or ASICs and aiming for 100 nanoseconds. A spot market maker needs to respond fast to new level formation, and is aiming for 10 microseconds on a C++ stack. An alpha-driven liquidity taker may be using complex ML models, and is running a Scala stack at 50 microseconds. An ETF market may just need to re-mark their quotes when the underlying shifts, and is fine with 250 microseconds on OCaml.')
