At age 8, I learned QBasic (on an MS-DOS &#x2F; Win 3.1 system). At age 13, I learned C, and wrote a lot of code in it as well. (I used to write tons of C code up until around the middle of age 17. I had grand plans for all sorts of glorious software projects.)<p>But then, at the middle of age 17, a certain mild depression (&quot;dysthymia&quot;) set in, and I lost a lot of hope, inspiration, and motivation. And now, I&#x27;m 31, and I&#x27;ve accomplished very little of my teenage dreams (even though I still hold&#x2F;aspire towards those software dreams). I might be &quot;successful&quot; in society&#x27;s eyes, with software engineering jobs paying in the ~200k range (which is not really that impressive, as I have many friends making in the 300k to 400k (USD) range);  but in my own eyes, I still feel very much like a failure.<p>The depression or dysthymia had a crippling effect, that made a lot of dreams hard to accomplish. <i>My 2021 New Year&#x27;s resolution has been to overcome it my mental issues, and live life to the fullest.</i>')
