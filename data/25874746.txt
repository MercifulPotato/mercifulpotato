So you&#x27;re both correct.<p>However:<p>&gt; That would mean in 3 servers you need 2.5 aka 3 machines to commit a change.<p>That seems wrong. You need N&#x2F;&#x2F;2 +1 where &quot;&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot; is floor division, so in a 3 node cluster, you need 3&#x2F;&#x2F;2 +1, or 1+1 or 2 nodes to commit a change.')
