Unless you are able to get your order in before other orders, it’s not front running. Get it?<p>Being the first to look at new orders is nice, but the orders are in the queue so there is no way to get in front of them.<p>Here is a link to help you: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;f&#x2F;frontrunning.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;f&#x2F;frontrunning.asp</a><p>It’s very well-defined in the industry and when you complain about something completely unrelated using that term it muddies the argument for the general public and makes you sound ignorant to the people involved with the industry (both regulators and private participants).<p>I cursed because it’s the same ignorant argument over and over spreading false information about how the market functions.
