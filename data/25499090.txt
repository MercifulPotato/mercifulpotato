But if the people fighting injustice are inspired to do so based on injustice against a specific group, then you should examine your own motivations before discouraging them.<p>I&#x27;m generally opposed to such racism, but it&#x27;s not like there is a good alternative in these times. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the campaign against police unaccountability has crystallized around &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot;, but it&#x27;s hard to dispute that Blacks have been feeling most of the pain. If &quot;All Lives Matter&quot; were an alternative non-racist campaign against police unaccountability then we could debate the merits of each. Alas it&#x27;s just a reactionary stand to maintain the status quo.')
