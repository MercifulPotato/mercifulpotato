Item(by='matheusmoreira', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606827396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25263753, text='&gt; All of the locking down by computer vendors we’ve seen to date is pretty well explained by more boring but strong commercial benefits (e.g. app stores)<p>Yes. See also the copyright and advertising industries. Free unrestricted computing is directly opposed to the business interests of these multi-billion dollar industries. Simply because it gives me the power to block their stupid ads and tracking or copy their data without paying for it. They obviously don&#x27;t want anyone to have this power and the only way to achieve that outcome is by destroying computing freedom. In order for me to not have this power, they must necessarily make it so that my computer does not obey me.<p>I have no doubt there are more examples out there that I don&#x27;t know about. Hopefully others will post about them as well.<p>Like I said, these commercial interests are nothing compared to the big picture surrounding government control of computers. This is already a reality in certain niches such as radio: government agencies already try to control how radio equipment works and I have no doubt they will require trusted computing if they don&#x27;t already. There have been several attempts to regulate encryption in the US. In the other Five Eyes, particularly Australia, these attempts have been more or less successful.<p>&gt; I’ll worry when they outlaw&#x2F;restrict at least one of: unrestricted browsers, wordpress, wordpress hosting.<p>What makes you think they won&#x27;t be restricted? This is already a reality in certain parts of the world and the west is becoming ever more friendly to these ideas.')
