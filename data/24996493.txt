When it comes to videos you can trade image quality for file size. High end nvidia GPUs are better in bit rate constrained situations for streaming, but they&#x27;re not as good at reducing file size as the slower encoders.<p>When it comes to video hosting it&#x27;s largely about bandwidth. Imagine you had a video that got 1 million views. 110 MB vs 100 MB file size. That&#x27;s 110 TB vs 100 TB bandwidth - a difference of 10 TB. At a cent per GB that&#x27;s $100 difference. Now imagine a video with 10 million views or 100 million views.<p>And the real difference in file size is likely to be larger.')
