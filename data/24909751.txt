Every one of which has failed.  And therefore I predict that a drug trial based on this research will likewise fail.<p>So if that fails, what should we do instead?<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-018-05719-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-018-05719-4</a> for an overview of why it is reasonable that the root cause is infections and amyloid β is a symptom of our brains attempts to fight it off.  Which explains why decades of drug trials aimed at disrupting the creation of amyloid β (which this does) have failed dismally.<p>As <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;could-alzheimers-be-a-reaction-to-infection&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;observations&#x2F;could-alzh...</a> points out, treating people with the anti-herpes drug acyclovir was found to reduce the odds of getting Alzheimer&#x27;s by 80%.  Contrast this with the inability over many drug trials of any drugs aimed at amyloid β to demonstrate any effect on Alzheimer&#x27;s at all.<p>As the old quote goes, &quot;science progresses one funeral at a time&quot;.  We&#x27;re going to see ongoing research for a long time based on the idea that amyloid β is the cause of Alzheimer&#x27;s.  In the meantime if you have a family history of Alzheimer&#x27;s, I would recommend getting a prescription for the only drug that has ever demonstrated any clinical success.  Namely acyclovir. And start it before permanent damage has been done to your brain.')
