I think there&#x27;s exactly one video of me before I was 20-ish.<p>That said, I do worry about all those family WhatsApp videos that my family shares and&#x2F;or the videos that my siblings keep in their phones with no backup whatsoever. Maybe this post will finally convince me to put something together.')
