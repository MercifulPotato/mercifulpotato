I do not think the first review violates the highlighted policy, and I feel very uneasy with the disclosure of the songs played by the second, non-anonymized reviewer. Are you sure this person consented to you sharing her logs? Or is it fair game, because she had the audacity not to like your product after 8 minutes? Will you also challenge requests for refunds by pointing out that your customers did not try hard enough to like it?<p>Vine might have been a bad choice for you, but I am not sure I dislike it from an Amazon-customer perspective, and your post does not make me want to try your product (will you share my musical preferences if I do?).')
