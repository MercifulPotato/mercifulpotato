It&#x27;s closer to 240k&#x2F;10m.<p>As for privacy: if we were told we&#x27;d need to be permanently tracked from now until the end of time, I think just about everyone would agree with you (at least on HN) that it&#x27;s just not a sacrifice worth making.  But NOBODY is saying that, they&#x27;re saying: how about we use this tool until a vaccine is ready - which is a far more reasonable ask.')
