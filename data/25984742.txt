In a dynamic language, you could map over the values and apply capitalization trivially. It would be a one-liner.<p>That&#x27;s fair, but can you explain the context here? I.e. why are we trying to capitalize all the field names of a record object? This may be an &#x27;XY&#x27; problem--you may be trying to accomplish some final goal and &#x27;capitalize all the field names of a map&#x27; seems like an obvious intermediate step to you, while to a statically typed language programmer they may take a very different approach.')
