I think that enough people will voluntarily vaccinate that the population-level effects of insufficient vaccination will be small. If so, the points about &quot;endangering the lives of others&quot; do not carry much weight, and the discussion of whether one still has freedom to make medical decisions is very relevant.<p>If it could be mathematically proven that there is 0% risk of negative effects? Sure. Put a requirement for vaccination in the constitution. But the current RNA vaccines have not been tested at scale before, and empirical information about long-term effects is unknowable. Things are <i>likely</i> good based on current knowledge, but there is uncertainty.<p>Anyone who wishes to enact population-level policies in such a situation is making a statement about the likelihood of an &quot;unknown unknown&quot; that is unsupported by data. In the light of this, it is very ethically problematic to mandate anything at this point. That&#x27;s even if you&#x27;re open to de facto mandates regarding medical procedures in the first place.<p>Of <i>course</i> the consideration would be different if the disease had a 100% mortality rate, but such a situation would <i>obviousy</i> also affect people&#x27;s decisions about whether to get vaccinated or not. You wouldn&#x27;t see me presenting this argument of principles if that was the reality.<p>You can&#x27;t determine with an equation at what point such policies would be palatable, but you can make comparisons to other dangerous activities that affect others. Smoking. Driving a car, or speeding. Drinking alcohol. (De facto) mandatory medical procedures seem excessive in the light of our current policies against such behavior.<p>One might make a different argument if the skepticism was so widespread that the vaccination program was ineffective, but let&#x27;s revisit it if that happens.')
