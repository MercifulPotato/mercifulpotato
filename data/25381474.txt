But if they cared about customers as you claim, they&#x27;d let users set hard limits, and when one of these mishaps happened, stop the services when their system eventually knows that the quota has been exceeded... and, make the user only pay the hard limit as the maximum amount. If this continues to happen, warn the user that their account will be terminated... and that&#x27;s that. But they&#x27;ll never do that.<p>Most of their clients pay for these mistakes because they don&#x27;t have the reach or skills to make this a viral social media article to get people&#x27;s attention and hence get them to forgive the costs.<p>I&#x27;m sure they know how much they make in revenue because of these mistakes and they deliberately don&#x27;t do anything about it.')
