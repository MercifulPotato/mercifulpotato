Could you shoot me an email at hi@flurly.com with a link to your site?<p>Few follow up questions:<p>1) Would you have the website? Or would the flurly product page be your &quot;website&quot;? If the former, does it make sense to skip the product page altogether and Flurly just serves as a super thin layer over Stripe Checkout?<p>2) Would the purchase be a subscription or a one time payment?<p>Thanks for your interest!')
