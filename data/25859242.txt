Game engines normally refer to things like Unity or Godot : Not only do they include a framework for handling game logic, an engine provides things like asset management, level editor, etc.<p>This looks more like a &quot;game framework&quot;, which is basically a wrapper around opengl&#x2F;directx&#x2F;etc. which abstracts the low level stuff and gives programmers an easy way to render sprites, have a gameloop and whatnot.')
