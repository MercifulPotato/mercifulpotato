Learning for the job is distantly secondary, and getting my next job is tertiary. They&#x27;re perks to something I&#x27;m doing anyway, not justifications for doing it.<p>Yeah, I program at work, but the tasks I get at a software job don&#x27;t scratch the itch that got me into tech in the first place. Just like how most workers in &quot;creative&quot; fields don&#x27;t get paid to do the interesting things that first attracted them. They&#x27;re stuck using their arts degrees to write marketing copy instead of their dream novel, or they became a civil engineer to design inspiring architecture but their day job is trying to update someone else&#x27;s vision to include the safety features the designer didn&#x27;t leave room for.<p>I get that lots of people get their fill of technology at their job and don&#x27;t want to see a screen when they get home. Live the life that makes you happy. I&#x27;m just boggled at how many people appear to find it unimaginable and unrelatable that a technologist likes technology enough to mess with it for fun, even after work.')
