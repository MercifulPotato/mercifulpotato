Right now, DeFi is to finance what the world wide web was to communication and content in 1993<p>The internet managed to break every established industry that relied on network effects and scale - media, commerce, communication. But it didn&#x27;t do much for finance. The world&#x27;s biggest banks are still the same as they used to be 30 years ago (whereas internet based companies have taken over media and commerce).<p>DeFi is going to change that. If you rummage through the scams (and there are a LOT of them), there are some truly exciting ideas being explored in this space. It legitimately feels like the internet in 1994. Heck, even the web design is wild and adventurous as it used to be instead of the boring, tame &quot;professional startup&quot; crap we see everywhere now.')
