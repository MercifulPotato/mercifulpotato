You could spend the same amount of time learning a different language... but you probably can find a better use for that time.<p>In the time I spent learning English -- which is still far from perfect, especially in spoken form -- I probably could have learned quantum physics instead. Except, I realistically couldn&#x27;t have, because good textbooks on this topic do not exist in my language, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to learn more online, etc.<p>Now imagine removing an equivalent amount of knowledge from your life -- that is the price you would have to pay for not being a native English speaker.<p>(The idea of Esperanto as everyone&#x27;s second language is that instead of some people spending 10+ years learning the common language, and some lucky people spending 0, everyone would spend 2 years instead. Until people would hopefully realize that private languages are useless, and then it would be 0 for everyone.)')
