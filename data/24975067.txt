Hillary, in America, is loathed by many as a pretentious Marie Antoinette who rode her husband&#x27;s coat tails and looked down upon the working class.  I personally know several folks who voted Democrat their whole life and voted for Trump in 2016.  i.e. her infamous deplorables speech.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4486502&#x2F;hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-transcript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4486502&#x2F;hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorabl...</a><p>Working class voters saw their manufacturing jobs shipped overseas.  They were told to &quot;retrain&quot; to get high tech jobs.  They took on a mountain of student loan debt and still could not find jobs that were as good as their manufacturing jobs.  Even white collar workers are angry with what they see as corporate malfeasance.  e.g. H-1B programs that make it legal to replace American citizens with low paid foreign workers.  Under Title 8, of the US Code, you can be imprisoned for six months for hiring an unauthorized alien but with H1-B, the corporations can get away with it.  What David Shor and other Democratic Party Elitists describe as &quot;racist white people&quot; are the working class who feel abandoned by the Democrats.  I think the working class mostly voted out of frustration in 2016.  What worries me is that the Democratic Party Elite still don&#x27;t get it and will continue to foist tone-deaf candidates on us, who only know to toe the corporate line and ignore the working class who are becoming more and more desperate.')
