Only people who hire private drivers with Uber would pay those costs, not &quot;everyone&quot; in a flat way.  People who ride Uber more would pay more.<p>(And maybe, once we realize the actual cost chauffeurs for rent &amp; private transportation, one can start paying more attention to housing patterns, sprawl, public transportation etc.)')
