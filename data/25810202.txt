You can&#x27;t make it cover what is one the display or that important parts are highlighted. But you can potentially cover the color pallet and how exactly you arrange information of the same not high importance level.<p>I.e. in context of JingOs the way they cluster settings especially combined with the used color schema and similar aspects are very likely covered by design patents.<p>Similar that notifications are a list of swipe-able settings in a box can&#x27;t be covered by design patents, but that it has that graish color with that level of transparence, rounded corners, and similar might very well be covered.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like design patents but they are a thing which exists.<p>Lastly the copy is so close that it might not just cause conflicts with design patents but also with copyright on the visual parts (not the underlying code!) of iOs.')
