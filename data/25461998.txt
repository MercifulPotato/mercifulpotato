In practice, NULL causes many SQL statements to require 2 conditionals for logic instead of 1, introducing subtle bugs.<p>There are exceptions, but I haven&#x27;t seen many. One useful one is if you want a unique index on a column and you can&#x27;t use &quot;&quot;, you can use NULL.<p>Another is if you need the full range of a column, plus indicating whether data was supplied or not. I see that more with applications involving money, whereas the empty string works fine for most tables used in SaaS and social applications.<p>Source: DBA.')
