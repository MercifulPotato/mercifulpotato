If a relatively higher portion of women vs. men have college degrees and thus greater opportunities for stable, salaried positions; and a larger swath of the men are in (increasingly inconsistent, hourly and low-paid) physical labor markets, while a smaller proportion of men also have stable, salaried jobs (and it’s often still going to be the case that of the highest-compensated employees, a larger portion of them are male): most women aren’t going to want to hitch themselves long-term to someone with unstable prospects. This is where the matching problem comes in, and no, it’s not unreasonable to realize (and it doesn’t necessarily imply a flawed personality in the person who recognizes it enough to write it) that you’re going to have a lot of men with no ability to build a life (ie a wife and a family). And with the increasingly connected-world&#x2F;social media, they’ll be keenly aware of how a handful of other men have it better&#x2F;easier. Not crazy to think that will lead to larger societal problems.')
