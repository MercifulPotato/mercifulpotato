It gets detected and installed on Mac and Windows without issue. It still prints without issue. I am on the original toner (to help you understand how exceedingly rare it is for me to need to print).<p>Inkjet Printers are such a pain to make work in general, have such high costs for ink, and rarely hold up well. I would rather buy a color laser if I needed to print color and Iâ€™d probably go find a used one that was loved before dealing with the new ones.<p>Reminds me of 20 years ago when people kept the early HP LaserJet models going for their needs because they were such workhorses.')
