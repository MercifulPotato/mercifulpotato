The problem is tractable given enough enforcement tools and resources. Bitcoin&#x27;s different - it has little AML control so it&#x27;s super easy to write money laundering tools. Monero is even worse. Money laundering is built into the protocol, to the point where being able to determine the chain-of-custody over some funds is computationally infeasible. Cryptocurrency is designed to increase the scope of money laundering rather than just the scale, because it makes money laundering the default.<p>Think about how difficult it was to enforce copyright law in 1970 versus 2010. In the former, copyright enforcement was a matter of having enough lawyers to sue enough enterprises. In 2010, everyone has a commercial-scale copyright infringement device in their pocket. You practically can&#x27;t enforce the law to the same level purely because the targets are too small and numerous and going after them is a PR nightmare. This is why the music industry fought against consumer-grade recording technology for so long (and lost). Regulating large businesses is a fundamentally more tractable form of law enforcement than individuals.')
