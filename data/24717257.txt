Notion is too complicated, Roam doesn&#x27;t have some important features (such as OCR of handwritten notes), etc. Each time I try another app I decide that Evernote is the only one that ticks all marks.<p>I also hope that this allows a new wave of innovation. The first new feature I would like to see is automatic backlinks, similar to Roam&#x27;s.')
