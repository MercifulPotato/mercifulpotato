Those are the objects that any AI-controlled vehicle will have to recognize.<p>The point of the GP was, it&#x27;s training these AIs on specifically _American_ hydrants, store fronts, crosswalks and traffic lights, which sucks not only for those of us unpaid mechanical Turks who aren&#x27;t Yanks, but also makes you wonder if nobody cares that these coming AI-controlled vehicles won&#x27;t be so great at discriminating NON-American hydrants, store fronts, crosswalks and traffic lights from _non-American pedestrians._<p>And no, America does not equal “the West”; most of your street furniture looks slightly“ off” compared to, say, that of most European countries. Anyway, the part of the “West” that will probably be at the forefront of this wave will probably, as usual, be the most hyper-advanced: Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan...')
