He’s recently produced a video that you can see below about the process. Usually, printing in metal means having a high-powered laser and great expense. [Wu’s] technique is an extension of electroplating.<p>Boiling down the gist of the process, the print head is a syringe full of electroplating solution. Instead of plating a large object, you essentially electroplate on tiny areas. The process is relatively slow and if you speed it up too much, the result will have undesirable properties. But there are some mind-bending options here. By using print heads with different electrolytes, you can print using different metals. For example, the video shows structures made of both copper and nickel. You can also reverse the current and remove metal instead of depositing it.&quot;<p>PDS: <i>I wonder if this process could print a single transistor...</i><p>(Perhaps if silicon, or some other semiconductor (as opposed to metal) were mixed in an electrolyte solution (not sure of the chemistry of this at this point, or if it can be done -- more research is necessary) then maybe that could be deposited in addition to the metals, and then a transistor, or transistor-like circuit, could be created...)<p>Key Phrase: <i>&quot;Electrochemical Additive Manufacturing&quot;</i>')
