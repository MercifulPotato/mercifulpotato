As you can see in this comment thread (on an extremely left-leaning site) we have some people who think drug use is immoral. One of the sister comments says &quot;I believe it&#x27;s wrong&quot;.<p>Definitely some section of the population wanted to use this as a way to bully minorities but another section of the population was convinced &quot;drugs are bad&quot;.<p>Either way if &quot;hard on drugs&quot; was a dog whistle to signal &quot;hard on minorities&quot; then politicians may realize saying &quot;hard on drugs&quot; will actually hurt their voter base far more than they realized. Maybe that will put an end to this kind of signalling&#x2F;abuse.')
