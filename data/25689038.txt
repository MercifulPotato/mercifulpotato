Unless you&#x27;re going to argue that being forced onto the non-web is not suppressing your ability to communicate, but if so that&#x27;s a tough argument to dig into here.<p>edit: I should add here the thought exercise is that you are participating in speech that is legal and ethical but are overruled by SSL cert providers and are unable to get a root signed cert from anyone (or whatever other means of preventing SSL.) In that case, even if you are not hard blocked, having your speech be passed around the internet in cleartext also seems like it affects your ability to communicate in a negative way.')
