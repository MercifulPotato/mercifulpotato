Like &quot;ls&quot; sometimes actually being aliased to a bash script, or maybe BSD having one implementation and Ubuntu another.  Is that not the case?  Is &quot;sudo&quot; not maintained by an entity like gnu, bsd, etc?<p>edit - in other words, I always assumed &quot;sudo&quot; was a highly-dependent system-level tool, not just some useful helper binary that is maintained by one independent person.')
