The effect would be far larger than for gasoline.  Based on the ideal gas law, dropping the temperate by 20C would reduce the volume by 7% while keeping the mass of gas the same!  The change in density of gasoline is only ~2% over the same temperature range.[2]<p>However, you&#x27;d need to warm the gas back up before burning it as furnaces are typically tuned for a specific density of gas.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnicalculator.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;ideal-gas-law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.omnicalculator.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;ideal-gas-law</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;eic&#x2F;site&#x2F;mc-mc.nsf&#x2F;eng&#x2F;lm00129.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;eic&#x2F;site&#x2F;mc-mc.nsf&#x2F;eng&#x2F;lm00129.html</a>')
