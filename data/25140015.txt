I suspect that mild drinking on the order of 1 glass of wine per day is not likely to cause harm and would probably be something that a doctor wouldnt feel bad recommending as being generally safe to possible stress reduction health benefits.<p>That said, there is plenty of research suggesting not drinking is healthier for you and non drinkers are much less apt to diseases like cancer et al. I also think there are plenty of folks who either dont want to or cant stop drinking that would include some doctors that would not want to suggest not drinking at all.<p>I definitely notice anxiety increases either the day after or the night of drinking. In some ways I could see it causing a feedback loop, but I also somewhat enjoy what I would consider a jolt of reflection during those times. Am I treating people with kindness? Am I too focused on the wrong thing? That said, as Ive gotten older, I think curbing to completely stopping drinking is the trend for me.')
