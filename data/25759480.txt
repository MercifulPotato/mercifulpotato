In those cases you also need your filer _not_ to compress on the fly, and not deduplicate objects... unless your hardware can do it for you.<p>... I remember horrible performance on VMs with images stored on a oversized netapp filer, because someone enabled deduplication and compression instead of using 1 of the 4 spare drives (when it was HDD).')
