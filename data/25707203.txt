For example, in Russia&#x2F;Poland and likely other Slavic countries where people saw a much better life when capitalistic principles were adopted, there is definitely a prestige associated with working at a big famous company and earning big bucks. Ironically, there is very much aura of &quot;earn good salary, then spend it on BMW&#x2F;Merc&#x2F;Audi and a big house to impress your friends and family&quot; with people from that background, which seems significantly less applicable to native US employees within the company.<p>Meanwhile, in places like Switzerland&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;France, while my exposure to those people is limited (friends of family in Poland&#x2F;Russia), it seems that people care more about the quality of life than high salary. In those regions, high salaries have traditionally been very hard to get (you need connections almost more than talent), so most people don&#x27;t see this within reach, and as a result value things like good work life balance, ability to have a family, vacation, and other common things.')
