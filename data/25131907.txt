The ability for db2 to self-tune has put it ahead of sql server, oracle and others in some ways, for decades. While the author clearly got hired and found himself in a good niche at IBM and grew there, IBMs database teams have definitely hired and sustained people from various backgrounds because the work can be challenging and rewarding.<p>I&#x27;m saying this because one of my uncles maintained the lock manager in the mainframe db2 codebase for most of a couple of decades including being there at the time the author mentioned, working on sysplex and parallel sysplex, and he entered that gig without a particular interest in databases as he told it. But he really did take to assembly and production code maintenance')
