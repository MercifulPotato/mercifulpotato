My life used to revolved around F1 starting from the late 80s (did not miss a single race in 25 years), but two years ago I gave up and have not watched the past two seasons.<p>With rules preventing engine and car development once Mercedes locked in the advantage, it&#x27;s game over. Sure F1 has had plenty of dominant teams for short time windows but it was engineering-driven and could (and was) overcome by better engineering by other teams. Now that the advantage is locked in by the rules, there is no hope.<p>To me there&#x27;s no entertainment value whatsoever in watching Mercedes lap a second faster than everyone year after year. Let&#x27;s watch some paint dry instead.')
