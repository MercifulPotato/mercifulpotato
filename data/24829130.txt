To exploit this, the attacker needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position and compromise a CA<p>2. Certificate transparency helps with detecting and banning misbehaving CAs<p>3. CAs are audited to have processes in place which make it difficult for individuals to misbehave<p>4. In case of a large scale attack of this kind, banks are relatively likely to refund the money (unlike money stolen by a person you authorized)<p>5. The individuals employed by CAs are not anonymous and at risk of legal prosecution<p>I&#x27;d be more worried about DNS&#x2F;registrar level attacks, since CAs generally assume that whoever has control over a domain is authorized to issue certificates for it. I doubt registrars are anywhere near as security conscious as CAs.<p>And then there is the dependency hell of random software having hundreds of indirect dependencies they didn&#x27;t verify which are maintained by random, often anonymous people. On most desktop OSs any such application can steal your banking credentials.')
