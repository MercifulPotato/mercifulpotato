I saw 1.6 lbs and was like &quot;woah that&#x27;s well under 1kg for a 15&quot; laptop!&quot;<p>I think 3.64 lbs (1.65kg) is perfectly acceptable for a 15&quot; laptop, not the lightest but also not the heaviest.<p>However 49Wh is on the low end for this size laptop imho. Granted it isn&#x27;t having to put a HiDPI screen and hopefully the Ryzen is more energy efficient than Intel but I doubt it is going to be a show stopper in the battery life department.')
