It feels like it shouldn&#x27;t be possible nor work as well as it does, and yet apparently I&#x27;m having a much better experience than people with much more capable hardware.<p>I&#x27;m still keeping a PS2 and some old games for when I want to enjoy a local gaming experience that is completely my own, rather than a service. But for Cyberpunk 2077, treating it as a service works well for me.')
