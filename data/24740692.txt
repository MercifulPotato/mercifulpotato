Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[24741052], score=None, time=1602353208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740663, text='Yep, I recently made a mistake of buying a new Lenovo laptop directly from Lenovo instead of Amazon, and it was a huge mistake - the machine arrived with a broken screen and I waited over 2 weeks for the replacement, their support was generally useless and every time I rang them got a different answer to what was actually happening(they said the replacement is ready, only to say it&#x27;s not and I&#x27;ll get a refund 2 days later, to then turn around and say a replacement has actually been shipped, absolute nonsense). Had it been purchased through Amazon I can guarantee I would have just returned the laptop the same day with a prepaid label, had the money back in my account the next day, re-ordered and had a replacement the following day. Well, lesson learnt I guess.')
