That&#x27;s also only a single data point that&#x27;s required for the token to work (if everything else holds up). They would also need prior energy consumption, which the implementing companies would be incentivized to downplay.<p>The concept is as full of holes as your run-of-the mill 2018 bubble crypto project.')
