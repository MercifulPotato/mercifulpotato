Uhhh because they were not taking ANY aggressive actions in 2016 against anyone, that&#x27;s why we are here. They are trying to correct a wrong. I applaud them for trying.<p>Also it&#x27;s unfair to say they are doing this for political favoritism. Democratic politicians are the loudest ones calling for their breakup, ie. Bernie, AOC, Warren.<p>Reading this story without understanding the entire political landscape is as dangerous as the misinformation itself.')
