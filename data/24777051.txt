After seeing the potential of Code&#x27;s new Custom Editor Extension API, I took it upon myself to port some of the primary features of one of my favorite pieces of software, CastleDB, into Code itself.<p>Depot is a structured data editor for Visual Studio Code that allows you to edit JSON data like a spreadsheet. Data you would normally store in raw JSON or XML can instead be stored, edited, and managed, all through a single Depot file.<p>The key part about Depot is that it not only provides you a much nicer interface for editing JSON (spreadsheet instead of a long text file), but also that it stores the data model itself inside of the JSON file. That way if you&#x27;re importing a Depot file into your project, the file you&#x27;re importing contains the information about how to read and interpret it.<p>I&#x27;ve also made an explainer video here which walks through using it as well as its main features:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tCTQvd3zkEg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tCTQvd3zkEg</a><p>Thanks!')
