This is if you want to create live loops of a specified length and have them start playing automatically. They crippled this feature in the DAW so that you have to buy a Push. They could have allowed you to do this without a Push in many different ways. There is a third party tool called BinkLooper which gets you there, sort of, but it&#x27;s not like what they worked out with their Push. I don&#x27;t want the Push on stage and I don&#x27;t want to spend what is basically the price of Live all over again (plus have another expensive thing to have to upgrade again and again).')
