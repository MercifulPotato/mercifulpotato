A short ramp up has become way more important than ability to learn on the job.<p>Programming isn&#x27;t magic, one of our not-software disciplines has a tradition of learning python so they can make business logic changes to internal tooling we maintain for them. Not that it&#x27;s hard for them to get on our schedule (they usually preempt our other work), it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s so damn easy for someone smart to pick up python.')
