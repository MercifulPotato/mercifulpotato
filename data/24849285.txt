Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603297181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848527, text='I saw that photo in color and missed it by +2 years. In color, at least, it&#x27;s very obviously &#x27;retro&#x27; and the phrase on the sign is not particularly 60&#x27;s. I got two others within a year or two, but it was because I recognized the events. One I really flubbed was the two little boys on the junk pile (mine was color), which I guessed was related to the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Since the color average was &#x27;87 and the black-and-white &#x27;85, I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what most people thought regardless of color. The most difficult one for me was the &#x27;street parade&#x27;, which could have been many, many moments. In all cases, regardless of color or black-and-white I wasn&#x27;t using whether the photo was color or black-and-white to determine the date. I was first trying to guess the possible events, and then trying to rule them out based on clothing, style of cars, architecture, etc. etc.<p>I think a bigger problem is where to initially put the selection knob. The knob on the picture of the two &#x27;hippy&#x27; women was placed around &#x27;64 (if I remember correctly), confirming the bias in my brain &quot;60s == hippy&quot;. I suspect most people link the selection knob mentally as a sort of &#x27;caption&#x27; of the photo, even though they know consciously it&#x27;s the selection tool.People are also probably slightly less likely to move a slider further than closer.')
