Technically, I guess the nation could also work on reducing the demand side of healthcare by promoting better diets and exercise, but I won&#x27;t hold my breath on that one.<p>The prior is already happening with the introduction of PA and NPs taking over roles that MD&#x2F;DOs used to do (for better or for worse, I&#x27;ve seen many discussions on how PA&#x2F;NP education is very lacking and the bar to qualify is too low, which I agree with).<p>I don&#x27;t know much about increasing supply of medicine, but that probably has to do with patent reform and&#x2F;or FDA approvals for slightly modified medications.<p>There&#x27;s also probably something about liability and litigiousness that is a factor of higher prices in the US.')
