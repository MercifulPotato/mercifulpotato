If labor&#x27;s salary doesn&#x27;t capture that, then that value is going somewhere - either to  your governments via taxes or to capital owners. I understand that some Europeans will not have problems with the former, but are you comfortable letting capital class capture all the remaining value after taxes? If not, that is a good enough argument because allowing that to happen is what is driving wealth inequality to high levels.')
