For them, Apple is a quasi monopole. For me personally, it would take quite some time changing platforms, and I am already planning on doing this, but it will take time.<p>More importantly, Apple is a huge player that shapes the structure of the industry towards a vision that lacks any kind of freedom for its users. An end game where its users are just consumers, void of any freedom to do what they want with their hardware. This is not a bright future Apple is painting: Some sort of Utopia that we can take part of by giving up freedom, by accepting Apple&#x27;s rules 100% or leaving their territory.<p>I can understand that what Apple does appeals to many users. I still recommend Apple devices to my retired parents and to friends who do not want to fiddle with their hardware. But that folks here on HN are defending Apple&#x27;s practices is way beyond me.')
