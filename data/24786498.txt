The one on MacOS is not good even with extra apps (Rectangle). There is too much degree of freedom in moving a window pixel by pixel. I want it to automatically lay out the windows.<p>The other problem is a lot of things open are Chrome tabs nested within a Chrome window. I wish there were no tabs and the OS window manager would automatically surface the right tabs and windows and pick the right layout (eg. Four windows tiled or two windows side by side, etc.) With an easy keyboard search across the content of everything open')
