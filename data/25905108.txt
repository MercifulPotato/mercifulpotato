Like:<p>&gt; It would allow operators to procure [...] with different players to piece together a 5G network, <i>breaking the market power of “end-to-end” vendors like Ericsson and Nokia</i>.<p>And later:\n&gt; the O-RAN Alliance. It&#x27;s a standard-setting body that includes [...] leading vendors Ericsson and Nokia.<p>First, it doesn&#x27;t work like that. They will still offer end-to-end deals, even with ORAN, it&#x27;s just that winning conditions change. Second, why would companies support standardization effort that is supposedly intended to &quot;harm&quot; them? :D<p>&gt; The operators, now barred by governments from using Huawei in several European markets, see Open RAN as a fix to what they consider a duopoly in the vendor market that allows Ericsson and Nokia to charge higher prices for 5G equipment.<p>I LOL&#x27;ed. From what I know, Ericsson and Nokia does not charge higher prices for 5G equipment due to duopoly, because that would be called price collusion and the journalists don&#x27;t have proof to back it up. Also, Ericsson and Nokia are fighting each other for every piece of market share, I don&#x27;t see how pumping up the prices would help here.')
