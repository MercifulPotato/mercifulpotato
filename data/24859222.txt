You&#x27;ve participated in dozens &amp; dozens of conversations, had all sorts of interactions. And now when people go back to reflect, on their lives, on what happened, on conversations they had... they&#x27;ll find a big black hole. A vanishing point where ulucs once was there but has deleted himself.<p>It feels anti-civil to me, to put yourself in public, to participate in public activity, then to mask &amp; cloak &amp; hide all your activity after the fact. While platforms allow this, I think the civic world has an obligation to prevent you from doing this.<p>If you want to be non-interactable on the medium after time, I&#x27;d be ok with that. We can make affordances. But burning all the books is a bad thing. You are too important, too interesting, your contact with the world too notable to let you continually incinerate your online self.')
