This period of time is entirely within the afternoon, so writing it as 12:00 PM makes plenty of sense. This period of time is not &quot;noon&quot;, although that is when the period starts.<p>A digital clock, for example, shows the current period, and not an instant.<p>If you want to refer to the instant, you can use the words noon and midnight.')
