Most people do not like being on the receiving end of justified berating and will do almost anything to make it stop.  Sometimes starting off being an asshole and letting yourself be talked down creates a window for a quick agreement.  It’s not a nice way to deal with things and some people aren’t always comfortable being the “bad guy” but it is effective with certain personalities.<p>The most important part of this article is that the author was right and had proof.  The way in which he conducted himself was likely inconsequential but writing an article about being a dick and getting what you want won’t generate clicks.')
