Let&#x27;s say that a personal investigator is following you. They have a GPS tracker on you. They can see where you go, who you talk to, for how long, what you buy, etc. The only thing is that they don&#x27;t know <i>what</i> you are talking to people about or exactly what you buy (but they know where you bought it from). Would you feel comfortable with this person following you around?<p>I&#x27;m assuming not, because I don&#x27;t know anyone that has answered yes. It feels like an invasion of your personal space, right? They can still learn a lot about you and your habits by doing this, right? But all they&#x27;ve gathered is metadata on you. So why do you feel uncomfortable?')
