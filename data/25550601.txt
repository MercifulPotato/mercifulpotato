This is exactly the kind of situation that can branch out to completely different lives.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting contrast: the risk-taking choice into the unknown, or the comfortable but boring choice to stay.<p>If you choose to take the easy path, when you&#x27;re old you might look back and ask, &quot;Did I make the right choice? What kind of different life would I have had?&quot; Or, if things go well, you might be a satisfied person.<p>If you choose to go into the unknown, there is a chance that things will not work out better. Maybe you&#x27;ll have a more difficult life of struggle. Then you might wish that you had stayed in the comfortable but boring life you had.<p>&gt; good job, great house and extreme social security here - none of which I would have in my own country<p>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;d be risking for an unknown future..<p>I imagine people would recommend that you take the risk, take a chance to create a completely different life that&#x27;s more interesting. But, I also imagine that those same people would choose for themselves the comfortable path. From your story, I think you&#x27;ll regret it later in life if you don&#x27;t take the chance.')
