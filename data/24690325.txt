As if someone who is an &quot;html&#x2F;css&quot; designer isn&#x27;t a real developer. Yet at the same time we complain that we have to learn it. That after pretending it was trivial all this time, we&#x27;re annoyed that we can&#x27;t just fake our way through it when the going gets tough.<p>But the other reason it&#x27;s hard is that UI and clientdev is hard. There&#x27;s this weird meme that UI is just bells and whistles and stakeholder pleasers instead of a human interface that demands a lot of forethought and expertise, and something that has to be functional and possibly even a joy for the user to use. You can see this when people here brag about being backend developers that never touch the client as if that&#x27;s something to brag about.')
