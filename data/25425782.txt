This fantasy where you just have to give up your personal property for no good reason is just a fantasy. It&#x27;s not the way the law works. There will be a reason, it will be documented by a trail of papers and professional judges and attorneys will agree that it is fair.<p>If there is no paper trail saying that you are a beneficiary of human trafficking, you will not pay reparations. In order to understand this, you and also the justice system need to evolve to see the world more granularly than just &quot;race&quot;. Slaves had names, they had families, they had descendants. Those descendants have legal standing in the most basic sense: they have been deprived of property. Justice demands that those stolen assets be returned to the rightful, legal owners.<p>Forget &quot;resolving racism&quot;. That&#x27;s a red herring. Just return the stolen property to the rightful owners. That&#x27;s a much more concrete, actionable goal.<p>Edit: please post response instead of downvoting. Why should this comment disappear?')
