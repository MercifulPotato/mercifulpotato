USB boot is working properly in the newest Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu MATE Desktop images as well as the official Raspberry Pi OS.<p>The Samsung T5 and T7 are frighteningly fast USB-attached portable SSDs - some simple tests of mine had them at around 335MB&#x2F;s. On paper the T7 should be twice as fast, so it&#x27;s interesting that they tested so close (the T5 was even a little faster, as high as 350MB&#x2F;s), but they are both totally good enough.')
