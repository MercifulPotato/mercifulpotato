People with bad intentions don&#x27;t always do harm, any more than people with good intentions always do good.<p>As for actual outcomes, I don&#x27;t think the case is anywhere near as one-sided as you appear to believe. See below.<p><i>&gt; Fixing these issues, whether by government, tech industry, or otherwise, will involve some level of &quot;authoritarianism&quot;.</i><p>No, &quot;authoritarianism&quot; is what <i>caused</i> problems like your relatives&#x27; beliefs. That &quot;previous status quo of large centralized media groups&quot; did not just evaporate; it <i>killed itself</i> by throwing away whatever &quot;journalistic ethics and transparency&quot; it once had (and one can argue that it never had very much; it was just that before the Internet there were no alternate sources of information available so people could see how much politicians and the mainstream media were lying to them). Your relatives believe random Internet sources as much as NBC Nightly News <i>because they know NBC Nightly News will lie to them</i>--because NBC Nightly News, and all the other mainstream media outlets, killed their own credibility.<p>Why did they do that? Because they thought they were authorities and that the public would regard them as such--since before the Internet the public had done that, because the public had no choice. In other words, the mainstream media thought they had the authoritarian power to <i>declare what is true</i>, even if it&#x27;s actually a lie. They still think that; it&#x27;s just that the number of people who don&#x27;t treat them that way any more is much larger now, and will only continue to grow.')
