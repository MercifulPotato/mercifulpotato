The handful that need greater range or precision (or unlikely, both) can roll their own data structures or use a specialised one rather than needing to cater for that in the default.<p>You can always use floating point representations. It will give you great range and great precision, though not both at the same time (you can&#x27;t refer to a specific picosecond on a specific day 100,000 years from now).')
