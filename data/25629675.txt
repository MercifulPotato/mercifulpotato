That is, it&#x27;s mostly a positive externality &#x2F; public good.<p>You could ask the municipal government for pay for it, the way they pay for roads and other services, but then you&#x27;d have the problem of establishing some sort of worthiness standard to ensure the system isn&#x27;t just being taken advantage of. The determination of such a standard, besides being possibly unrealizable, would probably undermine the creative spirit it&#x27;s designed to foster.')
