Of course you don&#x27;t need to be a racist to vote for Trump, but you do need to fear the other options so much that you agree that his behavior and the way that he represents our country to the rest of the world is tolerable compared to what might come after him.<p>I was on the phone with my mom earlier and one of her friends called her up. She&#x27;s a republican, but they avoid politics. She asked her, genuinely afraid, if she thought that Harris would steal the presidency and convert the country to socialism. She&#x27;s not an idiot. She&#x27;s a physician, but was still so caught up in fear mongering that she genuinely believed that the government would steal her income and that there would be riots in the streets as we turn into a third world nation. I&#x27;m going to think about her differently after hearing that.<p>This is probably the first time in my life where I am going to look at people differently based on who they voted for and I hate that. However, I can&#x27;t get it out of my head that they voted for a president that has so disgraced the highest office in our country and that they did it because of a fear of the future burning so far inside them that they felt another four years of Trump was preferable to even as bland of a change as a Biden presidency will be.')
