Item(by='vaduz', descendants=None, kids=[25813024], score=None, time=1610885083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25808105, text='&gt; You seem to be implying that a company should not know what kind of web requests are coming from its computers.<p>Please point out where I made that claim.<p>All I am saying is that the way &quot;knowing what kind of web requests&quot; - and DNS request in this case - is achieved is by becoming a third party in supposedly two party encrypted communication. The company certainly has the authority to do so (check your local laws, though, as there are some exceptions) - but it is MitM in function and practice, if not in name. &quot;TLS inspection&quot; and &quot;data loss prevention&quot; are simply common euphemisms for the technique.<p>It&#x27;s also not new, MitM proxies and for that matter endpoint introspection (e.g. keyloggers at the user machine) have been in use for decades in the enterprise, and have been making their way into BYOD private machines as well via various MDM tooling.<p>Using your company DNS server as the grandparent has mentioned is not MitM.\nInspecting all traffic by all devices in your company to try to enforce the use of said DNS server requires MitM, though.')
