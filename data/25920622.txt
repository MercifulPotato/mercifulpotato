The AI was the search algorithm to find an effecient solution to the maze, not the mouse being able to navigate it later in a second run. The second run was just a demonstration of it having found  the solution demonstrating it&#x27;s intelligence. The actual intelligence was it&#x27;s first run through the maze. Almost any configuration of the maze could be solved using algorithms like depth first, breadth first and a star search (didn&#x27;t check which one the video demonstrates). Even though the algorithm was trivial it&#x27;s ability to be applied to problems of today is still extraordinary. Nerural networks being equally trivial algorithms capable of remarkable things. Id argue this is as much AI today as it was back then, just  more people know how Shannon performed this magic trick.')
