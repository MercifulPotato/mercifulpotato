I&#x27;ve seen this: a programmer has a genuine interest and passion for quality, but loses it over time due to a focus on doing (different) work that gets them promoted.<p>Code ownership (being required to &quot;own&quot; ones work along with the bugs &amp; maintenance burden that come with it) is one of the most valuable ways programmers learn. This needs to be balanced, as one runs the risk of having a bus factor of 1, but it&#x27;s still vital.')
