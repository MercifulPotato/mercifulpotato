As far as I can tell all the presets that are reachable without explicitly specifying a filter chain are just lzma2 with various options set.<p>I would love if xz had a zstd filter and a filter that adds&#x2F;processes some error correction code. But with what&#x27;s there right now I think it&#x27;s fair to treat it as a pure lzma2 container format.')
