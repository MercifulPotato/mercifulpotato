It wasn&#x27;t until the advent of quartz watches that you could find a solid watch (digital or analog) for under $100. Today, $20ish digital watches are fairly common on the market. One of my favorite watches is a cheap Timex Weekender (a favorite of &#x2F;r&#x2F;malefashionadvice IIRC).<p>Just like one might decide to go for a stylish (but cheap) quartz watch instead of that expensive automatic, one could decide to go for a stylish (but cheap) Wyze watch instead of that $300 Apple Watch. We&#x27;ll have to see if Wyze (or someone similar) can actually execute and pull that off.')
