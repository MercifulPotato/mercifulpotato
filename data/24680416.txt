There is little that is not justifiable so long as it serves that goal. In fact, more concern is afforded in the Talmud to the interests of other Jews who may be harmed by conflicting exploitation of goyim, than to the subjects themselves.<p>Of course this is taboo in the extreme by the standards of modern Western society, and of course I have no idea of the Sacklers&#x27; private convictions, but just as some may use their Bible as justification for their homophobia or the Koran for justification of their misogyny, some may well use the Talmud as justification for xenophobic sadism and exploitation - which includes the deceptive popularisation of opioids for extraordinary profits in spite of (or because of) the physical, spiritual and financial suffering of others.<p>[Some quotes for the uninitiated]\n&quot;An orthodox Jew is not bound to observe principles of morality towards people of other tribes. He may act contrary to morality, if profitable to himself or to Jews in general.&quot; Zohar, Vayshlah 177b<p>&quot;On the house of the Goy one looks as on the fold of cattle.&quot; Mas. Shabbath 31b<p>&quot;The non-Jew is consequently an animal in human form, and condemned to serve the Jew day and night.&quot; Zohar, Shemoth, Toldoth Noah, Lekh-Lekha<p>Sanhedrin 58b provides that Jews may not be held responsible for the deaths of non-Jews.')
