The lowest bug rates I&#x27;ve seen are where everybody cares about quality.<p>On the flip side, I get nervous when I hear something akin to &quot;We don&#x27;t have QA here&quot;, sometimes as a matter of pride. Think of those times when you&#x27;ve heard someone snear at &quot;Safety First&quot;, but for QA or testing.<p>Perhaps one ideal would be to promote a &quot;everyone cares about quality&quot; environment whilst still having some people focused specifically on QA.')
