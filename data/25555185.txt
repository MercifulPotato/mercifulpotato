I was on the fence about whether or not to put up the source code— I&#x27;m _glad_ I did!<p>I&#x27;m glad you did, thank you for that! Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not claiming that any of my modifications actually help, there&#x27;s too much randomness introduced by local minima, and I only did a few training runs. Unbiased Sinkhorn is fancier than Chamfer, but who knows if it&#x27;s better or not for this use case. Starting from a much higher learning rate did speed up convergence, though.<p>Re point cloud distance, there&#x27;s lots of good stuff referenced in the GeomLoss documentation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel-operations.io&#x2F;geomloss&#x2F;api&#x2F;geomloss.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel-operations.io&#x2F;geomloss&#x2F;api&#x2F;geomloss.html</a> , for example the author&#x27;s GTTI 2019 slides are an excellent overview. For a very deep dive into Optimal Transport there is Computational Optimal Transport by Peyré and Cuturi: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.00567" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.00567</a> . Note: these mention MMD and Hausdorff, but it&#x27;s all very Optimal Transport centric.')
