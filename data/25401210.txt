Item(by='sameers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607803774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400697, text='&gt; True but with the Analytic &#x2F; Continental divide in philosophy you still get a lot of folks on the Analytic side of things who think that anything not quantifiable in the way that they are used to is bunk.<p>I am glad you pointed that out. Anecdotally, I have found that &quot;philosophy&quot; to many in the tech industry when used perjoratively means Continental vs Analytic philosophy. Plus, even with analytic philosophy, when people recognize it as the sort of thing that Russell and his lineage worked on, they don&#x27;t really get what these philosophers &quot;cared about&quot; - that it mattered to them if mathematical symbolism expressed truths about the Universe in a metaphysical sense. They weren&#x27;t just manipulating symbols to prove consistency etc.<p>To me, Wittgenstein&#x27;s concerns portray the bridge between the two major schools (well, naturally, he was a European who chose to go study under Russell, the Englishman) very well. He cared about the formalism, but he also cared that it made sense in terms of finding meaning in the world.<p>Somehow, it&#x27;s the latter struggle that seems to pass by unnoticed when &quot;techie people&quot; (to generalize) think of the work of philosophers.')
