He&#x27;s learning these lessons the hard way.   <i>If</i> you can survive the lesson, it&#x27;s the best way to learn them.  Little consolation to those who buy the lemons during the learning period, though.<p>This is also a tale about America.   Tesla&#x27;s Chinese factory gets first place on a similar survey to the JD Powers initial quality survey that Tesla America got last place in.   America just doesn&#x27;t have the deep well of manufacturing knowledge that a new company like Tesla can draw on.')
