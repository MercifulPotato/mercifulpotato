It does not have &quot;complete uncertainty at the quantum scale&quot;. The probabilistic aspect only comes into play when you cast a quantum state down to a classical observable quantity like position or momentum.<p>You may have missed the subtle but important aspect of the uncertainty principle. It is not the case that there is a true underlying value of position and momentum for which the error bars are limited by quirk of theory. It is more like you expect to be able to observe 2 bytes of position information and 2 bytes of momentum information but the underlying quantum state is defined by 2 bytes in total. The full 4 bytes cannot fit inside 2 bytes. You can have a state which encodes the 2 bytes of position information but no momentum information, a state which encodes 1 byte of each, a state which encodes 2 bytes of momentum information but no position information, and everything in between. The uncertainty principle is actually a non-existence principle. When the position information exists the momentum information isn&#x27;t uncertain, it just outright doesn&#x27;t exist.')
