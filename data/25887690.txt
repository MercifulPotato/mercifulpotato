Forever immortalising &quot;The Times 03&#x2F;Jan&#x2F;2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&quot; just as a reminder of why they were doing what they did [0].<p>We don&#x27;t need better regulation. We need, when financial firms muck up on a global scale, to replace the people who run those firms with different people. There is an easy way to do that, let them go broke.<p>The biggest problem in the room is that the regulators have bought in to the idea that some companies are &quot;too big to fail&quot;. That is a stupid idea, fundamentally unfair, completely throwing out the best part of capitalism which is that recognised idiots aren&#x27;t allowed to be in charge. That problem will certainly not be solved by giving the regulators more power.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genesis_block" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genesis_block</a>')
