I assume based on everything you&#x27;re written that there was a time, perhaps working at the bank, where you were just like me or anyone else... Working, dissatisfied, looking for more...<p>What changed?<p>What sparked the transition?<p>I admire your conviction but at the same time, it&#x27;s yours.  You&#x27;ll never be able to just say those things and convey the same power that it has on you.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Instead, maybe, you can explain to someone how you got there.  How did you come to these convictions?  How did you become a person who believes in a higher power who has good intentions and is always watching?  For some of us, that sounds more like an acid trip than reality - yet I&#x27;m open minded.<p>In my case I&#x27;m comfortable.  Very comfortable.  Maybe even too comfortable.  I want more in life, and I chase happiness like a carrot on a stick.  I guess you could say I&#x27;m having a mid life crisis my entire life.  I can perform exceptionally well when I am inspired, but being inspired is a transient state.  I&#x27;d love to find peace with my situation, and be inspired to work hard, and work well.')
