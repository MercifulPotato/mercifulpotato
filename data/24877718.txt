I maintain the HyperCard Online project, a collection[1] of over 3,500 HyperCard stacks on the Internet Archive directly emulated in-the-browser.<p>I&#x27;ve made an uploader[2] that anyone can use to contribute their own stacks to the collection. It accepts all formats of stacks (all the .sit, .bin, .hqx-style compression formats that were common in the 80s&#x2F;90s, disk images, and just raw HyperCard stacks).<p>It&#x27;s always great to see what stacks folks are uploading - recently a large number of Japanese stacks were uploaded, covering a wide range of topics.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;hypercardstacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;hypercardstacks</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercardonline.tk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hypercardonline.tk&#x2F;</a>')
