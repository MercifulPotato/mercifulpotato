There is a difference.<p>Individuals like Jay Gould crossed the lines to get his way (attempted kidnapping? bribery?).<p>While others Russell Sage never gave his money for philanthropy (in his case, it was his second wife after he died).<p>Likewise, John Osgood’s life was all about trying to make more money before he croaked.<p>George Pullman, who controlled his own town and controlled the postal mail, prevented mail for his town from getting the through (it built up to rioting and striking).<p>In fact virtually all were against unionization, though they took different approaches to head it off.
