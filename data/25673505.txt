You, and CNN, and others are throwing around words like treason, sedition, insurrection, terrorist.  You are not talking about a few thousand people.  You are talking about tens of millions of people.  You are instigating hate.  I know you don&#x27;t understand the scale of what you&#x27;re dealing with.  But if you keep up the words things are only going to get worse over the next six months.  And you are going to wake up after six months of uni-party rule and they are going to do some things you don&#x27;t like.  Conveniently you are going to forget your instigation and words you spoke but no one will be there for you.')
