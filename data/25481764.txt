I don&#x27;t believe every article the NyTimes puts out despite agreeing with other, particular articles they publish. Overall I&#x27;d rank &#x27;line of underwater rocks&#x27; pretty low amongst the sensational claims that can&#x27;t be backed up with evidence. Surely this is more worth questioning directly rather than beating through the bush of questioning the publisher&#x27;s reputation?<p>After all, if the article <i>is</i> valid it would boost the other article&#x27;s validity. At least, by <i>your</i> reasoning of looking to institutional trust rather than the to the substance of the article itself. Personally, that seems silly and not worth the effort.')
