It should not care where the state is, and most importantly it should not handle the state itself.</i><p>This is nice in theory, but in any non-trivial application, a huge amount of state exists just to support the view. It actually makes sense to keep the view stateful and it&#x27;s counter-productive to further segregate view-specific state.<p>You can still keep large parts of your UI functional, but the idea that your whole UI should be a function from state to view seems misguided.')
