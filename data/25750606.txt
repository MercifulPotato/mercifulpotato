In the US, I think it&#x27;s only the Cavendish and maybe Plantain that are commonly seen in the markets. When people say &#x27;buy banana&#x27; in the states, we know it&#x27;s to buy cavendish. But in my home country, when I asked my mother to buy banana when she goes shopping, I had to tell her what specific kind.<p>I truly miss the variety of food and vegetables available in my home country. In the US, I will have to be rich to afford such variety of food and even then, I might not be able to access them immediately&#x2F;fresh. I guess that&#x27;s the price we pay for efficiency in the developed world (of food production which is more or less monoculture and corporatized).')
