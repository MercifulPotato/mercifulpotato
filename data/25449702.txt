They might have to shift funding from other areas or raise taxes in order to do so.<p>But they don&#x27;t have the money to do so.  Plans like that require deficit spending, which the federal government can do  but the states can&#x27;t.<p>Your alternative suggestions are not serious ideas. Do you really think the states could find the money to pay people to stay home by levying taxes on basically those same payments?')
