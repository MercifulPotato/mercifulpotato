Even MacOS doesn&#x27;t follow their human interface guidelines. The butterfly keyboards really are sensitive to dirt, it&#x27;s a problem. The touchbar is bad, it&#x27;s really bad. MacOS does not have much of a lead over windows in terms of usability, and is much worse at multitasking (not at a technical level, at a UI level.) The obsession with thinness is a bit much, and they have pushed it to the point where they have compromised internal reliability and build quality and cut off ports and useful features for millimeters no one cares about.
