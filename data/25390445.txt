I have never thought that Show HNs get more votes by default (look at the Show HNs in my history, you&#x27;ll see they got absolutely nowhere), and was not trying to game the system.<p>&gt; More significantly though, this doesn&#x27;t feel very on topic for HN<p>I thought that this was mostly determined by whether or not the HN community upvotes a link. I personally do think there&#x27;s a role for (perhaps infrequent) satire about certain quite cringe-inducing types of articles you get here. I saw a similar piece the other day - can&#x27;t recall the link though.')
