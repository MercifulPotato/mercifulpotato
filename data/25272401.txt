This is mostly an append-only workload, however Maven updates maven-metadata.xml files in place. These files contain info about what versions exist, when they were updated, what the latest snapshot version is, etc. We would see issues where a Maven build publishes to S3, and then a downstream build would read an out-of-date maven-metadata.xml and blow up. Or worse, it could silently use an older build and cause a nasty surprise when you deploy. It only happened a small percentage of the time, but when youâ€™re doing tens of thousands of builds per day it ends up happening every day.<p>We switched to GCS for our Maven artifacts and the problem went away.')
