I&#x27;m at a company that had a rather detailed negative article written about us, and we were warned about it internally shortly before it was published, after the reporter had contacted us with details and questions. However, we didn&#x27;t go public with a reaction until after it was out, since it seemed rather pointless to respond to something that hadn&#x27;t been published yet, especially when we hadn&#x27;t even seen it in full.<p>It is odd to me that they would preemptively go loud on this, drawing attention to a story that might not even get that much traction. It seems like it would have been much easier to just let that story go out and respond with a simple &quot;We&#x27;ve investigated this before and dispute the claims, except for these few unfortunate stories we can confirm happened, and here&#x27;s how we will prevent them in the future.&quot; What on earth do they gain with a preemptive memo like this? Are they really scared of their employees leaking this? Would anyone even pick up a story of &quot;someone&#x27;s about to publish a bad article about Coinbase&quot;?')
