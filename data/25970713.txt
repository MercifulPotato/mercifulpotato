If you think it&#x27;s bullshit, too, here&#x27;s how you could do something about it.&quot; such a questionable thing to say and do?<p>Do you also want cancer charities to stop asking for donations? Should start up founders not be allowed to ask for investor money?<p>I could totally see the market manipulation argument if this was done in backrooms, with multiple accounts to hide the moves, several shell corporations holding the funds, etc. But these folks are publicly declaring their intent. And the first person to uncover the gamestop shorts has been saying it for over a year. Out in the open with frequent updates.<p>The short sellers have had a year to get out and leave the company alone, but they were so obsessed with watching a company die that people got pissed and wanted some blood.<p>The chain of events doesn&#x27;t start with &quot;we buy a lot and blah blah blah&quot; - the chain of events starts with someone declaring over a year ago &quot;fuck these guys for going all in on destroying a quality company for no reason other than the lulz.&quot;')
