The per-axle figure is the relevant one and would probably flatten that figure out quite a bit.<p>They are also much more stringently enforced on commercial transportation vehicles,  which require annual inspections and serious preventative maintenance to pass which does already add to the cost of operating these vehicles.<p>Their per-mile consumption is higher as well,  which aside from being bad for the environment,  already means they are consuming much more fuel and paying a higher tax as it is.<p>&gt; tax all gas burning cars for the lung cancer and other negative externalities they cause.<p>Transportation,  on the whole,  accounts for 28% of greenhouse gasses...  but it also enables the society that we live in and our own personal mobility within it.  Electricity is nearly the same at 27%.  You can shift the source,  but you cant eliminate greenhouse gas from our way of life.')
