But Apple also makes IPads which are kind of a bridge device - mobile and battery-powered, but also big and something people might want to do real work on.<p>Iâ€™m also going to say that I think Apple is still alone among the phone manufacturers in recognizing that smartphones are software platforms, not simply hardware devices. I think they have a special appreciation for the enabling power of a more capable CPU.')
