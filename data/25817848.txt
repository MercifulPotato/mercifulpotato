If they keep on opening up bulk tranches of the population (instead of in small slices) before people of priority are reached, when will the most vulnerable ever get their turn?<p>This is a known problem.  Multiple queues of priority and people on call to be given turns the next day if it looks like there&#x27;s capacity.<p>Instead you have people wondering if they should walk in, visit a county next door, or wait around in case some mistake is made and there are actually extra doses at the end of a day.  Or try to scheme&#x2F;figure out the system however they can, out of desperation.<p>If it can&#x27;t be done right, let everyone know that it&#x27;s up to their willingness to wait wherever they can, according to some basic ground rules, and don&#x27;t make a meaningless (or worse, deceptive) reservations system that gets bypassed at the last minute.<p>What a shameful clusterfuck.')
