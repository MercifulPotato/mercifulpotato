I was pulling tower location data for LEO regularly at request of corporate legal only. Though sometimes LEO would try to end run around and go to stores who would contact me.<p>I socially engineered them to believe I could not access that info without a code generated by corp legal.<p>Not true, of course. But hell if I was going to risk being mired in a legal fiasco for a possibly immoral investigator.<p>Tracking of our cellphones has been a thing since well before smartphones. Smartphones just enable it to be real time, and more granular than a tower triangulation.')
