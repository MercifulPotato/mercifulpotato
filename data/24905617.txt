However, I personally would never learn it this way--I prefer Spivak, during my read through I learned more than I could ever learn in a class.<p>It&#x27;s also my belief that most people aren&#x27;t like me in the sense that they learn from example first. However, most people I know are like me so it&#x27;s hard to realize how needed a textbook like this is and how huge it could be for the regular person to learn something like this.')
