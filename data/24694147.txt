For instance grand theft in the US is generally a 1000 dollars, but those laws don&#x27;t account for inflation. Most these grand theft laws also were written in the 20&#x27;s.<p>So stealing same thing today could be felony, but would have only been a misdemeanor when the law was written. So re-basing also helps ensures certain statues and laws remain just. You could argue that law makers should go through old laws or account for inflation to start with, but sadly that is not the reality. Tons of laws get written with fixed monetary units.')
