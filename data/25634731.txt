I can find similarities between him and D&#x27;Angelo: both of them do not really fit the frame they&#x27;ve born into. Both of them try to get out from that frame.<p>The whole season 2 is about how people turn into criminals and why. This time it happens to white working class men and this is one of the reasons I find the second season essential.')
