Phone A has a battery that can supply 5 watts brand new, and phone B has a battery that can supply 10 watts brand new.<p>It&#x27;s true that phone A is &quot;getting the most out of new batteries&quot;, and phone B isn&#x27;t.  But phone B isn&#x27;t &quot;limiting itself to the performance of an old battery&quot;.  The 5 watt limit is there for efficiency and heat reasons, and it just so happens that the battery is never the limiting factor.')
