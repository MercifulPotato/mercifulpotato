Last winter I was driving back home from town and the weather flipped on a dime. Ended up in white-out conditions on a windy mountain road. Luckily a police car had their lights on pulled over on the side of the road. We pulled over behind them and waited it out. It was the scariest drive I’ve ever done and I drive that road every day.')
