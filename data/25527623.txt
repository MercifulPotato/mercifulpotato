Well I live in Maryland and I&#x27;m not sure what a &quot;Baltimore accent&quot; is, so I&#x27;m just assuming she is referring to AAVE? I mean, sure, there are a few words people from Baltimore pronounce slightly differently (like &quot;water&quot;) but... hardly enough to call it it&#x27;s own accent or a disability.<p>This is yet another he-said she-said story that is impossible to judge for ourselves and stokes racial outrage...')
