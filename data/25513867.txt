At the two year mark (which is in January) I&#x27;m fairly sure that it won&#x27;t ever be required for any kind of behavioral reasons. It hasn&#x27;t always been perfect and I know at times things would be easier if I HAD neutered him.<p>I also didn&#x27;t choose the easiest breed, he is a purebred Parson Russel Terrier<p>&gt; The whole practice feels archaic and somewhat cruel<p>I&#x27;m not sure its archaic or cruel. For virtually all rescued animals, it&#x27;s the best path.<p>&gt; I wonder how much of it is societal&#x2F;vet pressure rather than in the best interest of the dog&#x2F;owner<p>1000% social and vet pressure. In my circle of dog people, who are more conscious than most, being a part of dog agility&#x2F;sports, I still have people who get hostile when I say that I don&#x27;t intend to neuter him unless it&#x27;s absolutely required. They insist his behaviour will turn foul. At first &quot;no way he doesn&#x27;t become a terror by 1 year old&quot;, recently &quot;wait till he&#x27;s 2,&quot; soon I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll hear about how awful having an uncastrated 3-year-old will be.<p>The pressure from my veterinarian was INSANE. Keep in mind this is a vet practice I&#x27;ve been using for over THIRTY years, I&#x27;ve had 9 dogs and 1 cat under their care. The owner&#x2F;veterinarian who I&#x27;ve known all that time and is a close family friend was strongly in favor. Her associate who I see now as the owner is transitioning out of practice (I&#x27;ve been there that long!) was nearly hostile about my decision and flat-out told me I was wrong and tried to fear-monger me about how I wouldn&#x27;t be able to control him.<p>&gt; I understand why people do it<p>I, too, understand why people do it. It was hard work. It required lots of careful planning to find a dog with the right temperament. It STILL requires lots more work than if I just got him snipped. I will still do it again. It&#x27;s not for everyone.')
