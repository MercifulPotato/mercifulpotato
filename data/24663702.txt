In fact worse: It <i>competes</i> with Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary formats.<p>Microsoft would like everyone to be sending data to one another using xlsx, but not so much that they&#x27;ll make generation&#x2F;processing libraries and tooling free cross-platform, just enough to sabotage everything that isn&#x27;t that.<p>Microsoft made these decisions during their &quot;evil&quot; years, and never back-tracked. So regardless that CSV is used in multiple industries for data exchange (e.g. financial, order&#x2F;invoicing, scientific, etc) they&#x27;ll just keep on corrupting them until you use what they want you to use.')
