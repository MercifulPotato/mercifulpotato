I&#x27;m not sure why a newer Mac with better CPU options is going to result in increasing Linux share. If anything, it&#x27;s likely to be neutral or favor the Mac with it&#x27;s newer&#x2F; faster CPU.<p>&gt; But frankly I believe Apple have lost ground UI-wise over the intervening decades, while free alternatives have gained it (they are still not at parity, granted).<p>Maybe? I&#x27;m not as sold on Linux gaining a ton of ground here. I&#x27;m also not sold on the idea that the Mac as a whole is worse off interface wise than it was 10 years ago. While there are some issues, there are also places where it&#x27;s significantly improved as well. Particularly if you have an iPhone and use Apple&#x27;s other services.')
