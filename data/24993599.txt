If those costs go up they aren&#x27;t in business (e.g.demand elasticity of price will kill them).<p>So they aren&#x27;t pushing this as a &#x27;I have leverage&#x27; play.  It&#x27;s an existential issue for them.  They cannot exist with the labor prices demanded by the AB5.<p>If they cannot make their margin, they go out of business and then there is no more ride share business.  Then the existing jobs go away.  And this is the point of my comment.   These jobs only exist with low wages.  Raise the wages and the jobs go away because the business becomes unprofitable and exits.')
