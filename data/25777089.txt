I am saving but probably 60% of my &quot;retirement  savings&quot; are mandatory payments (payroll taxes effectively) and if I save nothing at all, I&#x27;ll still have a low-but-liveable pension. The last 40% of my pension or so is what I&#x27;m saving for, so basically it&#x27;s the &quot;extra&quot;. It&#x27;s not nearly as much as you&#x27;d have to save in a country where you have to fund your whole retirement.<p>Also I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll want to retire very soon which helps the calculation. Saving durig a 50 year career to live 10-15 years is very different from saving for a 40 year career to be retired 20-25 years. I&#x27;m hoping to work to at least 70 or longer and that makes a huge difference too. I some times hear US devs talking about wanting to retire at 55 or 60 - which I&#x27;d want too if I didn&#x27;t have summer off every year!')
