If you want more formatting for your article, your Gemini site can just link to a TeX or PDF or whatever you like; Gemini can download files, they&#x27;re just expected to display in a different application.<p>I like your ideas around Bittorrent and would love to see a system combining podcast-style RSS feeds and Bittorrent to enable decentralized video subscriptions. If we can get those RSS feeds onto some easy to find IPFS location, then we&#x27;re set to replace Youtube as long as the famed Network Effect can be harnessed.<p>&gt; Imagine Napster &#x2F; Bittorrent for news. Shared p2p. That would be amazing. There&#x27;s no HTML to enforce presentation rules. Your client can represent the content any way you want.<p>Ultimately just re-inventing Usenet here; might make sense to just head back into the land of Usenet and start actually using the big network of providers that are already set up well to defend themselves from DMCA claims and other takedowns.<p>&gt; The signal is in the text and media content. Not the HTML&#x2F;JS shell it comes wrapped in.<p>Time was we had a healthy competition in desktop clients for Usenet, mail, etc. that would use common protocols but differentiate themselves on usability and feature set.<p>We see the shadow of that with website-specific clients (I use Hackers and Apollo on iOS, for example) that provide more functionality or a better look-n-feel on different form factors - but they&#x27;re specific to a website, and while Reddit allows community creation, it&#x27;s not the same as something actually decentralized, as is evidenced by their insane level of censorship lately (i.e. banning entire communities that aren&#x27;t breaking the law just because they disagree with their political opinions).<p>&gt; Or maybe it should be completely free from monetization attempts.<p>Eh. I&#x27;d like to see a standardized section of document metadata that is able to include links to donations; make it super easy for me to click a button and donate 25 cents worth of BTC to someone and I will click it all the time.<p>&gt; Comments and upvotes could flow like email, completely distributed. They&#x27;d be cryptographically signed to prevent spoofing, and you could curate your own peer group.<p>I&#x27;d really like to see an easy way of querying Usenet for comment threads about a topic, and then on any page I am visiting, I should be able to see comments by group, so as to pick the &quot;comment section&quot; that I want rather than just one shared one that isn&#x27;t to anyone&#x27;s liking. Gab&#x27;s Dissenter provided an early vision of this: a meta-commentary mechanism not linked to the website in question.<p>Plenty of other things (NZB indexers) have built stuff on top of Usenet using it merely as a distributed, sharded datastore. There&#x27;s precedent here.')
