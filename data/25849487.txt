Item(by='jkingsbery', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611165165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833557, text='I know Visual Basic gets a bad rap, but as a learning language it had an interesting feature, `Option Base`. By putting `Option Base` in a module, it changed how the indexing of arrays worked. It defaulted to 0, but for some applications (and also, when you&#x27;re first learning), 1 can be convenient.<p>Of course, there are problems with this in a professional setting, such as how do you enforce uniformity across modules, and what happens if you copy code from one module that&#x27;s Base 0 to one that&#x27;s Base 1 and vice versa. But when I was first learning how to program, it was helpful to me to have a language that allowed for some choice.<p>In the meantime, 23 years of programming have led me to believe that index base 0 makes sense. For many applications it&#x27;s moot, because we should be using higher level functions (like map and reduce) for processing lists. In every other application (such as working with data on a grid), dealing with offsets does make things easier.<p>Perhaps the convention is arbitrary. But, lots of industries have arbitrary conventions that we all agree on just to aid communication, and I disagree with the original author that the term &quot;groupthink&quot; applies in this situation.')
