Conspiracy theories used to be fringe content that one had to make an effort to seek out.<p>The biggest problem facing society today is the complete lack of discourse across segments of the population.  The filter bubble exacerbates this.  It the tech platforms were to sprinkle in even just a little bit of content from outside of one&#x27;s filter bubble, there would be a benefit to society.  Just look at the platforms of old (broadcasting, newspapers): you could only target general populations.  Today&#x27;s platforms can target across so many variables there is no need to publish content that&#x27;s generally acceptable when you can limit its viewing to those that your algorithm has determined can be easily manipulated.  Maximum effect, minimum cost.')
