Item(by='esaym', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605377734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091414, text='My memory is fuzzy (used to do sheet metal repair for L3 and Boeing), but I&#x27;m pretty sure the FAA requires nearly everything to be &quot;American&quot;. This means pilots must speak English and all aircraft hardware is of the AN (army-navy) or NAS (National Aerospace Standard) standard.<p>Hardware is always in English units (inches). In this case, the #8 screw (5&#x2F;32&quot;) was used in place of a #10 (3&#x2F;16&quot;) screw. Side by side, the size difference is obvious. Trying to judge the screw size by looking at the hole is not so obvious and a #8 screw will sort of cross-thread into a #10 hole because aircraft female threads are &quot;interference fit&quot; by (at least) about .001&quot; so screws and bolts won&#x27;t vibrate loose. I&#x27;ve made the mistake before but if you are paying attention, you&#x27;ll know you got the wrong screw just by how sloppy it goes into the hole. That and #8 screws are only used on mostly non-critical stuff. If you were to take every screw,rivet, and bolt on a plane, 90% would probably be 3&#x2F;16&quot; in diameter.')
