That it is continually brought up to the point that you&#x27;re bringing it up in advance in attempt to dismiss it means it&#x27;s so <i>much</i> of a problem that it shouldn&#x27;t be dismissed.<p>The branding is just wrong. No, it&#x27;s not an &#x27;iPad Pro&#x27;, if I can&#x27;t run &#x27;Logic Pro&#x27;, Apple&#x27;s own &#x27;Pro&#x27; software on it. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;MacBook Pro&#x27;, if it has the same goddamn SOC as the MacBook Air. (You can order an Air with the identical 8-core processor as the Pro)<p>A consumer could <i>easily</i> make the mistake of buying an iPad Pro, reasonably thinking it could run Logic Pro, only to find out that it can&#x27;t.')
