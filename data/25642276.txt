By definition, it is completely impossible for everyone to become an entrepreneur, even in fields such as SaaS - as soon as it can be expected that competition will require you to scale to a level where you need one subordinate person to work for you.<p>Also, barrier to entry is a term that is also an artefact of the 19th century.
