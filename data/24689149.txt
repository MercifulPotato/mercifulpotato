My experience has been that after establishing a baseline of trust (by delivering on goals, making good technical decisions, behaving honestly and ethically, etc.), my company and manager are happy to give me a lot of latitude to choose what I work on.<p>Being one of our founding engineers, I have several times identified a need and implemented a solution without &quot;seeking permission&quot; first. When I do want more formal company backing to pursue a project, a conversation with my manager or an email or a one-page Google Doc all sound easier than writing and submitting a grant proposal.<p>As our company has grown, I have seen my role change, and I have collaborated with my manager to determine a new direction and title for myself. Notably, I tried management for a while, and I ultimately decided to return to an individual contributor role (no direct reports). It didn&#x27;t sound like Dr. Fratantonio had the option to stop mentoring other PhD candidates.<p>Freedom is not exclusive to founding engineers. Our company has a prioritized list of features available for development, and devs have a big role in choosing the next feature they work on, even when it&#x27;s not a current area of expertise. Established engineers and new hires alike have a lot of latitude to pick technologies, architect a solution to a problem, implement a novel algorithm, etc. One relatively junior new hire is embarking on a project to rewrite much of our frontend code, with support from all of us.<p>Again, that&#x27;s why I commented. Depending on what type of freedom you&#x27;re seeking, industry may offer it and pay better and have better working conditions to boot.')
