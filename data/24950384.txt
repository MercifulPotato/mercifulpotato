In this world, everyone runs around nearly naked under a tropical sun and people with Pale Skin Disorder are constantly sunburned to the point of peeling and routinely die at very young ages of malignant skin cancer.<p>There&#x27;s really a simple fix: Acting like being Caucasian is normal and covering up when out in the sun is normal etc. But not only will no one think of that solution if you view the issue as Pale Skin Disorder, the possibility that this fixes the problem will be actively and openly mocked while people decry what an inordinate burden it is to expect people to wear long sleeves and how desperately important it is to find a genetic intervention -- and never mind that genetic treatments are still new enough that we don&#x27;t really know how awful the unintended side effects might be but we can guess &quot;probably pretty freaking bad, to be honest.&quot;')
