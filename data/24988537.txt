My opinion has been and continue to be that to deal with the crisis, we would need to roughly double our money supply, and use that to prevent structural damage during shutdowns.<p>The alternative would have been to delay all fixed obligations -- loans, mortgages, etc. -- by the duration of the shutdown. No interest accrues for some number of months.<p>Those both would have required coordinated, thoughtful efforts. Neither of those happened, so hyperinflation is certainly possible at this point, as is economic collapse.<p>We&#x27;ll see!')
