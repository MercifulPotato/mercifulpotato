This differentiates it, ideally, from e.g. processes to find solutions to problems that have different kinds of approaches depending on your political outlook.<p>Someone who says that any discussion of e.g. energy policy is &quot;political&quot; is just being stupid. Someone who points out that someone is taking a particular position w.r.t e.g energy policy purely as a cynical political move might be right.')
