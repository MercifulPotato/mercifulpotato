Just use cryptography to randomly distribute your device local prefix across that of the entire network.<p>For example (there&#x27;s almost certainly a better way to do this), distribute a shared key when you assign device local prefixes via DHCP. To get a new address, allocate from the local prefix, encrypt with the shared key, and (slight hand waving here) map back into the network prefix. This will produce a pseudorandom distribution that is guaranteed not to overlap other devices (that use the same shared key OFC).<p>Depending on how downstream software made use of it, you might actually end up with <i>better</i> privacy characteristics than NAT. For example, an IPv6 address per browser tab mixed across multiple devices means that an adversary now has to do some amount of work just to reconstruct the range of the prefix that&#x27;s being shared (where before NAT gave this information to them more or less for free).')
