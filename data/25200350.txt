Item(by='ComputerGuru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606237387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200320, text='<i>Yes, &quot;with rust&quot; in the title is HN clickbait.</i><p>This release was motivated by a recent HN thread [0] where I shared the solution I came up with for myself [1] and learned a number of other people had similar problems with the forced move to libinput. I added configuration file support (instead of hard-coded commands in the rust source code) and some basic literature, packaged it up, and released it under the MIT license.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24700537" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24700537</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24702106" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24702106</a>')
