Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=[24782609], score=None, time=1602692673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24778328, text='&gt; It seems like unfortunate timing - Facebook&#x27;s cracking down on fake accounts before the election right as the Quest 2 launches.<p>No, this isn&#x27;t new, more people are just seeing it now since they just expanded the market of users.<p>It has been like this for years: If you go out of your way to create an account disconnected from a social graph so that it doesn&#x27;t creepily alert people that would have saved your number&#x2F;email and uploaded all their contacts in the past, Facebook will ban the account within 10 minutes.<p>Somebody&#x27;s inevitable rebuttal: &quot;Yeah but my grandma just made an account and didn&#x27;t get banned&quot;<p>Okay, good for you. The described reality here is also valid.<p>To make it not ban the account you can upload a contact photo and try to friend request multiple people in a social graph. The time limit is very short and you will otherwise very quickly get instabanned or stuck in a security verification loop where the verification never comes.<p>This is just creepy Facebook behavior for their data mining operation, now masquaraded as &quot;ensuring quality of accounts&quot;. This is the same behavior as when they use insecure SMS one time passwords instead of client side code generation, and then use that phone number to add it to the social graph.<p>Their behavior is very consistent and there is no one individual there responsible for it and even understands the use case.<p>In this case, this is just another byproduct of Facebook employees living in the warped reality where everyone loves the Facebook product and has it. They honestly believe it there and you should see how confused and affronted they will act when you tell them you don&#x27;t have an account.<p>This is just a byproduct of that sentiment.')
