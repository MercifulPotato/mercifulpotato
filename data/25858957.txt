Just this small detail can add so much memorability to a character who may have been relatively minor otherwise. Like Inigo Skimmer&#x27;s regular &quot;mmh-mmph&quot; in The Fifth Elephant which could be a sarcastic snigger or a nervous laugh and to some degree it is left up to the imagination of the reader to interpret it based. It somehow makes the character relatable and realistic.')
