Nearly 40 cities and towns throughout the state have adopted ordinances mandating all-electric appliances in new residential buildings, with San Francisco among the most recent to do so.<p>Good luck trying that in Europe, where gas price is a fraction of electricity (~6ct &#x2F; kWh vs ~30ct &#x2F; kWh). Additionally, using electricity for heating is <i>madness</i> - essentially the generator plant burns stuff to turn water into steam that rotates a generator, then there are transmission losses, and only then it&#x27;s finally converted to heat. A gas flame is as direct an energy-to-heat transmission as it gets (although there <i>are</i> some losses here too, for compression stations).<p>I&#x27;m paying 60€ a month for gas for both the heating and the stove in a ~60 m2 apartment, and 70€ in electricity. My direct neighbors who have electric heating and stove pay over 200€.<p>Regarding the pollutant issue: <i>open your windows while cooking</i>, get a CO alarm and have your water heater regularly cleaned and inspected. That&#x27;s basic life advice, and the latter is actually mandated by law in Germany.')
