You write: &quot;Elements of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are sets of real numbers.&quot; That is an incorrect definition.<p>- It is inaccurate because n doesn&#x27;t enter into the definition (and thus all Euclidean spaces would be the same).<p>- You want ordered n-tuples, not sets. If you actually defined elements of R^n as sets of n real numbers, you would not be able to represent the diagonal (or, if you fix that, not be able to represent the difference between certain points on the diagonal of R^n and certain points on the diagonal of certain subspaces).<p>Moreover, figure 5 talks about &quot;overlapping vectors&quot;. This is highly non-standard, and definitely would need to be defined.<p>Further, you&#x27;re setting your readers up for trouble by defining vector arithmetic in terms of bases.')
