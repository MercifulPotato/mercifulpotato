Not remotely higher fidelity than FM or CD quality audio. But I&#x27;ve A&#x2F;B tested songs I know inside and out on the same equipment using both vinyl and 320 kbps mp3 and I can hear the difference night and day.<p>But the main reason I listen to it is not that it&#x27;s better than Spotify, but that it&#x27;s a physically beautiful medium with artwork and is still high quality while promoting active, intimate listening.')
