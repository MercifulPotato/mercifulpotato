While I am not a huge fan of Java, if I owned a company, I would probably be more likely to use a JVM language (probably Clojure) than I would to use something like Haskell or Idris, precisely for the reasons you&#x27;ve discussed.<p>My overall point, though, is that often times languages themselves lag behind the state-of-the-art; there&#x27;s been a lot of progress made in language design, and Java (and a lot of other languages) can feel crufty in the process.  Sometimes the wheel really does need to be reinvented...if we could somehow convince the entire industry to use Lisp, this would (arguably) be a non-issue, since they allow you to abuse macros relatively easily and add language features (see CLOS or core.async for examples), but Lisp hasn&#x27;t really taken over the world like I wish it would.')
