It does all the things required to configure your projects, apply datasource transformations, propagate configurations, etc. It&#x27;s a rather complex stack to operate and also our secret sauce so we don&#x27;t want you to operate it.<p>I don&#x27;t need any specialized tools or secret sauces to build a REST server. I already know SQL and when my frontend needs something from the database, I simply write a query with that or do a fetch with my ORM, crafted specifically for that endpoint. Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.<p>GraphQL is a solution for building APIs when you aren&#x27;t involved with the frontend at all. Even then the time invested learning, the extra layers of complexity, &quot;magic&quot; and tooling hardly make it worth the effort.<p>I don&#x27;t build APIs that way though. All of my APIs are purpose-built specifically for a given frontend and if I&#x27;m not creating both the frontend and the backend, then I&#x27;m closely collaborating with someone who is.<p>Keep it stupid simple. This is the way.')
