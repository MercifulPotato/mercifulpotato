There&#x27;s a level which meets your needs, a level which makes you happy, and a level that anything beyond is superfluous. And the levels aren&#x27;t fixed either; more of one may make up for less of another, and different people have different needs.<p>I personally don&#x27;t need a lot of mission; it&#x27;s nice, and having a mission frame helps me accept an offer, but once I&#x27;m in the job, it&#x27;s kind of whatever.<p>Autonomy can be picking your tasks from anything possible, or picking your tasks from a small menu, or just doing your assigned tasks in peace. Or having &#x27;flexible&#x27; start times of 7-9 AM. Different people have different needs.<p>I love having global impact, but really all I need is for my code to actually make it out to users. I hate doing a bunch of work and it never ships. But if like one or two people use it, that&#x27;s enough for me.<p>Creativity is relative too. Some people want to create totally new things. I just don&#x27;t want to do the same thing every day for years. In software that&#x27;s not too hard though; if it&#x27;s the same every day, it&#x27;s begging to be automated.<p>Look for enough of these things to make you happy, not to find the maximum available. And yeah, some jobs won&#x27;t have enough to meet your needs; they might meet other people&#x27;s needs though.')
