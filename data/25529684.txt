Is there anywhere I can read more? Found some specifications, but not anything on its properties.<p>I think this might be a case where the requirements for image editing and image compression are different.<p>For image editing, especially when working with HDR images, I think it is better to just have a simple power function, since this makes less assumptions on the exact viewing conditions. E.g a user might want to adjust exposure while editing an image, and if the prediction of hue changes when the exposure is altered, that would be confusing (which happen if more complex non-linearities are used). When compressing final images though, that wouldnâ€™t be an issue in the same way.')
