This typically starts at ~35Mbps, ~70Mbps is very common, and a few providers will do 200-300Mbps but in more limited areas. Some suppliers do 1Gbps, but these are often limited to apartment blocks in cities or towns that invested heavily in infrastructure.<p>This quote is misleading:<p>&gt; Found some data about internet speed in the UK, wasn’t easy to come across, that puts 45% of UK housesolds have &lt; 8 Mbps connection.<p>The graph below shows that this is a survey of ADSL2+ users where the technical cap is 20Mbps. They obviously can&#x27;t get any better. Anecdotally this matches my expectations.<p>I think the reality of the current state is that most of the population can get fibre, but many haven&#x27;t bothered upgrading from their ADSL&#x2F;ADSL2+ packages. When I&#x27;ve done price comparisons there&#x27;s typically not a lot of difference in price mid-market, but there are some very low end providers who will do ADSL&#x2F;2+ for ~£10, where typically home broadband&#x2F;fibre is £20-40.<p>Lastly, with things like home internet it&#x27;s not useful to talk about area coverage.<p>&gt; I moved to a newer home earlier this year and like most places in the UK (even in London) it only had broadband internet aka slow ADSL over copper.<p>Yes, most of the UK does not have fibre, but a significant part of that is fields. In reality most of the _population_ have access to fibre, but of course they are not evenly distributed. Area coverage makes a bit more sense when talking about wireless&#x2F;cellular services because people move about.<p>There are a few areas of London that were wired up in the late 90s&#x2F;early 00s in such a way that they are very hard to re-wire for fibre. The Surrey Quays area comes to mind as one. Those areas have essentially skipped fibre and are moving straight to 5G.')
