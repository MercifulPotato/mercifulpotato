I think the suggestion that desktops aren&#x27;t necessary is a good one.<p>Several years ago, I started turning desktop icons off (both GNOME and Windows make this easy) and it really helped my organization, as I was then forced to competently organize files into Downloads, Documents, Pictures, Videos directories instead of vomiting everything onto the desktop. Simply _knowing_ where files are located is faster than scanning a cluttered desktop.<p>As a bonus I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about the positions of my desktop icons changing.<p>File picker definitely needs thumbnails though.')
