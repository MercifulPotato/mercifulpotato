Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601926768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689749, text='I have seen drivers in huge cargo trucks read the newspaper on the autobahn (the newspaper strategically positioned over the steering wheel, of course), or watch TV. Scary shit. One guy was very interested in his porn mag, one hand holding the mag the other hand &quot;occupied&quot; too, so he somehow steered with his knees.<p>One day I drove with a fellow student to some university event, and he suddenly at a red light took out an electric razor and started shaving. &quot;Want me to take over and drive?&quot; &quot;Nah, you&#x27;re not insured to drive this car&quot; (true).<p>And the makeup thing too, seen that a lot of times, once even two ladies (driver and passenger) in the next car applying eye makeup at the same time, as if to make sure neither of them could watch the traffic.<p>But nothing beats the guy who was so deep down in his seat he was barely visible except for his feet on his dashboard. He apparently thought that being able to use the brake was optional on the autobahn. I can only hope that his car was one of the rare special fitted cars that had a hand operated break paddle, tho the car&#x27;s steering column looked pretty regular from my POV.')
