What does a single &quot;Conway memory cell&quot; circuit look like?<p>It should be possible to implement this circuit on an FPGA.<p>In addition, rather than loading the FPGA with a general purpose &quot;Conway CPU&quot;, one could optimize it for the particular problem (e.g. matrix multiplies).<p>It seems to me that implementing the CPU &quot;in the memory&quot; would overcome the &quot;memory wall&quot; problem (moving data between the CPU and memory).')
