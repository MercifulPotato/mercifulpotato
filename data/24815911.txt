Are any of these like not normal unix utilities? What dependencies are you pulling in after GNU&#x2F;Linux... which is where  CONTAINERS come from? I&#x27;m even only even putting &quot;GNU&quot; here because it&#x27;s literally every fucking Linux distro on the planet containing the utilities referenced. Is it common place now-a-days to bloat a docker image with text data or something? Is docker only for the csvlookup tool?<p>Not trying to be a supermassive asshole but I do feel like I&#x27;m losing my mind reading this... In order to use GNU&#x2F;Linux one must install Linux, setup a container runtime, and then! Use the same utilities available to them in the runtime... from a container?<p>I feel like if this is the state of a tutorial for someone <i>new</i> to these utilities we&#x27;re all pretty fucked and should probably take a step back to re-evaluate the mess we&#x27;ve made. I&#x27;ll go crawl back into my hole now to do just that.')
