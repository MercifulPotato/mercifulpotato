Just importing Django + Django Rest Framework + some other minor libraries in Google App Engine (standard) leads to painfully slow response times when a new instance spins up. Like, more than 10s to spin up an instance. Although App Engine seems to be 3-4 times slower than my desktop computer from 2014 on this particular task. I wonder if AWS lambda is better.')
