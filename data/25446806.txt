But sales of sedans are absolutely <i>swamped</i> by SUVs and trucks. The best selling car in America by a long shot is the F-series pickup truck, with about 900,000 units sold. You can easily fit three child seats in it[0]<p>Oh, the number two and number three best selling vehicles are the RAM 1500 truck and the Chevy Silverado, at 633k and 575k. The Silverado is a bit smaller, but it too will fit three seats[1] across. You have to get to number eight in the list before you find a sedan at all, the Toyota Camry. You have to get to nine and ten on the list before you start finding sedans that would get uncomfortably tight fitting three seats, specifically the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, and even those will fit three if you&#x27;re careful in your shopping. The top selling car that I&#x27;m pretty comfortable you simply could <i>not</i> fit three car seats in is the Nissan Sentra at number 19, with only 184k sales last year.<p>Now, 184K sales isn&#x27;t nothing. There are clearly cars sold in America that will not fit three car seats. But the sales of those cars are <i>dwarfed</i> by large trucks and SUVs. In 2019 Ford sold more f-series trucks than the top three sedans <i>combined</i>. And that&#x27;s before we consider the sales of three row SUVs which can easily fit 4-5 child safe seats in them.<p>So, if Americans are willing to buy massive vehicles capable of seating three seats safely by the literal millions, how in the world is that consistent with &quot;the cost of upgrading to a car capable of seating three seats is a major barrier to having more children&quot;?<p>0 - Here&#x27;s a list of all the child seats that&#x27;ll fit three across in a F-150: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-f-150&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-...</a><p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-silverado&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecarcrashdetective.com&#x2F;3-across-installations-...</a>')
