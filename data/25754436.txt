Only trade is allowed, no personal travel at all. So, no, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impractical at all. Trump did complain a lot about us closing it, though.<p>Air travel, however, has been permitted all along, and mostly  from what I can tell because of the fact that the airline industry would go bankrupt otherwise. So there&#x27;s still people coming into Canada from the US constantly by air, and likely breaking their 14 day quarantine period, too. I know of some \n personally.<p>International travel is still being promoted heavily by airlines, despite governments giving official guidance to not go. Big scandals here in the last couple weeks about politicians taking off for tropical vacations, after instating tough lockdown rules and telling the public not to travel.<p>Canada also instituted the negative test on arrival rule in the last week or so. The caterwauling from our airlines was just ridiculous.<p>The federal governments in both Canada and the United States failed to make moves against travel early on, and they just let it coast for months, as if this virus was just going to go away on its own, because they were afraid of bankrupting the airlines.')
