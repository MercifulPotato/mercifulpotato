I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s such thing as a problematic mail for BEAM really, mails are just terms, and BEAM handles terms, no problem. A mail that contained a small slice of a very large binary, would of course keep the whole referenced binary hanging around, which could be bad, or a large tuple could be bad because if you tried to inspect the message queue through process_info in another process, that would be a big copy.<p>But I think maybe the original poster just meant lots of bad mail in the mailbox to mean mail that would take a long time to process, because of how the receiving process will handle it.<p>Or, possibly bad mail meaning (as you suggest, perhaps), mail that won&#x27;t be matched by any receive, resulting in longer and longer receives when they need to start from the top.')
