I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that I <i>know</i> what I want them to do, but I&#x27;m about 80% sold that I want a repo to be a collection of patches, with the larger structures, e.g. branches or histories, to be ways of organizing the application of those patches, and telling a story to other developers about why they exist.<p>So I&#x27;m eagerly awaiting the next generation of pijul, to get the chance to see if that&#x27;s right.')
