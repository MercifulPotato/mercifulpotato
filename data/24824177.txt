The trimmers are just the start of the investment. Lube &amp; 5-in-1 cleaner are both consumables that are ongoing but not bad. But wow, the clippers are all fixed size, not adjustable, &amp; buying a set was about as much as the clippers themselves. Very pricey. But wow, my ability to trim &amp; maintain myself has gone way way up. I used to use an Oster and sometimes scissors+comb, and I got by, but this is so much more consistent &amp; even &amp; easy &amp; fun to do.')
