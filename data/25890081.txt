Item(by='ddingus', descendants=None, kids=[25890155], score=None, time=1611473131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890029, text='No, what you do is whatever you need to, then fix it later.<p>Votes are cast over a period of a couple weeks and are distributed well in both time and space.<p>It is very difficult to line up the needed criminals and have them lean on many people over a non trivial amount of time and space.<p>And the criminals cannot really verify the vote cast.<p>So, let&#x27;s say they unionize.  Break a lot of kneecaps over the next year?<p>All that will come out and won&#x27;t look pretty.<p>By contrast, discouraging votes by forcing everyone to gather in one hard to miss group takes far fewer criminals.  It all happens on one day too.<p>The key thing is that distribution in time and space.  The mechanics of coercion are very different.<p>Nobody knows who has ballots, when and whether they have voted and or any number can report too.<p>Criminals would be facing a high risk scenario and a high resource requirement.')
