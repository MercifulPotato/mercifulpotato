Very cheap, and incredible features. Configuration should not be a mystery for the average HN poster. Mine is router only, no wifi, but I have heard good things about wifi versions too.<p>Not sure what to recommend for non tech-savvy users though. The overwhelming majority of routers in the market that are targeted to consumers are hot garbage. Some TP-Link models? Maybe... Google(if are ok with your most important device being from them)? Are Linksys still good? My last one was a WRT54G. It was ok out of the box, pretty good with custom firmware (that takes it outside the end-user territory once again).')
