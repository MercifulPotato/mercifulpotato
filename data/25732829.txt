History of theft? Okay, let&#x27;s not leave you alone with people&#x27;s valuables. History of assault? Okay, let&#x27;s not leave you alone with vulnerable people. But beyond that, if we&#x27;re not willing to say that your sentence is finished when your sentence is finished, we&#x27;re admitting a major flaw in our criminal justice system. And maybe that flaw is there, but then we should fix it. &quot;Guilty for the rest of your life for ANY conviction&quot; is just as bad as &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; in my opinion. I don&#x27;t know what you were convicted of, but there aren&#x27;t many things that would block me from trusting you to sit at a computer in an office and contribute to a software project as part of a team.<p>Side note: are there really NO companies that let you in the door? I&#x27;ve had some larger corporate places ask me about any criminal history and have even run a background check. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s come up at small and medium-size companies, where I&#x27;d also expect there&#x27;s a bit more understanding and flexibility anyway. Maybe the ageism is more of an obstacle there? But then maybe I just don&#x27;t notice because I don&#x27;t have a conviction to tell them about. I certainly don&#x27;t mean to minimize your problem, just wondering if it&#x27;s really a complete deal breaker everywhere.')
