E.g. why not invest in amber, it&#x27;s probably one of the rarest things in the universe.<p>Yes but the amount of amber, gold, silver, etc. on Earth is a known unknown. There are presumably deposits of gold that we don&#x27;t yet know about. The amount of BTC is known. You seem to be conflating rarity with fixed scarcity.<p>&gt;  Using existing anti-money-laundering laws &amp; global institutions, you&#x27;d be effectively banned from getting back any value from your BTCs (or, doing so would expose you to all the associated risks).<p>While this is true, this is sort of the whole point of bitcoin. Like, it&#x27;s a currency that is independent of any nation-state and acts as a sort of systemic-hedge against governmental incompetence&#x2F;malfeasance. So the fact that it could even be banned by any particular country is kind of part of its value proposition. And, similar to VPN&#x27;s, just because an IP-based technology is banned doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;d become impossible to use.')
