Obviously the client and server you&#x27;re talking to needs to have actually correctly implemented the bits of the spec that you&#x27;re trying to use - but there&#x27;s no openpgp v. OMEMO or rival file transfer mechanisms etc.  It&#x27;s only a difference in governance, but it&#x27;s an important one.<p>Obviously, a single monolithic spec controlled by a committee like the matrix spec core team has its own problems (most importantly, the committee can become a bottleneck); and we still provide mechanisms to let people experiment via the equivalent of vendor prefixing, which can go horribly wrong (c.f. aggregations in Matrix) if not managed with discipline.<p>But, I&#x27;m not trying to spread FUD about XMPP - just try to explain that the approaches taken are different, and have different tradeoffs, and are not &quot;exactly the same&quot;.')
