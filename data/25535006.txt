It&#x27;s an environmental regulation, as you&#x27;re presumably aware? Seems odd to not acknowledge it, in that case.<p>It encourages advances in lower power vacuums, just like energy labeling does (and did) for other appliances. We don&#x27;t want manufacturers to compete by having ever higher wattage numbers, which they are wont to do. This is not going to appeal to libertarians, obviously, and the UK is now free to finally become a Thatcherite libertarian experiment.<p>It would be nice to tax CO2, making electricity ten to twenty times more expensive. Then making rules like these might be superfluous.')
