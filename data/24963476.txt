Individuals part of the organization that behave badly don&#x27;t either. Other states have organizations like the NSA and in order for the USA to defend itself from them the USA also needs one. We don&#x27;t question the need for a military because one lieutenant burns down a Vietnamese village, we demand justice and changes, but we continue to support the need for a military. That&#x27;s my thought around the NSA. I support private companies protecting their customers by utilizing encryption and I support the NSA to do whatever they can to amass all the information they can when private companies fail. Why? Because our enemies are doing the same thing. A moral position that loses doesn&#x27;t last, and for sure there are some moral positions I would stand by them even if it meant losing, but this one isn&#x27;t one of them. Not for me anyway.')
