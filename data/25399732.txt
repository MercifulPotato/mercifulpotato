I also should mention that Notion&#x2F;Airtable vs. Excel are somewhat different types of swissarmy knives to be used in different environments. One is used in the battlefield and space exploration, the other one in a children&#x27;s playground. Jokes aside, Notion has some nice features like Wiki and it wears too many hats like a joker in a circus. I love the fact that I can write a recipe with tables and markdown -&gt; publish it to the internet to be consumed. Can&#x27;t do that with Excel.')
