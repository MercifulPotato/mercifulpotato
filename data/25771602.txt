It all comes back to Intel&#x27;s fab problems. If they fix that then the CPU instruction set is a minor issue. What do AMD and Apple&#x27;s CPU&#x27;s have in common? They&#x27;re manufactured on TSMC&#x27;s process. Why is Apple&#x27;s M1 apparently so ahead of the rest of the industry? They exclusively reserved all of TSMC&#x27;s new 5nm capacity.<p>This also makes me wonder why they chose Pat Gelsinger, a micro architecture engineer as the new CEO. Instead of someone from the fab side. fab success is life or death, everything else is a sideshow.')
