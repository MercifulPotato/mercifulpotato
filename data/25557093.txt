You should be able to cover the entire sunward side of a skyscraper with vines and harvest the grapes using a robot hanging off a crane.<p>Except when you realize that the most highly valued added product (wine) relies on soil&#x2F;region specific soil (terroir). No one buying table grapes, even at Whole Foods, is going to spend the kind of money to make something like that at scale. I&#x27;ve worked in a vineyard for a Summer in Croatia, it&#x27;s how I got run my own Kitchen in Italy soon after as it crated a good &#x27;marketing hook&#x27; for a chef, and I can go into why that skyscraper idea is impractical for anything fruit bearing but suffice it to say: it won&#x27;t work unless you want a small, low yield plaything that can be outperformed from anything in most common grape growing regions even if hyper-local expenses are removed. Hell, even using them as a cover crop&#x2F;ornament on a trellis in a backyard garden may yield better results.<p>Cash crops, as specified, are based on economies of scale for a reason and are actually very efficient when properly done and have 10,000+ years of refinement behind them--crop rotation, efficient irrigation, cover crops in the off season, livestock grazing for fertility and micro-organism replenishment. With the advent of more automation, and no till methods we are seeing increases in yield, despite global climate change. Water scarcity, irrigation and water table replenishment and growing organically is something I wished we placed a greater focus on and would do more good for us and our Ecosystem as a whole than anything else hindering cash crop modality if I&#x27;m honest.<p>I sincerely wish people were forced to have to farm as part of their formal education, and continued gardening as their is so much deadly ignorance in regards to where our food comes from and the maladies it creates as a result of being so far from it: obesity and heart disease kills more in the West than anything else.<p>With that said, I see this as very good data for Mars colonization and food production; but for terrestrial purposes its absurd for anything but Hype&#x2F;Marketing an expensive and impractical bridge with fanciful ideas of &#x27;closing the gap between food deserts&#x27; when urban farming is the real answer in the US (see: Detroit). This model only semi-worked when they were aligned to expensive fine dining restaurants, now that those have been systemically destroyed and may never come back, I don&#x27;t see it having much if any potential as I&#x27;ve eaten greenhouse stuff that aren&#x27;t herbs or salad from Holland and its awful!<p>We could honestly make more headway in solving hunger, food scarcity if they just allotted community gardens in vacant land not in use and mandated fruit bearing trees be used instead of ornamental ones in urban landscaping and reinstated gleaning as a form Community Supported Agriculture.')
