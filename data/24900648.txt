Item(by='_o-o_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603742424, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899779, text='This reminds me of the issue in machine translation where even sophisticated systems cannot understand the importance of a word like &quot;no&quot;. So, for example, a phrase like &quot;please press this button&quot; could be translated as &quot;please do not press this button&quot; and it could be automatically rated as a good translation because most of the words are there.<p>But, on the other hand, I have dictated these paragraphs, (pretty much just adding punctuation and minor edits at the end). I think the most useful feature I&#x27;ve found related to voice is dictation (speech to text). It is almost perfect, at least in English (and I am not a native speaker).')
