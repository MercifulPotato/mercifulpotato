An education&#x2F;gamedev tool aimed at kids and looking back it was really neat. You had a grid and gave rules to objects on the grid by pattern-matching the surrounding grid cells. Right arrow key makes the player move right, if the cell to the right is empty. If there&#x27;s a block already to the right but an empty square beyond it, move the player and the block. You just laid out a &quot;start&quot; state and a &quot;final&quot; state and whenever the start state was met, it would replace with the end state. A ton of basic (and not-so-basic) games and fun things could be made really easily with this. More advanced users could do something closer to traditional programming by giving objects variables and manipulating those, making &quot;folders&quot; of rules that controlled which ones could run, etc. I made a fairly full-fledged short JRPG in it, and other people&#x27;s projects were even better. Frankly, I finished more gamedev projects playing around with that than I ever did after learning to code!<p>I could see something like that succeeding in the modern era if you make it easier to share - you needed Stagecraft to run anything made by it. Anything modern with this grid+rule system like that already?')
