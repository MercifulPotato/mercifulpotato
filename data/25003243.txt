I can’t tell you how many times I open a new project, perhaps in a different language, and everything works great out of the box. It’s a total sigh of relief.<p>I agree 100% here, if you value these types of IDE tools I don&#x27;t recommend going to Vim. It frankly sucks at this stuff, it wasn&#x27;t meant for it and it&#x27;s not the type of things you can easily tack onto a codebase not meant for it. Doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying of course, and some do an amazing job at it, but it rarely reaches the same level of polish and simplicity as good IDE solutions.<p>But on the other hand, please consider the Zen of dumb tools: I code all day in Vim and I don&#x27;t use YouCompleteMe, NERDTree or anything like that. I use dumb, language-agnostic completion and dumb, language-agnostic FZF and Rg for searching and navigating the source code. If I&#x27;m feeling fancy I use universal-ctags, but if it&#x27;s not here FZF and Rg do a good enough job.<p>Is it as fancy and fully featured as an IDE? No. But like the author I like when stuff just works, and dumb tools work reliably regardless of what I&#x27;m editing. It works in emails, it works in man pages, it works in custom DSLs, it works in config files, it works in HN comments if I decide to edit them there. And it&#x27;s always instant.')
