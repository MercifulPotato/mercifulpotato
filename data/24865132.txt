I&#x27;ve tried this sort of thing before, being more conscious of &quot;time left&quot;, but I found it just made me anxious and depressed. I&#x27;d continually second guess whether or not I was working on the most meaningful thing, felt guilty, and I&#x27;d be overly impatient and agitated when forced to work on something I didn&#x27;t care about.<p>I have had better success thinking in terms of 3 year chunks; seems to be a good balance between giving myself time to get big projects done without feeling overwhelmed, but not so far off that today&#x27;s actions seem too insignificant. Still practicing though. (On a side note, just about everything I work on takes more time than I&#x27;d like, which is continually frustrating. I haven&#x27;t found a good way of thinking of self-set deadlines in a helpful way.)')
