But I doubt anyone could have made a KL-10 on a board in 1975. A TTL implementation would have been difficult to squeeze into a small space, and a VLSI implementation was at least a decade away.<p>In fact there was a short-lived project called Minnow which was supposed to put a KL-10 on a desk, but it was overtaken by VAX - much like the Jupiter super-KL-10 project, which never got past the design notes and emulation stage.<p>LSI-11s did end up in small boxes, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.<p>The problem was that Olsen didn&#x27;t have a vision for commodity personal computing. And to be fair not many people did in the 70s.<p>He seems to have been a very 1950s corporate kind of manager, and couldn&#x27;t imagine computing outside of technical and corporate settings. DEC&#x27;s culture was geared to selling to corporates and academia and trying to compete with IBM, not with smaller startups. So when DEC did eventually try to make hardware that could compete with PCs they tried to sell it to their usual customers instead of finding new markets. And that... didn&#x27;t work.<p>Apple meanwhile had worked out that you needed a national dealer network with stores and hands-on demos all over the country. And plenty of approachable PR and ad spend. That was really what made Apple stand out from the competition, and that kind of marketing, to users who didn&#x27;t work in big offices, factories, and research labs, and didn&#x27;t have degrees, was unimaginable at DEC.<p>I&#x27;m fascinated by DEC as a company. There was some incredible world-leading engineering and a progressive culture, but the vision seems to have got stuck on a peg in the 70s, kept it together in the 80s because VAX was already in place, but couldn&#x27;t deal realistically with the 90s.<p>Gordon Bell has said that Olsen never quite understood what VLSI implied culturally and socially - never mind technically and financially.<p>There&#x27;s an apocryphal story about someone handing Olsen one of the pre-Alpha VAX-on-a-chip designs and he has a very polite mini-meltdown when he realises that it literally outperforms the top water-cooled mainframe ECL VAX hardware - for just a few hundred dollars, instead of a couple of million.')
