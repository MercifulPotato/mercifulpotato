It&#x27;s just too much. It&#x27;s the paradox of choice.<p>There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with &quot;oligopolies&quot; except when they collude together to raise prices, and competition is weak. But that&#x27;s obviously not the case in office productivity software -- competition and innovation are intense, and there&#x27;s zero evidence of price-gouging whatsoever.')
