However, racism adds an extra layer of difficulties on top of the more general problems---and poor whites are some of the strongest supporters of this extra layer. Further, racism has been a problem longer than (the current wave of) poverty and economic inequality. (See, for example, the 1950s and 60s when inequality was lower but racism was much stronger.)<p>Edit: A corollary of this: the &quot;problems associated with poverty and economic affect both minorities and whites&quot; can be seen as a way to distract attention from the very real problems of racism.')
