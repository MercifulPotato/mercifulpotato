However the few games left after the Catalina change to drop 32 bit support are still important to me. One of the publishers has preemptively dropped support for Mac and its near impossible to tell if others will continue support into AS.<p>I know, there is a crowd out there that loves to declare &quot;you should not use your Mac for games&quot; along with &quot;Buy a system for games then&quot;. Well let me be blunt, if it cannot serve both purposes then it serves none which means leaving the platform behind.<p>So I look at AS with excitement and trepidation all at the same time with the realization my current Mac may well be my last.')
