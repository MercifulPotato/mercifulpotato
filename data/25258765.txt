It seems like people just downvote anything they simply don&#x27;t agree with. Your comment is a perfectly valid observation, yet people actively try to downvote it away and silence your point of view. My gut tells me that NN is probably a mostly beneficial regulation to have in place, but I have heard some very well reasoned arguments against it that seem more substantial and less reductive than &quot;incompetency&quot; or &quot;corruption&quot;.')
