Item(by='cassianoleal', descendants=None, kids=[24708505, 24707822, 24707842, 24708289, 24708219, 24709817], score=None, time=1602076401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24707612, text='This is terrible physics!<p>~~First, the Z axis is commonly used to represent height rather than width.~~<p>Second, the mirror is not flipping <i>anything</i>.<p>It&#x27;s just reflecting things in a straight line. This is easily demonstrated by holding a sign with a transparent background in front of the mirror. The image you see on the back of the sign aligns with the one you see on the mirror.<p>A person in front of the sign is able to read the words properly because, relative to you (and the sign) <i>they</i> are flipped. Their right eye is in front of your left eye and vice-versa.<p>The mirror gives the impression of a flipped image precisely because it&#x27;s not flipping anything!<p>Edit: It&#x27;s already been pointed out twice to me that Z for height is not in any way a convention. I never thought it was, which is why I used the phrase &quot;commonly used&quot; instead. Turns out that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case either, regardless of my personal experience so this is an acknowledgement of that mistake.')
