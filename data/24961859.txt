It&#x27;s not like DMCA notices are their only option after all (and I&#x27;m not sure the DMCA notice sent to GitHub is really even a DMCA notice anyway). I would imagine they&#x27;re either already in the process of or are ramping up to also go after the individuals involved as maintainers and (major) contributors. I think that could actually be a really interesting legal case to see if something like youtube-dl is found to be something more like a VCR or more like Napster, but I don&#x27;t know if RIAA would ever take the chance of letting that happen on the chance that they lose. I think the more typical strategy for them would be to start sending everyone they can track down the real identity of scary letters and maybe drag a few into court and settle so the rest run away.<p>I personally wouldn&#x27;t touch contributing to youtube-dl right now with a 10 foot pole, but I&#x27;m also a bit on the paranoid side :).')
