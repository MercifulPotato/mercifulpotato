Lots of newer traditional RLs are quite accessible and accessibility was a big goal for my game. There&#x27;s no real reason to have a game use 95 separate key commands. Then again this classification is no less arbitrary than the low value factor &quot;ASCII display&quot; in the Berlin Interpretation.')
