I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a situation anywhere where it&#x27;s a free-for-all.<p>Personally, I will take the vaccine as soon as it&#x27;s made available to me. Even if my risk is perhaps low (which may or may not be true), taking the vaccine reduces the chance that I would spread COVID to someone else. It&#x27;s a collective effort to reduce the spread, not an individual or selfish one.')
