Does the &quot;host&quot; run the emulator and stream the video feed of it and accept inputs, or do both players run the emulator in lockstep or something? The first approach would introduce a delay that&#x27;s likely to be unacceptable for games. The second one would work better in terms of delay but would require some very tricky state synchronization.<p>edit: the first approach would also give the host an unfair advantage because they&#x27;ll have no delay at all.')
