They run on the same platforms and they use the same frameworks, build tools, debuggers, and other tooling.<p>A Java developer will pick up Kotlin much faster than, say, a Postgres developer will pick up Mongo. It takes a lot longer for a Java programmer to learn the Android environment than the Kotlin language.<p>If there were a trend from Java towards Rust or Go or Python, that would be a significant change in the world. If Java were to vanish tomorrow and everybody had to pick up Kotlin, the world would be pretty much the same in a week. Kotlin is nice, benefitting from a clean-sheet implementation of lessons that Java takes on only with difficulty, but it&#x27;s not a wholesale break.')
