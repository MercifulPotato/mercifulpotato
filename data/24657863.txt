I have 1 year of full-stack experience in Angular 7 - 10 + .Net Core 2.2 - 3.1, but am continually learning new languages and frameworks (both professionally and for fun).<p>My humanities background has aided me quite a bit in technical documentation, public speaking, and effective communication with product owners, QA analysts, PMs, and other developers. Although I&#x27;ve put in a lot of time to catch up to my colleagues coming out of CS programs, I&#x27;ve found that these soft skills have been invaluable on development teams.<p>I am very passionate about learning, and love to teach and work in collaborative, inclusive workplaces. I would be open to part- or full-time work, but would prefer something that does not involve frequent over-time.')
