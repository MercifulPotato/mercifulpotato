Item(by='ravenstine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608481863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='&gt;  Every single hacker news thread about the Cyberpunk fiasco has had a ton of top comments about they havenâ€™t had any issues with the game.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to reconcile with the sheer number of video clips I&#x27;ve seen of bugs that are totally unacceptable in even alpha level software.  I have to wonder whether those who are claiming they don&#x27;t have that many bugs have simply grown up in the current era of buggy games on first release, or if they&#x27;re just being dishonest because reasons.<p>Just watch The Act Man&#x27;s compilation of Cyberpunk bugs and tell me that game is worth full price.')
