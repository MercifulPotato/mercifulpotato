It will matter only in the future, when Apple will include enough cores in its CPUs, to be able to exploit the higher TDP available in a laptop.<p>On the other hand, if the power consumption of Tiger Lake &#x2F; Zen 3 is reduced to be equal with that of Apple M1, their clock frequency is reduced from 4.8 GHz to around 3.5 GHz ... 3.6 GHz, remaining higher than that of M1 (which does more work per clock cycle).<p>Therefore at equal power per core Apple M1 is faster, but only by around 35%. This advantage is not enough to enable 4+4 Apple cores to match 8 Intel&#x2F;AMD cores.<p>In conclusion, the laptops that will be launched in early 2021, with 8-core Tiger Lake H or AMD Cezanne, will have the same single-thread performance as Apple M1, but higher multi-thread performance. The slower laptops with AMD Renoir already have better multi-thread performance.<p>Moreover, while Apple M1 has an <i>average</i> IPC 1.5 times higher than the <i>average</i> IPC of Intel&#x2F;AMD, which enables high scores in benchmarks like SPEC or GeekBench, in computational benchmarks with optimized programs that have higher IPC than the average IPC, Apple M1 is disadvantaged and it is slower in single-thread than even an old Ryzen 7 3700X, unlike in single-thread SPEC or GeekBench, where you need a new Ryzen 9 5900X to exceed the Apple M1 performance.')
