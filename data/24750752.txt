Other locations too, depending on the state &amp; local laws.<p>Paying before pumping became a thing when gas went to $4 a gallon several years ago.  Stations had a lot of people driving away without paying and the amount stolen was below what the police would investigate.<p>You can often pay at the pump, and they way they work is they authorize a certain amount ($75, I think) against your card, and then when the station settles at the end of the day, the actual amount will be applied. I have exceeded American Express&#x27;s hold limit a couple of times during cross-country drives, and had to talk to their fraud department..<p>Pumps with one hose are cheaper. You&#x27;ll probably get a dribble of whatever grade the previous customer chose from what was left in the hose. But diesel will always have it&#x27;s own hose.<p>The funny thing about precisely stopping the pump - prices in the US seem to always have 9 tenths of a cent added to them - like $2.599 per gallon. If you purchase <i>exactly</i> one gallon, and hand over $2.60, there&#x27;s no way to get that tenth of a cent change. I expect it was originally a marketing thing, and now it&#x27;s a custom.')
