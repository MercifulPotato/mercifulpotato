IMHO it was the best software development environment for that platform.  It was full featured, very fast (both compilation and run-time), and very memory efficient.<p>I also had Microsoft CBASIC, Fortran-80, COBOL-80, BDS-C, and many assemblers.  Turbo Pascal put them all to shame.  The C compilers for CP&#x2F;M could not even do floating point math.  Turbo Pascal had no such limitations.')
