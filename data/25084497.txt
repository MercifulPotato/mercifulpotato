I don&#x27;t know that I think it makes a large pragmatic difference as long as the pay guarantee is there but it seems a convoluted system as opposed to an immoral or unfair one.<p>I think where we may disagree is that my main concern is that the employee makes that minimum threshold, whether paid directly by the customer via a weird quasi-voluntary tax or by the employer who would presumably pass that cost on to the customer. Again, assuming it all gets claimed in income I don&#x27;t see any shortfalls; it&#x27;s just a weird convention.<p>Where I may have a problem is that there seems to be some evidence there is bias in tipping. I&#x27;ve seen some that indicates some race groups&#x2F;protected classes are tipped less, controlling for service quality, even by their own race&#x2F;class. If true, it would mean tipping is a de-facto form of discrimination and obviously needs to go away.')
