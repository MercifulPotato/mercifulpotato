So e.g. We have had clocks for a while that are accurate to a part in 10^18, so they can measure time dilation at walking speed. Or detect gravitational time dilation when you lift something (the clock!) up one meter in the earths gravitational field.<p>Yet another way of saying how amazing this new result is: A second is much &quot;closer&quot; to the age of the universe than it is to a zeptosecond.')
