The ide support in vscode&#x2F;tsserver is very complete, but it is NOT fast. As an example, it frequently takes multiple minutes to use find references. Rg or git grep with fzf are both hundreds of times faster, and are easier for me to navigate. (Obviously language aware find references is much more powerful, but with carefully named variables it&#x27;s acceptable to just use rg.). Sometimes, even a simple &quot;go to definition&quot; results in a 45 second hang. (This is on a 2019 Macbook pro)<p>I&#x27;ve also used intelij idea with Java, and while it was much smoother than anything in the typescript ecosystem, it&#x27;s definitely not faster than using grep.')
