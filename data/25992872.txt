Then slowly transition to saying &quot;no&quot; as your career develops. The transition point from &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no&quot; is when you develop more unique and valuable skill sets.<p>When all you have to offer is energy, excitement, and smarts - &quot;yes&quot; opens doors, creates relationships, and gives you opportunities to learn. That&#x27;s how you grow, not only in career, but in relationships.<p>After you can bring more differentiated value to an opportunity, you&#x27;re going to be in more demand and need to filter the best use of your time and energy.<p>The Steve Job&#x27;s part is absolutely correct when you are sitting in Steve Jobs&#x27; position. As a thought experiment, probably every Fortune 500 CEO would want to have a 1-2 hr meeting with Jobs circa 2008. That would be 500-1000 hours of meetings where arguably <i>they</i> would derive more value than he would. So while it would be insane for most to pass up on these meetings, he obviously would need to.<p>Don&#x27;t confuse the &quot;yes&quot; vs &quot;no&quot; periods of your life.')
