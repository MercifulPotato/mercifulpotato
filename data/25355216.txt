The dollar will depreciate, and though we will be seeing people make massive gains in 2020 and 2021, the buying power of those gains will not be the same as the buying power they would have in say 2019. There’s just too much money being printed out now and spent. If you’ve just been sitting in cash and have missed those gains you’ll be in a world of hurt when the day comes that your cash can’t really buy what it used to, while all the stock investors are out living their life as usual comfortable with inflated prices.<p>You cannot afford to be sitting on the sidelines. If you’re extra paranoid, put your money where your mouth is and buy put options as insurance to protect yourself from downside risk, or if you’re happy with the gains you have now put a collar on your positions.<p>But do not sit around doing nothing or reposting memes about how the Fed can’t keep printing money forever or how PE ratios are insane.')
