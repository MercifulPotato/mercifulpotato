But people had been trying to get such APIs into the kernel for years with no success. Which is why we tried to piggyback on something existing.<p>Cpusets, which had already been accepted into the kernel a year or two previously, provided the basic userspace API for cgroups. It was just expanded to support control files for more resource types. (And multiple resource hierarchies, although that&#x27;s gone in cgroups v2 I think).')
