Gtk seems to be slower than others (such as KIO&#x2F;KDE), but all of them are pretty slow. E.g. the KDE file picker takes about a second or so to finish listing the contents of my home directory (though it is usable while it is doing so, unlike the Gtk dialog), where the Gtk takes quite a bit longer (perhaps on the order of 3-5 seconds). Meanwhile ls is essentially instant, as you&#x27;d expect for just a few thousand files or so.')
