What&#x27;s your sleep duration if you sleep until you wake up by yourself? I&#x27;d test that on a quiet long weekend, not during a busy day.<p>Second, while I now use a lamp which ramps up the light before it starts to chime, I used music (instrumental and not to hectic) to wake me up. Music might get you something else to concentrate on while finally waking up.<p>BTW, both ramping up lights and playing music at &quot;alarm time&quot; looks like a nice side project for a Raspi. Does somebody know about such a solution?')
