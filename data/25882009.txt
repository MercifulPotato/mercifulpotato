Some feel there is a correctness justification, being able to follow the code from top to bottom rather than jumping around, see: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;number-none.com&#x2F;blow&#x2F;blog&#x2F;programming&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;carmack-on-inlined-code.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;number-none.com&#x2F;blow&#x2F;blog&#x2F;programming&#x2F;2014&#x2F;09&#x2F;26&#x2F;carm...</a><p>Personally I think it just doesn&#x27;t matter. 50k lines of code is 50k lines of code. Whether it is in one file or 10 or 100, only changes whether you jump around via a file tree or other editor tools.<p>There are some practical problems when you get too huge though, like not being able to view the thing in github!')
