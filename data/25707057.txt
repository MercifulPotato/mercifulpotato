Guns should have never been allowed. The shooting happened because drug addicts were fleeing to CHAZ with their stolen car that looked similar to the car that tried to pull a drive by earlier that night and the retards shot them.<p>Some parts of Seattle aren&#x27;t really safe at night in the best circumstances.')
