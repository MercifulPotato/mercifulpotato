Imports are a benefit and exports are cost in real terms. The point of an economy is to maximize consumption. Its costs labor, raw materials, and even pollution to produce IPhones and Mercedez Benz.\nThe problem is everyone wants to export and only America wants to import. Is that a bad thing for America ?  I don&#x27;t think so. If you give me an Iphone and I give you a piece of paper, or, better yet, a debit on a spreadsheet, who is getting the better deal here ?  Why do you want to horde that piece of paper?  You can&#x27;t eat it or use it for shelter. So why not have fed policy that optimizes this rather than calling our trade partners currency manipulators .<p>Certainly we need to protect industries that are vital to national security and that list has increased with the pandemic.  Wouldn&#x27;t put iPhones on that list.')
