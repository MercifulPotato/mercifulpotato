And sanitation, and medical care, and...<p>What you are calling &quot;rich&quot; countries are countries in which people have way, way more options--where their lives are a lot more than just bare subsistence. And history shows that the vast majority of people <i>want</i> all those options; they don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to live a bare subsistence life. (If you do, how are you even posting here?
