I largely learned to program using such resources, with QBasic, QuickBasic (much more help), Turbo Pascal, Visual Basic, Delphi, etc.  Mostly before or without internet.  I learned data structures and algorithms from classes in parallel with this (along with some other languages), but actual practical programming knowledge came mainly from built-in IDE documentation.  Before QBasic, I had GW-Basic, with no built-in help, and learning was very slow.')
