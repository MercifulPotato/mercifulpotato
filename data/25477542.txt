Vice versa is true too, hardware wants to build software ecosystem around it, but in a such way that uses only its hardware, not other hardware. This is why wintel is a thing.<p>Only from a quick glance it appears that we all win, but really none of us can win from this. Worse, megacorps don&#x27;t really compete with each other, their view on competition is pretty perverse, they &quot;compete&quot; as long as such &quot;competing&quot; doesn&#x27;t eat into juicy high margin profits that exist only on monopolized markets, so it&#x27;s more like dividing markets and forming oligopolies, but not commodotizing each other.')
