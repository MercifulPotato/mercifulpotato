Item(by='purplecats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607073172, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300332, text='&gt; I have special place in my office where I put a book so that it is visible to me whatever I do. It serves as a constant reminder to get it finished.<p>Tangential but I do this with everything. I like very high levels of organization (blame my aspergers) and thus I found that my motivation to hide unnecessary things from view is pretty high. High enough that I place things in view as a reminder to get them done. An extra laptop on my desk -&gt; I need to transfer the remaining files into my new laptop so that I can finally remove it from view. Book on my desk? Needs to be finished. Sticky note on my island? need to order groceries before I can remove it. I&#x27;d turned minimalism into a lifestyle&#x2F;todo list. Same with the digital world.')
