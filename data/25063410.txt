It perhaps wouldn’t even exist. Trust, it being an Electron app is a good thing for you, despite its limitations.</i><p>Google Mail (Gmail) is very successful despite not having an official desktop application, even though Electron and other web wrappers exist. I am confident that Slack, Discord, Messenger, WhatsApp, Notion, among other web applications, would exist without Electron, and the features would be the same.<p>If you are a macOS user and want to have a better experience with hybrid web applications, I highly recommend Fluid [1] or Unite [2]. They both create wrappers for web applications using WebKit, which performs several times better than Chromium on macOS.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluidapp.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluidapp.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bzgapps.com&#x2F;unite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bzgapps.com&#x2F;unite</a>')
