Infection rates for influenza probably being an order of magnitude worse than Coronavirus in April, probably. But whatever, the mortality rate data is there in the table, too, if you care to look. Influenza death rate in January 5yr average was 4218, which is about 1.8x worse than April. That absolutely does not make up the 12x difference here.')
