What made it wobbly was the animation technique used. It had several animation sequences (walking, running, dying, etc..), each with multiple frame specifying the coordinates of a fixed number of 3D vertices. The indices of those vertices corresponded to the indices in a list of 2D vertices giving coordinated into a single 2D texture. IIRC Animation between frames used linear interpolation.')
