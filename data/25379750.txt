So if Proton is a serious attempt at making everything work, why do 40% of the top 10 games still not work at all? Clearly there are some Windows APIs which WINE&#x2F;Proton can&#x27;t emulate yet. So now your developers have to specifically avoid those syscalls and system libraries. What if a third-party library you want to use uses those syscalls? Now you need to work with the vendor to get them changed. Okay... as if that isn&#x27;t bad enough... Only 20% of the top 10 games are &quot;gold&quot; meaning they work 100% correctly, with some tweaks. Okay, so now you have to tell users what those tweaks are, or they might refund. Never mess with an angry Linux user!  And then, 20% of games work &quot;okay&quot; meaning there are glitches that don&#x27;t affect gameplay. But... you now have to field support calls from users who see these glitches and think their game is borked.\nAnd if you&#x27;re wondering why I went with the &quot;top 10&quot; list and not the &quot;top hundred&quot;, it&#x27;s because most Linux gamers I&#x27;ve seen complaining about the lack of Linux ports are complaining about the AAA top 10 games, not the simplistic 2D tower defense games. Packaging a game that already works great in Proton is beside the point.')
