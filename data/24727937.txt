I&#x27;ve never been that much of a writer, but I ended up as the internal communications person at my company.  Not exciting at all.  I was actually dreading it.<p>After doing it for a year, I got pretty good at it (I&#x27;d like to think).  I&#x27;m able to pretty quickly throw together an email or press release that&#x27;s clear (avoids BS corporate speak), concise (summarize a paragraph in one sentence) and sets the right tone (why should the reader care).<p>Now I read others people&#x27;s work (not talking about this blog post at all, I haven&#x27;t read it) and subconsciously edit it my head.<p>My takeaway?  Anyone can be a good writer with enough practice.')
