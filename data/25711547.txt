That energy expenditure is no longer needed for survival and reproduction. Dump those neurons. Over time people stop caring about the tiny details of what the difference is between a good and a great restaurant. Yelp handles that.</i><p>I think there&#x27;s a distinction that&#x27;s being glossed over, here: people can be desirous of eating at some restaurants more than others because of the results, but no longer pay attention to what those restaurants have in common -- what the underlying reasons are for the outcome at those restaurants that they prefer. Something which helps decide where to eat would <i>ideally</i> highly rate restaurants you&#x27;d enjoy, while not requiring you to learn specific details about the preparation of really excellent food.<p>I disagree with the assertion that letting a rating service choose the restaurant (or a list of restaurants of the highest rating) will result in not having desires about the experience at that restaurant, but I think &quot;nuanced preferences&quot; in the initial sentence must mean &quot;knowing a lot about the kind of restaurants I like&quot;, instead.')
