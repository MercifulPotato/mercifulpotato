Does the author think there&#x27;s no need for security? That it&#x27;s not important?<p>A large chunk of the problems we have now are because no-one thought about security in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s when the various protocols we use were being invented.<p>It was only kinda safe because not connected to the internet. As soon as the internet came along all those simple protocols got abused royally, and all those simple OS&#x27;s got pwned routinely.<p>I remember those days. Being the family IT support, once a month I had to clean my sister&#x27;s laptop of all the viral crap she kept clicking on. Today is better. Much, much better.')
