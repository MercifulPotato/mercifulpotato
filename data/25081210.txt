The focus is always on the micro-architecture of the compute units.<p>Knowing that the wire area of a conventional register bank grows by the square of the number of read&#x2F;write ports, and that superscalar processors require an increasing number of read&#x2F;write ports, the micro-architecture of the register bank quickly becomes critical with the number of issue.<p>But there is very little information on the right micro-architectural strategy in this regard.\nThere is some information on GPU register banks, but very little about modern CPU designs.')
