I like some of the ideas of the Right that they believe that States are governments to experiment with. I&#x27;d suggest FPTP and other solutions to just attempt to do this locally and in a State or two. It will get traction, if it&#x27;s worth it to the governed population. That&#x27;s my suggestion, start small.')
