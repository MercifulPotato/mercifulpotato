Then we schedule the notebook with more resources (GPU, RAM, etc). We can set the timeout to kill the job.<p>We also shut down the notebook servers automatically, and use resources only for the duration of the long-running notebook when they&#x27;re scheduled.<p>OP might want to look into JupyterHub spawners[2]. They can use the API to make custom spawners that fit their specific needs (handling storage, using specific images, etc).<p>One limitation in ZTJPH in one comment above if I recall correctly is the locality of the cluster. OP also might want to take a look at JupyterHub Enterprise Gateway[3] which may solve their need.<p>It depends on the experience OP wants to provide for their users. We wanted to let users roam around, have files, use the console, collaborate in real-time, load data, and fresh environments... Similar to what they&#x27;d have on their own laptops, except with a better experience. Not just &quot;one notebook view&quot; or a rigid pipeline.<p>That&#x27;s what we disliked in most of the products we&#x27;ve seen so far. That and the fact many of them focused way too much on pretty stylesheets and animations instead of actual problems ML people struggle with.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;manage-resources-containers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;configuration&#x2F;manage-res...</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;config&#x2F;containers&#x2F;resource_constraints&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;config&#x2F;containers&#x2F;resource_constrain...</a><p>- [2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jupyterhub.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;reference&#x2F;spawners.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jupyterhub.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;reference&#x2F;spawne...</a><p>- [3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jupyter-enterprise-gateway.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>')
