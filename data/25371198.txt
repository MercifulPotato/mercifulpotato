It then provides pulseaudio remote, shairport and mpd services.<p>I have not witnessed stutter but with buffering comes some kind of lag indeed.\nI strimmed down the basic install, by removing packages, disabling services and devices, in order to reduce power consumption and have the rpi to work out of the timecapsule USB.<p>My main takeaways:<p>1. The system has been stable for years and sounds great. I use it on the weekends mostly.<p>2. The DAC is great, because the built in audio is really terrible.<p>3. Spotify over Airport quality is not on par with pulseaudio, nor with playing flac through mpd. I have not found great mobile mpd client. Convenience wins.<p>4. It is strangely difficult to have pulseaudio running headless.')
