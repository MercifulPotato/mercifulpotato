The only way I&#x27;d give them my blood would be to infect them with a disease.&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6349349" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6349349</a><p>June 2014, top-rated comments include &quot;.. zombie ... apocalypse&quot;. &quot;What an odd cast for a startup board.
