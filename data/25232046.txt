Probably would not be that controversial even a decade ago. But now would probably get me ostracized from society if I expressed them freely now.<p>After visiting Europe and coming back here. I noticed how fat everyone here is. But everyone here is stumbling along and nobody notices it, as if its all fine. But really its not fine, its actually pretty horrible.<p>Earlier today I overheard a teen girl with a giant behind, talking with her friend how she wants to go home and do nothing, to her obese friend, on a Friday.  \nSorry but this is not how teenagers acted in the past. And its not normal that so many young people are morbidly obese, stay at home do nothings.<p>I also draw a line, I don&#x27;t think we should be wearing space suits to live on this planet. Sorry if that means people will die from exposure to disease. But thats not the path I want humanity to take.')
