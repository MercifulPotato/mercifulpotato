And its not normal that so many young people are morbidly obese, stay at home do nothings.<p>People are stumbling along and nobody notices how fat everyone is around here, as if its all fine, but maybe they notice but too afraid to speak up. But really its not fine, its actually pretty horrible. And is probably an indication of some sort of toxicity. Maybe like lead poisoning from lead pipes.<p>I also draw a line, I don&#x27;t think we should be wearing space suits to live on this planet. Sorry if that means people will die from exposure to disease.  But thats not the path I want humanity to take.<p>Independent thinkers can often come off as lacking empathy. Expressing empathy is very important in communication, especially If you want to be liked by other people. But as society, I think its crutch too. Its not that I don&#x27;t think we have too much empathy. I think we use empathy to cover up problems, which can be solved. A little temporary pain, can reduce suffering in the long run.')
