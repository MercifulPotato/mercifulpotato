The infrastructure to relay massive scale of streams (even without transcoding) is not cheap.  There&#x27;s only so many streaming minutes at 720p that a single $9.99 nitro sub can support.<p>They also do gif transcoding and a bunch of other things that do take actual compute resources that cost money.')
