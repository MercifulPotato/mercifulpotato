That means that they are responsible for their income and expenditure and have to balance their own books - the government pays for services in the same way that the private sector does. If the OS didn&#x27;t sell its data, the government would have to pay a lot more to have the range and quality of cartographic services that are available.<p>It&#x27;s also worth saying that government departments are free to purchase mapping (or weather) services from other agencies in the free market, and I&#x27;ve seen OSM based providers winning contracts before.<p>Finally, weather data is made freely available by the Met Office, but it is the forecasts are commercial. The same base data is used by eg Meteo Group for their forecasts.')
