Good to know that entire lifetime energy consumption is 50 MWh. At $0.1&#x2F;KWh, youâ€™re looking at $5000 in equivalent electric energy consumption over entire lifetime of a human being.<p>The brain uses 20W of power. For a life time of ~80 years, that is 14MWh of energy usage. Suppose we say the brain trains for the first 25 years then that is 4.38 MWh. Equivalent electric energy consumption is only at $438.<p>So yeah, the brain is quite efficient both in hardware and software.')
