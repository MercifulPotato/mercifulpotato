I&#x27;m someone who has probably flown very close to 1M miles in my life. Spent about 15 years on planes weekly.<p>Flying in my lifetime has moved from being something &#x27;fun and exclusive&#x27; to &#x27;taking the bus with strip searches&#x27;.<p>After 911 none of the airlines really pushed back on the Orwellian security theater its customers were forced thru...I understand it, perhaps it just wasn&#x27;t worth the effort, perhaps enough of their customers <i>wanted</i> more searches.<p>Around 8 years ago, I moved to trying to do online meetings when possible and agreeing to drive for anything less than 8 hours or so. Its been a welcome upgrade in life. As much of a pain as driving 6 hours for meeting is, you strangely feel less stressed out than dealing with the insanity of airports and cattle-cars.')
