I ordered from While Foods four times. Each time I ordered there were issues. In all three orders I received incorrect items. These were not substitutions but just incorrect items I received. For example in 3 of the orders I received regular cola instead of the zero calorie cola I ordered. For the 3rd order I even sent a message to the shopper asking they confirm they grab the zero calorie version because of my past experience. Still received the regular cola. Each order I had to submit for a refund for at least 2 incorrect items. For the 4th order I received notification that it was delivered but it never actually was. I had to get a complete refund for that order.')
