Were it Python, I would agree with it. (Well, not on &quot;guard clauses&quot; per se, but the significance of an implicit vs. explicit nil&#x2F;None return.)<p>It is certainly an issue for polyglot programmers that as well as differences in syntax and behaviorally-visible semantics, language communities have different idioms that impact the communicative semantics of code (having been deeper into Ruby before getting more into Python, it took my a while to stop writing Python with Ruby conventions.)')
