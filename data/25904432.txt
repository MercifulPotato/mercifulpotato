I am a beginner to Rust (this emulator being my second project). I was not aware of that.<p>I feel like when I&#x27;m done I need to find a bit of cash and get a veteran to code review the whole thing. I&#x27;m learning a ton by suffering through it myself.

My understanding is that while it is good to avoid heap allocations, given this is a called-once piece of code, it&#x27;s not really a big deal?')
