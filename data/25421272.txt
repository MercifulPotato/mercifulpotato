After smartphones we have smart watches (the continual minimization of mobile computing) and ar&#x2F;vr (immersive computing).<p>The main driver has always been mobility and minaturization. From mainframes, desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. Also we had ethernet to wifi and cellular.<p>Kevin Kelly had a great talk about screens being pervasive  almost a decade ago. The leap from bulky crt to flatscreen resulted in an increasing number of displays to display all the data we’re receiving. Not only that, but because the displays have become bigger there is more data to be displayed. Ar&#x2F;Vr seems like the next thing since the screen is (paradoxically)  even larger!<p>IoT is interesting because it is a new form of computing (let me know if you think otherwise) as it’s not necessarily meant directly for human-computer interaction, instead it’s machine-machine computing.<p>Voice is another interesting aspect since this type of\ncomputing does not utilize the traditional screen.<p>Apple’s upcoming smart glasses seem like the next logical step (minaturization of mobile computing with an expanding immersive display)')
