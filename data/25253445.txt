Silicon makers themselves are under intense pressure of dotcoms massive negotiating weights. Chasing the Facebook, Amazon, Google trio is not a pleasant experience as many OEMs found out.<p>Unlike hardware makers themselves, and OEMs, there is no way any component manufacturer can simply &quot;turn the switch off&quot; on a dotcom client. Such clients can simply wait out few hardware generations, and buy older products just fine.<p>Now, imagine yourself an OEM, and that a top chipmaker declined to ship him his latest, and greatest chip&#x2F;part. This becomes instantly  less funny. Imagine a graphic card vendor having to ship cards with 3 years old GPUs, or a laptop vendor having to do the same.')
