Item(by='fbkr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602966517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24808742, text='This fails when you want `4 + c` or `c + 4.f` etc. So you either have a gross number of overloads doing the same thing, or you just put an implicit constructor to `complex`.<p>Also, I agree that implicit conversions in general should be avoided, but this complex number example feels like the perfect use case.')
