I have compassion and empathy, but real talk, it is of utmost importance that you get this very specific thing in check.  As an employee, that&#x27;s legitimate grounds for termination; as a new employer, it&#x27;s a lawsuit that will end your business.<p>Learn your triggers, and learn your triggered behaviors.  In my life... that happened over the course of 20 years of failed romantic rationships; seeing harmful behaviors in my partners and doing hard self-reflection to identify those behaviors in myself.  Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck in counseling.  Maybe not?  Progress is hard; setbacks are easy.<p>Once you can recognize that you&#x27;re about to do harm, you can pull yourself away.  Take a mental health day.  Work on something else.  Avoid that co-worker, but be explicit about it: &quot;hey, I can&#x27;t do this right now, can we come back to it tomorrow?&quot;.  Be vague but open about mental health issues -- saying the words &quot;mental health&quot; is great to establish why you&#x27;re stepping back; going into detail about your challenge in the moment is <i>never</i> a good idea, in my experience.')
