Discussions about self hosting development environments will be filled with people claiming it&#x27;s not worth the opportunity cost to spend the time setting up and maintaining anything yourself when you can pay $X per month and make it someone else&#x27;s problem.<p>In the same context, how long does it take to write something like faker.js?  I&#x27;ve never used it, but I see commits that are at least 6 years old and there are 200+ contributors.  Is that 1000s of hours?  I honestly don&#x27;t know.<p>Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s 1000 hours just for an example and that someone worth $100k &#x2F; year could write it.  At $50 &#x2F; hour that&#x27;s $50k if you have have to build it in house and you lose out on the value of having 200+ contributors that are familiar with part of the codebase plus tens of thousands of users exposing bugs and edge cases.<p>So IMHO when you have codebases like this the corporate donations should be in $10k increments.<p>I would never publish a line of code under the MIT license.  It&#x27;s great for companies that want to popularize their platforms (like Microsoft is doing), but it&#x27;s terrible for small developers and you&#x27;ll rarely get any value from those projects.')
