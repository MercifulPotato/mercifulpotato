At that point you might as well move across the country.<p>Frustrating bit to me is how unnecessary this is - just people who bought first protected by prop13 keeping the supply down for others.<p>There’s an irony in seeing people with a Black Lives Matter sign on the lawn, and pushing for No on 22, but when it comes to the most important way to actually help the most people (increasing housing supply) - they instead repeatedly argue against building new or high density housing. And they do this while pretending they’re in favor of housing at the same time.<p>One of the Palo Alto city council members says there’s no housing crisis - you just need a good realtor (like her).
