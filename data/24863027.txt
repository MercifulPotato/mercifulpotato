AmigaOS 4.x is for PowerPC machines which can get pricey.<p>But if you&#x27;re looking to buy a modern PC with an &quot;it just works&quot; OS that asks no effort of you -- nope. See, the thing about putting in no effort is, somebody has to put it in. So effort that you don&#x27;t take responsibility for yourself, you delegate to the vendor -- and you give them license for the same shenanigans Apple and Microsoft are getting up to. Restricting what apps you may run, tracking you through telemetry, and forcing updates on you is perfectly good business sense if you want to cater to the clueless but cannot handle the volume of support calls from them or the risks they present.<p>In reality you&#x27;re probably best served with some common Linux distro. There is probably more software and hardware support for Linux than there is for AmigaOS or RISC OS, which are today primarily of specialty or historical interest and only kept alive because, for example, Amiga people are too stubborn to admit that the Amiga boarded the White Ship bound for the Undying Lands a quarter century ago.')
