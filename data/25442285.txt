Trying to make investors feel they are onto something really advanced?<p>Or just caught up in VC&#x2F;SV speak? Because products that nobody understands have a harder time taking root in the commons.<p>Edit: Literally there is a question above (top at this time) &#x27;What is Vercel?&#x27; - this is my point, a communications failure. If people Googling &#x27;Vercel&#x27; and not getting the answer very quickly, then it&#x27;s a communications problem.<p>Speak in plain English, describe &#x27;what it is&#x27; and the direct material value.')
