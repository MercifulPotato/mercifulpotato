Turns out they don&#x27;t have to be threatened with overwhelming force. They don&#x27;t need to be threatened with death, starvation or torture. They don&#x27;t need to be threatened by economic ruin or untold suffering. No, the richest and most safe civilization ever existed on the face of the planet is ready to give up on freedom because of TV picture and a bunch of talking heads on TV and Twitter that told them there was an &quot;insurrection&quot; (nothing of the sort happened of course) and it&#x27;s time to panic now - and poof, all noble ideals fly out of the window. It doesn&#x27;t take nukes, it doesn&#x27;t take Russians or Chinese, it doesn&#x27;t take death and destruction - it takes Facebook, Twitter and CNN. I am still dumbfounded about how <i>easy</i> it was.')
