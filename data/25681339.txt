The problem was Trump kept bringing up already discredited theories. Then when disputes came to court they weren&#x27;t even about those theories. After the third or fourth time this happened I quit following along, and decided the courts would settle it. I&#x27;d guess that 40% skipped the little research I did, and has only been following the discredited theory part. Get rid of Trump and we&#x27;re on the way to reducing the spread of unfounded theories though. I don&#x27;t know how to fix the rest. Good education maybe, but higher education is looked down on as liberal elites.<p>I&#x27;m aware BLM has become a wedge issue. There are issues they took up like civil asset forfeiture, and reforming mandatory minimums that have widespread appeal. These could be implemented if we had both parties willing to work together to find common ground. Instead Trump calls Kaepernick a son of a bitch, and Pence walks out of a game for a stunt. Then a whole movement is demonized so the issues can be dismissed outright.')
