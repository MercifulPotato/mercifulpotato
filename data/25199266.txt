An old manager of mine at Apple had moved into Apple from NeXT with the WebObjects team. We had a lot of black hardware and tons of NeXT docs, etc. and ran the Austin corp NetInfo server. He worked with Jobs for WebObjects demo&#x2F;keynotes. He told some stories about Jobs, mostly about things he would throw when demos went badly.<p>I still have a lot of NeXT swag that was eventually given away and have a color turbo slab gathering dust.')
