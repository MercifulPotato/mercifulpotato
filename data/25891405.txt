There was a time when SCSI was <i>the</i> hottest hardware for workstations and geeks. When my classmates in the late 90es bought 3D cards for their computers, I was counting every penny to afford an Adapted UltraSCSI controller and disk system. It was really fast and knocked the socks off ATA. My last controller was a 19160U which ran like a dream on Linux and FreeBSD. It was very noise though with a set of 10k rpm drives in my little teenage room.')
