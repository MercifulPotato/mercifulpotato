Fixing a bug or delivering a feature where you haven&#x27;t documented the process, (how the criteria were decided, when it was tested and deployed) is as good a running a web site nobody visits. JIRA hate comes from the bottom up. Developers don&#x27;t like having to have their work parceled out so specifically. But it&#x27;s not for them. It&#x27;s for managers and stakeholders who have to report progress and who are responsible for budgets. If devs aren&#x27;t working on priority items, are off target to timelines, are not following QA process or not following agreed specs then the company could be losing money. And developers are expensive as hell.<p>And I&#x27;ve also never worked anywhere that had a better option than JIRA.')
