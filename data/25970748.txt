From experience, professional traders do tend to use passive indices for part of their PA, but also actively trade a portion.<p>But you&#x27;re right in that if you don&#x27;t have a passion for it, you&#x27;ll never be able to truly outperform spy on a risk adjusted basis. However, if you do have the knowledge and the passion, I definitely think you can.<p>Investing is personal, and just holding spy doesn&#x27;t fulfill everyone&#x27;s objectives.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a strategy that outperforms spy in most cases: 1&#x2F;3 of your portfolio goes to upro (3x leveraged spy) and 2&#x2F;3s goes to a bond fund&#x2F;etf. As long as the bond etf returns above the upro expense ratio (~1%), you will outperform. From my backtests, this strategy will earn you an extra 1-2% return a year, while also having a slightly higher risk adjusted returns.<p>I list the above as a great example because it&#x27;s the kind of strategy that is great for a PA: easy to manage, doesn&#x27;t require babysitting, and backed by solid academic research. When people think active vs passive, they think actively trading single stocks vs just holding an index. My point is that you can use some quant-lite strategies that tilt your portfolio to eek out a little return. You don&#x27;t have to be trading everyday or even holding anything except ETFs.')
