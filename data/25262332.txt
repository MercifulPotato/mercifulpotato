The story in every field is more or less &quot;you&#x27;re not clever enough to engineer good features&quot;; &quot;you might be clever enough to define good symmetries for the feature space in which the features live... maybe&quot; (convolutional neural networks in image problems); &quot;... but maybe not even that&quot; (attention mechanisms).')
