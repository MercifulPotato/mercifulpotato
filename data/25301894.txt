It contains a unique token. You know, the usual way to do basic web form -&gt; server checks via bcrypt or some other password hashing scheme -&gt; generates a long unique token and saves it in a DB -&gt; sends it to the client via a cookie -&gt; that cookie is looked up in the DB for a period of time which will then authenticate the incoming request.<p>This does not require a cookie banner whatsoever.
