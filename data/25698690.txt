Then only users you have created can access your homeserver. Of course anyon in the federation can invite your users to a room etc.<p>&gt; Which makes it seem a bit risky<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a very large risk to running your own homeserver (not more than running other services).<p>A matrix homeserver can require quite some resources depending on how many users you host and how large the rooms are. Also there is some normal administration required (updating, making sure the cert is valid, ...).')
