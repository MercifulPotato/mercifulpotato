I was surpised to learn that they try to scam customers into paying for longer than was intended.<p>They refuse to accept cancellations of their paid premium services for when the paid for duration ends.<p>They insist you to login the day the duration ends to switch to the free mode. If you miss the date (by not much), they say they&#x27;ll cancel and reimburse you.<p>The intent of this scam is clear, they hope you miss the date and pay for one more year. However, they have absolutely no legal standing in refusing the cancellation.<p>I&#x27;m engaged with customer protection organisations against this scam by tutanota.')
