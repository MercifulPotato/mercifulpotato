Registration campaigns also double as get-out-the-vote campaigns, which are thought to affect similar demographics.<p>And yes, Rock the Vote was thought to have a similarly partisan effect. It didn&#x27;t face this kind of organized governmental opposition, because Facebook is seen as being far more influential. But RtV did draw criticism from party officials for its efforts.')
