Amazon already has the monopoly and drove a lot of smaller retailers out of business; the counterfeit problem is not (yet?) causing people to shop elsewhere, probably because for a lot of goods there either isn&#x27;t an elsewhere or the elsewhere is still a worse experience (longer delivery, etc).<p>Our regulatory environment also doesn&#x27;t hold Amazon liable for selling counterfeit and&#x2F;or dangerous goods (bad batteries which catch fire, etc), so there is yet again no pressure on Amazon to do anything.<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t really care whether you get a bad&#x2F;counterfeit item, they get their money regardless. Until this changes there&#x27;s no reason for Amazon to act.')
