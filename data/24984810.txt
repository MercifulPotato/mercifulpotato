Item(by='arghwhat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604442887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974989, text='&gt; Let&#x27;s take a look at Youtube-dl specifically:<p>So you&#x27;re going to take a project that does not at all use emails in their workflow as an example for email based workflows? Brilliant.<p>Have you perhaps considered that maybe, if a project actively used emails in <i>any</i> part of their process, maybe addresses would have been more visible?<p>If only we had the means to write arbitrary relevant text on a page such as the one you linked...<p>&gt; But some starting points matter more than others.<p>It objectively does not. Everyone starts once. It only matters for recruitment. However, as you yourself seem to accept &quot;youtube-dl.org&quot; as an acceptable starting point, which can contain arbitrary information in any form, then there is nothing more to discuss here.<p>&gt; ... is not making progress in that discussion.<p>... Like every argument you&#x27;ve made so far.<p>As this point, I&#x27;ll consider the discussion as over by three-fold repetition. Everything you have presented has already been answered (directly or indirectly), and the counter-scenarios are all faulty (e.g. discussing doomsday scenarious with no ability to share maintainer addresses yet accepting a website, using a non-email based project as reference for an email workflow, yadda yadda).<p>I&#x27;ll take my leave.')
