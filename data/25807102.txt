This would have been an egregious column to post as part of NYT&#x27;s news coverage.  It isn&#x27;t among the worst columns the NYT has published as part of its opinion columns.  There are different standards for the two and different reputations for each department inside the company.<p>Basically what you are doing is blaming Alphabet because it doesn&#x27;t hold YouTube and Google Search to the same standards and Trump was banned from one and not the other.  Those products serve separate purposes and therefore need to have their own independent expectations and practices.')
