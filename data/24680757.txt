Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[24681424], score=None, time=1601833146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680063, text='&gt; Key apps have zero incentive to try to get people to switch to Android.<p>Google Play is less stringent about privacy than Apple (right?), so the same incentives would exist.<p>&gt; Even if there was, there is a prisoners dilemma - it would only work if many of them switched at once.<p>Which would still be true with alternate stores. Nobody wants to be the first to switch to a shady store that customers don&#x27;t trust and abandon the one they do.<p>&gt; Most users do not refuse to use Facebook. New people take up smoking daily. The idea that users would ‘refuse’ to buy apps from a store run by Facebook (or worse) is an idealistic fantasy.<p>Then what&#x27;s stopping them all from switching to Android right now? Why haven&#x27;t they done it already?<p>&gt; As for why apps would switch to other stores? Paid exclusives, just as with every other media type - TV, Movies, Books, Podcasts.<p>That only gets the user to use the store to install one app which they&#x27;re already familiar with. It doesn&#x27;t require anyone to trust the same store for apps they&#x27;re not familiar with. For that to happen the store would still have to establish a reputation for trustworthiness, which would require it to not carry shady apps.<p>&gt; The only choice for users would be to install all of the stores.<p>&gt; The only choice for developers will be to deal with all of the stores.<p>These are obviously contradictory positions. If all the apps were in all the stores, a user would only need to use one of them (presumably the one they like the best). If all the users had all the stores, a developer would only need to be in one of them (presumably the one users like the best, to maximize competitive advantage over alternative apps).<p>The stores still have to compete with each other for users.<p>None of your conclusions make any sense. Competition reduces costs because all else equal people will choose the alternative which takes a smaller profit margin and passes that money to the user or the app developer, which either makes apps less expensive for the same amount of developer revenue, or increases developer revenue at the same price to the user which leads to more and better apps.<p>Monopolies are abusive and inefficient, so removing them makes things better. It&#x27;s why we <i>have</i> antitrust laws.')
