For a few years we had a retired accountant come in and teach (as one of our elective courses) business accounting, stocks, and personal finances. From what I understand he did it for a relatively reduced fee (paid as a substitute teacher).  I took the course one year and it was successful for three years and was a pretty good foundation and has been very useful since. Some parents complained about it tirelessly as a waste of time and that students should be learning shop class and advanced math (that they most likely would never use). Eventually the guy got tired of fighting and quit teaching it and they never replaced him.')
