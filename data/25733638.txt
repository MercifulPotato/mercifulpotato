Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610390107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732579, text='&gt; I reported them when I noticed. I checked back after the<p>&gt; Capitol Riots and the posts were still there. If they had<p>&gt; any moderation it was not at all effective even for the<p>&gt; most obviously unacceptable content.<p>That&#x27;s clearly a failing of the moderation system. I imagine they were very overwhelmed that day, as all social media platforms probably were (including Twitter and Facebook from what I saw).<p>One problem Parler specifically are up against is that they were already unofficially blacklisted in multiple places that would allow them to raise the funding to hire moderators, due to cancel culture and the fear of it. They already couldn&#x27;t get advertising, investments, etc. Now the situation is even worse, and when it reappears, it will likely have even less resources for content moderation.<p>The only way out for them will be to distribute the problem of content moderation as some other platforms have apparently done (I am told Minds do this). Of course you have to rely on randomly selecting a fair jury in order for it to work - something that won&#x27;t happen now.')
