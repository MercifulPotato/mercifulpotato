Perhaps over a longer time period I would think differently, but so far I haven&#x27;t felt it. However, not doing anything is a waste of time. It doesn&#x27;t really give me anything and excessive wasting of time has negative consequences on life. If I were wealthy enough then I&#x27;d probably do it way more.')
