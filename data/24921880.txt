It&#x27;s pretty impressive already, but not everything shown in the video is yet available.<p>What they have put together so far seems well thought-out and, in my opinion, has some advantages and better design decisions vs. e.g. Notion in some respects. In other ways they need to improve, for example lack of a tree navigation makes managing deep page linking more annoying than necessary. But in general, seeing their current pace of progress, I am frankly more confident in their ability to create a good tool than I am in Notion at this point (Notion&#x27;s next big release, theoretically this year, may change my mind again...).<p>Anytype in alpha is faster than Notion on both desktop and web. A good part of this is probably just because it&#x27;s all local. So search is near-instant. Page loading tends to be very fast, etc. It will take a while to get to feature parity with Notion, and until then a full comparison between the two is unreasonable, but there is strong potential.<p>One thing I also particularly like about the Anytype team vs. Notion is the relatively new forum they setup. Unlike Notion they have an actual feature request and &quot;vote&quot; board! So you can see what has already been requested, comment on and upvote it, etc. This is so much better than Notion&#x27;s opaque process and long periods of development inactivity.<p>It&#x27;s early days, but they have some funding and a team that is doing good work so far. I&#x27;m optimistic about the future.')
