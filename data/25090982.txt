An imperfect rule of thumb is that the more granular the lesson, the less useful it is to the future.<p>I think this is throwing away something incredibly important. The way things are today is because of events in the past. Things have <i>provenance</i>. It is important to understand why historians have put so much weight on things like the french revolution and the trappings of the Roman Empire. The <i>specifics</i> of the french revolution are what matter when we consider what happens next. People were thinking about the &quot;ideas of 1789&quot; (and other momentous years during that revolution) when they attempted revolutions again in 1830 and 1848.')
