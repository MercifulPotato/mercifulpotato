You just have to accept you&#x27;re going to do it on both ends.<p>If at all possible I think of client side as &quot;active&quot; validation with lots of feedback and such built in.   Back end is &quot;passive &#x2F; defensive&quot; where validation is more &#x27;nope just not gonna do that&#x27;.<p>Every time I think &quot;let&#x27;s see how much I can do this on the back end&quot; it ends up being kinda wonky, I&#x27;m sure it is possible but just human interaction type stuff, I like it on the front.  Security, detailed rules, etc, back.')
