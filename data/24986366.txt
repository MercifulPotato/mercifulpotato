Only a <i>single</i> company managed to actually fill an FPGA that we had to bump to the next class of the same family.<p>Mostly the usages are just: 1) extra pins to control&#x2F;sequence &quot;stuff&quot; or 2) one single latency sensitive thing or 3) ADC communication.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to think of any company I did work for that was outside those applications--&quot;safety lockout&quot; would probably count.<p>Back in the days of 8-bit micros (yeah ... I&#x27;m old), you would probably offload the PID control loops so they didn&#x27;t clog your micro.  Nowadays, microcontrollers are so powerful and FPGAs are so annoying to program that you&#x27;re better off shunting as much as you can into the micro and minimizing the FPGA.<p>&gt; Plus, as the number of gates and other elements gets larger, sophisticated software with a lot of domain knowledge becomes more important<p>I&#x27;m going to call this out.  I simply don&#x27;t believe it.  The publications of Xilinx and Altera (when there are any) simply look like the same algorithms from 20+ years ago but with Moore&#x27;s Law applied to them.<p>FPGA tools <i>still</i> suck at anything that looks like a &quot;datapath&quot;.')
