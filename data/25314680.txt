I mean you are given some sort of one way access to names of contacts from their database and in return you pay them real money, you are shown ads based on your IP address, who you call, how long and other parameters and the most problematic is the fact that your phone contacts are taken as a payment.<p>I came across this app back in 2011 and noped the fuck away. Never installed trucaller once and my details may be there but I don&#x27;t want it.<p>My question, can truecaller take your contacts not to serve you in particular but to build a wordwide database and they dont say that in clear terms from what I have asked its users. They DONT know the software is doing that')
