Add in WebAssembly, and you can pick from a number of languages -- including those that were traditionally used to write apps not designed to run in browsers.<p>But to the quote: I was cleaning out my basement, which quickly became a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; of sorts since I&#x27;ve been storing things that I took from my parents&#x27; house when I moved out.<p>My favorite find was a CD-ROM that was basically a CD-based Search Engine of the Internet.  It was &quot;Designed for Windows 95&quot; and was probably a free disc given to me by a vendor rep when I worked at CompUSA in my teens.  I&#x27;m tempted to see how many of these actual sites still exist (I&#x27;m sure <i>none</i> of the deep links do).  Incredibly, these things probably sold very well back then.  It even came with a browser (neither Mosaic nor Netscape; no clue who&#x27;s it is).')
