This actually explains it very well. So, in a nutshell, it&#x27;s the difference between apparent and actual complexity, as well as a trust issue.<p>With async&#x2F;await the apparent complexity gets reduced at the cost of vastly increased actual complexity. E.g., now instead of everything being your code that you can look at and reason about, all your concurrent workloads disappear in this void that promises to do the right thing with them. If it works the way you intended, great. If it doesn&#x27;t, the rabbit hole can now be really deep.<p>And then, it&#x27;s also a trust issue. Now you have to trust other people to have done a good job.<p>Ok, yes, this makes sense.')
