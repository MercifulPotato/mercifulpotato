This single book had completely changed my view of the business world more than any other, and it gives one a much clearer understanding of the massive debt load that the United States operates under. I grew up and lived through the 08 financial crisis, losing a home in the process, and hated debt of any sort. Now that I&#x27;ve read this book cover to cover multiple times, my view has completely shifted, and my understanding of stock valuation and cash flow analysis has done nothing but improved.')
