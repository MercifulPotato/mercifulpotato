Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25668236], score=None, time=1610002044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25666314, text='&gt; There are lots of sworn first-person statements, which aren&#x27;t hearsay.<p>That is flat-out not true. Hearsay refers to whether or not the witness actually witnessed the event they are referring to, or is merely recounting what someone told them about the event. Some of the &quot;sworn first-person statements&quot; have the person literally swearing that they <i>heard</i> someone <i>say</i> something, which is literally <i>hearsay</i>. I haven&#x27;t combed through every piece of evidence in every case, but a lot of &quot;sworn first-person statements&quot; basically amounted to hearsay or other statements that could not legally be sustained as evidence.<p>&gt; Actually many of these cases never reached the stage of preventing evidence.<p>The first set of cases <i>did</i> reach that stage, and were often rejected because the evidence they did present was insufficient to sustain allegations.<p>&gt; In a situation like this, demonstrating that the concerns are being taken seriously is more important than actually taking them seriously. The apparent legitimacy of the President is likely to have more of an effect on everything than who the president is, at this point. When these allegations aren&#x27;t seen to be taken seriously it creates the appearance of illegitimacy, regardless of the facts.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem. The people who are alleging this conspiracy--first and foremost Trump himself--are unwilling to sustain any evidence to the contrary. The Trump campaign and affiliates have lost <i>62</i> lawsuits in the past two months (and that&#x27;s not counting subsequent losses on appeal). The legal theories in the most recent lawsuits start making pro se sovereign citizen bullshit look sane. Hell, Michigan has already filed a motion to impose sanctions on the lawyers for making these claims, which is a rare step.<p>And where did that get us? They&#x27;re calling Mike Pence a traitor for not exercising unilateral authority to miscount the electoral votes--an authority that he <i>does not have</i> (read the 12th Amendment for yourself; it&#x27;s not a long document). For the first time in 230 years, a mob has broken into Congress to commit sedition [1] to prevent the election of the next president. Not even in 1861, when the treasonous South objected to Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, did this happen.<p>Why? It&#x27;s not because we didn&#x27;t demonstrate the concerns were being taken seriously. It&#x27;s because way too many people were willing to indulge a delusional conspiracy theory that was ungrounded in truth, and to pretend that frivolous lawsuits that were clearly contrary to all prior precedent fanned [2] that delusion.<p>[1] 18 USC ยง2384: If two or more persons in any State or Territory [...] conspire to [...] by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, [...] they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.<p>The mob that broke into the Capitol is unquestionably guilty of the crime of sedition.<p>[2] I have read several of the lawsuits and their briefs. I actually left a detailed comment about the Texas v Pennsylvania case when it was first filed, explaining 6 different reasons for SCOTUS to toss the case that didn&#x27;t even address the merits at all.')
