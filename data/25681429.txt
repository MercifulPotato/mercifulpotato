They use that tax advantage either for their vanity or else to convert their money into influence.<p>Think of Bill Gates in the 90â€™s vs now. He has far more influence than he ever had, and a large part of it is because of the money he was able to put at a huge tax advantage into his foundation. He probably has a direct line to dozens of heads of state. He probably influences policy across many countries. True, he has used that influence for good, but he got a lot of it at a massive tax advantage.')
