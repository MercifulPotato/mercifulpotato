Even if it is only for a second or two, I don&#x27;t want this to happen to a device that feeds live data into my car&#x27;s controller.<p>Even if this is only level 2 driver assist. If a car would get a bogus &quot;you are crossing a divider line&quot; signal for e.g. 2 seconds, it would start to steer quite persistently (even if with limited force) in a certain direction and you would have to counter that action.<p>Nope, I wouldn&#x27;t use this.')
