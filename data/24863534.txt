Accoridng to one group of people, we should applaud the bets because some pay off and others don&#x27;t. But it&#x27;s not like all bets are equal. Not all start ups are equal. Some people are doing something unique and innovative, and some people are doing a crap version of something everyone else already tried and failed.<p>As well as this, there&#x27;s a whole load of strategy that is specifically designed by startups to minimize wasting resources - fail fast. Building an enormous platform (for which you&#x27;re being sued) and investing billions before you show it to your customer....well that&#x27;s going to fail fast. But not really want we meant. And not only do you want to fail fast, but a $10m launch doesn&#x27;t need to be that successful, if you&#x27;re launching with billions in investment then you need an absolute home run, and to a large extent that&#x27;s what happened here. The investment was so big that you needed to immediately capture a top 3 spot in the market.<p>I have a lot of respect for someone who can say &quot;Ok, we see other people exist, and here&#x27;s why we&#x27;re different&#x2F;here&#x27;s why we&#x27;ll succeed where they failed&quot;.
