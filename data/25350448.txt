They are not lighter. Their battery life isn&#x27;t better. They&#x27;re not objectively prettier. Their case looks worse. They don&#x27;t charge wirelessly. There&#x27;s not a lot of gain to be had in comfort as opposed to earbuds (competing headphones from Bose for example are plenty comfortable).<p>So...from what we already know, they have one thing others don&#x27;t and that&#x27;s the &quot;magical&quot; pairing and switching. And they are $250 more expensive.<p>This means either they sound incredibly fantastic, or they are way overpriced.')
