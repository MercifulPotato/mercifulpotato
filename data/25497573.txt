My point is that whatever inferences you can draw from that aren&#x27;t usefully generalized to Americans being skeptical of what Chinese restaurants put in their food.<p>Skepticism of foreigners and the food they eat is universal to human societies. Enslavement of a distinct minority group, amounting to 1&#x2F;8 of the population, for hundreds of years, and the social and economic consequences that remain when slavery ends and the groups must subsequently live alongside each other, is <i>sui generis.</i> It&#x27;s not analytically useful to look at both things through the same lens. The causes, consequences, dynamics, and solutions are more or less completely different.<p>Skepticism of Chinese food ingredients is much better understood through the lens of the experience of prior generations of immigrants: Germans, Irish, Italians, etc. Anti-German antagonism in World War II accelerated uptake of English in German-speaking communities in the midwest and caused people to change their names; JFK&#x27;s candidacy was met with charges of Popery; and people were actually quite skeptical of Italian food and unfamiliar ingredients like garlic.')
