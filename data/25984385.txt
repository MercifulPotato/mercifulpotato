How much I wish as a teenager I understood how much easier learning Korean could be compared to either Japanese or Chinese. The writing system doesn&#x27;t have 4,000 different characters to remember so it might be possible for me to eventually read Korean as well, but for now I&#x27;m more focused on learning basic phrases. I figure if I have a need or a desire to eventually learn the Korean reading system I can do that later.<p>Any thoughts')
