Indeed, during COVID when I expressed to my boss that I was having a tough time, his immediate response was to ask how he could help and to offer me a couple days off to recharge.<p>And the reason we have that relationship is specifically <i>because</i> we treat each other as friends that also happen to have a working relationship, rather than letting the work relationship dominate all else.<p>Not everyone will have that kind of relationship with their boss, but I believe it is something everyone should aspire to rather than immediately rejecting it as even a possibility.')
