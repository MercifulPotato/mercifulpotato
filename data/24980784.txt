Now the data is showing that using less feminine terms makes women less likely to be hired and we have an article discussing how sexist the hiring process is.<p>The big takeaway from the study is that the language used impact success rate for women but does not have any effect for men, which makes the conclusion a bit odd. If women are punished for violating normative gender expectations, why are not men who use feminine terms punished? Gender norms are generally enforced for both women and men (as is often reported by transgender people). The article does not seem to put much thought on that question.')
