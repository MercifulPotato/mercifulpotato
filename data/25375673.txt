I want your software, but different features&#x2F;licensing. There&#x27;s really not much of a difference between open core and &quot;dual licensing&quot;. I think for open source, there are only a few revenue models that really matter:<p>* Aggregators - Redhat and AWS (and cloud providers). They sell and deliver collections of open source software, driving value from configuration and easier deployment.<p>* Differentiated licensing - Toss all the variations on pay for something other than the GPL version or additional features into this bucket. It&#x27;s a model that is rapidly becoming obsolete.<p>* PaaS &#x2F; Saas - host it for the client. Value is delivered by better operations. Competitors often are aggregators in the form of cloud vendors.<p>* Support &amp; Services - Free software, paid support, paid consulting. This limits the market to larger companies or at least people who need a much higher level of support. Competitors can be other contributors to the code base.<p>* App Store Delivery - I&#x27;m seeing lots of GPL software where the authors are putting the &quot;official version&quot; in app stores (lots of this going on in Windows) and charging for it. Competitors can be anyone who can build and deliver the app, but since many apps need a back end, the hosting of app data can be a moat.')
