Laws that affirm freedom of expression and free speech in the digital space, instead of laws that increasingly punish common behavior in the name of copyright or &quot;think of the children&quot; type rhetoric.<p>I don&#x27;t have much experience in law so I don&#x27;t know if something like this is even possible. Can laws only dictate punishments? Is it possible to use legislation to make encroachments of freedom harder, or does that require a constitutional amendment? Is it a question of financial lobbying power?<p>Perhaps a more legally informed user could chime in about how feasible it is to push for legislation in the other direction.')
