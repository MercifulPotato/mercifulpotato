Item(by='abruzzi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605741771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143223, text='I can completely read Vonnegut&#x27;s &#x27;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&#x27; in about 3-4 hours--just a nice afternoon.  When I read Rushdie&#x27;s &#x27;Satanic Verses&#x27; or Pynchon&#x27;s &#x27;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&#x27; it can easily take me 3-4 months (though if binged, it would probably take a month), not just due to length differences prose style.  Vonnegut is conversational (Pynchon&#x27;s &#x27;Crying of Lot 49&#x27; is almost as easy as Vonnegut&#x27;s books) Rushdie and Pynchon are (usually) dense and complex.  So some books will take most people a lot more time than just binging GoT end to end.  But some aren&#x27;t much more than a long movie.')
