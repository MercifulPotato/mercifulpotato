If you want $15,000 of Bitcoin then you buy an ASIC and pay your power bills in time.<p>That seems extremely wasteful.  Wouldn’t a global tally of IOUs satisfy the same requirements, without having to have this centralised coin stuff?<p>Of the two things it represents — a global ledger, and a money printing machine — all I hear about are people focused on the latter.')
