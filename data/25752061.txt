It is more decentralized since a single actor does not control the system.  You cannot be de-platformed without the consensus of the community and a fork, as opposed to a decision made by a single or small group of actors.<p>&gt; Or does it also serve as a certificate authority somehow?<p>Since you can verify a certificate against a DANE TLSA record which is retrievable from a DNS zone with DS records stored on chain, the CA is no longer required for trust -- only cryptography.  Checkout the paper which goes into far more detail [2].  The entire system actually incentivizes the Internet to become more secure -- which is pretty exciting!<p>&gt; Is it actually more decentralized than DNS<p>It&#x27;s more decentralized than DNS in that the root becomes the blockchain instead of ICANN.  This project simply finishes the beautiful DNS ecosystem, which was already decentralized, other than the root.<p>Now we are all root, democratically.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Q3QbXMFjro0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Q3QbXMFjro0</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;handshake.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;handshake.txt</a>')
