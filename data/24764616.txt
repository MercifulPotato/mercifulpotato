It also helps to set up well-aligned incentives for actually producing good software. Consider this comment by open-source licensing expert Kyle Mitchell [1]:<p>&gt; The value of software lies overwhelmingly in the software. Charging for anything else perverts  incentives. Charging for features? Make it hard to add features. Charging for configuration? Make  it hard to configure. Charging for training or documentation? Make it hard to understand. Charging  for hosting? Make it hard to host, monitor, tune, &amp;c. Not charging at all? Slurp up personal data  on users, and charge for that.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23967773" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23967773</a>')
