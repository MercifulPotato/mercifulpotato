Item(by='heimatau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602215303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726557, text='&gt; I think you&#x27;re underestimating how much _fun_ some people find this sort of recreational trolling.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s fun. It doesn&#x27;t matter if someone paid them money to sabotage another company. The blame for allowing this excessive behavior in a business environment, lays with the leadership, full stop. Management is typically to blame and since CB is tiny, then it lays with the CEO.<p>One could look at even the positive aspect of it. Say a group of coworkers are very close friends (either through work or prior) then they are excessively talking about something. Well, then that situation is the responsibility of their bosses.<p>P.S. I&#x27;ve said my peace. If y&#x27;all <i>still</i> don&#x27;t get it. Go read a few leadership or business management books.')
