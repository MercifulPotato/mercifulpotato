The author omits that 20% of shelter dogs are still euthanized each year, instead using the overall population as the denominator. And the 5,700 dogs being purchased in auction by rescue groups over ten years is pretty insignificant considering that 1.6 million dogs are adopted each year (and the author even highlights the possibility that the dogs may in fact be abused but sees this as hypocrisy on the part of the rescues). The rest is anecdotes about puppy mills. What would have been convincing is an actual example of demand not being met by the supply provided by pounds, or even better, statistics on a possible shift in demographics from mixed breeds to pure breeds in pounds.<p>Also describing strays as living successfully on their own is absurd. Sure some haven’t starved to death or been crippled by random acts of violence by humans. Any one of them would still prefer a home where their physical and emotional needs are met.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aspca.org&#x2F;animal-homelessness&#x2F;shelter-intake-and-surrender&#x2F;pet-statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aspca.org&#x2F;animal-homelessness&#x2F;shelter-intake-and...</a>')
