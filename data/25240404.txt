It got me into programming on our first family pc, a Compaq Presario around &#x27;94. QBasic was accessible on every windows installation from the command prompt. You could read the programming guide built into the editor and have your first running code shortly after. That was its true power.<p>One of my first programs was teaching me french words, asking me to translate them in a random order until I got them all right. It was truly magical.<p>I also made pixels move, trying to write games, but I quickly ran into limitations and problems organizing my code. If you like a small challenge, watch a few minutes of this video about a game called Noita, where in the beginning Q-Basic was used to create some simple physic simulations [1].<p>It was hacky yes, but I think if you&#x27;re starting out, it&#x27;s much more important to get something running quickly than learning how to do it the right way. When people speak of basic, they always seem to have the impression that you&#x27;re spoiled for life after touching it, but I think that&#x27;s wrong. You can always learn more and improve. It&#x27;s breaking down barriers of entry, which is key. A simple editor, with an inbuilt help page and a run button is all you need.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;prXuyMCgbTc?t=102" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;prXuyMCgbTc?t=102</a>')
