In a particular instance, I think anyone can answer it about themselves.  But in the abstract, it&#x27;s a lot harder.<p>Some people have issues with many or all things, and can easily answer &#x27;yes&#x27;.  Some people have no real issues and will easily answer &#x27;no&#x27;.  But there are a ton of people in the middle who have problems with certain situations and it&#x27;s not an easy answer.<p>If you could answer &quot;yes&quot; without having to worry about repercussions, I would recommend that anyone unsure just answer that.  But sadly, that&#x27;s not the way the world works.')
