You can open your network inspector, enable the &quot;Protocol&quot; heading, and look for &quot;h3&quot; requests.  For example, if I visit cloudflare.com right now, I see a bunch of requests with protocol &quot;h3-29&quot;.  If I visit Google maps, I see requests with &quot;h3-Q050&quot;.  (The part after the h3- is the draft number; Cloudflare&#x27;s servers use draft 29; Google uses their own thing which identifies itself as Q050.)')
