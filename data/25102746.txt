Fox News has the benefit of being readily available via every major cable TV carrier in the US, Trump TV may pull a few members of the MAGA crowd further into their echo chamber, but I doubt that it has any real chance of doing much to the crown jewel of the Murdoch news empire. Maybe if he siphons off one of the more popular talking heads, but even then, how many people will really follow Hannity or Carlson if it’s not as simple to access their content?<p>What will be interesting is how Fox News would react - what’re the chances the commentary shifts harder against Trump to combat competition, but dividing conservatives along the way versus continuing to toe the line and kowtowing to a perceived Trump stranglehold on the right?')
