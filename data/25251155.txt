I&#x27;d be interested in reading more if you have sources.  Genuinely asking, I know almost nothing about deflation other than what I just read on Wikipedia [1].  My generation has had to grapple with the negative effects of <i>inflation</i> combined with low interest rates and wage stagnation, so I&#x27;m genuinely curious to hear about a different time&#x2F;place where long-term deflation caused problems.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deflation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Deflation</a>')
