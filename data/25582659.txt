It would allow two players their own screen in POV mode.<p>I used to work at a video rental store so I had access to two TVs, two PS1s, this cable, and the space to set it up. It&#x27;s a lot of setup when you could just play the game normally on one screen. Still neat.<p>That aside, Bushido Blade to me is still the best fighting game. If they revamped the location damage detection, and redid the graphics, I would rebuy it in a heartbeat. Most people favour the sequel, but to me it lost a lot of the charm and simplicity the first one had.<p>One hit kills really spice up fighting games for me. Positioning and timing are even more crucial then in other games.<p>The &quot;juggling&quot; and ten button combos really take the fun out of the genre for me. (nothing against the other games, just not my cup of tea)<p>I haven&#x27;t found another like it. HMU with recommendations if I missed a game!')
