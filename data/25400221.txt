Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607796895, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398582, text='&gt; What about prepaid credit cards with payment limit? If the payment failed the service will be terminated?<p>Never used one for this purpose but since billing happens after the fact (and monthly), AWS won&#x27;t be aware of the limit until after the monthly billing occurs. Theyâ€™ll just tell you the card failed and you have a billing liability to take care of (and give you some time to fix it) while still letting you rack up additional debt with services running <i>after</i> the billing fails; they definitely won&#x27;t cut you off when you&#x27;ve reached the level that would meet the limit on your card (and couldn&#x27;t even in theory without realtime notification of other charges against the card, even if they were inclined to.)')
