It is the union of countries that had the primary goal to return monarchy to the power in France. The coalition included UK, Germany, Austria, Holland, Russia.\nWhen did the first Coalition started? In 1792.<p>When Napoleon did gain power in France? In 1799. So the anti-republican wars started before his actions.<p>How many anti-French coalitions there were? Eight!<p>The European rulers were frightened to death about revolution spread in their countries and started the wars against France. The goal of Bourbon Restoration was temporary achieved only in 1814.<p>Now, the article claims that Russia started the war against France because the Tsar did not want to join the England blockade.\nReally? :)\n England had been fighting France for 20 years, blocking each other economically. Russian forces already had had many battles against France before 1812, and the country was in the first Coalition. \nHere we go, a conventional story where “bloody Napoleon was terrifying the whole Europe”.<p>The fear of revolution against slavery in some countries were not theoretical. Russia was under peasants mutiny during the Napoleon wars. The Tsar savagely choked the rebellion movements.<p>The history should be based on facts.')
