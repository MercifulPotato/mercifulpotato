They know their readers won&#x27;t actually read the whole NYT article in question, so they shamelessly misrepresent it.<p>NYT is reporting on something that happened and providing context. They <i>interview the girl who got cancelled</i>, which means she gave them permission to use her name and direct quotes. They paint her in a very sympathetic light. They don&#x27;t demonize her at all. They allow her to repeatedly say that she was young and behaving like a typical thoughtless teenager.<p>&gt; <i>The New York Times has opted to assist a teenager&#x27;s desperate quest to ruin the life of a young woman who said something stupid when she was 15.</i><p>So what does Reason want?<p>Should NYT ignore the story altogether, even though it&#x27;s of public interest (as a microcosm of cancel culture)? Should they write it only from the perspective of the girl who was cancelled?<p>They did what they should have done, which is try to get into the heads of both students. Their attempts to sympathize with the white student will anger some liberals, and their attempts to sympathize with the Black student(s) will anger some conservatives.<p>This is just Reason intentionally ignoring half the article to throw some rage-chum into the water for their readers.')
