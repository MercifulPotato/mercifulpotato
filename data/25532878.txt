You need rules and standardization to be able to trade effectively.<p>If everyone is happy and close by, trade is simple. But as soon as there&#x27;s conflict, it becomes messy, especially if the trade is international, and spread over time.<p>Let&#x27;s say I order a few containers of cucumbers from you. A couple of months later they arrive, I open the containers and inspect the cucumbers, but find out that they&#x27;re wrong. The colour is wrong, or the shape is wrong, or it&#x27;s the wrong cucumber species. I complain and say that I can&#x27;t sell these in my country, consumers wouldn&#x27;t want to buy them, but you just say that in your country you call these things cucumbers, and customers would happily buy them.<p>I paid for cucumbers, you shipped cucumbers, but our respective <i>definition</i> of cucumbers are not the same, so now we have an international trade conflict.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly what the &quot;ridiculous&quot; EU trade rules solve. They set up common shared definitions of stuff that gets traded so that everyone agrees what a cucumber is, and so that the above scenario doesn&#x27;t happen. So you <i>have to</i> write down the accepted curvature and greenish hue a cucumbers has to have to be called a cucumber, even if you think it&#x27;s ridiculous.')
