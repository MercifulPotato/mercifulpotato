It&#x27;s taking people with shit job prospects and starting them on a good career.  I went through something like this, got paid ~33k for a year and had similar repayment conditions and non competes.  I did my time, left that initial shithole of a company, and embarked on a lucrative career.  It&#x27;s no exaggeration to call it a life changing opportunity.<p>I find it interesting to compare getting hired at these places to the big tech firms.  I&#x27;ve applied to places with collectively thousands of open engineer roles.  But they all have a process to find a reason not to hire you.  Like one place I did well on 3&#x2F;4 coding challenges and kind of bombed the system design interview. None of these companies will look at that and say, well this person has potential let&#x27;s give them a chance.  They all will say, well they don&#x27;t raise the bar so let&#x27;s just keep our dozens of needed roles unfilled.')
