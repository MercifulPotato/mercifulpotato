Nobody is going to be perfect on stopping that either. From kids uploading explicit content of themselves to tiktok and snapchat to people cross-uploading random videos they found from other porn sites purely for the ego of the view count to actual intentional spreading of childporn.<p>pornhub is not the only user upload powered adult site out there, they just happened to be one of the few that actually has and enforced rules against extreme content like rape, so i don&#x27;t know why they got targeted other then they are #1.')
