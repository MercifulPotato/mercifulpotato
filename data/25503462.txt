Taking trunc(32, hex(sha512)) will still give you a result that is stronger cryptographically than taking the 32 characters hex(md5sum) would give you.<p>For more security, you of course can encode the sha512 hash in a format other than hex in order to let those 64 bytes be fewer characters. The hex encoding is only one of many encodings.<p>But the main point is that the solution to needing to store a shorter value is not to use a weaker hashing algorithm, but to truncate the result.<p>This is the reason that sha-512&#x2F;256 exists as a truncated sha-512 even though sha-256 already existed.')
