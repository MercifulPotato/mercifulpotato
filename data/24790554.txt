For most people they could easily use it.  However the moment updates don&#x27;t install correctly kills it for them.  Windows is great if you never shut down your computer during an update or always give them the time to apply.<p>My main beef with it is the telemetry and inconsistent UI. It&#x27;s far better than it was 10 years ago but nobody wants to be dealing with that.  It&#x27;s annoying.  I can deal with program crashes or some minor feature not working right.  I can&#x27;t deal with random UI changes, random resetting of settings, and uploading usage data behind my back.<p>Windows will always just be a tool (slowly becoming an integrated Azure client) to me and nothing more.  It&#x27;s a great fleshed out customizable-as-Microsoft-allows tool.  But it is hardly what it needs to be to quit non-creatives from migrating to iPads and smartphones.')
