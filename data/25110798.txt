I&#x27;ve been using it using it under Fedora as it is the default there and the results have been good. There are some issues to be aware of as screen sharing and remote desktop not working entirely as they should, but it&#x27;s been solid otherwise.<p>If you have Ubuntu installed I believe you can change the session to Wayland when signing in. Or give Fedora a spin, it&#x27;s my favourite mostly vanilla GNOME experience.')
