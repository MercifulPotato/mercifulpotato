You are misinformed about the tawdry reality of asset seizure in the United States.<p>If the police take assets from you, you might think you get them back unless you&#x27;re convicted of a crime. Far from it: you must prove the <i>innocence</i> of your seized assets to get them back, and good luck with that.<p>That this exists at all is a scandal and a moral hazard. Seizure should be strictly temporary until a conviction is obtained, and the burden of proof that assets are illegally obtained should be on the state, rather than the opposite, <i>and</i> the value of all seized goods should go into a Federal general fund, rather than retained by the local jurisdiction.<p>Until this is the case, and good luck with that reform, it is simply state-sanctioned theft. Nothing else.')
