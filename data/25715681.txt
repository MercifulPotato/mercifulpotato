The deeper, conspiracy-minded parts of the MAGA community are verifiably dangerous.  They said for weeks that a storm is coming, that they were going to take washington, that congress had to be stopped, that the vice president should be executed, etc...<p>And then on Wednesday they made the attempt.<p>Comments like yours are predicated on this idea that speech itself can only ever be merely &quot;irresponsible&quot;.  But... the world isn&#x27;t like that.  If you spend years making &quot;jokes&quot; about insurrection, you eventually find someone attacking congress.<p>[1] Edit to answer the question below: you are falsely equating harmless anarchic geeks of the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s with violent terrorists.  It&#x27;s not appropriate to manage these communities using the same tools.')
