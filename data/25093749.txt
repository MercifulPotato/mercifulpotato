For a long time, the Intel i5&#x2F;i7&#x2F;i9 were the processors of choice for gaming, but AMD&#x27;s Ryzen line has been making remarkable inroads, with the recently released Ryzen 5000 series boasting performance that competes or tops Intel&#x27;s top chips in the space, and generally with lower power draw to boot.<p>I&#x27;m not a tech journalist, but the way they seem to have done this was exactly what was described in this essay. AMD brought out &quot;chiplet&quot; designs, initially at the low end, but with significant performance gains generation over generation. Combined with simpler motherboard slot conventions, delay&#x27;s in Intel&#x27;s next-generation processes, and overperforming Intel in areas like streaming, the value case for buying AMD processors in this space has grown to the point where you would find very few enthusiasts who would strongly recommend Intel over AMD if you&#x27;re building a new system and wanted the best performance at your price point.<p>Seems the infighting issues described by another poster have not only affected Intel&#x27;s competitiveness in the mobile space.')
