Moving is basically the worst.<p>Most movers are not end to end and there&#x27;s a broker network in between.

You can go higher end though and I think get decent service.<p>It&#x27;s too bad you couldn&#x27;t move via the military as they are pretty reliable.<p>My rules for long distances moves is to sell everything I have and only ship the essential.  Then insure that cargo.  When something is insured they seem to be less likely to lose it.<p>Outside of moving, I look at Amazon fakespot reviews but I try to not buy anything third party.  Even then the drones I bought turned out to be turds.  For other things I use reddit.  And for cars I try to find the a website forum that specifically addresses the brand or model.')
