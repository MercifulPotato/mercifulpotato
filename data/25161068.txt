Georges Lemaitre, a Catholic priest who came up with the Big Bang Theory. Look at all the scientific work of the Jesuits, their big research universities, etc. There are countless examples of groundbreaking science coming from religious institutions - and this is just from one world religion that I am most familiar with. Many Islamic and Jewish scholars have also been scientists.<p>These deeply religious people believe that naturalistic observations can get us closer to the ultimate truth of God. There is no purely empirical argument that can be made to refute that worldview - you must turn to philosophy and contend in that arena.')
