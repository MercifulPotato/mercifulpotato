They claimed lack of demand and doubled down on supercharging instead.<p>A company named Better Place got a ton of VC funding to set up a battery swapping service for electric cars, and flamed out spectacularly.<p>Perhaps NIO can succeed where Tesla and Better Place failed, but I&#x27;m doubtful.   OTOH, Shanghai is probably a great place to start.')
