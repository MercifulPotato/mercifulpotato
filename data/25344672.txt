I certainly wouldn&#x27;t expect a bridge to fail given modern safety standards.<p>You might have marginally more confidence in the bridge after a few hundred thousand cars, but we have processes in place to be confident within reasonable doubt that things are safe before that.<p>No one is claiming that anything is &quot;100% safe&quot;. That&#x27;s an unachievable level of confidence. If everyone waited for a hundred thousand other people to do anything we&#x27;d never get anywhere.')
