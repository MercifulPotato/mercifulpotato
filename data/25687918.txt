I was hoping to lead you here without saying it explicitly, but that is what I was getting at when I asked what it meant to &quot;have faith&quot;. It means to hold a belief that cannot be rationalized.<p>With the above inconsistency in mind we can explore what it means to &quot;prove something false&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-does-it-mean-to-prove-something-false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-does-it-mean-to-prove-something-f...</a><p>The top answer here summarize the current state of our understanding. The key terms on which to focus are &quot;inconsistent&quot; and &quot;contradiction&quot;. Can you see how believing in something that cannot be rationalized is inconsistent or a contradiction? It is the <i>belief</i> in a religion itself that is the contradiction. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether any specific event can be proved true or false (again that is not my point). My point is that &quot;having faith&quot; is to recognize this contradiction and choose to believe anyway. By simply &quot;having faith&quot; you are, <i>yourself</i>, proving it false.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say having faith is a bad thing! I will again commend organized religion as a valuable tool to both the individual and society. People are not rational. Feelings are not rational. I genuinely believe that the good that comes from religion outweighs the bad. That doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t recognize it for what it is...<p>And I am not an atheist! I guess it depends what you mean be &quot;God&quot; though... I don&#x27;t believe in any region as an ideology, but I do believe in religion as an institution (I do go to church on occasion): Was there a person name Jesus? Probably. Did he inspire good things? Mostly likely. Are the lessons we learn from his story valuable? Absolutely! Did he turn water into wine? No. Did he rise from the dead? Of course not.<p>In this way I believe in religion, but I don&#x27;t &quot;have faith&quot;.<p>[0] The word &quot;myth&quot; does not always denote something that is false.')
