I was actually quite surprised when the test I decided to take in the interest of an abundance of caution returned positive, and that afternoon (day 4 of active symptoms) was when my sense of smell &amp; taste completely turned off. It went from &quot;my coffee tastes weak this morning&quot; to &quot;olfactory sensation has 100% vanished&quot; in the course of a few hours. And for anyone who keeps saying you can lose smell&#x2F;taste from a cold or the flu - in my personal experience, that is due to sinus blockage or drainage. This is a completely different sort of loss. I could breathe completely clearly through my nose and there was still absolutely nothing. Other symptoms were gone within 8-9 days of initial symptoms, but it took a full week for any sense of taste to come back and almost three weeks for it to return to normal.')
