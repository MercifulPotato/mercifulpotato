On iOS it&#x27;s even more complicated if you wanted to write an app for your iPhone and share it with friends - expensive developer subscription &amp; draconian app review!<p>So my worry is we will loose a generation of developers who would otherwise get to coding and sharing of their creation on PCs if their first and only device is a locked down cosume-only device like an iPhone.')
