Maybe auto-conversion could happen in the background while I cut with low-res?<p>I do support the popular formats for now. What do you mean by &quot;conversion&quot;? In my mind, that clearly happens when you import the file into the project.<p>At export, I do go through the original videos, to get the highest res for each video frame. If this is what you mean by auto-conversion, that is possible, but not sure how advantageous it would be - it takes a lot of CPU + GPU (even if in the background) and may disrupt your editing. I will dig deeper into this.')
