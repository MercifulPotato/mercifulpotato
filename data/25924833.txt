But even then, in a lot of places there are impartiality requirements on media outlets, as flawed as they may be.<p>The &quot;Public Square&quot; assumes the space is owned by... well the public. Either the town or city. That&#x27;s not the case here. Even if it were, the reach of a person in the public square is tiny... a few hundred people if they are absolutely lucky.<p>Besides... your rights in actual public squares haven&#x27;t changed a bit. Save the fact that COVID has shut down many public spaces.<p>&gt; But then what if I start buying out every printing press in town?<p>You mean the way Clear Channel <i>has actually bought up</i> a huge percentage of radio stations?<p>The way big right wing corporations have bought up the majority of local television stations in the country?<p>Is it &quot;fair&quot; that the majority of television broadcast stations are owned by a few right-wing media companies?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, all three &quot;competing&quot; local broadcast television stations are owned by the same company now.<p>I&#x27;d love to know why people think it&#x27;s super important that Facebook and Twitter cease their supposedly &quot;biased&quot; curating while so many broadcast companies which reach 10s of millions of homes get a free pass.')
