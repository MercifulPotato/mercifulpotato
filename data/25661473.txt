If I want a reciprocal, I will just type the two parts of my query in the opposite order. I&#x27;d even say they&#x27;re confusing because you have to look at them understand why there are two numbers.<p>(Also on the subject of flags, I&#x27;d like one that suppresses the first two lines of output but not the prompts like &quot;You have:&quot;.)')
