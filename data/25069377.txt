You could use it super easily and by holding open a connection and pushing down little json or XML payloads you could build all sorts of things easily in JavaScript. I even saw super basic chat functionally built using two Iframes a form in one and the chat log pushed back from the server as a stream of valid but open ended HTML abusing how lax the browser was about parsing missing certain closing tags at the time.
