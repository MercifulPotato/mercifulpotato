So when it comes to competition there is none and they make sure nothing threatens their Oligarchy. Trudeau like others, promises to go after them every time there is an election and then does shit like everyone before him. I&#x27;m sure there is a payoff somewhere in there for him and the others.<p>Any money he throws at this will be tax payer money and it&#x27;s just a different way of separating the masses from their wealth and funneling more of it to Big Telco. He will never offer any kind of support to companies like SpaceX since they are not part of the club.<p>Just good old corruption in plain sight of the masses. He knows they won&#x27;t do anything about it and there are millions in favors he has coming when he decides to leave Government.')
