I would be surprised if the main cause ended up being different than this collective intuition.<p>Men are generally lauded by society for casual dating and &quot;spreading their seed,&quot; while women receive the opposite treatment. They are still generally honored for being very selective in their dating and only engaging in a monogamous relationship with the best mate.\nHence, many men end up trying to sleep with most women on Tinder, while not committing to a monogamous relationship. While more women are trying to find the best mate that will commit to a monogamous relationship.<p>Note: The above only applies to hetero dynamics. I&#x27;m ill informed on lgbtq+.')
