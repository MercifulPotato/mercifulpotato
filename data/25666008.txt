Almost sounds like a pro-gun argument to me but I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t mean to be one. The victims must be victims because the evils are evil right. That their own actions or inactions makes them the victim just doesn&#x27;t fit the victim mentality of some. Its just one of many things that shows how they are so out of touch with reality. Did no one ever told these leftist that life isn&#x27;t fair, that people dont play by the rules, that having right doesn&#x27;t mean you also get it? We should strive for the perfect world but it will never exist and only a fool would walk the earth as if it where paradise already.')
