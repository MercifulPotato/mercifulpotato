The commitment to isolated testable units of code is what generates abstractions of dubious value.<p>Don&#x27;t use a class where you could use an interface: easier to mock. Don&#x27;t use a static method where you could use an instance method on a collaborator: easier to inject, replace and mock. Your object graph getting too hard to compose, or other design smells? Don&#x27;t worry, we have tools to handle the complexity, so you don&#x27;t have to try and reduce it.')
