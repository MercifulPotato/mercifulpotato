Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610473819, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747234, text='&gt; What I think internet 3.0 will be is websites and services segregated politically, just like the media is. Just like we have CNN and Fox, we will have Twitter and [Parler?] Facebook and Rightbook.<p>That defeats the connection desire of user-generated content.  I&#x27;m on FB mainly to learn what my friends&#x2F;family are up to (and see cute animal pix and some maths jokes).  If a bunch of them were on {right,left}book and I were on the other I&#x27;d miss out as would they.<p>If the political claptrap self-segregated into verticals that would be fine by me.  FB would still work.  Of course such arrangements are not stable as terms like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; aren&#x27;t really meaningful (the 1950s &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; enthusiasts would not recognize how those terms are used today).')
