It&#x27;s not the solution it claims to be.<p>I could write a list of criticisms of Matrix&#x27;s software products, organization, and track record, but the main problem is that we want an ip-native comms tool that&#x27;s &#x2F;actually&#x2F; decentralized.<p>Matrix is Open Source, federated, self-hosted Slack (plus voice calls). That&#x27;s great, but that leaves you needing to trust a homeserver admin or host your own homeserver. Putting aside that there STILL isn&#x27;t a finished homeserver implementation, you&#x27;ll have to rely on a third party no matter what. Either it&#x27;s hacker Joe (the admin of your homeserver), or the server hosting company that hosts your homeserver, or the DNS registrar who legally has to have your real identity...<p>It may be theoretically possible to host a homeserver without a domain name, but you&#x27;d still need to register your real name with an ISP to get a static IP.<p>Freedom from this kind of control should be baked into the software. Plenty of teams have tried it (retroshare, Scuttlebutt, etc.) but unfortunately none of them are quite there yet.')
