With the perceived &quot;free healthcare&quot; the use increases a lot and the limited resources cannot scale up to infinite, so you either have a very long wait time or get the almost nothing left.<p>This is the situation in most of countries with this system. It is mathematically impossible to get what you dream of. In countries like USA the demand is heavily filtered by prices, so people get what they afford to, if you take the filters out  you will be left with nothing very fast. I hate the system in US, but at least it gives a chance to people who can afford it; here, everybody is equally screwed. The only thing that works well here is giving birth, that is free, you can cover that by the state or federal in US too, but that&#x27;s about the limit.')
