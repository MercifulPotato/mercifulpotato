That is a very interesting use case. Do you mind emailing me at david AT retool? We&#x27;ve previously built something like this, but for Excel (you upload an Excel template, and we pull in data from various APIs [e.g. SFDC, JIRA, etc.] and fill it into the xlsx file). If you&#x27;re interested in using Retool for it, I&#x27;d love to chat and learn more about the use case. (I bet there are many others who have a similar use case, hah.)')
