When we look back at history we see that the big 3 took a number of anticompetitive actions over the years while managing to usually avoid government action through careful planning. (GM at times would hold back products in those decades, knowing if they went over a magic number of market share it was bad news.)<p>But look at the RESULT. Look at 2008. Look at the future of self driving cars and the future of the trucking industry.<p>By letting large monopolies run unchecked, they embed their ways of dependence into society such that impacts can be felt for generations.<p>Maybe its not about the number but what the damage is.<p>Edit: hit reply early, sorry.<p>The big 3 managed to get taken down by the factors of the oil embargo and the growing Asian auto industry, but we still felt the effects I listed above.<p>And, to that end, its worth restating that GM specifically tried to &#x27;avoid&#x27; fitting the government definition.')
