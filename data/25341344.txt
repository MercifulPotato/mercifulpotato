Machine A is NATted, B uses a public address. A always gets the error within 50-60 fetches. B doesn&#x27;t (I ran the test a number of times for a few seconds each). I even ran them both concurrently (repeated the test on A since it keeps failing) but it was always A that got the error.<p>I am wondering if this is modem related -- may be they silently &quot;upgraded&quot; it or changed some default such as TCP checksum offload? Just guessing, I haven&#x27;t checked.<p>Experiment 2:\nI switched machine A to use a public address (from my static IP address block) and the problem disappeared! I then switched it back to the way it was and still there are no errors. Not sure what to make of this...')
