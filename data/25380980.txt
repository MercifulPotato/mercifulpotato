I had an experience a few years ago with Canadian Tire where I chose in-store pick-up for an online purchase. The people at the store looked at me like I was from Mars. They didn&#x27;t have the item in stock, and the manager actually told me that<p>1. he couldn&#x27;t refund me because it was two separate computer systems (a lawyer would have told him tough sh*t - you&#x27;re still the same company), and<p>2. I should do a credit-card charge-back to get my money back!<p>It&#x27;s been years since, and I&#x27;m trying them again now. I ordered a set of dumbbells yesterday and ... still no email to come pick up my in-stock dumbbells.<p>BTW - I have wide feet too. If you&#x27;re looking for running shoes, ASICS is good (this is the brand I always wear), and I&#x27;ve heard New Balance is pretty wide too. I can&#x27;t wear Nike or Reebok for this reason.')
