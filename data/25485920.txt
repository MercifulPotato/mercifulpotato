If it had been faster or with better power consumption it would&#x27;ve been fine. There was a massive push to get Android studio to automatically compile X86 binaries for you etc.<p>But why would you put an Atom in your phone if it means it&#x27;s slower and worse battery life? That&#x27;s the reason it flopped. ISA change is a hindrance for switching, but it can be overcome. Even if Intel had sold Atom chips with ARM ISA and identical performance to the X86 variant it would have still flopped due to the poor performance and efficiency.')
