Not only did everyone in the UK know who they were voting for in terms of individual leadership, but very much in terms of policy. It was also an &#x27;issue election&#x27;.<p>The affirmation of &#x27;Boris to complete Brexit&#x27; was clear, democratic and decisive (however people may disagree with the result).<p>Voters clearly &#x27;had their say&#x27;.<p>The EU does not have any such relevance in terms of issues, ideology, leadership, policy, participation, regulatory clarity, which makes it&#x27;s democratic credentials kind of questionable.<p>They do some good work though, it&#x27;s just going to be a problem when the are at odds with the people.<p>Edit: I should add, the fact there was no public awareness at all of Von der Leyen - there was no opportunity for scrutiny, press inquisition, background awareness - is obviously problematic from a democratic perspective.')
