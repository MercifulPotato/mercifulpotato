Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603985096, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931408, text='I actually don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to &quot;make the observation&quot;.<p>There are multiple issues at play here:<p>Who is paying this person and what do they have to gain from people panicking and selling shares?<p>How is this an observation given the title? It&#x27;s a proclamation. I can write the exact same article and say that the current climate is here to say.<p>Putting your investments where your mouth is shows that you don&#x27;t have a specific agenda and that you&#x27;re being honest and truthful in your writing. I don&#x27;t advise people to do things I wouldn&#x27;t do, why should we give market &quot;journalists&quot; a pass?<p>If you literally write an article proclaiming &quot;The Stock Market is on the Edge of a Historic Crash&quot; then there&#x27;s no honest reason why if you wrote that and believe it that you would have any problem whatsoever in showing the audience how you adjusted your trading strategy. Anything besides that to me is horseshoe, which is why I never read or pay attention to these articles.')
