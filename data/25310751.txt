It seems people think this is like academia -- it&#x27;s not. There are no guarantees of tenure at a private company, even one with a research culture. If she wants that, then give up the paycheck and go back to academia. Google doesn&#x27;t owe her anything. (I bet she&#x27;ll get a decent settlement.)<p>AI ethics are important and I&#x27;m willing to bet that the Google execs want to know about biases and other problems in their products and probably don&#x27;t care that much what is published. They probably don&#x27;t want high maintenance researchers that cause them headaches and are obsessed with microaggressions, etc. I expect that this stuff has been a distraction for too long and they are happy to be rid of this and happy for the signal it sends across the company.<p>I have little sympathy or concern for Ivy educated elite in-fighting. There is probably a huge number of qualified people just dying to have the opportunity to work there, have access to those resources and do research.')
