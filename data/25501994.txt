It also depends on qualification and eventual productivity.<p>As I started this argument, the goal of an employer is to pay as little as possible for given work. Let&#x27;s turn this argument around: if male and female are equally qualified, what would make anyone pay male _more_? If a female accepts to work for less, than she&#x27;s going to be hired in the first place!<p>So, maybe females are paid less because they are less productive on the average? It&#x27;s quite plausible, because they objectively have more distractions then men (giving birth, raising children, etc) . This is a rather valid reason to compensate them with higher pay, but presenting it as &#x27;equal pay for equal fork&#x27; is an intentional deception.')
