Just some of the things the CIA is notorious for.<p>Imagine if the Soviet Union had made endless TV series and movies about the heroic deeds of the KGB. It would be quite rightly laughed out of sight as the most absurd, batshit propaganda.<p>And yet that is what&#x27;s pumped out in the US year in, year out, about the CIA. And it works.<p>Edit: Pretty sinister that since posting this HN is now preventing me from posting and replying. Note to others: don&#x27;t question the CIA.<p>Edit 2: Since I can&#x27;t reply to the post asking about which shows are CIA propaganda, shows like Covert Affairs, The Agency, Burn Notice, Homeland, Alias, and others, which AIUI have current or former CIA advisors and guided tours of Langley for the producers and cast.')
