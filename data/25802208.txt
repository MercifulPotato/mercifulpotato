I&#x27;d like to add that Go gets out of the way like I&#x27;ve never experienced before (having worked with Python, .NET, Java (Spring), C++, Rust, Javascript). Very good tooling and a standard lib that is great (e.g. networking) to mostly good enough (e.g. xml).<p>Developer productivity is unmatched with Go. Focus is almost always on the problem to solve not on language features (I&#x27;m happy for generics to come but really don&#x27;t need them), memory management &#x2F; borrow checker or build tools &#x2F; config (gradle et all).<p>Rust is a formular 1 car. Use it when you need it and be aware that it has substantial costs developing and maintaining (immature ecosystem).')
