I started working in this area in the early 90s so I have both nostalgia for the old days but still excited about new stuff we&#x27;re coming up with.<p>Things I don&#x27;t miss:<p>- Managing IRQs on the ISA bus or more generally messing with the BIOS<p>- dedicated keyboard&#x2F;mouse connectors<p>- physical serial and parallel ports<p>- large plug-in cards<p>- incompatible monitors (Hercules, CGA, VGA, ...)<p>Nowadays most of our external equipment (motion controllers, sensors, barcode readers, etc.) is either USB or Ethernet and I think that transition happened maybe 10 or 15 years ago? It&#x27;s just so much easier now with fast-enough external busses.<p>I think part of the problem with a 100 yr scheme is that you really only get economies of scale with highly integrated memory and other support chipsets with physical standards that change as manufacturing capabilities get better.<p>So at the two extremes there&#x27;s the hobbyist track (RPi&#x2F;Arduino) and there&#x27;s all the amazing tech crammed into our phones for a ridiculously low price.')
