They tore up roads and made a mess and generally failed all around.  Finally, they pulled out completely and left us high and dry.  It was a pretty bad time, really.<p>I just checked my address in the Google Fiber website and it says that it&#x27;s &quot;coming soon&quot; to my home.  I wonder what that means.  Did they stop digging up roads?  Are they doing something different now?  What&#x27;s changed in the past 3 years that allows them to suddenly come back to the cities that they abandoned?<p>NOTE: Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not completely unhappy with Google as I have AT&amp;T Gig Fiber thanks to Google Fiber scaring the incumbents into action.')
