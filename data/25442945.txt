Using one of the other just changes when&#x2F;why I have to work around the distro.<p>Arch usually has more small &quot;papercuts&quot; I have to fix myself - often problems around suspend&#x2F;power management or drivers, in my experience. Ubuntu and the likes I usually struggle either when I encounter some bug OOTB (meaning that won&#x27;t get fixed in a timely manner because &quot;stable&quot;) or once I need some package that&#x27;s just not there. Having to figure out what are the damn dependency equivalents for some program I&#x27;m trying to compile that only has Arch instructions is never fun.<p>Obviously YMMV.')
