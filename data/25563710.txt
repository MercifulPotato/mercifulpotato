That’s a really long space in between contacts. Ideally the whole interview marathon at multiple companies should be packed into a couple weeks so you can drive a bidding war so to speak.<p>If they know you are interviewing elsewhere then it should be closer to 2-3 days max contact gap. Tip: If you don’t hear back from A, maybe you’ll have an on-site scheduled with B, and then you can ping A with that info “for scheduling purposes” and trust me you will suddenly hear back if they are interested. Again, urgency is your friend here.')
