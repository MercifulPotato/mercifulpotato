Much of it is just based on their observations of the world and experience within.<p>The problems is that as parents we often just group all kids together in how we treat them.  They think it&#x27;s either one way or the other for all kids rather than treating them as individuals with different experiences and different minds.<p>The one thing I have seen to be true amongst all my peers children is that if you talk to them and treat them like adults, they are much more likely to act like adults at a younger age.  That is to say, take into consideration their experience and feelings any time you want to intervene or have an interaction.<p>*not parenting advice, just imho. apply as you see fit.')
