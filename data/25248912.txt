Crops aren’t grown in clean rooms and the crop getting out into the wild could cause untold harm to the environment. Either by the crop growing in the wild or cross-pollinating and eventually replacing wild types.<p>The other issue people have with specific implementations is that big ag uses either sterility of the crop (eliminating #1) or the license agreements to prevent seed saving, effectively creating DRM for our food crops. This changes crop seeds from assets you buy once to a subscription model you’re forced to pay over and over for each season.<p>Finally, the actual execution of many GM changes is simply to make the plants resistant to specific heribicides, fungicides and pesticides. This allows farmers to bathe their fields in these chemicals which of course go on and leach into the environment. Not to mention killing plants, animals and insects in greater and greater quantities, which of course may also harm the bees and other pollinators.<p>I think #1 can be managed and avoided and in general (potentially through sterility) I’m ok with GM as a technology. However what I’m not ok with is the specific approaches big ag have been using.')
