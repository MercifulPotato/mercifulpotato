The problem with Lisp is not a number of parenthesis but where they are and what is their role. In c-like languages parenthesis help parser compiler but they also help humans to read the code. In case of Lisp they are just for the sake of the parser. \nLet&#x27;s look on the code:<p>Python:<p><pre><code>  model = Sequential()\n  model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3),\n                 activation=&#x27;relu&#x27;,\n                 input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))\n</code></pre>\nClojure:<p><pre><code>  (defonce net-bp\n    (network (desc [128 1 28 28] :float :nchw)\n</code></pre>\nWhich one is more readable? looking on the Clojure code I see 128 1 28 28 thrown on me, without digging in the documentation I have no idea what&#x27;s happening.')
