The subsequent realignments have so far been more gradual adaptations within the existing major parties, but a radical and suddenly realignment destroying (and replacing, either immediately or in short order) one of the majors is still possible.<p>&gt; Dislodging the duopoly (that is, opening the electoral system to 3rd parties) will require proportional representation full stop.<p>Something like that, yes.
