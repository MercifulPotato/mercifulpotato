This is why so few researchers work in the area, and why they are so hostile to each other: they are protecting their small, remaining turf.<p>All desktop CPUs made after 2010 provide blazing fast AES instructions (and on the mobile side, even ARMv8-a, from 2011, had them). Running AES in counter mode provides deterministic, high quality pseudo-random numbers faster than any of these proposed PRNGs.<p>Even if someone ends up in the unlikely situation where RNG throughput is the bottleneck in their Monte Carlo algorithm (which implies that they do pretty much no computation other than generating random numbers; having worked in a search- and genetic-algorithms-heavy field before the AI&#x2F;GPU craze, I&#x27;ve personally never seen it happen), they&#x27;ll be much better off getting a non-ancient CPU and switching to AES than trying to use any of these generators.')
