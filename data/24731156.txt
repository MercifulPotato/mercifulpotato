What&#x27;s the religious equivalent of the replication crisis? Holy wars?<p>The replication crisis is an alarming and embarrassing problem, driven largely by the slavish &quot;publish or perish&quot; incentive structure. But I don&#x27;t think this relates to your original claim that &quot;no one - NO ONE - is verifying anything personally. No one is testing the claims.&quot; It&#x27;s through exactly those attempts at verification and testing that scientists are realizing that standards of statistics, transparency, and integrity are not good enough.<p>&gt; I love science, and the scientific method. But, not the science we have. It really is akin to religion - both are means of governance of the masses by controlling what is acceptable to think about.<p>Science is inextricably linked to politics and society, as you rightly point out. Good science indeed can and should guide policy and governance, but calling that &quot;controlling what is acceptable to think about&quot; is wildly pessimistic.<p>Your argument has evolved into &quot;scientists and science is imperfect due to various sources of bias.&quot; That&#x27;s true, but I disagree that this makes science &quot;absolutely equivalent to religion.&quot;')
