Sabina is physicist, and I do not know your credentials, I would need to conclude behind logic and little and no actual references you have provided. You may say, &quot;you should do the research&quot;, but we do not time to research every little thing. So, I would go with a motion that for &quot;5G we do not know&quot;. Why?<p>I lived in a place where people believed, or had very serious fear from the draft (light indoor &quot;wind&quot;) and that it causes all kind of illnesses. Then, around mid of my life, all kind of jokes were made on that subject. But, using logically I concluded despite jokes that there can be some issues, as in sedentary life, outside tissue if it gets cooled, blood vessels will shrink causing the poor supply of oxygen and nutrients, during a prolonged time that can cause some serious &quot;buildup&quot; and issues. Now, later on, that logic was confirmed by studies and western science. Jokes were still there, and older people still have (now) justifiable fear, but non of two groups knows about the study.<p>It is not hard to say &quot;I do not know&quot;, and you and I, we do not. Humans as a whole do not know much, we do not know does microwave with smallest quantities impact metabolic intake of let say vitamins, we do not know does some of the minerals has a resonant frequency that will prevent mineral being absorbed in the cells, we do not know it is there some kind of impact on skin cells or hair follicles, will any of the tissue behave as an antenna, we do not know much. Yes, it looks semi-logical that it is low-level energy and it can be stopped by a thin wall, but a wall is not live and does not care.<p>Our bodies are complex mechanism, still, in 21st century we are trying do neurosurgery with stone-age axes. And each period of history, we do the same, when we do not know something, we use humans Guinea pigs, and when things go wrong, then we try to fix issues. Each time is on a larger scale and each time is a more serious issue. \nAsbestos, forever chemicals (PFAS, PFOS and PFOA), endocrine disruptors, oil industry, plastic, leaded petrol, chlorine in the water ... and always the same pattern, there is an excess of something, there is &quot;bright&quot; idea, big money of course, and always do before the study, because at that time we find it &quot;necessary&quot;. So, we convince the public that it is necessary, and they must follow...<p>And above all, dynamic of many human conversations is driven by &quot;trying to be right&quot; instead doing actual scientific study and action on facts.<p>One thing I agree 100% texting and driving does kill.')
