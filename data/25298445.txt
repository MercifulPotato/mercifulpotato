Intel having been humiliated by this will loosen their grip on OEMs who will now be under pressure in the inevitable rush to produce appealing, performance-oriented ARM laptops, as the current market has basically been Chromebooks and some half-hearted Windows ARM tablets, all based on chips adapted from phones.<p>And of course there will also be the rush on the fab side to produce a non-Apple chip that&#x27;s actually suitable for these machines, which will in turn have performance characteristics far more suited to <i>server use</i> than any previous ARM chip, enabling that market and feeding back a demand for larger and more performant server ARM chips and mainboardsâ€” and who knows, maybe even some kind of socket standard so they aren&#x27;t soldered down like it is today.')
