Doesn&#x27;t mean he will be wrong, though.<p>I really don&#x27;t get people&#x27;s optimism here. This is not some doomsday prophecy divined from religious texts. It&#x27;s a trend in the data - if nothing significantly changes, we&#x27;re headed for a crash in the coming decades.<p>It&#x27;s like watching a program with a memory leak - you see it ticking up in its memory usage, knowing that when it approaches 100%, it will crash. Oh, it didn&#x27;t, because Haber-Bosch^W^Wthere was a swap drive? Well, the swap space isn&#x27;t infinite either.<p>Sure, maybe skyrocketing oil prices won&#x27;t crash the economy (though people seem to forget that oil isn&#x27;t just fuel and energy, but also anything made from plastics - i.e. just about everything). But something else will give (likely the habitability of this planet). We need to step off the exponent, or ride it to space. But we can&#x27;t fit it on Earth much longer.')
