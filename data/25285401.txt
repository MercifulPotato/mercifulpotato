Those conversations gave us a better idea of what would work and helped build a realistic roadmap.<p>Executing on that roadmap has worked for us. We continue to evolve that roadmap based on customer demand - When somebody asks for something that&#x27;s on our roadmap, we count their vote.. and generally prioritize work in order of demand.<p>So ya, talk to your users... it&#x27;s not about what they ask you build, but what problems they&#x27;re trying to solve.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com</a> - shared inboxes, knowledge bases, live chat.')
