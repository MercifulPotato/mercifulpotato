There&#x27;s a service I used a couple of years ago that allowed me to basically connect to the internet through this particular VPN without having any data plan.  I don&#x27;t know how they did it but it still seems weird that the service worked this way on the contrary to what I understand VPNs actually do or how they work. After a little bit of googling, finally got the name it was called  Your Freedom')
