Even the most selfish manager may tolerate some pushback and some &quot;no&quot;s if it means they don&#x27;t have to go through all the work to hire someone &quot;better&quot; (which might require hiring and firing a lot of unknowns to arrive at, even if there&#x27;s plenty of applicants.)<p>The vengeful and dysfunctional might fire you anyways, even if it&#x27;s more work for them, if only to flex their power.  The downsizing might not <i>want</i> to replace people.  Life circumstances might mean you <i>can&#x27;t</i> be reliable and are already on the fence (or - to put it another way - you might already be saying &quot;no&quot; to too much to say &quot;no&quot; to more without getting fired.)<p>So, sure, there are people without power.  But - perhaps it&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> as bad as jiggawatts is making it out to be either.')
