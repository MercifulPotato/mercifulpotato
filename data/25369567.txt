Item(by='bryananderson', descendants=None, kids=[25375307], score=None, time=1607573177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362291, text='&gt; Honestly, I don&#x27;t think we should knock Instagram for mental health issues, that&#x27;s really up to the user.<p>Frankly, we know enough about human psychology to definitively say that this is not true, or at least not workable or useful.<p>We know that different technologies provide environments with different <i>affordances</i>. They influence us to think, feel, and behave in different ways by providing different possibilities and making some of them more appealing or lower-effort than others.<p>We are not simple automatons, but neither do we have unfettered free will as the Enlightenment philosophers conceived of it. Rather, we are unavoidably affected to some degree by our environment. We have well-known and easily exploitable cognitive biases and addictive triggers.<p>Our underlying nature was always there, but different environments and different incentives can bring out the best or the worst of it. Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook bring out the worst. And it&#x27;s not an accident: they consciously seek to leverage psychological research in order to addict us, be. Unfortunately, the things that addict us are fear, anxiety, envy, anger, tribalism, and self-loathing.<p>Robinhood is analogous. They have created an easy, free, addictive way to ruin your life, and they profit handsomely from it. They aren&#x27;t ignorant of how many people have lost everything, and they aren&#x27;t innocent, because their product actively invites you to do it. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the fine print says.')
