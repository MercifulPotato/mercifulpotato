For most people, they were in it for the community, which included things like the prestige of having your name associated with a popular&#x2F;successful project.  The reason the fansub community was upset at CrunchyRoll was because not only did they take the content, they edited it to remove the intros and other forms of attribution to the original fansubbers.<p>If they had left in attribution, nobody would have cared, and CrunchyRoll would have been treated like any number of other torrent to streaming sites that existed.')
