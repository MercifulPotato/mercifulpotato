Instead I responded to someone who claimed that unions make me no worse off.  And I have described how that is false.<p>That is the only thing that I have said.  Please do not put words into my mouth or say that I said things, when I did not say them.<p>Can you please stop lying about me saying anything, when I have been extremely clear regarding my original statement?<p>It seems like you do not disagree with me that the original person is wrong though.<p>&gt; You&#x27;ll be better off as a union member, through the superior negotiating power of collective bargaining<p>Not if I don&#x27;t want that contract, or if I don&#x27;t want to engage in collective bargaining, that I am now forced to join if I want to keep my job.  There are many things in actual real life examples of union contracts that I would strongly oppose.<p>And no, I will not accept you talking about some hypothetical union contract that does not exist, where you claim that this non standard union contract, that has none of the bad things that I brought up, would help.<p>The only thing that I will accept as arguments, as for why unions are good or bad, is actual real life examples of contracts that have been enacted in the real world, because anything else is just a story that someone made up in their head.<p>And there are many examples of concrete real union contracts that I would absolutely not support.<p>&gt;  Why not give a straight answer?<p>A straight answer to things that you are lying about, that I did not say?  I have already given you a straight answer about exactly what I believe, and that I have made no comments on any completely irreverent thing that do not disagree with what I said.')
