There&#x27;s nothing intolerant about the claim that the Bidens are corrupt.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s quite a stretch to call any of that &quot;news&quot;. So I don&#x27;t see how allegations of censorship even apply.<p>Freedom of speech isn&#x27;t restricted to news and the idea that you can censor anything which doesn&#x27;t fall into a narrowly defined category such as &quot;news&quot;, with the censor deciding what counts as news and not, would completely kill the point of freedom of speech.<p>&gt; The founders had the notion that democracy requires an informed populace.<p>I often see this claim but I&#x27;m not aware of any evidence that either the founders believed this, nor for the belief itself. It&#x27;s also often used to argue for voting restrictions. It&#x27;s kind of parallel to the idea that freedom of speech requires that people are rational, where again my question is: What&#x27;s the alternative? What is the rational informed group that we should entrust restrictions to?<p>In your view some elite group should decide that NY Post, Fox News and OAnn are anti-informing people, not serving democracy. Well if we trust that elite group, why bother with democracy in the first place?')
