Consider how many devs use Apple products - proprietary products that come in a walled garden, and that in many ways go against developers. A good amount of it comes down to aesthetics. Were Sourcehut to have, say, a &quot;2020 theme&quot; or something, that would help lots of those devs appreciate it more.<p>Developers are using macOS despite it continually removing features from developers, and are even in some cases defending Apple&#x27;s decisions. I believe that this design actively harms the adoption of Sourcehut. There are definitely other things Sourcehut should do if they want more of GitHub&#x27;s and GitLab&#x27;s marketshare, changing their UI (or adding an alternative UI) is an important part of that process.')
