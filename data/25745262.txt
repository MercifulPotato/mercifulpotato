We get a <i>lot</i> of mid-corporate turnover and it every time one takes over it seems that we quickly find things being changed for no reason, only for it to happen again in 6-24 months when the next passing of the baton occurs.<p>IIRC we&#x27;re on our fifth or sixth vice president in the 15 years I&#x27;ve been there and the tiers immediately below that have turned over similarly with people promoting in and out from other opcos, or even from competing companies.<p>It has <i>never</i> made sense to me. One would think you&#x27;d want consistency for long-term plans, only replacing someone if they retire&#x2F;are horribly ineffective.')
