Microsoft, and most other major tech companies, have been “hacked” many times.<p>Note that being hacked isn’t a binary state. What matters is what they were able to obtain. It could range from full compromise of the C-suite and domain admin, to phishing some marketing employee with no access to anything interesting. If anything, you should be afraid of companies who <i>haven’t</i> been hacked. It most likely means they’re either irrelevant, or they have been hacked and don’t know it yet.<p>This isn’t even the first time they’ve been hacked by Russians. It’s honestly not a big deal.')
