I keep that at the root of the git repo, usually as &quot;run.sh&quot;.<p>For example here is what I did when hacking on Kernighan&#x27;s awk 5 years ago:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andychu&#x2F;bwk&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;run.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andychu&#x2F;bwk&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;run.sh</a><p>So now 5 years later I can see exactly where I downloaded the source from.  I count how much source code there is in a repo to get a feel for it, and I have that exact command recorded.<p>And I was trying to figure out how much test coverage there is, so I ran a bunch of gcov stuff, which involve Python.<p>The shell script may have some problems now, but the point is that I can tell within 10 seconds what I did 5 years ago.  And I can fix it in a few minutes.<p>It costs so little to write down these commands that it&#x27;s worth it.  If you try to make it really rigorous then you&#x27;re not going to do it.  Th<p>In summary, I suggest becoming SHELL LITERATE and checking in shell script with comments.  The point is that shell is ALREADY what you&#x27;re typing, so you can save it exactly like it is in a file, and run it later.  (You can also use a Makefile, but then you lose that property, and that matters.  Make has all the gotchas of shell plus some more.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25400278" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25400278</a><p>(I have a couple upcoming blog posts that mention this.  Another view on this, regarding releases: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;good-parts-sketch.html#semi-automation-with-runsh-scripts" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;good-parts-sketch.html#...</a>)<p>----<p>Another meme I use is &quot;never remember a port number&quot;.<p>I have had the experience of pair programming with people and they are trying to remember port numbers.  Sometimes the server doesn&#x27;t print it out to the console.<p>Sometimes they go digging through their notes, or they go digging through Python source code to find the port number.<p>I always know the port number because I put it in a shell script at the root of the repo.<p>If you automate stuff like this you can get to the meat of the problem a lot faster.')
