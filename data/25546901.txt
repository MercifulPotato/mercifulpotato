My point though is that for this kind of value of time calculation to make any sense, you need to assume the amount of work for money someone can do is variable. Otherwise the amount you earn at work is essentially irrelevant when you&#x27;re looking at the opportunity cost of spending time on something.  So then if you <i>are</i> going to look at your net hourly earnings at work, I don&#x27;t see how it makes any sense to consider all your expenses on the basis of per hour worked.')
