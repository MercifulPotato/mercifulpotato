It&#x27; no longer enough to have a project that solves a specific problem - you now have to build &quot;mindshare&quot; and a &quot;community&quot; and have the metrics to show VC&#x27;s so they can fund your growth, and corporate acceptability is key here. The playbook of a successful open source project is:<p>1. Use the most liberal license you can think &amp; grow a community<p>2. Become popular, gain traction in enterprise market &amp; get millions in funding<p>3. AWS forks your project, tells customers they can scale it better than you<p>4. Investors call you and demand you do something - competing with Amazon wrecks all their projections on your future revenue. You add anti-cloud-hosting clauses to your license - building a community is no longer a concern the way Amazon is.<p>TerminusDB were on step 0 (no thanks to the GPL), now they are on step 1.')
