That isn&#x27;t racist.<p>Unqualified statements asserting that a specific racial group &quot;just commit more crime&quot; is pretty much an applied definition of the word &quot;racist&quot;. Isolated statistics about aboriginal behaviour used to buttress your assertion that you are not racist, just seem to underline the fact that perhaps you have much to learn.<p>If you&#x27;d said, &quot;statistically, aboriginal people commit more crime. Studies have shown that this is because of chronic health and economic issues which have never been adequately addressed by any Australian government&quot;, that would probably not be racist, but I&#x27;d want to defer to an aboriginal person before putting my neck out too far on that one either.<p>One of the difficult things about racism is that it does not matter how <i>we</i> (ie, people of European descent) feel about it, but how the people <i>we&#x27;re talking about</i> feel about it.<p>&gt; Thats a symptom of a problem that predates most of us sitting here in our armchairs<p>What problem are you talking about? The problem that we invaded their land, shot them, stole their children, and to this day oppress them both economically and legally?<p>&gt; all that does is alienate allies and make you look like a moron<p>No ally of mine is going to be alienated or offended by simple statements of truth.')
