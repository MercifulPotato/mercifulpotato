In my community of athletes Strava is the gold standard and there is really nothing else quite like it that is compatible with more than one brand of device and offers a similar feature set.<p>Probably about 1&#x2F;2 of my friends are paid members.  Since they changed their billing model&#x2F;feature&#x2F;plans earlier in the year, more people in my circle started paying and I can not think of anyone who left.<p>While there can be some frustrations with some of the segments, it really varies heavily sport to sport and area to area.  In trail running segments where I am it&#x27;s pretty rare to find a completely unbelievable segment entry that screams someone is cheating.  But at the end of the day often you are filtering the segment results down to your followers or clubs list.<p>Overall I find Strava to keep me more engaged in friendly competition than other-words and the premium features do a good job of adding actual value in terms of another view&#x2F;opinion in your training status.<p>Having said all that, my circle of friends are not your casual athletes.')
