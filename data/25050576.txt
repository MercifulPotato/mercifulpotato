A fundamental law that governments should have is that your employer cannot harm your health<p>I think there&#x27;s a better way to deal with this. Rather than legislate that certain abuses of health aren&#x27;t okay, let&#x27;s instead make it so people aren&#x27;t stuck working jobs if they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. Right now, the main reason workplaces can abuse employees so much is that employees can&#x27;t quit, or else they&#x27;d starve on the street.<p>If we had a livable universal basic income, that would allow anyone to, at any time, decide if their job&#x27;s extra income + the meaning it gave them was worth the stress and other issues.<p>We already have good evidence that this wouldn&#x27;t result in no one working since, well, quite a few of the people born wealthy enough to never need to work do work anyway.')
