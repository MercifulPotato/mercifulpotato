If you are looking for a complete set of pages on a specific topic time is sort-of irrelevant. Google for example has alerts for new results. That these pages are not available sooner (before publication) is not intolerable. You can also throw hardware at YaCy and adjust the settings which improves it a lot. The challenge with a distributed approach is sorting the results. Other crawlers have the same problem but in a distributed system it is even harder.<p>Running an instance for websites related to your occupation or hobby YaCy is quite wonderful. You don&#x27;t want google removing a bunch of pages that might cover exactly the sub-topic you are looking for. Of course the smaller the number of pages in your niche the better it works.')
