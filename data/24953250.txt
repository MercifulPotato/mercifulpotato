Think of this as Chesterson&#x27;s fence.  If something dates back to antiquity, it&#x27;s hard to say why it exists.  This isn&#x27;t simply that -- this cultural phenomenon was designed to weaken the people of India (leveraging some ancient patterns).  If folks understand that, and recognize that their ancestors got played, then they&#x27;ll (hopefully) have a stronger impetus to collaborate to remove that fence.  Unfortunately, it seems to involve convincing the people at the top to relinquish their unearned privilege -- that rarely happens without bloodshed.')
