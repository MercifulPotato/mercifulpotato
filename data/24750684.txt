If you&#x27;re a mathematician, you probably solve some maths at home.  If you&#x27;re a writer, you probably write at home.   Most people that can practice their craft do so at home.  I don&#x27;t expect a hunter or a fisherman to hunt or fish at home.   But a chef?  A chef might have an idea for a meal and experiment at home.   So a software developer that doesn&#x27;t practice their craft at home is very suspect.   I don&#x27;t expect a side project, just practice, but very often, we have an idea that does turn into a side project.   I don&#x27;t expect this side project to make money, to have a website, to have a beautiful code, to be in github, but if you can&#x27;t tell me anything that you have worked on just for the hell of it in the past year, I will be very and highly suspicious of how good you are.')
