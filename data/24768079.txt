But that&#x27;s only the case for irregular cases (notable example being 漢 to 汉). In many cases they are highly systematic and phono-semantic roots are preserved (e.g. 訁 to 讠, so no information is lost), or characters are so frequently used that you will have to memorize anyway (e.g. 飛 to 飞). Pronunciation-based simplification (e.g. 後 <i>after, behind</i> to 后 <i>empress</i>) is debatable, but it also tends to occur in frequently used characters.')
