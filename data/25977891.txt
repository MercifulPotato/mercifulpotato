Men are statistically far more likely to rape a woman than the other way around. Setting aside any legal&#x2F;criminal consequences, rape has substantially higher risk of long term, life altering consequences for the woman than for the man.<p>Now of course the better solution for this disparity would be to empower women with physical defence skills, e.g. Brazilian jiu-jitsu. And to somehow exorcise the male erotic fantasy out of mainstream female fashion&#x2F;culture. But as desirable as those solutions are, we can&#x27;t rely upon top-down social engineering being effective.<p>It&#x27;s also important to point out that men being (on average) physically stronger doesn&#x27;t equate to women being &quot;weak&quot;. And having objectively more at risk does not make one &quot;need protecting&quot; in any special way. Such twisting of language is political gamesplayingâ€”and not healthy discourse.')
