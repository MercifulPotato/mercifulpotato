Each time was subtly different than the last, but cumulatively it felt like a whole different world. Eventually I ran into the very difficult dilemma of having to &quot;reconstruct&quot; my original timeline so that I could return safely to it, rather than to the bizarre new timeline we all seemed to occupy.
