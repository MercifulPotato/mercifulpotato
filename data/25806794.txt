My unsolicited advice: take your time and learn some mathematics you might enjoy.  Trust simple mathematical definitions over long-winded &quot;explained as easily as possible&quot; essays.<p>Mathematicians congratulate each other for simple, elegant definitions (sometimes developed over decades) which make deriving results easy.  If you don&#x27;t understand a definition which requires only a few words, learn some of the background instead of doing 10000 Google searches for the &quot;easiest&quot; explanation.<p>Here&#x27;s an example.  In physics, a vector is something with a  &quot;magnitude&quot; and &quot;direction&quot; and we associate feelings and intuition with this.  In mathematics, a vector (in 3-dimensional space) is simply &quot;an ordered triple of real numbers&quot;.  Many people might find this definition unsatisfying, but it is simple, precise, and lots of USEFUL mathematics is created from it.')
