It takes time for the body to incorporate the missing nutrient into underperforming systems and get them back up to speed and you typically need other nutrients along with the one you are obviously deficient in to make proper use of it.<p>Generally speaking, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much in the way of good results to give massive doses of vitamin D to people so sick they have been hospitalized with Covid-19. But I think there is plenty of evidence to suggest that a good recommendation is &quot;If you are vitamin D deficient and would like to actually survive the pandemic, raising your vitamin D status is the smart thing to do.&quot;<p>I mean, you should do that anyway, even if there were no pandemic. It&#x27;s just a hair more urgently life threatening at the moment.<p>It&#x27;s sound advice generally to say &quot;If you are vitamin D deficient, you should seek to remedy that.&quot; It&#x27;s sound advice with or without a global pandemic happening around you.')
