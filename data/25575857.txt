I ended up getting more tests. They played a series of words into my &quot;good&quot; ear and I had to repeat them: &quot;duck&quot;... &quot;duck&quot;. &quot;concrete&quot; .... &quot;concrete&quot;... it was pretty funny.<p>Then they did the same thing in my other ear: &quot;schmwaaa&quot; ... &quot;Smchmwaa?&quot;... &quot;Grunnnngch&quot;... &quot;wtf?!&quot;. Turned out I had an accoustic neuroma - a tumor on the auditory nerve. Got it cut out with some neurosurgery, but now am 100% deaf in one ear with shitty tinnitus.<p>Hearing loss is pretty common so I don&#x27;t want to scare-monger - but, OP - follow up on the tests!')
