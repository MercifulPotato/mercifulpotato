TSMC would not be in the position they are right now without Apple&#x27;s partnership powering their capital investments.<p>So in short, Apple&#x27;s backing isn&#x27;t <i>proof</i> that TSMC 5nm is good, it&#x27;s actually a large part of <i>why</i> TSMC 5nm is good, and even exists in the first place.')
