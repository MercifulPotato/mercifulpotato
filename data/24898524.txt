Hands down. And has been for many years. In fact it&#x27;s so bad, that I&#x27;ve been using Waterfox for a few months.<p>If any better option becomes available, I will immediately switch. I hate that they shove updates down your throat, and you have to literally set a policy to disable them. Then if you ask about it, they look at you like you are crazy. I don&#x27;t like auto updates. That&#x27;s my right. I find a version that works, I don&#x27;t want it changing every week. I want to update when <i></i>I want to<i></i>.<p>Then you have other stuff like the megabar, which Firefox implemented to be more like Chrome (I guess). Looking through about 10 issues on bugzilla about it that were all closed as WON&#x27;T FIX, then they hide any negative comments and threaten bugzilla ban from anyone that express dislike. And cherry on top, they make it impossible to disable via settings, you have to do CSS hacks.')
