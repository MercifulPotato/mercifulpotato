Not because I feel sorry for them, but because an ordinary person&#x27;s day-to-day life can become massively disrupted or nearly impossible without them, and a company might be essentially punished without trial. Perhaps payment processors could be responsible only for banning customers that are on a government-maintained blacklist (where a customer would only be added after having been found guilty of a relevant crime, obviously).')
