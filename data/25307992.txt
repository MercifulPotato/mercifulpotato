I have a workout shirt from when I was 15 (I&#x27;m in my 30s now) that has seen literally hundreds, even a thousand+ workouts.<p>However the cotton fabric used in most off the shelf clothing is also not what it used to be. My dad, who doesn&#x27;t like to throw things away, still has his old clothes from when he was in his 30s (he is in his late 70s now). They&#x27;ve retained their shape far better than my 3 year old clothes.')
