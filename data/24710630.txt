While the &quot;freedom&quot; of being able to choose whichever Infra-as-Code tool I personally prefer is nice, it&#x27;s also a huge negative that there isn&#x27;t one single tool that has the full backing and endorsement of AWS.<p>CloudFormation is the &quot;official&quot; tool, but it&#x27;s basically a second class citizen in AWS rife with bugs and gotchas, and often lags in adding support for new AWS features. CDK is the up-and-coming &quot;official&quot; tool that seems like it might take the spotlight, but it&#x27;s still in pre-release and because it relies on CloudFormation under the hood, it too is less than ideal.<p>Terraform is probably the most feature-complete and most frequently updated IaC tool, but since it&#x27;s technically third party it isn&#x27;t going to be included in official AWS docs&#x2F;tutorials or get first party support from AWS.<p>Then you throw in the other stuff like the Beanstalk CLI, Copilot, SAM, Chalice, Amplify CLI... there are so many tools for creating resources in AWS that it&#x27;s overwhelming when trying to decide which one to use.')
