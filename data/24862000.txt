But the reality of generating keys and signing and distributing certificates was <i>horrible</i>, and our users were confused and hated it.<p>How would you solve key generation even now - assuming the client generates the key, is it locked to that browser on that machine? How do you generate a CSR (certificate signing request)? How do you send the signed certificate to the user? How does the user install the certificate? Again, does that mean the user can only access your app from the machine they installed the certificate to?<p>PKI is <i>hard</i>, mainly because of the distribution problem.')
