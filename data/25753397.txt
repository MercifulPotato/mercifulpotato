The ideas he believes become a dangerous mental disease. This diagnosis is written into history. The sooner he gives up this nonsense, the better. To help convince him, we&#x27;ll make this idea quasi-illegal. The sooner he gives it up, the less his life will suffer. Eventually he can be fired for staying an idiot. Everyone will agree that he deserved it.<p>&gt;This is Popper’s paradox of tolerance. Popper discovers that every real regime must have the apparatus of the Inquisition in its back pocket. If it hesitates to deploy its intellectual rack and thumbscrew, it will be replaced by a regime with no such qualms.<p>&gt;Popper, read logically, advises the Nazis to repress the Communists, the Communists to repress the Nazis, the liberals to repress both and both to repress the liberals. From his “open society” he comes all the way around to Hobbes, Schmitt and Machiavelli. Next he will tell us, in Esperanto, that “the earth is nothing but a vast bloody altar.”<p>I think Moldbug reads Popper much more elegantly. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graymirror.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;vae-victis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graymirror.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;vae-victis</a>')
