I think it is ok to question if we are doing the right thing. There are intellectually honest ways to do that and intellectually dishonest ways. I do think we should do everything we can to avoid becoming callous. Some amount of of emotional fatigue is to be expected though. We are talking about nearly 250k deaths so far. That is a completely overwhelming number. And the lockdowns and general fear has created an immeasurable impact on the the future world economy, political stability and mental health.<p>The science is clear that the risk of COVID morbidity and mortality is not evenly distributed. There could be more than one good way to manage this risk and keep our healthcare system functioning. As we start distributing the vaccine, we are going to have a great opportunity to mitigate a large portion of the risk for some people, while accepting a lower risk for others as the price to pay for getting back to normal as soon as possible. We make these kinds of population risk decisions all the time and no one bats an eye. Simply getting in your car every day and trusting your life to its imperfect safety systems is one example.<p>Soon we will need to draw that line of what risk we, as a society will accept, and then get on with it.')
