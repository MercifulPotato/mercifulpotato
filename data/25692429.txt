Its their right to free speech and the US constitution guarantees it.<p>When the people <i>in power</i>, the government, falsely claim that the election should not be trusted, and the people should ignore all other sources of information because any other source of information but those approved by the government are &quot;fake news&quot;, the government should be silenced and the people should reject it. Otherwise, those in power can maintain their power indefinitely, with no reason or facts allowed to dispute why they must be kept in power.<p>&gt; major media and almost all journalists saying Russia stole&#x2F;meddled with our election<p>I read what I (perhaps incorrectly) assume you consider &quot;major media&quot; - Reuters, AP News. I have not seen anything about the 2016 election since, well... early 2017? Don&#x27;t remember but it&#x27;s been a very long time. Of course, the Mueller report validates aspects of those claims, but I never thought the election was stolen - just interfered with.<p>&gt; The whole reason you had a bunch of desperate crazies storming congress<p>.. is because people take all their information from a narrow source of information that has been repeated and spread across right-wing media and social media, despite many of those messages not being accurate. When you believe the people in power telling you &quot;I&#x27;m on your side, and the other side is evil, and they are trying to take away <i>our</i> power&quot;, then you have a bunch of desperate crazies.')
