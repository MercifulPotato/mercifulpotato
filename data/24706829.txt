Everyone wants to share what they love with someone else, but you have to respect the fact that others won&#x27;t love what you love.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to encourage my little (he&#x27;s 21 now) brother to get into programming, but he&#x27;s just not interested. I&#x27;m disappointed, but that&#x27;s my problem, not his. He&#x27;s had every opportunity to get into it. He&#x27;s got his own computer and a big brother willing to teach him. If he wanted to do it he would&#x27;ve done it.<p>My other brother became a mechanic despite nobody encouraging him to do it, nor providing him with the resources when he was younger. He had to go out and find old lawnmower engines to work on by himself. He was actively discouraged from bringing home junk by our parents, but he did it anyway.<p>The vast majority of people do not want to become programmers. The best thing you can do for children is to expose them to as many things as you can. Take them to museums. Involve them in your hobbies and your friends&#x27; hobbies if possible and if they want to. You&#x27;ll know when they&#x27;ve found what they want to do.<p>Also, don&#x27;t be disappointed if girls just want to be mothers. It&#x27;s one of the most important and noble jobs there is. Don&#x27;t discourage it because you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as important as what you do.')
