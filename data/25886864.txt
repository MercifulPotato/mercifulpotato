I don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;re suffering paranoid ideation or what&#x27;s going on, but someone sharing links to a tech they&#x27;re discussing (which I edited out after your previous accusation that you deleted, in a failed attempt to keep the peace) is hardly evidence that I&#x27;m a founder of said company engaged in underhanded promotion. The mods can check my IP address and see I&#x27;m in a different country to the founders if they really wish (not that that would put your mind to rest, you&#x27;ll probably just think I&#x27;m using a VPN).<p>It&#x27;s a rather elaborate scheme that you&#x27;re accusing me of: make a HN account, spend hours writing 20 posts, all to plug my startup in some comment that nobody will read. Think through the plausibility of that one.')
