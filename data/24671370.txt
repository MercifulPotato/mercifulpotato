We also can&#x27;t tell time accurately to the minute if we <i>can</i> see outside but don&#x27;t know how long the day is, i.e. latitude and time of year.<p>We can tell time <i>inaccurately</i> by timing somewhat regular internal biological events. That pretty much follows from the definition of time as the interval between regular events (which are assumed for physical reasons to be equally spaced). The only question is <i>which</i> underlying events we use and how.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time_perception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Time_perception</a>')
