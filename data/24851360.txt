Mostly JS heavy sites.<p>The energy usage of Firefox is way higher than Safari, which in turns makes my fans spin a lot harder.  Basically some sites will peg the CPU and hit max fan speed, but the same site just sips energy on Safari.<p>Video streaming is a prime example of this.  I can use twitch on Safari and it uses maybe 30% CPU.  Twitch on Firefox uses 150% CPU.')
