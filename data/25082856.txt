DDG has been there for much longer. I could not trust them after such obviously false claims.<p>* They promised (to the public and their investors, which includes the state funds) that if they used Bing, they were improving they own engine which was handling more and more queries. Studied showed it was not the case, that many searches showed outdated results and repeating entries (to make think they have many search results).<p>* Their previous boss was a tyrannic Jobs wannabe. He wanted Qwant to become as trendy as Google so he kept launching half-baked products (Qwant maps! Qwant mail! etc). Constant chance of priorities and new projects were devastating for developers (especially when the search engine was still very weak). He was finally pushed out of the company.')
