Hitherto philosopher had served, but, as I  have said, philosophy had narrowed in meaning to exclude natural philosophy, except in the  minds and mouths of  an older generation. An English man of science who called himself a  philosopher  now did so rather self-consciously, or hastened to qualify the name with the adjectives &#x27;  experimental &#x27;  or &#x27;  natural. &#x27; The French word philosophe was immedi- ately brought to mind, and those designated by that word were not men of science, besides having been notorious atheists. The name scientist was first propounded in the Quarterly Review for March, 1834. The anonymous reviewer made the suggestion, too jocularly, however, to be taken entirely in  earnest, in the course of a  review of Mrs Somerville&#x27;s book On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences. From Todhunter&#x27;s biography 9  we learn that the reviewer was William Whewell, F.R.S.&quot;<p>I cannot yet find a copy of the original review and am curious to find it.
