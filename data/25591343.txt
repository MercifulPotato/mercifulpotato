Other countries are not, like the UK.  The UK is allowing 2nd doses <i>far</i> later than was tested in trials.  Is that the best approach?  Maybe.  But we don&#x27;t know right now.<p>It&#x27;s certainly trendy as hell to trash how the US is handling Covid - and don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is certainly room for improvement.
