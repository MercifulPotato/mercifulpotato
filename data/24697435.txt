We joke that I build it and then she makes it pretty.<p>We do have an assistant who we&#x27;ll probably hand 1st level support off to at some point but right now we&#x27;re handling it all so we can keep a close eye on what&#x27;s going on.<p>I&#x27;m still piecing together how customers were found in the past.
