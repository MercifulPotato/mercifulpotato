However I have yet to find a decent adapter that will both charge my laptop and output 4k @ 60FPS. I&#x27;ve gone through several iterations now and the closest I&#x27;ve come is a monitor that can connect via USB-C directly, but even then the power output only outputs enough juice when the machine is near-idle... I&#x27;m looking forward to the day when I can have a 1 (or even 2) cable dock setup that won&#x27;t run me $250+. Until that day, I have to use all 4 ports for:<p>- Charger<p>- USB C (4k display)<p>- HDMI (4k Display)<p>- Ethernet')
