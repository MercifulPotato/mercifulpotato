Just the simple fact that indices are handled the same way in Matlab and Julia makes this transition easier than going from Matlab to Python in my opinion. What I would suggest, is that you first write some test suite of your Matlab code (you might have it already), have a look to the Julia documentation and in particular to the performance tips (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.julialang.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v1&#x2F;manual&#x2F;performance-tips&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.julialang.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v1&#x2F;manual&#x2F;performance-tips&#x2F;</a>) and for functions where performance is important check its type-stability. You might want to start first with a small project to familiarize yourself with the (quite rich)  type system in julia.')
