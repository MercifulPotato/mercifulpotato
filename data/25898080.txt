A habit-based approach for deep psychological change. There’s a lot of research behind it and in the U.K. it’s a go to tool for the NHS for tackling depression.<p>The principles behind CBT overlap considerably with the principles of habit change that BJ Fogg researches and writes about (aka the Stanford research as cited in this article).<p>Whether it’s health behaviours or negative thought patterns, I’d argue that “hacking habits” is a very valid way (but not the <i>only</i> way) to make positive and lasting changes in your life.<p>I also say this as someone who has drastically changed my lot in life by focusing on habit hacking and behaviour change. And yes, meditation too, and therapy, and lots of excellent self-help books and medication.<p>These are all tools in a toolbox. None of them are a panacea, but in combination (and everyone is different) they all have their place.')
