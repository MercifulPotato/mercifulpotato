It is hard enough to get developers writing meaningful tests that exercise edge cases to make code hard to break. Far too often they do it because &quot;you should&quot; and &quot;we have a policy&quot;. Coverage reports too easily get people focusing on numbers and policy over understanding how to identify and strengthen key functionality so it&#x27;s hard to break as things evolve.<p>What you end up with is:<p>1. Tests that at <i>least</i> invoke code that may be overlooked, but due to mocks, invoke it in a way thats meaningless.<p>2. Twice as much code to update when doing any feature work, refactoring, ... or even bug fixing!<p>3. A false sense of security because &quot;tests passed!&quot;<p>4. A lot of wasted time writing tests for code you end up either throwing out or significantly refactoring before it ever becomes a remotely active part of the project.<p>I&#x27;m jaded.<p>I LOVE good tests, but far, far too often they get in the way of real progress that actually matters to an end user. Tests are supposed to be worth their weight in gold. Too often they&#x27;re a self-congratulating pat-on-the-back and a detriment to success.<p>Please, prove me wrong. I know you can, because this does NOT apply to everyone.')
