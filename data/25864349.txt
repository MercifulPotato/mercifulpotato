Item(by='tanelpoder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611263764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863641, text='Yup indeed it&#x27;s an issue with NAND SSDs - and it heavily depends on the type (SLC, MLC, TLC, QLC), vendor (controller, memory, &quot;write buffer&quot;) sizes etc. I&#x27;m doing mostly read tests right now and will move to writes after.<p>The Samsung PRO 980 I have, are TLC for main storage, but apparently are using some of that TLC storage as a faster write buffer (TurboWrite buffer) - I&#x27;m not an expert, but apparently the controller can decide to program the TLC NAND with only 1-bit &quot;depth&quot;, they call it &quot;simulated SLC&quot; or something like that. On the 1 TB SSD, the turbowrite buffer can dynamically extend to ~100 GB, if there&#x27;s unused NAND space on the disk.<p>Btw, the 3DXpoint storage (Intel Optane SSDs &amp; Micron X1) should be able to sustain crazy write rates too.')
