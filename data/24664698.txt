Wolfram has earned a bit of self-assurance in my view.<p>As for the theory itself, I&#x27;m in the &quot;wait and see&quot; camp. If it&#x27;s true or at least on the right path, then it should be generating testable hypothesizes soon enough.<p>Put another way, say his theory was the same in every way, but instead of purporting to prove the fundamentals of our own existence it instead made the claim that there was a two dimensional world with its own constants and physics and that this other universe existed as much as ours does, but that we could never reach it due to what the foundations of the theory laid out. Then I&#x27;d be completely uninterested. At least until we were able to simulate this universe with perfect fidelity in a computer.<p>But since it&#x27;s our very existence then it&#x27;s only a matter of time until the theory generates a prediction that we can use as the hypothesis for real experimentation and then the theory can rise or die. But until then I&#x27;m going to try to keep an open mind.')
