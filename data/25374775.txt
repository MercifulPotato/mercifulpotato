I went through this a couple of times and I’m in the industry for 20+ years. The last time it happened, it lasted for weeks. Weeks of not knowing how to put focus on simpliest programming tasks which would normally take 5 minutes. Sleeping all day, mood totally down.<p>The best thing to do is to accept it. Don’t fight it. Ignore the feeling that things „have to be done”. This only creates additional stress and spirals out the problems. Go out (if you can), watch tv, play video games, talk to a therapist. Do something different. When the stress regarding software comes, tell yourself that it does not matter, it’s normal and you are ignoring it is for the better. Don’t force yourself because that leads to a burnout. The process of getting to a better state of mind can take weeks. Or months. It’s okay. You will come out stronger.<p>Don’t cross off talking to a therapist. A talk to someone who doesn’t know you and is qualified can be a miracle.')
