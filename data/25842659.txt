I haven&#x27;t stepped inside a building except a Walgreens once to get a flu vaccine.<p>My own parents have only visited twice, and we only visited outside my front yard. I haven&#x27;t seen any friends in person except for two brief times when they dropped something off at the house, and we talked outside with masks on.<p>But then again, I live in the US, and we just officially crossed 400,000 deaths due to the virus, compared to less than 1,000 in Australia, it looks like. I can understand it would be more difficult to adhere to when the virus is so under control where you&#x27;re at, but those lockdowns might be a big reason why.')
