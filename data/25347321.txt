It would seem to me that renting a truck and delivering packages to the local center would be the easiest workaround.<p>The article mentions a company shipping through UPS when they capped FedEx and having to pay the retail rates on their UPS account. I cannot imagine that paying the UPS retail shipping rate is cheaper than renting a truck for a month to ride out the limitations.')
