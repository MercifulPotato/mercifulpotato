Postgres 12 is more than a year old.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Aurora because it&#x27;s managed, I don&#x27;t have to worry about backups, it&#x27;s faster and cheaper and easier to scale, etc.<p>But Postgres 12 has some really important features and performance improvements, and we really need them for my app. I&#x27;ve got to wonder why I&#x27;m paying for a managed service when they can&#x27;t even manage to do a major version upgrade in a year.')
