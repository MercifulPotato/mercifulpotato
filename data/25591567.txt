Flash (now rebranded Adobe Animate) can export to HTML5, it just isn&#x27;t very good.<p>As I recall, it tries to naively export your Flash graphics as HTML5 Canvas drawing commands, but they come out all glitchy because Flash&#x27;s renderer just uses a fundamentally different model (planar maps vs. stacked rendering).<p>This probably is fixable, but I sincerely wonder whether Adobe still has the engineering skills to solve new problems like this. They&#x27;ve subisted for so long now by just adding new layers of janky, slow, webview-powered cloud-enhanced e-commerce integration to their existing products, that I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most of the serious engineering talent has left.')
