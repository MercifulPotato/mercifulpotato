Apple user demographic is across the entire economic spectrum so I&#x27;m sure that 1) this will sell well and 2) it&#x27;s a great pair of headphones.<p>Worth pointing out that this doesn&#x27;t have any auxiliary ports so you can&#x27;t use it on airplanes, etc...unless there&#x27;s an upcoming lightning-to-aux adapter. It feels like a culmination of the &quot;no headphone jack&quot; vision started with the iPhone 7.')
