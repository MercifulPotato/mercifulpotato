But even before that, I always really liked English and as a kid worked really hard to emulate the way I heard it spoken in American TV shows.<p>The way I speak has been described as, &quot;pretty much no accent, but you don&#x27;t sound like you&#x27;re from anywhere in particular.&quot; Other immigrants sometimes think I&#x27;m American, but most people say I sound like someone who speaks English as their first language, but they aren&#x27;t be able to tell which country I could be from.<p>Maybe I should just have a bit more of a foreign accent, after all :D')
