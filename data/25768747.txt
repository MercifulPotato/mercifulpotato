Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[25771833], score=None, time=1610576400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25768267, text='&quot;Who does it better&quot; is not the right question here since the problem is not related to other actors being &quot;better&quot; but to NPR (and PBS) not fulfilling the mandate of being politically neutral. Commercial actors do not have that mandate since they are not publicly funded, they can be (and most certainly are) as partisan as they wish.<p>As to the supposed difficulty of being neutral I&#x27;ll just state that it is actually quite easy, all you have to do is make sure that your programming represents the political diversity of the region or country. Given the near 50&#x2F;50 split between those who align themselves with the GOP and those who prefer the DNC it would be simply a matter of having half the programming made by &quot;progressives&quot;, half by &quot;conservatives&quot;. Both groups should have essentially the same amount of influence on what gets put on the air. There should not be room for shenanigans like having a station master from party A who does his best to put all programming which aligns more with party B in the nightshift. Throw in a few Libertarian&#x2F;Green Party&#x2F;etc. people in the newsroom to give them a proportional voice and you&#x27;re well on your way to political neutrality.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re confusing being politically neutral with being politically centric? They&#x27;re not the same. It just means that the net average political stance ends up as a weighted average of the current political spectrum.')
