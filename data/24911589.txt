There&#x27;s a growing perception that a lot of mathematical abstractions that are purely naval-gazing have arisen from ZFC, and the intuitionalists and finitists are gaining followers amongst amateur and upcoming mathematicians. I don&#x27;t have data to back this, just a feeling that I get.<p>And I think in particular this is attractive to programmers because this skews closer to what we&#x27;ve learned about computability and program design, and I think there&#x27;s even some hope of moving forward from obscure notation and single-letter variable names towards a syntax for doing mathematics that can be more expressive and easier to verify.')
