Where they diverged on newer things, bash nearly always acquired the feature later than zsh and only very rarely implemented things in a compatible way. Especially for interactive features, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve seen any need to be compatible. Zsh made more effort on easing things for old tcsh users. It is only on Linux where bash came to be a &quot;default&quot; â€“ if you want pure defaults, see how you enjoy either early sh or a pure POSIX variant as an interactive shell.<p>Where differences drive you bananas, a little effort to find the right knob to tweak and to stick with it would be rewarded in the long run as you explore the nicer features at your leisure. I&#x27;m guessing the asterisks is `setopt NOMATCH` to tweak or, otherwise to understand the benefits of the zsh default.')
