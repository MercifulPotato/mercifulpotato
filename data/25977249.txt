Here are some of my pain points:<p>1) Having to &quot;docker exec&quot; to get a shell in a running container vs just running the command (in dev) or sshing into the server (in prod).<p>2) Tests taking 3:30 min to run with docker vs 30 secs without. And then of course, you don&#x27;t just run tests once but many times, leading to tens of minutes on a given day where I&#x27;m just twisting my thumbs.<p>3) Having to even spend time learning how to debug Python code inside a locally running docker container.<p>4) Having to deal with disk space issues caused by old docker images on my 500gb hdd.<p>All while not deriving any value from it in my projects.')
