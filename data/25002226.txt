To hire more city employees at above-market rates? To build new parks and roads? To fund public transportation?<p>The money will be used for what it always is - some of it will be good and some of it won&#x27;t be very good. Once it&#x27;s in the pot, it gets stirred around and all sorts of people and projects get a full bowl. That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s interesting about this story - taxes get raised all the time by all sorts of authorities. What&#x27;s interesting is that the tax is full of perverse incentives and may very well lead to lower, not higher tax receipts.')
