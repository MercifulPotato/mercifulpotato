Item(by='speedgoose', descendants=None, kids=[24971704, 24971883], score=None, time=1604342950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24969793, text='I used Audacity (and YouTube-dl) a few days ago to have an estimation of the top speed using the SSC information such as the gearbox ratios and the size of the tires, and the sound of the engine in the YouTube video.<p>Because it&#x27;s actually simple to listen how fast an engine rotates, I found that they went slower than what is advertised and that the engine didn&#x27;t rotate as fast as they claim. I computed 7530rpm and they claim 8600rpm.<p>I posted it on HN and I hope it&#x27;s ok to post it again as a comment : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fungiboletus.github.io&#x2F;ssc-rpm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fungiboletus.github.io&#x2F;ssc-rpm&#x2F;</a>')
