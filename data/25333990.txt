It had some mechanical ventilation, but it&#x27;s not really the same as actual fresh air. It was by far the most horrible office I&#x27;ve ever worked at.<p>A lot of people also don&#x27;t like it when I open windows for a bit to let some fresh air in, even when the air is clearly stale and musty. I don&#x27;t know why people are so opposed to opening windows. My pet theory is that it&#x27;s a subconscious psychological connection to a certain piece of software :-)')
