But Morehead&#x27;s review wasn&#x27;t of the M1 processor or architecture as a technology. It was a review of the 13&quot; M1 MacBook Pro as an end-user device.<p>Software problems _are_ worth raising in a review of who should buy an M1 MacBook, and why someone shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Because of the architecture change, the M1 has to come up — to omit its role in requiring Rosetta would be lying through omission. It&#x27;s not an indictment of the technology, and shouldn&#x27;t be controversial, for an end-user review to say the first OS revision targeting the first generation of a piece of hardware maybe isn&#x27;t ready for every task thrown at it, especially those that rely on the newest of the new software components. It&#x27;s why my workplace isn&#x27;t even mostly on Catalina yet, much less Big Sur.<p>For the love of whatever stupid internet points people are trying to win, let Morehead&#x27;s review go. It&#x27;s contributor report on Forbes, which makes it only slightly more relevant than a Reddit post. Folks can absolutely find better things to squabble over about these computers.')
