Instead of abuse their market position by forcing AMP down publisher&#x27;s throats, they can do much the same thing but with an appearance of neutrality.<p>I think most of us here know that 99% of publishers will not be able to match AMP in performance, so the incentives haven&#x27;t changed.<p>I like the change though because this will force everyone to pay attention to website performance - something that&#x27;s often an afterthought. We used to be able to use the internet over a dial up modem and it was OK, not great, but OK. Now that would be nearly impossible.')
