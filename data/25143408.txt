That&#x27;s the basic fact underlying this. Any argument you make about kids changing when they become teenagers needs to have this realization at its core. Once you realize that, <i>then</i> you can start to make judgements about whether or not their behavior is cause for alarm or not.<p>Yes apps are addictive, because they&#x27;re designed that way. But I can tell you what else is designed to be addictive: <i>literally everything</i>. Do you think Doritos taste the way they do by accident? They don&#x27;t fall off the Dorito tree tasting like that. Or what about the chip companies that has the slogan &quot;betcha can&#x27;t eat just one&quot; or &quot;once you pop, the fun don&#x27;t stop&quot;? Likewise, why do TV shows and movies never line up with reality, even if they&#x27;re based on a true story? Because they were designed to be more interesting than reality. Why do episodes always end on a cliff-hanger, or people leaving a theater say &quot;man they really set that up for a sequel&quot;? Because it was designed to be addictive. Why do most songs last about three minutes and have two verses and two repetitions of the chorus? Because the producer knows that&#x27;s the most addictive way to write a song.<p>I mean <i>literally everything</i>: Why is bread and milk at the back of a grocery store? Because they know you&#x27;re going to buy that anyway, and if it&#x27;s at the back, you&#x27;ll need to walk past a whole bunch of other things that are all designed to be addictive, with colorful marketing signs designed to maximize engagement. Why do automakers make cars with smooth gear changes and plush leather seats and feature-filled entertainment consoles and a jillion speakers? Because that keeps people happier in their car and more likely to buy another one of those cars in the future. Why do people love dogs? Because humans purposefully designed wolves into the perfect human companion, and everything about a dog was designed to increase user retention and engagement. Why does cola have caffeine added to it? Because caffeine is addictive. There is literally no other reason.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s designed to be addictive&quot; isn&#x27;t an excuse, because <i>everything</i> is designed to be addictive. So start with &quot;my child is turning into a teenager and teenagers like different things than children&quot; and then subtract &quot;everything is designed to be addictive&quot; from your reasons. How do you talk to your children when they want more Pringles or a(nother) dog or to stay up late watching TV, or when they&#x27;re upset that their first car doesn&#x27;t have Bluetooth audio? I&#x27;ll bet this author wouldn&#x27;t write an article shaming their kids for that.')
