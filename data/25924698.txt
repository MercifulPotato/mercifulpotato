There may be commercial advantages to having accounts for your business, but there&#x27;s absolutely no reason you need to personally participate in the discourse or know about the most viral tweets.<p>I think we&#x27;ve gotta step back and recognize how strange this would sound just a couple decades ago. If you talked to someone in the 70s, they&#x27;d tell you that of <i>course</i> mainstream media platforms are sanitized for public sensibilities; that&#x27;s just what it means to be a mainstream media platform. If you want to show things that might shock and offend people, you have every right to do so, but you&#x27;ve gotta do it in a smaller forum. My argument is that they were right, and the past decade of nation-scale but unsanitized platforms has been an inherently unstable aberration.')
