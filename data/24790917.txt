This is about censorship and even application of &quot;community standards.&quot;<p>Twitter has never once censored any of smears or leaks against the Trump campaign.<p>Also, your criteria for this story to reek shows your bias. It&#x27;s not like Joe Biden himself bragged about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired with the threat of holding back a billion dollars. It&#x27;s on video, just Google it. And Hunter Biden is an admitted drug addict. So nothing that has been exposed from that laptop reeks too much.<p>You want to say Hunter was set up? Okay, I&#x27;ll go down that rabbit hole, but to say this is all false? Well, again, your bias is showing.')
