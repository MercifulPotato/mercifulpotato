And even if a couple postal workers snicker at what you wrote, then that&#x27;s where it ends. There is no conceivable scenario in which hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of people will spend tomorrow talking about your postcard, sharing your postcard, contacting your boss about your postcard, photographing your postcard and critiquing it in the NY Times, and so on.<p>One of the weird things about social media for me is that my intuitions about the postcard -- nobody cares, nobody will read it, what do I care if the postal workers laugh at what I said? -- don&#x27;t actually work all that well on social media.')
