There&#x27;s nothing inherent to processing food that makes it less healthy. In fact it could potentially make it even more healthy, e.g. adding fiber or protein to a starch. Heck, even just like at the original processing technique. Cooked vegetables are more nutritious than raw vegetables.<p><i>But</i> the reality is that 99% of processing is directed at making foods hyper-palatable, calorically dense, and easy to digest. Because that&#x27;s what consumers crave. If someone&#x27;s investing the capital necessary to process foods, it would not be smart to do it such a way to make their product <i>less</i> appealing.<p>So the reality is that avoiding processed foods in favor of whole foods winds up being a pretty good heuristic. The only real exception I can think of are products marketed explicitly as health food, and even a lot of times they&#x27;re not actually that healthy.')
