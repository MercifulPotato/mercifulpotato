We humans are literally the most dangerous organism on this planet. After we perfected murdering other animals with spears and arrows, we took to killing each other. That got boring so we started boring into mountains to kill them too. That&#x27;s when we then learned about explosives, oh buddy did we start killing big ass mountains too, disappearing them from the landscape for coal. That got boring so we started murdering microscopic creatures. All while we still kill each because they wear a different flag, said something we dont like or are the last pizza slice.<p>We&#x27;ve been assassinating for thousands of years. Theres no precedence. This event will be forgotten in a week and probably will never be in a history book due to how mundane the killing was. The term assassin is old as hell for a reason.')
