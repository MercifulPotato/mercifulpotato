Thanks to recent improvements in the Go compiler however, as well as general improvements in CPU micro-architectures, this cost has been greatly reduced in 2020.<p>I read that as &quot;used to be non-negligable, is now negligable&quot;<p>4%-10% depending on compiler and architecture is pretty variable, to my way of thinking. YMMV.<p>also kinda random, in that there&#x27;s nothing I can do in the code to determine how much overhead it costs, or change that (apart from ignoring Go&#x27;s convention on error handling completely, which I&#x27;m not going to do because it wasn&#x27;t a convention for performance reasons in the first place).')
