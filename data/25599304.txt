The buyer must necessarily trust the vendor to deliver.<p>There&#x27;s no recourse outside of the good graces of the vendor.  There&#x27;s no chargebacks or third party mediation.<p>Thus Bitcoin actually reverses the risk assumed by online purchases from the vendor to the buyer.<p>This is the reason why Bitcoin is a failure outside of niche grey and black market concerns.  It is far worse for the consumer than existing solutions that isolate them from transaction risk, and will usually kick back a small percentage in cash back.')
