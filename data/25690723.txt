You cannot shoot to immobilize. Every shot taken is practically and legally a shot intending to kill. Real life is not a hollywood movie.<p>Someone knowledgeable of the subject, which you imply I am not, would know that shooting someone in the middle of their body is the standard operating procedure (and is potentially less fatal, but yes legally still intended to kill) rather than taking an (essentially) headshot as this officer did.<p>Also notice I did not say what the officer did was &quot;against policy&quot; or illegal, I simply said I didn&#x27;t feel it was justified (especially with where the shot hit). It&#x27;s for the department and the courts to decide if the officer violated his duty.')
