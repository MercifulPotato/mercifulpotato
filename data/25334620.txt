This reminds me of a story.<p>A few years ago, I had the very bad idea of replying to one of the typical &quot;lol millennials amirite&quot; posts. I called it unprofessional and told them to be more careful about the way they carried themselves because &quot;this is not Facebook&quot;.<p>This prompted a lengthy, downright insane reply from another person, who criticised me because &quot;Facebook is a very big job searching platform&quot; (huh? How does that change my point?) and called themselves &quot;a world thought leader, according to my friends&quot;.<p>At that point I just blocked that whole thread because it was actually giving me anxiety and I just didn&#x27;t know how to reply to that without making things worse.')
