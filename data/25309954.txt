Sure I didn&#x27;t contribute as much to the team, but the team didn&#x27;t need it and I had fun.<p>Having some more difficult rounds could make it more rewarding to win the next round.<p>But constantly having to play against similarly skilled players to me would totally not be what I&#x27;d be after.')
