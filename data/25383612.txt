Item(by='geocar', descendants=None, kids=[25383680], score=None, time=1607675333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379559, text='&gt; the second Volkswagen says you can&#x27;t use a 3rd party part in your car that you bought - everyone should be up in their arms about it.<p>There&#x27;s a risk-benefit question to be weighed <i>even with cars</i>; Lots of parts in a Volkswagen are sealed for safety reasons, and (in many countries) your car will get inspected regularly (here in Portugal it&#x27;s an annual occurrence) to make sure your modifications don&#x27;t impact the safety of your car and to others you meet on the road.<p>Having to re-tether your phone periodically to a diagnostic device to rekey and verify the trusted base seems like a reasonable analogue to me and that&#x27;s largely where unlocking on iPhone is at the moment.<p>&gt; like on android devices when you want to unlock a bootloader - a one way, single step process<p>I think &quot;single step&quot; is a bit disingenuous here: It&#x27;s many little steps that all have to be performed correctly, and that then need to be sealed by <i>re</i>locking the bootloader (wiping the phone again) or you&#x27;ll end up with a phone that cannot any longer protect your data from physical access, and may have a diminished capability to protect you from remote access.<p>There&#x27;s a case to do this in the lab, but I think nobody in their right mind should put their banking details in an unlocked phone -- and yet that&#x27;s exactly where most guidance about unlocking various Android devices leaves its users...<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a line here - and it should end at customers choice, always.<p>&gt; it still leaves the final choice to you, the user<p>If I woke up to find my bank account suddenly $100k lighter, I&#x27;d want my money back, and giving the bank any opportunity to say <i>well Geo, you made a choice to rip out the trusted base we were relying on</i> would fill me deeply with regret for letting the Internet convince me this was something as simple as choice.<p>Right now, there are relatively few people in the world who would be confronted with that dilemma -- precisely because iPhones don&#x27;t make this easy. Do you agree? Or can you explain why you think it would make our society better to have more people face that?')
