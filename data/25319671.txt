My wife and I face 6 months of jail time if we step out of our 8 sq. m &#x2F; 86 sq. ft hotel room even once in 13 days&#x27; quarantine.  (All travellers are quarantined.  We&#x27;ve both had negative PCR tests before flying and negative IgM tests upon arrival, with another IgM test scheduled for this Wednesday.  The 1st night of 14 was spent in another hotel, provided by the government.)  We&#x27;re in our early 40s and pretty healthy, walking at least 5 km every day in November, often more than 10 km.<p>The first 8 days of our 14 day travel quarantine have gone mostly fine, but I&#x27;ve noticed my muscle mass dropping rapidly, despite some isometric exercises and bodyweight squats in the shower.<p>There&#x27;s about 2 feet between the foot of the bed and the wall, and 2 feet between the left side of the bed and the wall.  Some of that space is taken by our luggage from spending all of November abroad.  We&#x27;ve put as much as we can under the bed.  We have no chairs in here.  There&#x27;s a writing surface attached to the wall at the foot of the bed that my wife uses for her laptop while working remotely.  I work remotely while lying down on the bed, since my wife gets back problems much more easily than I do.<p>I&#x27;m aware of cardiovascular and gallstone risk from immobility and rapid fat loss.  We thankfully brought 90 days&#x27; worth of multivitamins with us on our 30-day trip.  (The government changed quarantine policy while we were away.  We planned for this possibility, or the possibility of being stranded abroad for a few months, but were hoping to be able to spend our 14 days of quarantine at home.  We&#x27;re glad we planned ahead.)')
