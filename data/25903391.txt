Oviously when I speak I want to be head, so it&#x27;s not &quot;I don&#x27;t care if nobody knows about it.&quot;<p>But I think that&#x27;s far too broad a definition of &quot;signaling.&quot; The original article says &quot;Building social capital through signaling.&quot;<p>When you post about your gardening to see if there are any other gardeners you can connect with, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily to &quot;build your social capital,&quot; yet you can prove that it isn&#x27;t.')
