Man, they put DOCTORS doing their job to prisons ! Actually we shoud be more concerned about such idiocy ! Where is logic in that ?\nLooks more like mentality from few hundreds years ago reborn in autocratic country. Communists usually give orders for achievements :&gt;<p>But yes, as you pointed, not everything is &quot;CCP propaganda&quot; and such meme is often trown in unresponsible way.<p>And yes, pointing earlier cases in Europe is good to know too. But in Europe there was cases (x-rays photos, can&#x27;t find info about dead cases) in September &#x2F; November but in China there was EPIDEMY in early November.
