Wolves were reintroduced to my original part of the US to much benefit, not just the conservation of the species. Stupid whitetail deer were running wild, destroying flora and destroying too many cars on the region&#x27;s highways.<p>Departments of game and wildlife tried to address this by issuing more hunting permits for whitetail. Didn&#x27;t work. There are only so many hunters, and they hunt all they can. More permits doesn&#x27;t do anything for them when the population is booming. They&#x27;re not hunting anything that exists, they&#x27;re looking for trophies at this point, and taking the best of the gene pool. A group of vehicle insurance companies were organizing events, leasing hunting land, and paying bounties in a couple counties due to the rampant whitetail population.<p>Wolves were reintroduced there to much benefit making for a healthy population of whitetail. Also, because the whitetail overpopulation has been curtailed, game law violations dropped in that rural part of the world. It takes a dedicated hunter to actually &#x27;hunt&#x27;, but attracts any idiot with a rifle when game in an area is rampantly overpopulated.')
