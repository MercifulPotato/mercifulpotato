They were around for over a 100 years, then digital photography came along to disrupt their market and they pretty much disappeared in a few months.<p>Kodak was well aware of digital photography, arguably one of its pioneers. What killed Kodak was cellphones. Kodak was too dependent and attached to making cameras and camera-related equipment. Most people did not need separate cameras once cellphones came along (even the &#x27;dumb&#x27; models have a camera), so Kodak had nothing relevant to sell... Doubtful Google could be so stupid. Maybe if the Feds separate gmail from Search there&#x27;ll be problems?<p>&gt;I wish nothing but success for Fastmail or any other email service that lets you control your email, but if they go down then you&#x27;re in the same position as Google going down while using gmail.<p>Keeping all your mails locally is not difficult if you use a mail client rather than a web client. Copying to a local folder every once in a while is a one&#x2F;two click operation in typical clients.')
