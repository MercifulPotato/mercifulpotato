Are you saying that it would be a good thing if society in western countries were more like what it was 400 years ago?  Enormous improvements in science, technology, culture and civil society grew out of that 400 year history, and regressing or remaining static over that 400 years would be a disaster.<p>The <i>only</i> way to have a stable society that spans across centuries is to have a society that can change and incorporate new ideas, technology, people and ways of doing things.  It&#x27;s societies that aren&#x27;t flexible and strong enough to cope with change that are unable to remain stable over long periods of time.')
