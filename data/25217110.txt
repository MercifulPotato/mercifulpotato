Stop and ask the customer - what are they looking to do with a writing instrument? Go as deep as possible in understanding their need in that conversation by asking questions. Once you understand the need - work out how best to fit the pen you&#x27;re selling to their needs.<p>Two benefits of this approach: the customer does most of the talking.
