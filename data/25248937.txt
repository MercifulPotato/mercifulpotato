I remember playing this sort of game years ago, maybe on Solaris? Very fun thank you.<p>One thing that might help unfamiliar players is a list of all tiles in the deck(?). I assume better players know how many there are of each which means it is safe to remove some easier ones when there can&#x27;t be any more.
