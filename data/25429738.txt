It leads to an awful feeling of &quot;missing one&#x27;s true calling&quot;.<p>In the end, I did not acquire a significant amount of merit or status related to those capacities I heard people tell me.<p>Rating oneself, evaluating oneself, comparing oneself to others is NEVER healthy. The universe doesn&#x27;t care, society doesn&#x27;t care, your relatives don&#x27;t really care, it will not make you happier, and generally it won&#x27;t make the world a better place.<p>It&#x27;s important to have humility, and avoid the reflexes of constantly having the thought of &quot;what rank am I, do I reach my objectives, am I doing my part&quot;. It matters to do self introspection but it&#x27;s not healthy to be afraid of natural selection because it leads to a social darwinist mindset, &quot;eat or be eaten&quot;, which will always generate anxiety and fear. Civilized brains are able to focus on cooperation, not domination.<p>Humans exited the food chain, so there&#x27;s no need to act like animals in the wild.')
