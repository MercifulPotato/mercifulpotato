I think we also tend to overvalue getting that information and retaining it. The HN crowd is biased towards analysis and information, but just look at the abundance of note-taking systems posted.<p>I used to store as much info as I could somewhere (a personal wiki) but over the years I realized there&#x27;s just too much there and most of it I never need, and if I do need something, I can look it up again anyway.<p>I think it&#x27;s possible to become something of an information pack rat. It&#x27;s true that for me learning something new feels productive somehow, but if I were to be honest, most of the knowledge I seek out online doesn&#x27;t really provide me with direct value.
