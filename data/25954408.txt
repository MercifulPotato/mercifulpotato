Other than the name (and the currently accepted &quot;value&quot; of the coin), it doesn&#x27;t seem as though, to the lay investor&#x2F;user of the currency, there is any true difference.<p>Today&#x27;s insane 800%+ increase in DOGE scares me into thinking that most of the folks I know who have been working in today&#x27;s version of cryptocurrencies are literally building the equivalent of giant ponzi schemes (I should know -- I unintentionally ran one at one point in my life).<p>So... your thoughts?')
