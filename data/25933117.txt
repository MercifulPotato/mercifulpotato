Standardizing a mechanism like this is insanely complex so for the most part it would be &#x27;per company&#x27;.<p>And even within the vehicles of one company, changing a Model S and Cybertruck battery is very challenge.<p>Even assuming all of that works, it requires you to totally change the whole engineering on the car. Designing the car to have battery swap makes it far more complex to integrate the battery pack with the vehicle structure and makes it more difficult to protect the battery.<p>Tesla moved away from even having the option of a swapable battery when they added extra protection on the bottom of the car to prevent more fires and accidents like that.<p>NIO in China does operate a system like that, but the swap stations are human operated. So you drive up, hand over your car to a person, who drives it into the swap station for you and returns it.<p>Its also incredibly expensive to build these stations, let alone operate 1000s of them.')
