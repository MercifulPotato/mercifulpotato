I would say its about continues intervention.<p>Continues -&gt; reminding people how shitty it is and that we can&#x27;t accept the current state which you would say is &#x27;pretty OK&#x27;.<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong: Why would you even try to counter argue about something like whale rescue? Do you have the feeling that we as a society are spending too much money on rescuing and saving species versus i don&#x27;t know cars?<p>Lets give them more money, lets create jobs which are actually here to help our planet and lets do something useful once instead of writing just another backend.')
