Item(by='nurspouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609568016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610783, text='&gt; I have to disagree with this as an Iranian working in Germany who moved with an offer on a Blue Card.<p>Reading up on it, I assume you got this offer while not in the EU? That is impressive. Over here (and often in Canada as well), few companies will give you an offer without you doing an on site interview - unless you are clearly exceptional. So it becomes a Catch-22.<p>(Of course, things likely changed in the age of COVID).<p>&gt; Regarding your other point about racism, that experience is not representative of the whole of EU. I am biased as I live in Berlin but I think you are also biased (probably) if you live in the multi cultural centers of US(SV&#x2F;LA&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;Seattle etc.).<p>Well, like in the EU, it is fairly nuanced here. I&#x27;ve spent most of my time in the US in small towns, actually - 100K or smaller, and some time in a larger city (but not as big as Seattle, etc). I&#x27;ve lived in both Red and Blue states. It&#x27;s extremely hard to generalize. The least diverse city I lived in was also the most welcoming (I am not white) - and in a Red state. The larger, multicultural (and liberal) city I live in only like people like ma as long as my views are in line with theirs ;-)<p>I may be wrong. Pre-2016, it was <i>much</i> easier to find very open and vocal anti-immigrant rhetoric in the EU - but perhaps it&#x27;s just a very loud minority. Of course, post-2016 you see plenty of that in the US. But prior to that, people really cared mostly about illegal immigration (and amusingly, the pro-immigration folks are often only referring to illegal immigrants - they do very little for those trying to gain legal immigration).<p>Speaking of racism in the US, here are some comments I made a while ago with more details:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21486342" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21486342</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19324589" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19324589</a>')
