I agree that Congress is out of touch with many tech challenges, but it doesn&#x27;t apply to the issue under consideration. You don&#x27;t need to be tech-savvy to understand or consider the implications of media control over public speech. Society has struggled with this issue since the dawn of mass media. It&#x27;s fundamentally the same concern we faced with yellow journalism a full century ago, and back to the dawn of man in many ways.<p>I don&#x27;t trust our politicians when it comes to complicated tech issues. I may not agree with how they handle current social media issues. But I don&#x27;t think tech ignorance is limiting their understanding of <i>this</i> issue. It&#x27;s a social issue and a media issue. It&#x27;s not a tech issue.')
