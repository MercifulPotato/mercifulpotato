As opposed to your own machine, running half-way across the country where you might only be able to achieve 10Mbps between you and the AWS datacenter.<p>Think &quot;I&#x27;ll run this arbitrary script to batch-process input-bucket X to output-bucket Y, enriching the data by calling out to internal service Foo and external service Bar.&quot; The kind of thing Google&#x27;s Cloud Dataflow is for, but one-off and freeform.<p>â€”also, for a lot of people, just the fact that things are running in the cloud, means they&#x27;re running more reliably. If you want to run something that&#x27;s going to take four days to finish, you don&#x27;t want to do it on your own workstation. What if the power cuts out in your house? (Just the fact that you can restart&#x2F;OS-update your local computer and &quot;keep your place&quot; in the remote is nice, too.) You want a remote VM somewhere (preferably with live migration in case of host maintenance) running screen(1) or tmux(1), with your job inside it. Of course, you can just create a regular VM in your VPC, and do it on top of that; but a cloud shell abstracts that away, and &quot;garbage collects&quot; after itself if you leave it idle.')
