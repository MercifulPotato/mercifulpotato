I was sitting with friends at a lookout and I wandered off to take a leak. I jumped over a side fence to give some distance, not realizing that there was nothing on the other side.<p>I realized what had happened. My thoughts were along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;m about to be in a lot of pain, I may as well enjoy it on the way down&quot;. I was also horizontal on my back.<p>It ended up being a 10m drop, so not as big as in this story (I went back and measured it another day). It was soft dirt at the bottom, and there was sort of an indent in the cliff at that point so I missed any jutted-out rocks coming down. When I landed I bit through my tongue and was horribly winded, but otherwise ok.<p>I am religious but also remember making a firm note on the way down that nothing supernatural appeared to be happening, mostly because prematurely assigning meaning when these things happen tends to annoy me. I don&#x27;t think I ever thought I was going to die, maybe at 10m I didn&#x27;t have enough time. I just remember looking intensely at everything thinking I probably wouldn&#x27;t get the opportunity to fall off a cliff again.')
