In reality it isn&#x27;t so cheap because it&#x27;s poor oversold technology.<p>* AWS&#x2F;GCP have exorbitant bandwidth pricing. Linode bandwidth is very generous, as its pooled across all servers in the account.<p>* Having someone to pick up the phone 24&#x2F;7 when there&#x27;s a problem is a big plus in theory. However, it&#x27;s much better not to need to call in the first place because things just work.<p>* Migrating providers can be an expensive and time-consuming endeavour.<p>* Technical debt, interdependencies, manually configured snowflake servers and infrastructure, no documentation, etc. makes changes risky.<p>* Not enough DevOps on the team, and too many fires to put out, and shiny features to ship means cloud provider migration is low on the priority list.')
