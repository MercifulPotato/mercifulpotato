It allows to start making cars, like Tesla had with original Roadster which otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be let on the public roads. I think it is a great approach in US to have those limited loopholes in various domains which allow to start making things - such loopholes are absent in for example Russia (my old country) and through the Europe and that affects the entrepreneurship and innovation.')
