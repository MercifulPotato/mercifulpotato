Most countries would love to be in that position. Cutting off that immigration in order to &quot;serve the nation&quot; would be incredibly short-sighted.<p>&gt; students who are likely to take the knowledge gained (at institutions built in part through decades of public funding) back to their home countries (understandably).<p>Or, if they&#x27;re allowed to, remain in the US and contribute to its continued technological and scientific dominance. Even if they eventually leave the US, they don&#x27;t just soak up knowledge while they&#x27;re in the US. Most actual research is done by graduate students, for relatively meager pay. The US has a continual influx of extremely smart people who are willing to work relatively cheaply to keep American research institutions at the forefront of scientific research. How is this a bad deal for the United States?')
