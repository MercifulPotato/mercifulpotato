This is a critical phenomenon that is changing the dynamics of the network. Human networks are able to change their inner structure in order to reach a better solution than what&#x27;s possible in existing models.&quot;<p>This may be true of trained musicians (who have to deal with this kind of thing in ensemble playing. I&#x27;m reminded of when I&#x27;ve volunteered in less experienced or youth orchestras), but I would be careful to extrapolate or expect similar results in other human systems.<p>My biggest gripe here is that I find it incredibly distracting when videos of string players do not sync the video to the sound they produced. You can easily notice it when a single violinist changes bow direction and the sound doesn&#x27;t change. In a study and art piece about synchronization, syncing video to audio is pretty crucial!')
