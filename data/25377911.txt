How else do you get themes of technology being a boon to society? Isn&#x27;t it these companies who indirectly dictate this (e.g by using your public data)?<p>CD Projekt Red is a great example of why publicly owned companies and creating expectations for unreasonable deadlines for any software is going to cause your employees to deal with crunch and release something that doesn&#x27;t work that great. Unfortunately I&#x27;m sure that this game will entertain more than it will highlight horrible industry practices.')
