When I get asked at interviews &quot;what is your recent work you are most proud of?&quot; and I can&#x27;t bring myself to cite my Elixir or Rust work (even if I did some pretty solid work there in the last years) and the first thing that immediately springs to mind is how I actually invested two days in a shell script that did a job (making PDF invoices in a system that wasn&#x27;t meant for that but the data was in the DB) that the management thought is going to take 3 months.<p>Since then I changed my LinkedIn headline to: &quot;Solving problems with technology&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s what people care about. Not which language we use.')
