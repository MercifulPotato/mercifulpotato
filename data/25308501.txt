A similar, yet completely different, single-factor explanation is that a large number of PLA soldiers learning to swim in preparation of an amphibious assault ended up infected with <i>Schistosomiasis</i>, because the <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> parasite is endemic to China&#x27;s coastal rivers. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;the-fluke-that-thwarted-an-invasion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discovermagazine.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;the-fluke-that-thwar...</a><p>I was also a bit surprised by one big omission in the introduction of Cai Xiaogan:<p>&gt; In the 1920s, he left Taiwan as a teenager to attend school in Shanghai. On campus, far from home, Cai was apparently lonely and confused, making him easy prey for communist recruiting efforts.<p>In 1927, hundreds or thousands (depending on the source) of dissidents were killed in the Shanghai massacre, even though Kuomintang and Communists were theoretically allied. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shanghai_massacre" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shanghai_massacre</a> Nowadays, killing dissidents would be more expected of the Communist Party, but back then, they were the victims. If Cai was in Shanghai at the time, witnessing the KMT&#x27;s violent suppression of their political enemies likely contributed greatly to his decision to join the CCP and eventually lead their espionage efforts in his native Taiwan.')
