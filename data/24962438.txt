The kinds of changes they&#x27;re taking about get tested. A site will collect data, make changes and observe the impact on the data. A good way to go is present different users a randomly selected version of a site and track which version does better. With tests like that we can rule out people simply adapting over time.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered if the reverse study is done; keep the old versions of the UX around for months&#x2F;years as an experiment to make sure the improvements are still there, or if there&#x27;s a regression to the mean.  This sounds much harder to do because most development is roll-forward with new features and such.<p>Also; practically how does attribution play into conversion measurements? In theory it should be easier now to tell whether it was landing-page+UX or view-through&#x2F;click-through that made the bigger difference.')
