I personally dislike Git, but I absolutely think Git is a borderline-unacceptable choice for everyone that hasn&#x27;t been hazed into the industry with it. The amount of &quot;I accidentally lost all my animation files for ____ feature&quot; is huge. I think most of the positive talk about git UX just waters down to &quot;I know it already&quot;, which is evidenced by most of the responses to valid git UX criticisms being &quot;You just don&#x27;t understand.&quot; To me, version control should be as complex as a user wants it to be. Meaning, UX so obvious that you don&#x27;t need docs or manuals or youtube videos to do the simplest of tasks if you don&#x27;t want to. There should definitely be room for power users to be power users, but I think git absolutely fails at letting both novices and those that aren&#x27;t interested in version-control-as-a-specialty be consistently productive and safe.<p>It&#x27;s always been very curious to me that, for so many parts of dev, we re-invent the wheel a thousand times to try to find the &quot;right&quot; configuration, which ultimately leaves you with a very wide array of options for every one job, but for source control we seem to have just kind of shrugged and said &quot;Git&#x27;s fine.&quot;')
