However, in this case I think the whole value-proposition of Brave Today is that it is not just another web site.  Meaning that instead of needing to compile a sketchy privacy invasive cloud-profile on a user in order to surface relevant content, since Brave Today runs locally it can make the decision locally about what content is relevant to the user (based on the local browser data) without having to send anything to a centralized service.<p>&gt; The Brave Today news reader ranks stories locally for the user from hundreds of popular RSS feeds using an algorithm that weighs several factors, including the userâ€™s browser history and article published date.<p>Ideally, though, I would like to see this implemented as a browser extension or something like that that can be added&#x2F;removed as desired.')
