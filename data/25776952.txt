I would answer the phone, and people would hear my weird teenage voice and assume that I was my mom. After a while I got really self-conscious about it and started deliberately deepening my voice until it fully changed.<p>If somebody&#x27;s appearance or voice doesn&#x27;t match their pronouns, I think they&#x27;re justified in wanting to put that information up front. If somebody&#x27;s gender identity is not obvious, wouldn&#x27;t you rather they just told you up front instead of making you guess and then correcting you?<p>By the same token, if only people with not obvious pronouns practice this, it singles them out. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anybody. I don&#x27;t think it should be mandatory, but I do think it should be celebrated and encouraged.')
