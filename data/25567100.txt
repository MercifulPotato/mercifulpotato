There was no charge for the software, only the underlying resources that you consumed. While privacy and owning your data was a benefit, this had many more downsides and 99% of our customers were asking us to offer those solution as a managed PaaS offering. First, because the app was single tenanted the cost for most users did not justify the benefits that they were getting from it. Maintenance, trouble shooting, scaling, updating, and support are just few areas to call out where our customers had trouble and wanted us to run everything for them and just give them access.<p>Of course the customer experience lacked mostly due to the lack of a better platform for offering such &quot;one click to deploy&quot; apps. But still the customer needs to manage the uptime of the system and have on-call engineers who not only are intimately familiar with our software but can quickly identify and fix the issue.')
