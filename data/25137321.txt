I saw someone on Twitter talk about this guy who has $300k from a master&#x27;s in puppetry (lol?).<p>Besides the obvious first step consequences and moral hazards and not fixing the proper causes of the problem, there are more negative consequences. Think of what would happen to the idea that &quot;the U.S is a fair lender and you can rely on them to do right by you&quot;. What happens to the world investors big and small who observe this and then imagine a day where they would do the same to their U.S Treasury loans etc?<p>At that point all bets are off and no one will loan money to the U.S. The U.S school loan market is greater than $1 trillion, this isn&#x27;t pocket change.')
