This is better for betterIBM and worse for crapIBM<p>2. crapIBM will need to stop using betterIBM&#x27;s tools, and have to quickly negotiate new licenses&#x2F;tools and spend 6+ months of their first fiscal year just moving platforms (moving SAP has often been a 2 year failed IT challenge, good luck). This will make crapIBM continue to look worse, making betterIBM&#x27;s leadership look good for divesting themselves of it.')
