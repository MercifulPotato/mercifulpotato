If you do experiment E1 you will get Result R1.  If you do E2 you will get R2.  Since it is fundamentally impossible to do both on the same system, and the present theory correctly predicts the results of either, how can you say that the theory is incomplete? What more can one ask of a theory?&#x27;<p>While it is easy to understand and agree with this on the epistemological level, the answer that I and many others would give is that we expect a physical theory to do more than merely predict experimental results in the manner of an empirical equation; we want to come down to Einstein&#x27;s ontological level and understand what is happening when an atom emits light, when a spin enters a Stern-Gerlach magnet, etc.  The Copenhagen theory, having no answer to any question of the form: &#x27;What is really happening when - - -?&#x27;, forbids us to ask such questions and tries to persuade us that it is philosophically naive to want to know what is happening.  But I do want to know, and I do not think this is naive; and so for me QM is not a physical theory at all, only and empty mathematical shell in which a future theory may, perhaps, be built.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bayes.wustl.edu&#x2F;etj&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cmystery.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bayes.wustl.edu&#x2F;etj&#x2F;articles&#x2F;cmystery.pdf</a><p>...and which he goes on to makes some interesting observations about the Bell Inequalities.<p>&quot;Just as Bell revealed hidden assumptions in vonNeumann&#x27;s argument,so we need to reveal the hidden assumptions in Bell&#x27;s argument. There are at least two of them, both of which require the Jeffreys view point about probability to recognize...&quot;')
