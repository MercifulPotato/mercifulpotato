Every bit you add one bit it doubles your usable size.<p>The visible universe (according to Wikipedia) is 8.8 * 10^26 meters or about 5.4 * 10^61 Plank lengths. That gives us a log2 of 205.1<p>In other words if my maths is correct if you want to represent the entire visible universe down to the scale of the Planck length you need 206bits of resolution, or 4 64 bit integers with a lot of room to spare.<p>And if you don&#x27;t actually aim to simulate subatomic particles you can get down to millimeter resolution with &quot;only&quot; 100bits.<p>And that&#x27;s not even taking into account that, our universe being so empty, you can probably fudge super large distances a bit (having a lower resolution at scales where the universe is mostly empty). Nobody is going to notice if Andromeda if a few parsecs closer than it should be.')
