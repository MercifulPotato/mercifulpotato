Have the same problem with the Swedish layout. Especially the fact that all systems seems to have their own placement of the | character is quite hard on me.<p>At the moment I’m trying to handle it my learning to code in the se-layout. Isn’t looking promising though, don’t think I’ll ever get used to the {} (it’s a bit curious that the Mac has the Swedish letters printed on the keys but not the other symbols you need)<p>I think when I finally give up on this I’ll try a en layout that lets you type the required umlauts and rings by combining instead.')
