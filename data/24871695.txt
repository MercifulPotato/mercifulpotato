I donâ€™t know if anyone really does this in practice. It takes quite a lot of fuel (and storing the fuel) to generate meaning full power continuously. Plus high pressure steam is dangerous.<p>I&#x27;ve seen links to wood gas generators, which seems a lot more tractable than a homemade steam plant, although this is more micro and less diy; you could diy the wood gas part, but then you&#x27;d most likely put it into a commercially sourced generator. There are some commercially available all in one setups too (wood bits in, AC out). I haven&#x27;t done this, be careful with carbon monoxide and icky condensed liquids.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wood_gas_generator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wood_gas_generator</a>')
