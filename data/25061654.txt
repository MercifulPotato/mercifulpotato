Google was giving unlimited storage for any devices, including Apple’s.<p>It is only fair that in future they will give that perk only to Google device users:<p>&gt; As a side note, Pixel owners will still be able to upload high-quality (not original) photos for free after June 1st without those images counting against their cap. It’s not as good as the Pixel’s original deal of getting unlimited original quality, but it’s a small bonus for the few people who buy Google’s devices.<p>Among big players I believe Amazon still offers unlimited high-quality photo storage.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Amazon-Photos&#x2F;b?node=13234696011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Amazon-Photos&#x2F;b?node=13234696011</a>')
