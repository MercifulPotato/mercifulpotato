Item(by='syshum', descendants=None, kids=[25482152, 25482876], score=None, time=1608417508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481230, text='&gt;&gt;The amount your government retains is not a total loss for you either.<p>I assume here you are implying I get something of value from my tax dollars, but this does not make it any less of a theft.  If I come to your home, mow your grass then &quot;tax&quot; your car from you as payment for my services you would still call that theft. and rightly so.<p>Simply because the government &quot;gave&quot; me services I neither asked for nor consented to does not mean their taking of my labor &#x2F; money is ceases to be theft<p>&gt;If you produce a profit for your employer, you are not earning 100% of your labor, time, and knowledge.<p>This is false thinking, given your clear bias to socialism I can understand why you think that but it never the less false<p>My employer accepts my labor (at the agreed rate), then combines my labor with the labor of others, and their own capital investment &#x2F; or other assets (like a brand) where by that is repackaged by them to be sold as goods and services on the market.<p>True the total value of the end product sold has to be greater than their purchase cost, that is how businesses work, and how a Value Add economy functions, that however does not mean I did not get 100% of the value of my labor,  on the contrary.<p>I will ignore the attempt the slide in the government as a valid and ethical actor in the transaction, they are not.  A market transaction consists of the buyer and seller that is all,  the government is an unethical 3rd party leech on the system<p>Keep in mind I am not opposed to all government finance, at the end of the day I would even support a UBI,  in fact I would support a UBI over all other forms of welfare. I however would implement such a system using Georgism Single Tax model on natural resources, not on income, wealth or labor.')
