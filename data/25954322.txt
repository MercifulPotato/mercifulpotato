No one tool, method, book, blog post, forum reply etc will make it all go away. (so try to stop looking for &quot;the one perfect thing&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t exist)<p>I can only list things that have helped me:<p>Making sure my sleep, exercise and nutrition was good. I found this helped reduce the intensity of negative emotions that would loop into social media.<p>I use supplements for Vitamin D and Fish oil.  These seem to improve my concentration, though it could well be a placebo.<p>Using a timer for work. I set a timer and work 15 minutes and then take a 3 minute break. In my breaks I stand up, walk around, go into the other room.\nI try to avoid checking reddit etc in the same place as where I work.  If I&#x27;m on a break with the timer then I will check it in the next room.  I want to build an association of place and activity.<p>I use blocking tools, but they are just to remind you when you forget. Blocking tools are not a replacement for willpower. The seatbelt doesn&#x27;t drive the car.<p>Keep a notebook and write in it before and after work. Try to predict things that will cause you distraction and avoid them or deal with them before it&#x27;s a problem. At the end of the day, reflect on whether your strategies worked.  If they did, keep doing them, if they didn&#x27;t, try something else.  When you start to understand your patterns of addiction you can work out better and more personal ways to deal with it.<p>Plan for the relapse.  It will happen. That&#x27;s ok, but what are you going to do after?<p>I hope some of this can help you.')
