I was pretty alarmed by the announcement, and I think as you mention a lot of it boiled down to that devilish-sounding line:<p>&gt; If you are using CentOS Linux 8 in a production environment, and are concerned that CentOS Stream will not meet your needs, we encourage you to contact Red Hat about options<p>But, after reading your message I can partially see your point of view, in particular your gist seems to be that in the chain of development, CentOS Stream will sit where RHEL used to be, thus if you believed in RHEL as a boring, stable, reliable OS in the old world then so too should CentOS Stream be a boring, stable, reliable OS in the new one.<p>This logic makes sense, with one exception: this assumes that the standard for release quality remains unhindered pre&#x2F;post swapping the position of RHEL &#x2F; CentOS.<p>Before, Red Hat was incentivized to make sure RHEL releases were solid gold because <i>paying customers</i> were on the receiving end. CentOS releases were downstream of solid gold, making CentOS solid gold as well.<p>Now that the positions are reversed, what incentive does Red Hat have to make sure things are stable and low-risk before shipping to CentOS Stream? This is ultimately a matter of trust: if CentOS Stream gets a bad release, no paid enterprise server explodes. Quality no longer aligns with profit motive, a terrifying insight.')
