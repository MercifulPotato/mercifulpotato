Item(by='graeme', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610218349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702916, text='&gt; You keep introducing more variables and more arbitrary numbers<p>These variables are the ones that are relevant to deaths and have been talked about since the beginning of the pandemic: hospital overwhelm, total percent of populace infected, etc<p>To refuse to deal with the complexities of the situation doesn’t make them go away. I didn’t introduce any factors apart from the common ones.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s well known that harmless viruses exist, they infect a lot of people and kill nobody (or almost nobody).<p>We’re not talking about those viruses though. Most viruses that we don’t have a vaccine for are either orders of magnitude less lethal or substantially less contagious.<p>&gt; Claiming that more infectious = generally more lethal is just not based on facts.<p>I didn’t say that. I said that at the level of lethality coronavirus is at, an increase in contagiousness is worse than an increase in lethality. Very different claim.<p>&gt; If Covid-19 mutates into a mostly harmless variant, we will easily treat the few more severe infections and nobody will die.<p>This would be true if it mutated into something maybe 100x less contagious. An entirely theoretical possibility. That’s how much more lethal covid is compared to stuff like the cold.')
