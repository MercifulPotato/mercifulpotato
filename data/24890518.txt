Their highest end mobile processor is currently the i7-1185G7 which apparently retails for $426. Let&#x27;s compare it with the closest desktop processor to that price, the i9-10900 ($438).\nCores (Threads): 4(8) vs. 10(20). \nBase Freq: 3.0ghz (At 28w TDP) vs. 2.8ghz. \nMax All Core Turbo: 4.3ghz vs. 4.8ghz<p>Specs can never tell the true story, but it&#x27;s clear that the mobile processor is going to be much slower for anything remotely processor intensive, and probably much more than twice as slow for anything making good use of multithreading.<p>Having had to go back and forth between a laptop and a desktop for a processor intensive application (AutoCAD) the difference was painful.')
