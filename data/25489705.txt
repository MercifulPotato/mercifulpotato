The dumbification of UI coincided with the rise of tablet computers and touchscreen devices. Windows 8 came out around that time too.<p>I personally preferred Gnome 2 when Gnome 3 came out, but I&#x27;ve gotten pretty used to the top-left corner flick after a couple weeks. I sometimes do it on Windows and get disappointed when nothing happens :) This sounds somewhat perverse, but I kind of like the fact that it takes a <i>little</i> extra effort to switch applications. I&#x27;d say it keeps me maybe 5-10% more productive!<p>Ideally, UI&#x27;s should be tailored for the device they get installed on, but I&#x27;m happy Gnome was able to accept a few design compromises in order to keep moving the project forward.')
