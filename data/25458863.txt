Right now, we only support email + password login. But plan on supporting MFA soon. The exact supported methods are TBD.<p>2. The reason that happens is because we do not use iframes for the login UI. We provide a React component instead. The issue with that is that there might be CSS clashes and to prevent that, we use shadow-root (HTML feature). On certain browsers, password managers do not work with a shadow-root. So we provide a config that the user can set to disable the use of shadow-root. This would solve the password manager problem, but the developer will have to make sure that CSS does not clash.<p>3. This behaviour is the default one to quickly get started. We provide callbacks on the backend SDK that devs can override to send a password reset email using their own email ID domain.')
