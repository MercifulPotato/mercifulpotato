If someone in power says a lie about COVID, that may still be worth reporting, because the fact that a person in power misled is, itself, important. But if some rando political operatives push an unverifiable story, the <i>fact that they are claiming it</i> isn&#x27;t itself a story, unless the facts are true.')
