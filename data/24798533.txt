Needless focus on &quot;electric cars&quot; and very little info about the self driving part of it.<p>If your company&#x27;s objectie is reduction of carbon emission you should focus on efficiency and cleaner energy. If your objective is to sell electric car please tell us why it is better than Tesla. Ah, and it can drive itself too ? tell me more about it.')
