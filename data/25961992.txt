I might have to use a JSON file for the backend because I probably can&#x27;t remember any database libs well enough to use without documentation.<p>However, lots of programming is much closer to plumming than to.. programming.. any time you&#x27;re using a lib or api, you&#x27;re just looking up what kind of fittings that comes with and what length of pipe to attach to it.. So don&#x27;t worry about not being able to do anything really useful without looking in the docs :)<p>Now, if you have to look up basic language syntax for the language you use every day, I&#x27;d say its bad and you probably need to practice a bit ^_^')
