There&#x27;s no colored bathrooms and stuff like that.<p>&gt; At least in America now there are laws specifically disallowing discrimination against blacks and minorities. But it appears in Romania and the rest of Eastern Europe there is still widespread discrimination against the Roma. Looks pretty barbaric to me!<p>You are comparing laws on the books on one place with practice in another.<p>There is widespread discrimination against blacks in the US, despite the existence of laws prohibiting it. To the point that white supremacists have expressed confidence that local police throughout the country will stand aside for them to commit murder against blacks and&#x2F;or people seeking accountability for crimes against blacks <i>without any need for direct coordination or specific inside coconspirators</i>, and those sentiments have been validated.<p>Plus, GP didn&#x27;t offer a comparison to current treatment of blacks in America, but basically to treatment before the mid-20th century civil rights movement, when there were <i>not</i> such laws. When someone does that to reject that their treatment of someone else is barbaric, you don&#x27;t need to shift the ground and try to do an apples to oranges comparison to something else, you can just say that the bar they have set is too low to reject the characterization of barbarism even if taken as true.')
