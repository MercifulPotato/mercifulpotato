I threw everything at it from trying to optimise the SQL queries it made to pre-fetching multiple requests to its child processes.

Fixing that gave a 2x performance increase.<p>I went back and tested the various changes I&#x27;d made to that point and thankfully found that most of them were needed to sustain that performance improvement but it was a good reminder to break out the profiler first, not last.')
