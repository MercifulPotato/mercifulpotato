Heck, I even have my own third party based location tracking that dates back to when I was using that for billing clients - IIRC from one of those times when Google killed off a service I was using.<p>The disappearance of my Google account would be annoying (I&#x27;m using an android phone if nothing else), but that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;d probably lose a lot of contacts, but a lot of them would be people I haven&#x27;t really interacted with since I migrated them off my Palm Tungsten T3 so not a huge loss. I&#x27;d lose my calendar entries that remind me it&#x27;s Taco Tuesday 3-for-5 day at a local taqueria, but I&#x27;ll probably remember that.<p>Financial accounts? No. Domain registrations or hosting? Nope. Business email? Nope.  Social media? Not primary at least. Cloud hosting or services? Oh hell no.<p>Google is fine as long as you keep in mind that it&#x27;s a giant behemoth to which you and any concerns you might have matter not one bit. It&#x27;s also a capricious enough behemoth that relying on it for anything important seems foolish.')
