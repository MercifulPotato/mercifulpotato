I bought $300 of new comforters from Ikea but they turned out to not be what the family wanted... Ikea refunded me over the phone and told me to donate them. I also bought a $1,300 bed 3 weeks ago that really did not work for me - same instructions, to donate it and they would refund me without any proof of the donation. This seems ripe for scammers, sadly.<p>Edit, to add: I was expressly told by both companies that they were being Ã¼ber-lenient on returns due to Covid...')
