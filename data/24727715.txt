Or even the lesser: I know that recruiter, they are brilliant), but respecting candidates should be a priority of any organization.</i><p>Generally speaking, the same sort of superlatives used for high IQ aren&#x27;t used to describe high EQ, but we probably should.<p>I have interacted with a few recruiters (not at Stripe, I&#x27;ve never applied there) who were off-the-charts in their ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease, occasionally even in the face of truly horrendous processes and systems failures.<p>Also, it&#x27;s an interesting signal when you get ghosted by the hiring manager (bosses boss of the team lead I would have been reporting to) and the recruiter re-initiates communication to apologize and get things back on track.<p>I still never got that job, but that was basically because &quot;Remote OK&quot; really meant &quot;Remote OK <i>in theory</i> because we like the idea of paying a lower salary, but in practice it&#x27;s only &#x27;OK&#x27;  for overqualified candidates that we can&#x27;t convince to relocate, or maybe a relative of ours&quot;, and definitely not the recruiter&#x27;s fault (it turns out that the hiring manager wasn&#x27;t a good fit for the organization. Go figure.).<p>I did get some really good chocolate chip cookies as a consolation prize, though.')
