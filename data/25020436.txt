So any simple model will in time be found inadequate, and complex models unusable.<p>The problem of programming isn&#x27;t so much the interface. Text has been used for decades and remains a robust communication platform among humans. The real problem is defining the problem to be solved, its scope and adaptability to a complex and changing world.<p>The difficulty is the gap between vague ideas and real world outcomes of automation and human-computer interactions. To codify and implement ideas require precise understanding, design and adaptability which are otherwise demanding, understated and neglected.<p>Notice there is little need to focus on the tools themselves in this realization.<p>Update: Adding a bunch of numbers in a list is never a real problem, so is just an artificial construct.')
