If the tracking code is blocked or fails to load, that means a lot of actions break.<p>Best part? Trying to convince the operators of such sites that users they cannot see in their &quot;analytics solution&quot; are worth fixing their site for is not exactly a straightfoward job - from their narrow view, these users simply do not exist, because the tracking does not show them!')
