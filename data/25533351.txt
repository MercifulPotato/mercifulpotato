I get regular kernel panic induced shutdowns  that I can reproduce when plugging several different MBP compatible docks. Some days, Zoom plus web browser will bring the entire machine to its knees and make it behave like a netbook from years past. Multi monitor support is a giant crapshoot and there is a 50-50 chance all monitors get recognized properly or you keep unplugging and replugging till all your monitors get recognized correctly.<p>Opening new apps feels excruciatingly slow due to OSX sandboxing and I feel like I&#x27;m using a subpar laptop from 8 years ago. Finder is still an abomination in comparison to any sane file browser.<p>At this point, the experience definitely hasn&#x27;t been smoother than with my last XPS15, and I am likely to move back to Windows with my next laptop upgrade at work. I just get the feeling that developers or users like me are an afterthought when it comes to Apple.')
