I think someone at robinhood had the (good) idea that at the current price, most people can realize a nice buck (by selling), while allowing them to buy a stock, which will probably go down a factor of 200 over the next year and currently fluctuates -50%&#x2F;100% on a 20minute schedule required a casino license.<p>The whole idea of the short squeeze is that the hedgefunds can&#x27;t buy anything anymore and the lenders want their stuff back. And if they are still overshorted and the lenders don&#x27;t like to bleed them first, before initiating the squeeze I don&#x27;t think that this somehow hurts retail investors. Maybe it benefits the lenders who can nicely bleed both shortsellers and the WSB+muskalike-crowd, but at the current price, where the stock has actually gone up quite a bit but stabilized, it seems quite clear that this thing is decided by the lenders now. Do they want to play the crazy game for a near bankrupt company and demand their loans from Melvin or Co. (which would probably result in fast default and them not seeing a substantial amount of their shares again with the others reduced to a pennystock) or do they just sail along, taxing the narcissistic sociopaths on one side, while slowly selling off their actual stock to then be bought by those and returned to them. I guess they decided for option 2 and I think they are not as dumb and chaddy as they look to you ;).')
