Especially when bootstrapping (what the post seems to be aimed at), building integrations with a marketplace can be a significant time investment, at the expense of working on other marketing or product improvements. Established marketplaces for popular categories are going to see diminished returns pretty quickly.<p>For example, we were one of the first to integrate with the Google Workspace Marketplace when it launched many years ago (called Google Apps Marketplace back then). It brought us a lot of leads in the early days. Today, discoverability has become a real problem. The &quot;luck&quot;-component in being featured in any search result or when browsing the marketplace is now so large that I&#x27;m not sure if for new products it would still outweigh the work of building the integration and keeping up to date with inevitable breaking API changes.<p>Overall it can be an amazing channel for growth though, so it&#x27;s mostly about carefully picking one where customers might find you, rather than just going for something that looks promising because it&#x27;s big. There&#x27;s a big first-mover advantage when launching on a newish platform (and as the list proves, there&#x27;s many new ones).')
