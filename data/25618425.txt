I leave my phone permanently on do not disturb mode (pagerduty and immediate family are the only exemptions). I use greyscale settings to limit my interest in phones in the evenings. And, if you send me push notifications for ANYTHING I didn&#x27;t expressly request (like a status update on a pending uber), I&#x27;ll manually disable notifications in the system settings for the app.<p>The greyscale one in particular is fascinating, and I can feel the effect immediately if I disable the greyscaling in the evening. The colours are like candy for the sensory system. Instagram is downright boring in black and white :)<p>I wonder if there is some way to configure the same black and white mode on my laptop between certain times.')
