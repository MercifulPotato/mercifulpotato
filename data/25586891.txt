I have no idea how strong the actual analysis is, here, but the format is refreshing.<p>I wish all arguments about everything ever had a page like this; ideally with Wiki-style features like forks and suggested edits or something like that. At the moment I think they just rely on comments rather than something like a Wiki, but the overall model seems really appealing.<p>And, also, with respect to the COVID-19 topic, here people can actually argue about explicit and delineated claims rather than jumping into politics, which I think is way more interesting and productive. If I were dang (and I know I&#x27;m very much not) I&#x27;d keep the thread open but enforce a strict rule that all comments should be directly related to this page and not derail into the usual heat and noise.')
