Item(by='jillesvangurp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602573896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761026, text='Exactly, your software is still running on servers but you no longer worry about managing those.<p>The problem with PAAS and serverless until recently is that they still required a lot of devops activity. Most of that is pure drudgery: setting up networking, dealing with vendor specific weird shit (e.g. amazon&#x27;s IAM makes everything harder than necessary), micromanaging instance types and trading off overpriced vcpus vs small chunks of memory, etc. Lots of things that you can do wrong, lots of subtlety, lots of poorly documented gotchas, lots of potential bugs, etc. And all of that is needed so you can say &quot;go run this over there&quot; where this is your packaged up docker application and there is months of work by some poor devops person to turn a large amount of poorly integrated tools into a vaguely coherent deployment experience. It&#x27;s never simple. It&#x27;s never cheap<p>I had a decent experience with Cloud Run recently. I was not in a mood or position to reserve 3 months out of my schedule to terraform myself a new server environment (which I actually know how to do). I already had the software and I wanted it running ASAP. So, I felt slightly dirty when I did this but got the job done in a few mouse clicks in their UI. This was shockingly easy after basically spending months piecing together arcane crap in AWS in my previous project.<p>This got me a cloud run deployment, a build pipeline against my github repository for continuous deployment, and a running service. I tuned the build file afterwards to do more than just docker build &amp; deploy but that was relatively easy (similar to how most CI systems work these days).<p>They charge for cpu&#x2F;memory used by requests. The whole thing has been running for a few months now. Less than 4 hours of work to figure it all out from me knowing absolutely nothing about Cloud Run to me having a service up and running. I reconfigured the deployment via the UI a couple of times to fiddle with memory and CPU settings.<p>I suppose I could sit down and terraform this at some point but I don&#x27;t feel the need to do that right now. I have more interesting things to do. And technically me spending a day to do that would cost more than running the whole thing has cost so far. That&#x27;s the point: the cost of devops is out of wack with the running cost for a lot of this stuff.')
