I don&#x27;t know how true that was, a best part of a decade later I worked for them and would have easily been able to ask, but she&#x27;d moved on.<p>There was a method to this apparent madness though, because her catclock wasn&#x27;t running on her computer, it was running remotely over X. So if the catclock worked, this meant the network was up, and key services to the remote servers worked.<p>If one of your classmates has remotely unplugged your mouse that&#x27;s annoying for you (this is mid-1990s so telnet rather than SSH and by default X sessions are open to the world) but she has more important things to focus on - however if the entire network is down that&#x27;s worth her time.')
