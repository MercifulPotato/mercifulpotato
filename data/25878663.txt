On the same level as not understanding what the point of dropbox is when FTP exists.<p>The failure of FOSS to understand what users actually want is the reason proprietary platforms took off. Matrix is the first attempt to create something similar to what users use and want.<p>I thought about writing a list of all the things I use on discord which IRC doesn&#x27;t support but it would be a waste of time because its almost everything discord does. Even basic sending and receiving messages is close to impossible with irc on mobile unless you use a 3rd party service to translate the protocol in to something mobile friendly.')
