There are a few notable experiments that can be interpreted as demonstrating that plants&#x27; actions sometimes go beyond simple reflex and could be interpreted as &quot;remembering&quot; or &quot;planning&quot;. However, these interpretations are still in debate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plant_cognition" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Plant_cognition</a><p>Plant life makes up about 99% of the bio mass on this planet. If we can&#x27;t decide whether the dominant life form on this planet is intelligent, I think that shows that whatever intelligence may exist on other planets or galaxies will probably be so strange that we could be looking right at it and not see it.')
