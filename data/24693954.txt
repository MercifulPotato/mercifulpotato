Why do you think it was always limited to highway speeds and correcting a lack of input? Well that&#x27;s because it can&#x27;t tell an overhead sign from a stopped firetruck very well...)<p>Are we really then allowed to go back and go &quot;well they had a nice disclaimer&quot;.<p>-<p>It&#x27;s funny really, because calling it Autopilot wasn&#x27;t enough (spare me the airplane comparisons). Now there&#x27;s a feature list called &quot;Full Self Driving... capability&quot;<p>Like, the term FSD is used as part of a label for a collection of features, of which NOT A SINGLE ONE is even a COMPONENT of self driving, because EVERY SINGLE ONE requires full time driver attention.<p>They&#x27;re literally using the fact that theoretically, one day, the <i>SENSORS MIGHT OVERLAP WITH WHAT FSD REQUIRES</i> to sell it as... not FSD. FSD <i>capability</i>.<p>What a joke.<p>-<p>Tesla has gotten away with homicide, and I guess we&#x27;re ok with them continuing to.<p>The useless comparisons about &quot;Tesla with AP is safer than Tesla without&quot;, show me the comparison that Tesla with AP is safer than AEB+LKA+ACC (pretty much AP, minus the party trick that lulls drivers into a false sense of security), and I&#x27;ll show you a made up study.<p>Because that <i>would be AP being exactly what it already is</i>, minus the one mode where the <i>driver</i> is supposed to be a safety net for the computer. Where the <i>driver</i> already has responsibility to make sure it doesn&#x27;t crash! It&#x27;s literally like removing the ability to steer your bike with the training wheels, the training wheels are still there!<p>It&#x27;s simple really, Tesla has put marketability of a safety feature, over the actual safety benefits, at the cost of human lives.')
