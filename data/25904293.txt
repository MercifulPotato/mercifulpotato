When I submit a post I usually spend a little time voting on other submissions in the new queue. I&#x27;d guess that&#x27;s a pretty common mode of usage.<p>My own submissions and the ones I see when voting on new seem to land on the front page in rough proportion to their quality.<p>I see more political (in some sense) posts than I really want, and not enough super-duper technical stuff - but I don&#x27;t really get the impression that that arises from a lack of attention in voting stuff onto the front page.')
