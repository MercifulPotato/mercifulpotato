Some agencies&#x2F; people do have success in outsourcing the technology, because they might do QA and leadership, which these off shore teams would not get right.<p>- They have deep expertise in some technology which you can&#x27;t just hire someone for. I guess you can argue, everyone has a price and a company can just pay that rate, but if that employee is doing all the work, that employee would probably have a high rate and would be, themselves capturing the value, not the company. I think this point is almost just a repetition of the first example.')
