If there is one speech, but 3 candidates. And the AI predicted based on past performances, why is it unfair? (It is a bad decision for you, or the AI could be making a poor decision based on data&#x2F;algorithm limitations, but it is not unfair, the AI doesn&#x27;t favor anyone outside of the data it&#x27;s given). 2) AI doesn&#x27;t make the decision that you can&#x27;t give speeches. AI gives truthful predictions assuming the data is truthful. But it is your boss who uses the results to make that decision. The ethics part is on your boss using what data&#x2F;algo to make such a prediction to determine who should go. Why would you blame the AI instead of the boss?')
