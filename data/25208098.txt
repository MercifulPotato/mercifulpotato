Measuring download progress is easy, but presumably the &quot;something else&quot; was more difficult to measure the progress on. Most libraries don&#x27;t give progress feedback for most operations.<p>So the developer just thought &quot;screw it, we&#x27;ll allow 25% of the time for that processing&quot;. Based on the video they were wildly off but accurate progress bars are really low priority for a reason.')
