Chrome is arguably more polished because Google pours more money into its development, more readily available because Google can lobby&#x2F;buy&#x2F;enforce its inclusion as the default browser, and free because Google makes money from the information it collects through it.<p>You can&#x27;t compete with Chrome when your primary merit is simply not being Google. Forcing Google to spin-off Chrome should have been done earlier though, before Microsoft had a stake on the engine. Now additional steps need to be taken to ensure that spinning off Chrome will not actually kill competition; with an independent Chrome, we can count on Google cutting down on Mozilla&#x27;s funding since Google wouldn&#x27;t be any longer in danger of being ruled as a browser monopoly.')
