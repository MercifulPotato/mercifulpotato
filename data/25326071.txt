Betfair only takes a commission on money that changes hands. As fair as I understand, they are not openly laying or backing bets.<p>Backing is the simplest way of making a bet which ensures positive expected return. That is, if you can get the bet matched. I tried my hand at making some back bets by hand using the terminal programme I made illustrated in [2], and no bets were matched. This is because the only people making and matching bets with positive expected return are the ones laying, and they are laying at odds which ensure a negative expected return for the backer.<p>Now the problem is to figure out how to, given the exact odds for each outcome, successfully lay all outcomes. This involves ensuring the correct amount of money is matched for each outcome.')
