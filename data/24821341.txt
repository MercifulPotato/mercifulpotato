Since they head towards the centre, in a free falling frame the two objects actually get closer to each other until they collide as they reach the centre.<p>This is known as the tidal effect of gravity and is the actual physical content of general relativity. This effect can be shown to be obtained by an appropriate curvature of spacetime which itself can be shown to be related to the stress-energy of matter inhabiting spacetime.')
