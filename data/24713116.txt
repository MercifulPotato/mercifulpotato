Sure, there are many features of C that are easy to laugh at but in context make a lot of sense, but the macro system is <i>not</i> one of them. Hart&#x2F;Levin LISP had hygienic macros, just saying... And you don&#x27;t even need the full generality of a compiler to have limited but still useful AST-rewriting macros, there are a ton of ways this could be implemented very cheaply in terms of both memory and cpu, none of which are rocket science.<p>Seriously, the fact that textual macros are terrible isn&#x27;t even a controversial point. Maybe I&#x27;m too young to be a Real Programmer(tm), but this &#x27;everything is text&#x27; idea never made sense to me.')
