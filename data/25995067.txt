We&#x27;re figuring out our monitoring stack - but have also found Loki&#x2F;Grafana - and we&#x27;re looking at Victoria Metrics rather than Cortex. Our hope is that the combination will turn out to be able to scale down as well as up, and be possible to fit in with Docker swarm&#x2F;compose on-prem and at digital ocean. Also looks like vector might be a good option for collecting data.<p>Will keep an eye out, to see if optrace might be a fit for us.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
