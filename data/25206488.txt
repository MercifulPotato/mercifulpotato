Sure they use more power, so you&#x27;ll need to make do with somewhat larger batteries and somewhat smaller runtimes.  The performance&#x2F;core is pretty similar, even if the M1 has the edge.  I&#x27;d rather have a zen 5000 APU (due at CES in Jan), 32GB ram, and a 12 hour battery life and be able to run linux than a M1, 16GB ram, and 20 hour life and only be able to run OSX.<p>Similar the Intel NUC like AMD products are hitting, I expect them to be pretty attractive with the zen 3 APUs.<p>Sure I&#x27;d buy an M1, just not sure I want to switch to OSX, even the cut&#x2F;paste inconsistencies drive me batty.')
