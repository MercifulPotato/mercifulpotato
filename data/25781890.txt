I&#x27;ve given regularly to bail funds for years, and most report being able to recover and reuse bails for subsequent cases[1].<p>But even more saliently: nobody was &quot;paid to cause destruction.&quot; People we being <i>bailed out</i> following mass arrests in the <i>midst of a pandemic and unprecedented social unrest</i>. Whether or not a particular fund has failed to recoup its bails is immaterial to the fact that nobody gave to bail funds as a <i>mechanism</i> for direct wealth transfer. That just wouldn&#x27;t be very efficient.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bailproject.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bailproject.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a>')
