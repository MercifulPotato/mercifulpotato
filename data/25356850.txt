Our research group runs based on RHEL + CentOS. RHEL for all the important stuff, and CentOS for all the compute nodes. Now, if CentOS 8 dies, there is no way we are running say Debain on compute nodes and RHEL on other servers. RedHat sadly has to go away. It&#x27;s their own way of losing our business, and losing goodwill. Now, the people at university will treat RedHat the same as Oracle and IBM for being greedy and evil.<p>Too bad Scientific Linux was dropped in favour of CentOS. Perhaps scientific community will revive Scientific Linux or something like that. Cant wait for what comes out of this.')
