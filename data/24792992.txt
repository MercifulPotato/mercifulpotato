Talking about stuff is how people get educated. If you have an opinion or something to add, state it. Shutting down a topic because <i>you</i> judge the audience is too narrow to understand it makes... b) you come across as a snotty elitist who has an axe to grind.<p>I don&#x27;t see how understanding how ancient people looked is a political study. Yes, race is highly political, but it can be a political <i>and</i> historical topic. Individuals can be interested in what humans used to look like (and this is not limited to blackness) without being interested in the politics.<p>No one is up in arms. People are just interested. The Ancient Greeks are decidedly caucasian, there is not much discussion around that because most scholars agree.<p>We make models of what we think prehistoric humans and sapiens looked like and there is much interest in that without it being political. People just like knowing stuff about the past, about their ancestors. Just because some assholes politicize this sort of thing, just because some teachers push their politically charged racial bias on others does not mean that the whole topic is exclusively socio-political.<p>Citing genetic studies is completely valid. Real science is non-political so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a totally rational way to approach the question of what did the people of one of the most sophisticated ancient civilizations look like.')
