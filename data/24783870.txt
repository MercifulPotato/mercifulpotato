Or even better: a Heroku like app platform. I want to give you money, but I really dislike your companies&#x27; enterprise offerings.<p>BTW I believe there&#x27;s a great opportunity for Hashicorp right now. Cloud providers are good at selling building blocks, but are terrible at selling a vision of how you should build your applications. On the other hand, low code &#x2F; enterprise application platforms are a disgrace as always. IMO a coherent stack of managed Nomad + Consul + Vault could provide a solid middle ground for those who want to build apps without the burden of managing K8s or navigating through the incomprehensible maze of products offered by public clouds.')
