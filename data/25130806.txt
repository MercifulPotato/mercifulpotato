I tell my customers that my software doesn&#x27;t contain any tracking or telemetry, and that human-to-human feedback (direct email) from users is the only way I can know of problems. I also make it very clear that I am open to all kinds of feedback. This is great because I get bug reports directly, can understand how people are using the program in their workflow, and can contextualize feature requests and build solutions that fit for everyone.<p>Users like this because they are actually being listened to by the software&#x27;s author, there is no overhead to fixing problems, and they aren&#x27;t being shoehorned into a database.')
