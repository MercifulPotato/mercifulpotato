The game had already been pushed multiple times and there was half a $Billion in pre-orders alone waiting to be collected.<p>Estimates put the dev budget a little over $300 million [0]. After retailers &amp; Steam take their cut and given that a lot of sales were full-cut direct through GOG, that puts the game around break-even status before it even hits normal retail sales.<p>Given this picture, it is highly likely that investors forced through this decision to go forward as much or more than management did. Push the game again and you&#x27;ll really start losing pre-orders, and the next time a release date comes around people will be even more hesitant to drop $60 before release.<p>(As a side note, I&#x27;m playing the game on low-end gaming hardware and it works fine. Occasional graphical glitches, 1 crash. It&#x27;s hard to live up to the hype, but it&#x27;s still a great game. Feels like a mashup of GTA V with heavy RPG elements set in a future dystopia. Small hints of Assassin&#x27;s Creed stealth, maybe more if you build your character in that direction.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.altchar.com&#x2F;game-news&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-set-to-become-the-most-expensive-game-of-all-time-arjaa2a9dfqp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.altchar.com&#x2F;game-news&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-set-to-beco...</a>')
