Item(by='CyanLite2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603483740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871480, text='Florida is one of the few states that are reporting mail-in ballots the night of the election. They&#x27;ve already started counting them and tabulating the results. After polls close, they press a button and it spits out the final results. With early voting getting nearly 60% of all registered voters in FL, I suspect we&#x27;ll get 99% of precincts reporting FL numbers within 30-45 minutes after the polls close. Thus, I personally think we&#x27;re going to know fairly quickly who wins the presidency.<p>Some other states like PA aren&#x27;t even allowed to touch mail-in ballots til the morning of Nov 3rd. That&#x27;s millions of envelopes that have to be opened, signatures verified, and then the ballot itself has to be unfolded and flattened and then pushed through the tabulation machines. But we don&#x27;t have to fully wait til those are official--we can tell by the party registration on the ElectionsProject website who won based on in-person voting plus party mail-in.')
