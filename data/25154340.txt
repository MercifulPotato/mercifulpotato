I&#x27;m not aware of another service that offers a turnkey remote full filesystem (ie not just an object store) that you can access over SSH.<p>Your Hetzner numbers are impressive, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything available in the US for a similar cost. Most block storage I&#x27;ve seen is ~$10&#x2F;mo&#x2F;TB. I would love to be proven wrong on that.')
