And more salmon would depress those prices.  Economically speaking, the entire aboriginal catch is a drop in the bucket and not worth the benefit of a single dam.<p>For comparison, the US alone currently harvests 100&#x27;s of mil pounds of salmon a year.  Alaska alone produces 500mil pounds last year (and this was the lowest in decades).  Norway harvests around 3 BILLION pounds of salmon a year.')
