It&#x27;s not a big deal, one way or the other. Journalist and internet pundits simply like to play it up. Most of us don&#x27;t understand much of the workings of the CCP, partly due to deliberate intransparency partly due to the language barrier. So it&#x27;s fertile ground for all kinds of baseless speculation.<p>Even without language barrier, I think most of it is just the nature of politics and holding positions of power. It&#x27;s not like many of us have a very good understanding of the inner workings of the higher cadres in the (D) and (R) parties, or of the leadership teams &#x2F; boardrooms of large companies either.')
