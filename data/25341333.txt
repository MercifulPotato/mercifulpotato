And even more, the personalized attack on PG seem more like a giant projection of Tellman&#x27;s.<p>&quot;I recognized that he had a tendency towards self-aggrandizement...&quot;<p>&quot;In many ways, those early essays contained the clearest articulation of his framework; it just took me ten years to see it.&quot;<p>It took Tellmen ten years of deep thought to finally crack this nut: that PG is a <i>profoundly</i> unserious intellectual! Ten years, but finally he did it, he cracked it.<p>Hard to find more ridiculous self-aggrandizement than that.')
