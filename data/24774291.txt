There are libraries you write routinely in C++ that you can&#x27;t code in, or call from, Rust, and never will. The gap will widen with time. Rust is focused on low-level safety at the expense of library power, but you get safety in C++ by coding using more powerful and safe libraries, so C++ comes out ahead in the end.<p>Rust is a way better language than Go or Java. It would be excellent if Rust could displace them, or even just one of them.<p>If its adoption rate were to increase by maybe two or three orders of magnitude, it could survive. But the Rust core team seem not interested in doing what would be needed to get that much adoption, and hype alone won&#x27;t get it there.<p>Rust&#x27;s place will be secure when more complaints are written about it than paeans.')
