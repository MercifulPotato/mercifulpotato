However, I was unable to observe a meaningful difference between load balancing algorithms when measuring request latency from servers under load.<p>I think there is still a lot to be gained from exploring two-choices, but coming up with an appropriate strategy for &quot;real-world&quot; performance benchmarking is quite challenging.')
