It looks well put together, and most importantly, it works!<p>I created a board with a couple links and then I noticed at the bottom of my homepage it says &quot;Saved links&quot; but that&#x27;s empty. Is saving a link different from what I did by creating the links and putting them on the board?<p>Also, have you thought about something like &quot;browse boards&quot; page?  People could optionally select a board they want to share publicly and others could view all public boards and maybe vote or rate them.<p>Edit: A couple more thoughts -<p>I have two kinds of link collecting. Social and personal.<p>Social:<p>1. Wife: hand her my phone. \n2. Family: text messages\n3. Friends: Discord server<p>I can&#x27;t see myself changing from these solutions given...<p>1. Current solutions already work well. \n2. I&#x27;d have to convince the other people to use this too, which seems hard, especially given 1. \n3. More friction. Instead of &quot;Go to url&quot; it becomes &quot;Go here to see the url to go to.&quot;<p>Personal:<p>I make YouTube videos sometimes and collect links for sources while I&#x27;m making them. Right now I put all the urls into a text file and at publish time I copy and paste the sources into the video description.<p>I could kind of see something like this fitting into the workflow IF I worked with someone else. Since I don&#x27;t, the text file approach is easier and faster. If I did need to share collections of links, like with a collaborator or editor though...')
