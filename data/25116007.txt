There may have been a handful of outliers in the world who got reinfected, but there&#x27;s data showing that immunity seems to last for over six months in 100 out of 100 people tested[1]. There have also been multiple studies showing that some people exposed to the original SARS virus in ~2003 have cross-immunity to COVID. There&#x27;s also evidence of pre-existing immunity from other coronaviruses[2].<p>When the vaccine becomes available to you, get vaccinated. In the meantime, wear a mask and keep being careful, but we have legitimate reasons to be hopeful. We have two vaccines showing efficacy, more to come in the following months. There&#x27;s also a synthetic antibody therapy that just got FDA emergency approval[3]. This is going to save a lot of lives. All of the serious data points to the fact that this is going to make a huge dent in the number of new cases and fatalities.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.01.362319v1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biorxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.01.362319v1</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;science.abe1107" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.sciencemag.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;05&#x2F;scie...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;news-events&#x2F;press-announcements&#x2F;coronavi...</a>')
