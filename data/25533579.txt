AFAIK EU qualified medical personnel are hugely outweighed by non-EU ones.<p>The process seems fairly simple. My girlfriend is a nurse from a non-EU country, and she did have to take an English exam before moving, and then a competency exam after a month of working here. \nHowever, she described it essentially as a formality, that if you are a competent nurse who can speak English, it should not be an issue. It took a few hours.<p>It might be more of an issue for HCAs, porters, etc who seem to be much more frequently Eastern European. However given my mother became seriously unwell as a result of a miscommunication between an EU hospital worker who didn&#x27;t speak adequate English and one of the doctors... well I can&#x27;t help but feel a little bit of scrutiny on incoming healthcare workers isn&#x27;t the worst thing ever.<p>The sanctions data is definitely a concern though.')
