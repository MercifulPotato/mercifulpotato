They often don&#x27;t change any visual appearance and certainly don&#x27;t distinguish between different models in their marketing. It&#x27;s easy for me to look up what common issues Lenovo&#x27;s had with a specific T series model, but if I&#x27;m buying a used MacBook, it&#x27;s hard to know what I should be searching for until the seller has told me the exact model number. And even still, there&#x27;s variance between machines of the same model because sometimes different panels and SSDs are used for the same model number.')
