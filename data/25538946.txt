Item(by='fishywang', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1608929542, title='Show HN: Create ePub Out of URL', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='With the purchase of reMarkable 2, I have this need to easily send web articles to my reMarkable 2 from my phone, while officially they only provided a Chrome extension, which can only be used on desktops.<p>As a result I wrote some go code ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fishy&#x2F;url2epub ) for the past 2 days, to generate ePub from URL. I also implemented reMarkable API to send them to reMarkable tablets directly.<p>The current UI for it is implemented as a Telegram bot ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;url2rM_bot?start=1 ), running on AppEngine (code: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fishy&#x2F;url2epub&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;appengine ). I initially considered making an Android app for the UI, but decided that Telegram bot is less work for me, and works good enough for this use case (sorry for people who don&#x27;t use Telegram, but this also means that people on iOS, desktop, etc. will be able to use it).<p>For the future, I <i>might</i> do:<p>- Expand the URLs supported (currently it <i>only</i> supports URLs with an AMP version provided, and the AMP version does have article tag inside)\n- (if there&#x27;s enough demand for this) Remove the reMarkable restriction, so if you don&#x27;t have a reMarkable account linked, it sends the ePub file back to you instead.\n- Provide REST API on AppEngine\n- Create an Android app')
