If you only print a couple of times a month, it gets swamped by uncertainty: will the ink dry up before I use it? will they still sell those cartridges in 5 years time? will it have broken anyway? Under these conditions, it&#x27;s not that illogical to spend less on the printer.<p>It&#x27;s also not always easy to compare. Maybe I can see that a HP cartridge holds more ink than the Epson one - but do they use ink at the same rate? How much do they use for cleaning the nozzles when you&#x27;re not printing? Will I be able to get unofficial cartridges, and will they affect print quality?<p>It&#x27;s getting easier to compare, because they&#x27;re getting on the subscription bandwagon, based on pages per month. But the smallest plan I see is HP&#x27;s 15 pages&#x2F;month, which is probably at least 3x what I actually print.')
