Personally I think they are wanting FB to be a mobile-first service kind of like Instagram is. Insta was to the point where you used to not even be able to log in on a computer.<p>My problem is that the main feed has been completely useless to me for years. Here&#x27;s what I would really like to see:<p>- Direct posts from an inner circle at the top<p>- Direct posts from acquaintances &#x2F; posts in groups that I am a member of<p>- Reshares either gone or deprioritized from any direct post<p>- Ability to mute all reshares from a person instead of the current functionality of muting the individual source page.<p>Currently if I use my bookmark to my mother&#x27;s page I can see that that is day 9 of 10 in some &#x27;post your art&#x27; challenge. It&#x27;s all stuff I haven&#x27;t seen before because it&#x27;s been a hot minute since I visited her, and I&#x27;m interested in these posts. She doesn&#x27;t usually want her art online AT ALL and it&#x27;s nice to see she is branching out in this way.<p>If I go to the main feed, it isn&#x27;t there at all. I only know about it because I visited her page directly. When I call her, she will ask if I saw something my sister posted. I did not, because facebook doesn&#x27;t think my sister is important to me either.<p>Then there&#x27;s reshares. For the few people who facebook does think are important to me, it&#x27;s 90% reshared memes and 10% the actual content I want to see. If I try to hide that content, my only options are to unfollow that person entirely, or to hide whatever meme page they shared from this time. Only problem is that every single post is from a different page, so that is not a workable solution.')
