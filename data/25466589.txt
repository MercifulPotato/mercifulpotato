Now what?<p>Most tried to stay in the field and go the coach&#x2F;management route. One actually managed to get to a second world cup as head coach and place second. Several languished as coaches of lower league teams, clearly unhappy (or at least the article portrayed them so). Some became TV commentators.\nOnly one left the sport behind completely, invested his money and lived in the USA.')
