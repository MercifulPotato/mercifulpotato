Item(by='twelfthnight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610406943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738457, text='In the book &quot;Moral Tribes&quot;, Joshua Greene outlines a great point that rights are not arguments.  I think the Facebook&#x2F;Twitter censorship issue demonstrates this pretty clearly. Rights always have some context and without specifying that context, they can be used to justify almost anything.  For example, depending on whether I&#x27;m under oath or not reasonably determines whether I can be persecuted for lying or not.<p>Personally I think it makes sense for Twitter and Facebook to use their power to prevent Trump&#x27;s false claims about election fraud, especially given the harm it appears to be fostering [1].  That said, I believe there are many good faith arguments about why censorship in this instance could be harmful to the aims of a free society.  However, I don&#x27;t believe &quot;right of free speech&quot; or &quot;censorship is always bad&quot; are good arguments, instead I would like to see arguments about the purported benefits&#x2F;harms to society of this censorship.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not the arbiter of truth here, there are many court cases affirming no voter fraud and the recent Capitol Building invasion is demonstration of the potential harm.')
