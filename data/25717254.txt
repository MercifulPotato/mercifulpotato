I put through the Paddle payments as my income on tax returns and I&#x27;m done for admin.<p>Chargebee does seem to have a lot more customer&#x2F;subscription management features though so I would check Paddle has everything you need there.<p>Fastspring and Gumroad are worth looking at too as they handle VAT as well.')
