Item(by='bluGill', descendants=None, kids=[24769436], score=None, time=1602607165, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767103, text='10 year old code would be considered very new where I work. I know for a fact code I wrote 10 years ago is still the heart of our system (with very few changes). I know of code that someone else wrote 30 years ago that is still in use, getting that code tested is very important so we can confidently make changes for the next product that will use it.<p>A few years back we started an effort to rewrite some old C code into a modern system with formal proofs of correctness.  That was given up because the new improved process turned out to be 3x more expensive to write new code vs new code in the old process. (formal proofs were the reason to use the new process, but not the reason it was 3x more expensive.  I&#x27;m not allowed to comment beyond this so don&#x27;t ask...)')
