It lets you quickly access the commands in your shell history. Just search for the command you want to execute (regex mode is supported), or, if you don&#x27;t exactly know what you&#x27;re looking for, you can browse through the commands until you find the one you want to execute. Apart from this, you can delete unwanted items from your history, too, and more. It works on all terminals ranging from linux term to alacritty to xterm. It was initially made for the standard Python shell but it should work with IPython and bpython, too.<p>It has been my daily driver for a while now.<p>Check out the README for instructions if you want to try it out.<p>Suggestions, bug reports, etc. are welcome.<p>Let me know what you think:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adder46&#x2F;pyhstr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;adder46&#x2F;pyhstr</a>')
