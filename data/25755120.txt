Many product managers answer to marketing first, and don&#x27;t have earnest tech backgrounds that would let them know right from wrong past sales numbers. The culture changed significantly when they went public the first time; it went from a place where devs built good tools... to a place looking to buy products &#x2F; competitor products so they could charge more for their services. Look at how long it took them to get into cloud tools -- great example of how marketing and sales missed the boat because they were only focused on things they had sold before and not focused on systemic changes to the industry -- because technologists weren&#x27;t driving.<p>Anyway, like I&#x27;ve worked a lot places with better security built into the culture, better tech best practices built into the culture... that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m trying to say. Knowing that attacks like this are out there... and it was just a matter of time before it happened, SolarWinds did next to nothing to avoid it happening to them.')
