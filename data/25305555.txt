It was on a BMUG CD from 1994 that I would get a lot of freeware&#x2F;shareware. Used it download SPRY Mosaic, which Microsoft licensed to create IE on Win95 soon after (I had already seen Mosaic running on CDE on HP&#x2F;UX at my mom&#x27;s scanning electron lab. she was getting a physics ph.d). Then I got a Mac clone from Metroworks. It had a pretty innovative C++ engine for its&#x27; time (PowerPlant), but I ended up booting into mkLinux (a mach-based linux) just in time for linux 2.0.0, discovering kde, then spending a while trying to emulate hacking at khtml&#x2F;konqueror just to reverse engineer IE behavior &quot;quirks&quot; (5+ was a disaster) just to get websites to behave. Eventually both Apple and Chromium adopted khtml (webkit) instead of Gecko, before Firefox itself revived via Netscape and Mozilla (after it escaped the AOL&#x2F;Time Warner fiasco). The funny thing is I use Firefox, chrome (on my android), and safari (on my Mac) much more than I use linux anymore. I&#x27;m pretty luckily to not have been just slightly too young (I&#x27;m mid 30s) to go after the original .com boom.<p>I enjoy Rust the days. Modern C++ certainly ain&#x27;t bad, but nostdlib Rust is also the first serious threat to full spectrum C in a long time.')
