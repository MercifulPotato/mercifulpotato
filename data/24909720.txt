I was always told that the average level of nutrition often increased once the Romans were no longer in charge - since less tax was being levied.<p>I think the idea that the Roman Empire was bad for its citizens varies in persuasiveness depending on the era. The Roman Empire was very unstable and extremely prone to brutal civil wars, and when it wasn&#x27;t in a state of active conflict, the maxim of Severus &quot;Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others&quot; was pretty much the norm.
