Item(by='dmitriid', descendants=None, kids=[25728188], score=None, time=1610368306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727754, text='&gt; To clarify the sibling, a signature of `Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool` can&#x27;t do any IO (so no connecting to databases, reading&#x2F;writing files, network requests), so it does tell you a lot about a function.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help if it&#x27;s `Int -&gt; Int -&gt; IO Bool`, for example. Well, it does do IO, but other than that, who knows. Perhaps it reformats the disc while CPU is idle :)<p>My main point though is that the article does a very poor job of showing why Haskell is good at, well, anything, compared to, well, anything.')
