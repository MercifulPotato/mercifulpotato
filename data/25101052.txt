Linkedin is also really pushy with this, but being honest once I got a job (they contacted me through linkedin) that boosted my salary 30% with linkedin, really helped me with my personal economy. Also you cannot <i>not</i> be on linkedin in my region because then you are not normal :( ..<p>That being said, I have disabled all notifications on linkedin, but still they manage too be annoying when I&#x27;m added by someone who is selling me something (I don&#x27;t mind the endless recruiters)..')
