Nobody has done this as far as I&#x27;ve seen.  I mean you can find Github repositories for some papers but really a set of explicit tutorials from the math to the code would be really helpful.<p>To say something is &quot;machine learning&quot;, I think means that you should show the code not just equations and derivations.<p>I mean if you only show math and derivations, what&#x27;s the point?  To show off what you know?  How is that helpful?')
