This thread is so full of shills and I don&#x27;t mind eating the downvotes to call them out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;euobserver.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;144538" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;euobserver.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;144538</a><p>Every smartphone manufacturer agreed to use a common charger <i>except</i> Apple, who mumbled something about &quot;advanced functionality&quot;. They continue to exploit legal loopholes to allow themselves to be the only ones who have their own charger and, thus, the only ones who can massively profit off of their adapters (sure, others can make them, but they still have to pay the license fee). This isn&#x27;t the first time they&#x27;ve tried to lock down their proprietary adapter - remember FireWire?<p>We&#x27;re only <i>here</i> because Apple made sure to obsolete everyone&#x27;s cables from before they implemented Lightning. It&#x27;s fine if you genuinely prefer the Lightning cable but don&#x27;t pretend that this is pro-consumer when it&#x27;s really Apple screwing consumers to make a quick buck.')
