No thanks, I left Google Photos years ago when I could understand they provided something &quot;for free&quot; in exchange for your data, but even pay them for this? What a joke.<p>I am sure there will pop up companies happy to harvest your data for free.<p>Personally I just do multiple physical backups, it ain&#x27;t so convenient, but I have control over my data.<p>Btw. there is Yandex Disk for people who don&#x27;t wanna pay for OneDrive or Amazon Photos. For cold storage is maybe cheapest Backblaze.')
