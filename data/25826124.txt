Traditional fasting is something you do few times a year, and then you have a recovery period afterwards. Can&#x27;t find that research now, but I remember reading a paper saying that it takes about 2 weeks of normal food intake to get back to the initial white blood cells counts. What happens if you don&#x27;t let the body recover and instead create a new calorie deficit stress seems unclear?')
