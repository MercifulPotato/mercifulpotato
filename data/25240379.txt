A couple years ago I came across the BASIC source code for Oregon Trail, and I thought, &quot;Hmm, might be fun to convert it to C.&quot;  Started poking at it, and... Blargh!  It was pretty disgusting.  I don&#x27;t think the program, disgusting as it was, was really unusual or bad for the time, though, and I am certain I wrote similar code on my trusty TI99&#x2F;4A and thought it was just fine at the time.  But then I was just a little kid, and maybe it&#x27;s just right for a kid, I don&#x27;t know.')
