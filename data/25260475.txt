It has been reported that the term “triàge” was used for the sorting of coffee beans in Britain in around 1830.6 It would appear, however, that the medical use of the term “triàge” in the battlefield derives not from the classification of coffee beans but from the earlier sorting in the wool industry.<p>The etymology of “triàge” is French. Studies have shown that trier, which is the verb form of triàge, dates back to the 12th‐century Gallo‐Romance term triàre. That word can be divided into trià and eur, which mean, respectively, “three” and “crushing.” The French word triàge means “to thin out” in Japanese and “to categorize” in English. “Thinning out” signifies the removal of damaged items toward improving the overall quality. The original meaning of “triàge” is closer to the notion of thinning out than to categorization. However, the concept of sorting could also apply to such French terms as presélection, sélection, and choix.<p>“Triàge” may have come to be applied in the area of disaster medicine because it combines the meaning of both dividing into three and thinning out. With respect to military medical care, Larrey categorized triàge into three phases7. In a comparable fashion, French military doctors in World War I and Japanese military physicians in World War II divided sick or wounded soldiers into three categories according to the severity of their illnesses or wounds. Similarly, the Sort, Assess, Life‐Saving Interventions, Treatment and&#x2F;or Transport (SALT) triàge, which is a modern American triàge method for dealing with disasters and mass casualties, involves an initial classification of cases into three categories.8')
