Call it entropy in physics.<p>If you don&#x27;t try and improve, pay attention to the market, adapt, move, change, or at least maintain or build a moat, competition will inevitably want to have what you&#x27;ve got. It&#x27;s why capitalism works. If you get old, and don&#x27;t satisfy your customers, someone else will.<p>Now, if you plan on keeping your job for 1-2 years, then you don&#x27;t really care. Fine, that&#x27;s your point of view. But management and shareholders certainly would like the business to be around for as long as possible. And for that you always need to develop and change.<p>And this is not about some crazy capitalist mentality that destroys the planet. Nature is the same. Inevitably the tribe leading lion will get challenged and taken down. It&#x27;s just what happens. Unless you at least try and work against it.')
