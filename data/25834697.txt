This is not the way for me.\nI cannot trust them anymore. If I have payed for my computer and the vendor is using it without my permission - there is no fix for this. What&#x27;s next? Jailbreaking Mac OS?  I don&#x27;t care for Apple apologists or cultists, they have a right to choose. My choice is to move away from Apple products and replace everything that I can with Linux and FOSS.')
