First, I try to realize the features I need and then I try to optimize where possible. First, I will use many libraries and after I got everything working, I will see if I really need all those libraries and may replace a whole library with a custom more simple implementation that still fits the needs.<p>A case for “stupid light” software is probably trying to use a static website when an optimized dynamic site is much more appropriate. You start to over-engineer a complex build workflow, when all that’s really needed to speed up a site is better caching.<p>I have some experiences especially related to the database point. When I developed Android apps, I tried to use flat text files too. But recently I discovered how awesome SQLite is. In some cases flat files are great, but especially when you need to parse those files or retrieve specific information from them, SQLite might be better than flat files. But in many cases SQLite could replace complex PostgreSQL or MariaDB databases, especially when concurrent writing isn’t needed.')
