It makes them more disheartening, however.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in the replication crisis but I have to say that as a conceptual framework, it has the problem of pointing a finger at all research - saying &quot;Most Published Research&quot; etc, when the replication crisis is quite concentrated in <i>experimental psychology</i>, complex biomedical causation research and fields with pretty specific difficulties (humans taking simple psychology tests seem to be easily influenced by outside factors, the biochemistry of mammals seems to incredible variations in it&#x27;s operations). The germ theory of disease doesn&#x27;t by itself fall into this paradigm (even if humans are complex, the transmission mechanism of a germ is simple). And there&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s as if Ioannidis decided, &quot;nothing is true, I&#x27;ll claim what I want&quot;.')
