Grabbing two:<p>- the Arab nations don&#x27;t consider themselves kin (or &quot;coethnics&quot; whatever that means) with the Palestinians. When Jordan and Egypt controlled the Palestinian territory, they treated the Palestinians worse then Israeli does today.<p>- the groups that commit the vast majority of rape (per capita or otherwise) in the middle east are not Israeli. In most of the Muslim countries, it&#x27;s legal to rape your wife. In some of them (such as Iran), men execute their daughters for being raped by their neighbors. One well known group (ISIS) was really into rape - and so Iran gave them money so they could rape more.<p>If what you care about is rape, murder, and genocide, you&#x27;re against Iran 100x as much as you&#x27;re against Israel.')
