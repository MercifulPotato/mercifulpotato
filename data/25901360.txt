I&#x27;m Giorgio, the co-author of the PGM-index paper together with Paolo Ferragina.<p>First of all, I&#x27;d like to thank @hbrundage for sharing our work here and also all those interested in it. I&#x27;ll do my best to answer any doubt in this thread.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to mention two other related papers:<p>- &quot;Why are learned indexes so effective?&quot; presented at ICML 20, and co-authored with Paolo Ferragina and Fabrizio Lillo.<p>PDF, slides and video: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.di.unipi.it&#x2F;vinciguerra&#x2F;publication&#x2F;learned-indexes-effectiveness&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.di.unipi.it&#x2F;vinciguerra&#x2F;publication&#x2F;learned-ind...</a><p>TL;DR: In the VLDB 20 paper, we proved a (rather pessimistic) statement that &quot;the PGM-index has the same worst-case query and space bounds of B-trees&quot;. Here, we show that actually, under some general assumptions on the input data, the PGM-index improves the space bounds of B-trees from O(n&#x2F;B) to O(n&#x2F;B^2) with high probability, where B is the disk page size.<p>- &quot;A &#x27;learned&#x27; approach to quicken and compress rank&#x2F;select dictionaries&quot; presented at ALENEX 21, and co-authored with Antonio Boffa and Paolo Ferragina.<p>PDF and code: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.di.unipi.it&#x2F;vinciguerra&#x2F;publication&#x2F;learned-rank-select&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;pages.di.unipi.it&#x2F;vinciguerra&#x2F;publication&#x2F;learned-ran...</a><p>TL;DR: You can use piecewise linear approximations to compress not only the index but the data too! We present a compressed bitvector&#x2F;container supporting efficient rank and select queries, which is competitive with several well-established implementations of succinct data structures.')
