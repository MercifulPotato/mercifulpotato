Item(by='temac', descendants=None, kids=[25260359], score=None, time=1606775764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259563, text='&gt; An insane amount of good engineering went into this CPU.<p>I agree but lets not overblow the difficulties either.<p>&gt; For example, the delay in the decode stage itself scales quadratically with the width of the decoder.<p>That could be irrelevant for small enough numbers, and ARM is easier to decode than x86. So this can be very well be dominated by other things. What you cite seems to be only about decoding logical register decoding going into the renaming structures, and then for just that tiny part it even tells that &quot;We found that, at least for the design space and technologies we explored, the quadratic component is very small relative to the other components. Hence, the delay of the decoder is linearly dependent on the issue width.&quot;<p>&gt; The delay of a full bypass network is quadratic in execution width.<p>Maybe if that&#x27;s a problem don&#x27;t do a full bypass network.<p>&gt; dropping rapidly as both a function of increasing width and increasing clock rate<p>Good thing that the clock rate is not too high then :p<p>More seriously the M1 can keep the beast fed probably because everything is dimensioned correctly, (and yes <i>also</i> because the clocks are not too high, but if you manage to make a wide and slow CPU that actually works well, I don&#x27;t see why you would want to scale the freq too much high, given you would quickly consume like crazy, and there is only only limited headroom above 3.2GHz anyway). It obviously helps to have a gigantic OOO. So I don&#x27;t really see where there is so much surprise. Esp. since we saw the progression in the A series.<p>To finish probably TSMC 5nm does not hurt. The competitors are on bigger nodes and have smaller structures. Coincidence? Or just like it has worked during decades already.')
