Item(by='quaintdev', descendants=2, kids=[25179659, 25175559], score=13, time=1606025460, title='Tell HN: Blind People Are Calling for Help with CAPTCHAs', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='There&#x27;s an app called &quot;Be My Eyes&quot;. It allows blind people to make video calls to the volunteers across the world for help with their day to day activities. I have been using it for quite some time now but what surprised me the most is that 98% of calls that I have received are for help with CAPTCHAs. I am pretty sure other volunteers are having same experience. If you think about it the blind are not calling for help with other day to day activities but something so trivial i.e. CAPTCHA which also has an easy fix: audio CAPTCHA!<p>I should also mention that most of these websites were Indian. So I will try and spread awareness among Indian developers that I know but if you are developer and working on some application that uses CAPTCHAs please include audio CAPTCHA as well. It helps the blind immensely.')
