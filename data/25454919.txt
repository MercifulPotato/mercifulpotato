That means that in a large part, the views of the PL research community does not matter as much anymore. What matters more is a type of darwinism of languages, where popularity within a niche of practitioners can be the springboard into broad popularity. It doesn&#x27;t really matter than it gets lexical scoping wrong, or combines incompatible abstractions, or the hacky implementation is leaking into the language semantics. What matters more is that there are useful frameworks, editors and learning material online.')
