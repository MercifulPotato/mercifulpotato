But often and sadly I think it&#x27;s a case of both sides not understanding each other. Often one group has a moral code that excludes the others choices. Taken to an extreme this can be a problem. And if that person is a close relative it can be a problem but at some point you just have to be okay that some strangers in the internet think your political leanings, lifestyle choices, religious beliefs, natural tendencies, etc are wrong. There are probably things they believe that you think are wrong. But if we stop trying to be right all the time we can just find a way to live peacefully and cooperatively.')
