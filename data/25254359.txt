Law school dean. Books on law, chess, and classicism.<p>His writings on chess tactics are immediately actionable for novices.<p>His books on classicism (and one on stoicism) employ a really unique technique: he puts forth an abstract point, then stands on the shoulders of many giants to support and thoroughly make it very tangible. All dressed up and presented with his personal commentary to make his lessons his own.')
