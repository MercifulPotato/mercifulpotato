My resume is solid and I can at least get my foot in the door at well known companies including FAANG. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m going to get the job, but I feel like I can at least get a response.<p>I was job hunting earlier this year due to my last company (a fintech start up) shutting down and Stripe was the only company that just handed me an immediate &quot;No&quot; without even a recruiter call. I know one other engineer who is more mid level and she said she had applied and never even got a response.<p>I harbor no ill will toward them, but I&#x27;m really curious what their hiring criteria is and why it seems so different that most of the other major companies out there.')
