It&#x27;s the software support that feels half-baked. Enabling memory integrity blue-screens my computer. I need to update the chipset drivers every month because AMD is still dialing in their scheduler and frequency scaling over a year after release, and the idle power usage is inexcusable.<p>AMD&#x27;s performance is fantastic, which is why I was fine getting it for a home gaming desktop, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be willing to pull the trigger on AMD on an enterprise server buildout. Intel still simply (actually or otherwise) <i>feels</i> more reliable.')
