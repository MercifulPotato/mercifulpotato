I have discussed things I very much don&#x27;t want to happen before here and the &quot;I don&#x27;t even want to see your side, I just don&#x27;t want this thing to happen&quot; has never seemed to me like a good tactic - it just doesn&#x27;t get anyone anywhere. I&#x27;ve been convinced many times to change my mind on HN(and I hope I have changed some minds too) but that&#x27;s just not possible if the other side isn&#x27;t engaging in the debate. And if not for the debate, what are we even here for?')
