(I have no idea how regularly this process is enforced, but I think it&#x27;s standard in the industry).  And then -- reading between the lines -- reacted poorly to the lack of approval.  Whence Dean and Megan made the decision to force a retraction.<p>Then Timnit demanded the names and feedback of the reviewers.  Again, as an outsider, I have no idea if the provision of this is customary.  But not just the reviewers; also everyone that Dean and Megan had spoken with.<p>I do wonder how much of this was the irregular process around the paper, her reaction to criticism of the paper, or her public criticism of DEI efforts, particularly as a manager.  Or all of the above.<p>Calling out your leadership chain, both for DEI metrics and for behavior about the paper -- while also disclosing that you seriously considering suing Google -- seems unwise if you don&#x27;t wish to be terminated.')
