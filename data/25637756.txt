The presumption of knowledge and control.<p>All of these elite presumptions are illusory and fundamentally hubristic.<p>You know why &quot;limiting the consumption&quot; of alcohol is a dumb suggestion? We have tons of evidence that it was a massive failure: Prohibition and the War on Drugs.<p>No matter how well-intended you are - it&#x27;ll backfire and people will ignore it.<p>Humans are fundamentally social creatures. Millions of years of evolution have seared into their biology the instinct to be social.<p>The idea that we can force humans into acting against their fundamental instincts to socialize is folly. Not only folly - but abuse.<p>But seriously, it&#x27;s bizarre. The obdurance of so-called experts set on working against the grain of every human instinct, as though that&#x27;s likely to maximize the success of their plans.')
