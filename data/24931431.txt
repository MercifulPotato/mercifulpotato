I&#x27;m a junior pentester, junior to medior developer (depending on whom you ask) and know a lot more about data science than I&#x27;m supposed to for &quot;my profile&quot;.<p>Now I&#x27;m in a job where I&#x27;m simply judged as a developer. I&#x27;ve noticed that even when I find vulnerabilities and show them to the dev team at the startup I work, they don&#x27;t care. When it&#x27;s a critical, they care a little. They actively dislike that I try to do more than just programming, since it isn&#x27;t of my concern. And yet, this is the most graceful company that I&#x27;ve been at since they hired me, out of the 100 I applied to.<p>So yea, I&#x27;m floundering. I want to help out with marketing and recruiting. I want to help out with some data science. And I definitely want to hack the company I work at in order to harden your product against hackers. I know my main role is being a dev, but I hate being only seen as a dev.<p>If any company hires people based in Amsterdam and would like such a generalist dev, I&#x27;m for hire. I also speak English ;-)')
