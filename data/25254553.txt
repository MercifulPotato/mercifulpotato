Why would people put sugar on their fries?!<p>So I&#x27;m glad you like the Belgian fries. What I&#x27;ve always learned to be key is that we fry our cut potatoes twice: once at 140°C, wait for them to cool down, and once at 175-180°C. Then you add salt, that&#x27;s it.<p>And the mayo: I don&#x27;t think many people like it like that when they eat fries at home, but it&#x27;s easy ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
