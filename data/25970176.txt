My workflow would be typically:<p>- edit files to the NFS share;<p>- issue commands to the unix box via ssh (an IDE can abstract this away); and<p>- have some port forwarding for accessing e.g. the webapp I&#x27;m working on from macOS chrome.<p>In the end it would be a pretty vanilla approach and not tremendously different from using a virtual machine via Vagrant. The difference would be that the macOS machine would be thinner, and that the unix box would have greater focus on security and stability.<p>And of course performance - with a real box I don&#x27;t have to worry about Vagrant&#x2F;Docker&#x2F;... making my macbook overheat.')
