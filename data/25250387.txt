Her very first .net page was the MySpace homepage (which was demoed by Steve Ballmer at CES, iirc). Microsoft was very unhappy with the decision to retain the .cf extension on web pages even after the transition to .net. There were some crazy levels of scaling happening behind the scenes—they had database requirements beyond the capabilities of sql server and there was code on the server side to route to different sql clusters based on the user&#x27;s numeric id. They also had more page views than they could sell ads for. There was actually a pretty crazed level of new feature development happening at the same time—any time that friendster or some other site would release a new feature, Tom would insist that it be implemented on MySpace right away. At the same time, he was also requiring things like pixel-for-pixel identical output for existing pages&#x2F;features through all of this.')
