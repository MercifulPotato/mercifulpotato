The last decade has been devastating to the credibility of conventional news sources. With the advent of the internet, they are literally just ordinary people voicing badly thought out opinions and generating gossip.<p>The number of stories that turn out to be low-key hoaxes where the story was fabricated are probably the same now as they ever were, but an order of magnitude more are being caught. I&#x27;m often speechless by how badly <i>all</i> politicians are misrepresented when I compare reporting to actual transcripts of what was said.<p>I don&#x27;t especially trust social media news. But people who are paid to generate news aren&#x27;t about to admit nothing is going on today. And too many important media stories were just wrong.')
