Item(by='scarmig', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610756706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25798092, text='&gt; Not to downplay what you&#x27;re saying (I personally know it can be tough wondering whether you&#x27;re going to find somebody to spend the rest of your life with), but do you think raising kids is easy?<p>A year wasted versus a year spent raising a kid. For the latter, you&#x27;d be raising them anyhow regardless of quarantine. That&#x27;s not to say juggling WFH and being around your kids 24&#x2F;7 isn&#x27;t difficult--I&#x27;m sure it is--but at the end of it, your year was spent on something meaningful. It&#x27;s analogous to spending a year at a shitty intensive 80 hr&#x2F;week job vs being a NEET living in your parents basement. Neither enviable, but at the end of the day most people would prefer to be the former.<p>&gt; the world is going to be split between people who spent lockdown with one or more 2- to 4-year-olds, and those who have their sanity.<p>As opposed to people who spend months on end, devoid of any meaningful social contact at all? Neither situation is ideal, obviously, but at least with one you&#x27;re accomplishing something.')
