They&#x27;re hiding illegal money from the Chinese government (once it leaves China it&#x27;s illegal to hold as I understand it) and legitimising it in Canada. From Canada&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s probably not laundering depending on how it was originally earned.<p>&gt; next to the sea and the mountains<p>Next to the US is probably another big reason but I&#x27;m not sure how much that matters with planes.')
