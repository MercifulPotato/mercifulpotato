It&#x27;s nominally &#x27;closed&#x27;, but still open for trade. In normal times you don&#x27;t need a full passport, either- just a passport card is fine, and realistically a CA driver&#x27;s license will get you through without trouble. It kind of has to be that way- Tijuana and San Diego are far too closely tied together for much else.')
