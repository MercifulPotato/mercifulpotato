I earn less than FAANG but certainly make good money.<p>Because of my experience in my industry, I&#x27;ve gotten an opportunity to become a technical adviser at a regulatory agency in my field. This adviser roll is brand new (I&#x27;d be one of the first hires for this new team), will pay me very well, and represents an opportunity to become an industry expert a la broad domain expertise working with the biggest players in the industry.<p>I&#x27;m a tech guy so its hard to leave technology delivery, but over time, I do want to become more of a product guy or even work my way into sales, so this type of experience seems perfect. To become an industry expert seems like it would really give me an edge when combined with my technical skills.<p>What does HN think? Will this industry expertise be worth it? Or are technical skills more worth it in the long run?')
