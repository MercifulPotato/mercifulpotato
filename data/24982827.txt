They request an additional 48 hours, not to fix the issue, but to notify customers and determine a &quot;hard date&quot; at some point in the future.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t really with GitHub not making the fix available, but the issue is that if they turn it off now they will break legions of builds. I think the Project Zero disclosure issue for them then is more for pointy haired manager appearances (&quot;Oh no! Github has a disclosed Project Zero vuln!&quot;) than for any real difference in security.')
