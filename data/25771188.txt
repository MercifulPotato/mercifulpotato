It also looks like just another version of S-expressions (but with indentation instead of parens). That&#x27;s not a bad thing, though! S-expressions aren&#x27;t used nearly as much as they should be, and indentation syntax can be much clearer than parens.<p>What&#x27;s most interesting is the language design DSL that makes it easy to put together a new tree language. I wonder if that can be implemented in Lisp, possibly with an indentation-sensitive syntax like Wisp[1] so that it retains most of Tree Notation&#x27;s features.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srfi.schemers.org&#x2F;srfi-119&#x2F;srfi-119.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;srfi.schemers.org&#x2F;srfi-119&#x2F;srfi-119.html</a>')
