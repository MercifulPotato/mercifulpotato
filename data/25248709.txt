The equivalent is also theft.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen people on HN used the word rape to describe how they feel about something done to them against their will by, say, Facebook.<p>Yes, but they will readily admit that it is hyperbole, not what they actually think about the act.  If they treat it as a serious comparison, that will get strongly argued against.<p>You are saying that the actual definition of rape is fitting here, which is in a different ballpark from hyperbole.')
