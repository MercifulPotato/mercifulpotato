I very rarely have one, sort of like once every few years, but when I do, I wake up, try to think about it, but it was gone within 1 min. So one time I voice-record everything with my iPhone the moment I was awake.... when I replay it nothing make sense, and there were lots of details missing. Basically I couldn&#x27;t remember a thing. But when ever dreaming happens it is very tiring. As if like your brain had no time to rest, but it is a very very rare thing to me.<p>One of my friend has similar problem to yours, sort of like dreaming every night. One of the few thing she find very useful now is to drink a little bit of Alcohol &#x2F; Red Wine before she sleeps, or do Sports that actually makes you sweat during the day. It seems your mind will spend all the energy on repairing your body then bothering to dream about something.')
