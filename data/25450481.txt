I often cringe when we have someone who does not understand the subject matter or worse - we forgot to ask someone to take minutes (time lost!). However, I work a lot in the U.S. government sector, and I&#x27;ve also worked in the private sector where we were discussing proprietary or sensitive info. We can only use cloud services that are heavily vetted for security - or offline versions of software.<p>If your software is certified&#x2F;vetted by MS Teams for government use, I could use your product. Or, if an offline version is available, I can potentially use your product with some vetting by security. The risk is obviously not that you&#x27;re a bad actor out to steel trade secrets, but that the security of the servers you use have not been verified.<p>I&#x27;m just letting you know in case you weren&#x27;t aware. There are a lot of cool products that tie to the cloud that I would love to use but simply can&#x27;t due to security concerns.')
