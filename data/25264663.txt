Having it described textually allows extremely cheap (within minutes) iteration on names, algorithms and the architecture.<p>Showing all these aspects concisely at once makes it possible to develop a consistent, yet concise naming scheme, which can greatly reduce misunderstandings.<p>You can discover disconnects of interactions, the data flow or ordering errors by simply following the arrows with your finger&#x2F;pointer and reading it out loud.<p>The other tool I found extremely useful is the C4 Lightweight Software Architecture Description Method (which can also be &quot;drawn&quot; pretty well with PlantUML: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashedmind.github.io&#x2F;PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide&#x2F;C4&#x2F;C4Stdlib.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crashedmind.github.io&#x2F;PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide&#x2F;C4&#x2F;C4...</a> )')
