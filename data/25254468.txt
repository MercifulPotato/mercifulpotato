An alternative one might go something like this:<p>In early Autumn it was apparent that infection rates were high in the North of England but lower in the (wealthier and economically more productive) South. The UK government adopted a local&#x2F;regional approach to lockdowns, with the effect that the North was under lockdown-like conditions for most of Autumn. Infection rates began to fall in the North, but simultaneously started rising in the (non-lockdowned) South, though from a lower base. Once infections started rising in the South, the government adopted a national lockdown plan (with, coincidentally, vastly more financial support for firms and individuals). And so the fall in infections we see &quot;before the lockdown&quot; is the effect of the &quot;tier 3&quot; restrictions across the North, with the national lockdown intended to prevent serious increases in the spread of the disease across the South.<p>I am not saying that this story is <i>true</i>, just that it&#x27;s an equally good fit for the facts. Presenting statistics is only ever the start of the conversation, not the end, as the statistics do not speak for themselves.')
