Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=[25139467], score=None, time=1605718453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137908, text='&gt; I&#x27;d love to demand scientific evidence behind all of their assertions, but have (kicking and screaming) come to realize that many important things in life simply don&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t have studies at my preferred level of rigor.<p>I&#x27;ve had to unlearn this, and part of my awakening was watching the stagnation of rationalists (myself included) who think a lot and argue about things but rarely take action. So much of rationalism is based on assumptions (due to our inherent inability to capture everything in our models) and those assumptions can be wrong in real life. Rationalists also generally fear uncertainty unless they can describe or quantify it, but this is not always possible. I&#x27;ve learned to let go of hyperrationalism and instead, rely more on using intuitive reasoning and heuristics.<p>If I hired a coach, I would want one who&#x27;s more or less an empiricist who can push me to try new things and verify them for myself. Action, even if not perfectly rigorous, produces new information. A lot of stuff we cannot prove actually works in real life.<p>(I still don&#x27;t believe in crackpot theories but heuristics at least help me choose between reasonable options.)')
