Item(by='MaulingMonkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609215749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25565595, text='&gt; I would imagine if someone at the office started claiming your work at your own you would probably experience something rather analogous to anger.<p>I&#x27;d be more incredulous than angry.  The vast majority of my work is well tracked in VCS and easily shown to be my work - such claims of... what, insecurity?  Greed?  Fear?  Are typically self-defeating, easily disproven, transparent, and rather pitiable.  They merely invite closer scrutiny and undermine themselves, the value of their word, and destroy the trust people have in them.  They&#x27;re probably not even smart enough to claim just my work as their own, but probably that of several people.  It&#x27;s worth speaking up to try and nip the problem in the bud, but everyone probably already knows they&#x27;re an untrustworthy braggart.<p>They&#x27;re not hurting me, they&#x27;re hurting themselves, and they&#x27;re often too trapped in their maladaptive coping patterns from previous toxic relationships and environments where such actions were perhaps not only effective - but perhaps even necessary to succeed within those environments - to stop.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll recover.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll get fired.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll be able to get stuff done while being rendered harmless.  Yes bob, good job doing the entire project A while simultaniously fighting off both godzilla <i>and</i> mothra (<i>eyeroll</i>).  By the way, you can do project B all by yourself, right?  Since you&#x27;re so awesome?  No no - we&#x27;re sure you can handle it.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to step on your toes.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll get a better job.<p>&gt; It might also be your life situation is such that people don&#x27;t really try to take advantage of you or mistreat you very often.<p>You can control that life situation a lot.<p>If someone consistently mistreats you, remove them from your life, because you can do better than that.  Repeat to taste.<p>If your &quot;customer is always right&quot; job tells you to smile in response to verbal abuse, find another that lets you ban them from the store instead.  Where anger might focus on &quot;getting even&quot;, instead focus on &quot;preventing this from becoming a pattern.&quot;<p>If you can&#x27;t quit your job yet, discount their verbal lashing out as the angry adult temper tantrum that it is.  Discount their tirades as the worthless ventings that they are - targeted at the world, not you specifically - and pity them for their failure to become a worthwhile adult.  Or perhaps they&#x27;re screaming because their dog just died, and they don&#x27;t know how to process that.  Perhaps they just learned they have cancer.  Perhaps they <i>don&#x27;t</i> know about their brain tumor yet.  Perhaps they fear.  That doesn&#x27;t justify their frothing spittle, but one can pity and sympathise with a person unable to properly express their emotions in a constructive and healthy way - because we&#x27;ve all been there, and so many of us are fortunate enough to not <i>live</i> there like some of these poor bastards do.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s never worthwhile to get properly angry, but often the biggest victim of the angry and the cruel is themselves.  They push away friends, family, coworkers, opportunities, and kindness - and are often left with only mindless hedonism and misery themselves.  No wonder they&#x27;re such a miserable prick.<p>I also realize much of this is easier said than done.')
