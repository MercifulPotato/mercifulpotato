I’m comfortable enough with them that I didn’t need to look anything up to write any of what I wrote above.<p>There&#x27;s an even higher probability of Perl being installed, and I&#x27;d much rather use that than Make. I&#x27;ve even been known to write a Perl script that calls Make after doing something complex that would be &quot;not fun&quot; to add to a Makefile.')
