I owned a satellite uplink&#x2F;downlink in Afghanistan and it wasn’t cheap per megabit (supply&#x2F;demand issues) and I highly doubt you’d be able to get a gigabit connection to Mars, especially when it’s on the other side of the sun. Also, the earth is rather noisy, so it may be easier to get a fast connection from Mars, the SNR from earth will be much lower.')
