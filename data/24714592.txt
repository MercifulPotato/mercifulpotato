They did a hearing test, asked a couple of questions that didn&#x27;t apply to me and they both said &quot;I dunno why you have it&quot; and were fairly useless.<p>The only hint was a dip in a hearing chart, which wasn&#x27;t big enough to be considered hearing loss or otherwise.  This list alone is a better list of potential causes than those useless doctors.')
