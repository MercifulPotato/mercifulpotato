I said this specific use seems to be a fairly good example. See above factors.<p>&gt; Fair use is a defense you can raise in court, _after_ you have been sued. It is not a presumptive right.<p>Not correct. This has been challenged in court and it was found that fair use is a right and not simply a defense.')
