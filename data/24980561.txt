And there are still thousands of other things that COULD happen that didn’t, like a candidate getting removed by assassination, car wreck, illness, fatigue, enemy attack on the State, pandemic, on and on, that will have a massive impact on the state of things.<p>Yes, there are lots of things that could happen, but they&#x27;re all pretty unlikely.  A huge impact times a low probability doesn&#x27;t affect the outcome much.<p>&gt; I really don’t know how to value&#x2F;process information like “Clinton 90% most likely to win,” and “Clinton loses in hotly contested election.” How do you get from A to B.<p>Well, it helps to not start from &quot;Clinton 90% most likely to win&quot;—if I remember correctly (which I may not), the final odds for Clinton were in the 65%-70% range.<p>&gt; Taleb says model should never have been so confident. I would agree.<p>538 was not especially confident.<p>&gt; the output information is certainly less valuable than the attention it’s receiving. Seems largely academic, and worthwhile, but not worthy of broad attention outside of the quant circles.<p>Maybe, but it&#x27;s popular because it&#x27;s something that people want to know.')
