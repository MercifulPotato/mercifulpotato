I think even use of the term algorithm is misleading to obscure the truth. To make it seem like it some sort of soulless machine, that made a mistake. It was probably done by some administrator in excel, reviewed by a senior staff member to make sure the “right” cohorts get the vaccine.<p>Also 5000 is a small number, you can easily asses how reasonable the result of the algorithm is. Heck, a couple of decent PMs from any tech company can prioritize distribution of 5000 doses in a fair way in couple of days.')
