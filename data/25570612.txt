Mind you, plenty of farmers did grow &quot;Indian hemp&quot; for fibres, including (somewhat amusingly) George Washington, who imported Indian hemp seeds for that purpose, and is on record as saying it was much more valuable for fibre production that &quot;common hemp&quot;.<p>Whether those were ever <i>really</i> different plants, or what exactly the THC levels of any of them would have been is not clear. :) But the distinction is one that was routinely made both by farmers and government.')
