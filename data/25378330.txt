Most content by volume on the web is click bait farms littered with Ads.<p>At least Brave and BAT make it more of a transaction between you and the advertiser.  The advertiser now pays you for your attention to their ad, rather than paying a third party to do their best to trick you into viewing the Ad.<p>I dislike Ads as much as the next person, I block ads, and when I tried brave I opted out of any Ads.  But BAT does seem like a viable answer to the constant complain from &quot;publishers&quot; about how ad block is ruining their businesses.')
