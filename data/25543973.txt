THe people who are saying &quot;race is social construct&quot; are by and large not the actual scientists making discoveries in this area.  REad the NYTimes science section for a few months and you&#x27;ll see they commonly discuss the difference in medical treatment research and how we could improve health care by being more aware of it.')
