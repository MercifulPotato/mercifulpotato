Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603465764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867949, text='Is there a reason why &quot;sa bibliothèque à elle et sa bibliothèque à lui&quot; is a better translation of &quot;his library and hers&quot; than &quot;sa bibliothèque et la sienne&quot;? I know it&#x27;s just a word-for-word translation, but the latter seems more natural, and the former unnecessarily verbose. Especially in context, where the original English deliberately interrupts the pattern of &quot;his car and her car, his towels and her towels&quot;, as a matter of prosody.<p>Not that I&#x27;d expect the computer to &quot;know&quot; that. I&#x27;m just curious, as a French learner, about why DH&#x27;s translation is better.')
