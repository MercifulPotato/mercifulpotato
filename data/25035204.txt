I am seeking help with this but one of main stressor of my anxiety is deadlines and oncall.<p>I am trying to find job roles without deadlines. Once I worked as Business Intelligence analyst and that was one of a few jobs where there were no deadlines other than get it done asap. But that meant never really working past 5pm. And there was no oncall. If data warehouse was down after 5pm, we would bring it back in the morning. I loved it.<p>I am looking into data science jobs now but wondering what other options might be for someone seeking a slightly less stressful role?')
