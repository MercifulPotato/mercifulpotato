I think the US has pretty much succeeded in their goal of essentially canceling Julian Assange. Being holed up for years in the Ecuadorian Embassy had to have taken a toll mentally. As much as some might say it&#x27;s not prison, it effectively is.<p>2. There&#x27;s an interesting question of where the line is between journalist and not journalist. As much as some might argue otherwise, being a &quot;journalist&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean you can break the law. And yes there&#x27;s a difference between publishing classified material that comes to you vs actively engaging in, supporting and enabling the behaviour that led to obtaining that material. Assange clearly had prior knowledge of Manning&#x27;s actions and was more of an accomplice. Being a &quot;journalist&quot; isn&#x27;t a defense here, at least not a legal one;<p>3. Here&#x27;s my other issue with treating Assange as a journalist: he was clearly playing politics. You saw this in the Democratic email hacking and publication. This undermines the whole theory that Wikileaks was somehow different, impartial or open. It is and always was another tool to further a political end. At some point you aren&#x27;t a journalist anymore;<p>4. The UK court upheld all the prosecution&#x27;s points of law so it really was simply a matter of health grounds. I honestly don&#x27;t know how an appeals court will treat that. I guess we&#x27;ll see.<p>5. Interestingly I think Brexit works against Assange here. I don&#x27;t believe this case can be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (or Justice?). Obviously the UK isn&#x27;t in the EU anymore but I don&#x27;t know the law well enough here. Like it might be that the case was brought while the UK was an EU member so it&#x27;s possible the ECHR&#x2F;ECJ has jurisdiction? Probably not but it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>6. It&#x27;s unlikely the incoming Biden administration is going to be sympathetic towards Assange. There&#x27;s probably no will to spend political capital on that and the Democrats are probably still made about Assange&#x27;s (active) role in the email hacking and the 2016 election.')
