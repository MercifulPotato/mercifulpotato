If Trump has any idea what he&#x27;s talking about, I&#x27;m comfortable calling that level of dishonesty a &quot;lie.&quot; My view is that he just doesn&#x27;t care what&#x27;s true or not, and he probably knows that much of what he&#x27;s saying is false.<p>&gt; Trump lawyers did try to prevent these election changes, by taking them to court.<p>Which changes?<p>State election laws are set by the state legislature. In Georgia, the Republicans control both houses, plus the governorship. It&#x27;s hard to believe that the Republican party would have set the rules to disadvantage their own Presidential candidate.')
