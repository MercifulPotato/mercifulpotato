The example that you show uses colors to signal things that are <i>wrong</i> with the current page.  This is somewhat logical: if things look wrong (because there are more than three colors) then they are wrong.  Regular wikipedia entries do not have yellow nor orange:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Riemannian_manifold" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Riemannian_manifold</a><p>You are right that there&#x27;s still more colors: very light shades of gray, and a thin light blue line for separator.  They are almost imperceptible on my screen, but I would say that the page would look even better if the thin separator was black, and there were no different background shades.')
