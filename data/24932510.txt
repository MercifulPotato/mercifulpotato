The terms keep getting worse. I think all told, and if I were to repeat it, I would certainly scrap the IP I made in those early days and start fresh when starting the company. Like they mention in the article, chances are you&#x27;ll pivot a number of times anyway, making the IP largely irrelevant, but you&#x27;ll still have given up significant equity for it, and likely have a difficult shareholder onboard for life.<p>(edit: at least this is my anecdotal evidence, and what I gather from some other people having interacted with my particular tech transfer office...)')
