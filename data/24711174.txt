There are more complicated models, like Krussell-Smith, but it&#x27;s not clear that they help explain macroeconomics better.<p>Agent-based modelling isn&#x27;t more popular because they assume that the agents are very, very stupid.  Also, not only do they not produce closed-form solutions, they don&#x27;t tend to lead to clear statements at all.  Also also, the leading agent-based modeler, Cars Hommes, is infinitely better published than most economists, so he&#x27;s not suffering too bad.')
