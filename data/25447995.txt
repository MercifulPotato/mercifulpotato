I&#x27;m around the 1000-1200 range (just picked it up again recently) and I&#x27;d say most of my peers on Chess.com around that range have definitely studied openings and present sneaky traps consistently in the first ~5-15 moves.<p>Playing as black for me is the real driving force for me to study openings because my black game suffers the most from actual Theory openings around 1200. It&#x27;s not crucial to winning to study the openings because you can often get by with just basic positional play and simple deduction, but a cursory understanding of the most popular openings is a big bang-for-your-buck way to improve in the low 1k range, IMHO.')
