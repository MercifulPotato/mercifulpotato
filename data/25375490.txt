Although now that I think about it, a lot of what I mentioned could also be traced back to 9&#x2F;11 - calling Obama a crypto-muslim wouldn&#x27;t have been a valid way of spreading FUD about his intentions otherwise.

Deplatforming and regulation of social media might help stop the spread (although I support the former and not the latter) but we still as a society have to address the underlying issues. Something like QAnon doesn&#x27;t take off simply because it&#x27;s a viral meme, but because it resonates with people&#x27;s existing fears and beliefs.')
