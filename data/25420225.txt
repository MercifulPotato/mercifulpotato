It&#x27;s too high level. On the surface it seems like it makes code more consise and elegant, but in reality it just pushes the &quot;ugly&quot; implementation details and allocations onto the compiler. When you start writing code that&#x27;s phrased in terms of high-level compiler features, rather than in terms of what the computer needs to do, then you&#x27;re no longer writing C.')
