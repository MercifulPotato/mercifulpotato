I&#x27;m a student, see.\n\n  They call me master, but it don&#x27;t mean much.  Learned a bit from Aronoff down around San Pedro.  Rees-Miller too.  Real men of discipline.\n\n  &#x27;bout myself, I got thoughts on discourse, but that&#x27;s pragmatism talkin&#x27;\n\n  I hear you like math though.  Chomsky&#x27;s a son of a bitch, and he do know grammar.  But he can&#x27;t put you in a box even if you talk animals, or rocks - &#x27;cause he don&#x27;t know where you come from.\n\n  And that thing you asked me to read?  \n\n  I read it.\n\n  Keeps the rain off, but ain&#x27;t that what semantics is all about?  Keeping concepts from seeping into your cloths to dampen your soul?  \n\n  Your brain?\n\n  I said too much already, but discipline&#x27;s a creature of words.
