But to dig into the specifics here, because it&#x27;s not clear in the article: is this model generalizable to arbitrary tracks, or will the author have to generate new coefficients for each track?<p>If you have to generate new coefficients for each track, your polynomial regression reduces to a polynomial <i>interpolation</i> of two-dimensional points which represent the track path on a plane. Which is fine and still accomplishes the specific goal, but doesn&#x27;t solve what would generally be considered the actual research problem.<p>But then again I don&#x27;t know if the neural network actually achieves this. It&#x27;s a little unclear in the video: I don&#x27;t know if the model is being able to learn from the human guiding the vehicle on <i>n</i> iterations or if the model is <i>generated</i> by the human guiding the vehicle on <i>n</i> iterations. Presumably the research goal is to develop a model which learns tracks (in this circumstance, that would be akin to the model choosing the coefficients rather than <i>being</i> the coefficients).')
