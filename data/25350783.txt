If you compare the AirPod Pros and the Sony WF1000s, Sony comes out ahead in most estimations I&#x27;ve seen. Sony has been doing portable personal audio for an awfully long time, given that they basically invented the form factor, so they&#x27;re not likely to be lagging behind too much.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Apple is OK at consumer audio. The Homepod is nice, so are the APPs. Even Beats aren&#x27;t too bad nowadays. But they haven&#x27;t released consistently better audio products than Audeze, Sennheiser, Sony, M&amp;D, or even Bose--their closest comparison, since both Apple and Bose lean hard on DSPs for their SQ.<p>I suspect the second version of these headphones will be pretty excellent. Apple does learn from its mistakes, whatever they&#x27;ll end up being. Trick is Bose and Sony will have learned from their mistakes too. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Apple ends up being able to compete on audio, not just style.')
