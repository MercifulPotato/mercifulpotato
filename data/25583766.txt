Item(by='hangonhn', descendants=None, kids=[25586940], score=None, time=1609349922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25583523, text='&gt; I often heard YouTube comments claim that one got crappy Chinese products because of they paid cheap price. I don&#x27;t have much experience in buying items directly from China (I bought a drill and impact drive from AliExpress, have been OK); want to learn your experience.<p>I think that&#x27;s the nuance that other people miss. Cheap stuff is cheap for a reason and they break. We have all purchased expensive  Chinese stuff that work well but we don&#x27;t attribute them to China because of the shiny non-Chinese logo on them (i.e. Apple, etc.) Anker is a new generation of Chinese companies that is trying to build a brand and move up market. Their stuff have been superb but aren&#x27;t bargain bin prices.')
