Because you known anyway that it will be painful, why go for it?<p>&gt; It often comes from horrible bad memories from previous versions or old frameworks.<p>Those old versions and frameworks are still around. Companies don&#x27;t lose their legacy fast.<p>&gt; Objectively, compared to other languages i&#x27;ve been working with it is more than OK. Despite it&#x27;s lack of &quot;style&quot; it is easy to understand, host, tests, diagnose and it is powerfull for web applications.<p>That always was the case with PHP. Doesn&#x27;t say whether it has lost it&#x27;s old flaws.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s essentially sinking in popularity because of bad faith and lack of hype, really sad !<p>Is more losing because of competition. PHP still is mainly a web-stack backend-language that can&#x27;t offer much in other areas. But now there are other languages who can equally shine on backend, while also shine on other areas. So obvisouly people go for the language which can give them more, instead of less.')
