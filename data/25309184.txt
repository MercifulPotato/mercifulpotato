The problem a lot of creators had was what was the point in unranked mode ALSO having SBMM? I&#x27;m sympathetic to that argument.<p>Forcing SBMM in all cases just seems like it&#x27;s meant to protect n00bs from getting crapped on but isn&#x27;t this coddling players? There&#x27;s something aspirational about playing better players, no? Also, &quot;smurfing&quot; (creating a new account to play against n00bs) largely defeats this anyway.<p>If n00bs wanted to play against only other n00bs couldn&#x27;t they play in ranked mode where that would happen?<p>More relaxed modes tend to be better viewing. That&#x27;s actually good for the game IMHO if streaming it has longevity and audience retention.')
