You might die tomorrow, go ahead spend that money now. Enjoy yourself if You end up destitute tenting in a park with a sign begging for food, at least You had a good time.<p>While were at it, we might aswell drink a bit more and eat as much crap as we want, might get hit by a bus tommorow so why not, who cares if we get diabetes and have to get a foot amputated we lived life to the fullest.<p>Maybe we will get covid, maybe not. Who gives a crap about the doctors and nurses that wont get to see their families because they had to work overtime to try and save our selfish asses. We got to live our lives to the fullest.<p>Give me a break, part if being in a society is not always putting yourself first. You have the ability to do what You want but don&#x27;t think it is going to be without concequences.<p>These laws are really only going to keep honest people inline, sort of like a locked gate on a 3 foot fence. So go ahead and jump the fence but don&#x27;t play the victim when your loved ones are dying and there isn&#x27;t a doctor or nurse available to help them, all just because your tiny bit of freedom was more important than the general good or because You knew better than all the experts because you read something on the net.')
