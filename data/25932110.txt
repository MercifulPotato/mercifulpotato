Meanwhile small businesses (which employ a disproportionate amount of minorities) basically get rolled into the trash. California effectively mandated they go out of business.<p>The icing on the cake is seeing politician after politician get caught breaking their own rules. Nancy Pelosi visits a nail salon while the state ordered every other nail salon out of business. It&#x27;s sick and it&#x27;s dumb and a large portion of the country couldn&#x27;t care less.')
