Institutions will soak it up, leaving the price to the student exactly where it is. Because, markets (price levels settle where they bring the most profit).<p>I&#x27;ve seen it in &#x27;incentives&#x27; to develop local railway-adjacent properties. City subsidized rents, but they just advertised &#x27;premium&#x27; apartments and the rent is the same&#x2F;higher than elsewhere. The developer pockets the incentive.<p>Lest we imagine that some institutions to lower their rates because of Fed support, that isn&#x27;t happening now and rates are already well above what it takes to run a college.')
