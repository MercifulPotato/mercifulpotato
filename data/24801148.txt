I think Facebook is rotten because they keep dancing around the root of their problems: scale. If Facebook were to scale down connections by increasing the friction between people and groups so that individuals were nudged into interacting nearly exclusively with real-world personal contacts, then there would be little need for a technical filter. People&#x27;s own social filters would take care of that for them.<p>But you&#x27;re right. That would be against Facebook&#x27;s financial incentives because that would make them less valuable to advertisers. They wouldn&#x27;t have the power to move audiences anymore if the audience is moving itself.')
