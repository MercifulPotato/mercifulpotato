Apple does most if not all ML&#x2F;data-mining on the device where-as competitors do it in the cloud. My assumption is they are positioning themselves this way to grab consumers later should regulations hit cloud services collecting data externally. Apple can say it is all on device and don&#x27;t have access while other companies will have to say they have your data. Ultimately the motives are the same.')
