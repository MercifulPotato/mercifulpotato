Of course state machines are cumbersome for systems with loads of different states and transitions.<p>But state machines are really useful when designing safety-critical systemsfor aeronautical, automotive or train components, especially if one uses timed automata for modelling.<p>It&#x27;s possible to either generate the code from the model or use the model to automatically generate a complete test suite for the modelled system. Very useful for verification purposes.')
