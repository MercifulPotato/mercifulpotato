These people are deeply angry and frustrated because they think an overwhelming election win has been stolen <i>from</i> them. They&#x27;re deeply mired in denial, and in a totally self-serving way. This is crystal clear if you look at what they <i>actually</i> write on their platforms.<p>At some point, they need to get a clue and realize that further radicalization along these lines will <i>not</i> be helpful to them, and that the worthwhile battle against the new &quot;fascism&quot; they decry should be fought elsewhere, such as by working to restore the values of constitutional, limited government and protection of fundamental freedoms.<p>This also means actively de-escalating and stepping back from many of their most populist and most irrational political stances - but that&#x27;s only to be expected.')
