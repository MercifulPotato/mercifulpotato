Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608987185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542089, text='&gt; It&#x27;s the discrepancy between the initial voting within the first few minutes and the later voting that is strange. And it&#x27;s always an initial 2-3 immediate downvotes, followed by dozens of upvotes.<p>There&#x27;s no need to invoke a &quot;cabal&quot; theory because it&#x27;s not odd, it&#x27;s a natural and expected artefact of the system dynamics.<p>First you get downvoted because someone didn&#x27;t like your comment.  Or even by accident, mis-clicking the wrong arrow.<p>Probably something about your comment is seen as downvote-worthy by some people but not most.<p>After some time, your comment is seen greyed out because of the downvote(s); just 1 downvote is enough for this.<p>But your comment isn&#x27;t that bad, there are mixed reactions. So people seeing it greyed out think &quot;that doesn&#x27;t deserve a downvote&quot; and give it a compensatory upvote to remove the grey.<p>Those upvoters don&#x27;t see the effect of each other&#x27;s upvotes for a while because of the time between loading a page of comments and reading it, so multiple compensatory upvotes take place even though just 1-2 would be enough.  And they can&#x27;t react to the grey as early as the downvote(s) for the same reason.<p>The viewing figures go through an exponential rise phase, and if your first downvote(s) and subsequent trickle of downvote(s), and compensate-for-grey-because-it-wasn&#x27;t-that-bad upvote(s) all fall on the exponential rise, you see the effect you&#x27;ve described: A small number of downvotes early followed by a lot more upvotes after a time delay.<p>If your comment elicits enough mixed responses from different people, it will still get a trickle of downvotes while the viewing figures are high.  But you can&#x27;t see downvotes easily while there are a burst of upvotes.  So in this case, you see a small number of initial downvote(s), a larger number of upvotes, followed by a small number of downvotes again as the compensatory-upvote burst comes to an end.')
