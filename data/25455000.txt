Vader Immortal, that uses the teleport movement system... until you&#x27;re put on a moving platform, or (worst) have to climb up and down... and OH YEAH that triggered it. Bad.<p>&gt; <i>It&#x27;s a bit like if everyone who tried alcohol for the first time took 10 shots of vodka and then span in circles for 10 minutes straight</i><p>Okay, that made me laugh, and I think I see where you&#x27;re going, but I really think it&#x27;s different.<p>Alas, one of the first things I tried was RecRoom, which has thumb-stick navigation that was set to super-fast movement, so that was the first thing that really got me.<p>Where I disagree with your idea is that days later, in simple, slow, self-controlled movement (such as the ladders in Vader Immortal) it got me again.<p>&gt; <i>There are also hardware solutions...</i><p>Yeah, if someone came up with some non-drug way to take this away, I&#x27;d probably get a VR system right away (after testing it with my friend&#x27;s system, of course!)')
