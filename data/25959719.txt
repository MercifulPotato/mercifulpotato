Robinhood is a bit unique with their instant bank deposits feature, that&#x27;s something traditional banks don&#x27;t generally do, but its really just a minor extension of this same idea.<p>Robinhood is accessible, so it has serviced the bulk of the retail investor spike that happened this week. Additionally, I expect that their net liquidity is far, far lower than a traditional bank, just given their age and diversification of business. They needed money, so they went to JP Morgan. Plenty of people also trade with JP Morgan, but (and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this) JP Morgan actually, to some degree, knows what the fuck its doing. Robinhood doesn&#x27;t; Robinhood is basically a teenager who just got a new car, wanted to show off to some friends, crashed it, and is now crying on the phone to daddy.<p>Which, to be fair, is exactly the same thing every bank had to do in 2007, except daddy was the US Government.')
