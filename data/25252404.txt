If you have to pause for this 50ms GC once every X trades, then you force the GC to happen _after_ the X-1th trade has completed, but you need to provision an extra 15(?) machines to cover the pause. Otherwise, you&#x27;re not delivering 3ms trades, you&#x27;re delivering (3 + GCTime&#x2F;X) ms. It doesn&#x27;t matter if GC takes 1ms or 1s, you &quot;simply&quot; need to have the capacity to cover the extra GC time.')
