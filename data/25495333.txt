Things are not supposed to go under the radar.<p>I am in a team of 5 right now where stand-up style meetings is kinda fine due to few members in the meeting, though.<p>I would like some readme-style changenotes.txt instead of tickets for a release. There is not way you dig down the ticket pile anyway after the sprints are done so the traceability is quite overrated. The tickets are lost like a friends scream for help in your Facebook feed when the march continue.')
