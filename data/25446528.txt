But here&#x27;s my point of view: if Oracle tried to pull one of those moves, people would just jump ship to something else (just like they are doing here in response to Red Hat&#x2F;IBM). And likely Oracle management knows this, and so they likely won&#x27;t.<p>Oracle Linux is very different from other Oracle products (e.g. database, ERP systems) in that there are quite low levels of lock-in &#x2F; switching costs. &quot;Embrace and extinguish&quot; works best for products with high switching costs, which isn&#x27;t Linux.<p>If you are particularly worried about this, just avoid using any of the features Oracle added to RHEL, like DTrace or Btrfs. Just stick to the RHCK (Red Hat Compatible Kernel) instead of UEK (Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel).')
