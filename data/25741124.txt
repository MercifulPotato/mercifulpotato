Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[25744264, 25741663], score=None, time=1610415143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737600, text='Check out the Stanis≈Çaw Lem story &quot;GOLEM XIV&quot;.<p>GOLEM is one of a series of machines constructed to plan World War III, as is its sister HONEST ANNIE. But to the frustration of their human creators these more sophisticated machines refuse to plan World War III and instead seem to become philosophers (Golem) or just refuse to communicate with humans at all (Annie).<p>Lots of supposedly smart humans try to debate with Golem and eventually they (humans supervising the interaction) have to impose a &quot;rule&quot; to stop people opening their mouths the very first time they see Golem and getting humiliated almost before they&#x27;ve understood what is happening, because it&#x27;s frustrating for everybody else.<p>Golem is asked if humans could acquire such intelligence and it explains that this is categorically impossible, Golem is doing something that is not just a better way to do the same thing as humans, it&#x27;s doing something altogether different and superior that humans can&#x27;t do. It also seems to hint that Annie is, in turn, superior in capability to Golem and that for them such transcendence to further feats is not necessarily impossible.<p>This is one of the stories that Lem wrote by an oblique method, what we have is extracts from an introduction to an imaginary dry scientific record that details the period between GOLEM being constructed and... the eventual conclusion of the incident.<p>Anyway, I was reminded because while Lem has to be careful (he&#x27;s not superintelligent after all) he&#x27;s clearly hinting that humans aren&#x27;t smart enough to recognise the superintelligence of GOLEM and ANNIE. One proposed reason for why ANNIE rather than GOLEM is responsible for the events described near the end of the story is that she doesn&#x27;t even think <i>about</i> humans, for the same reason humans largely don&#x27;t think <i>about</i> flies. What&#x27;s to think about? They&#x27;re just an annoyance, to be swatted aside.')
