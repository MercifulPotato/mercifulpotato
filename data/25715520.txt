They have not bee prevented by the force of law from saying what they want to say. The 1st amendment doesn&#x27;t apply to private companies and nor does it guarantee a platform. There were platforms back when it was formulated (newspapers). So, i don&#x27;t think it is a case of &quot;platforms did not exist so the 1st amendment could not account for them&quot;')
