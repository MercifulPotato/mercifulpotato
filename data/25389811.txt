I spent a majority of my time as a teen playing Bungie&#x27;s wonderful Marathon on my Powerbook 165c, which was a 68030 running at 33mhz.  In a pinch, it could be played on a IIcx with a 16mhz (?) 030, but only with a reduced resolution.<p>I still have the Powerbook, but it won&#x27;t boot.  I regret ever selling my PowerMac 9500 though.')
