It is also not very fun. So when someone files a PR against your project, it means a bunch of not-very-fun effort. It also comes with a social obligation, because someone presumably put a lot of effort into the PR and you don&#x27;t want to have wasted their time. Obligation + not fun work on a side project that you&#x27;re probably doing to help stave off burnout turns that project into just another source of burnout. Project management in general just isn&#x27;t very fun.<p>If you feel a large degree of ownership over the codebase, you&#x27;ll also be irritated at including someone else&#x27;s code&#x2F;design style. Like having someone else&#x27;s voice in your head. You could go through the PR and request changes to conform to your code&#x2F;design preferences, but that would take a lot of your time and also a lot of the contributor&#x27;s time (and be very likely to frustrate the contributor). It would probably just be easier to rewrite it yourself in your own style. Or just let all that stuff slide. But then your project is less &quot;your&quot; project, and you might not get the same sense of gratification working in the codebase.')
