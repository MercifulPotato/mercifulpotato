Think something like a social network; view content, create an account, upload content, etc etc.<p>I know there are checklists &#x2F; task lists out there for things like web security (&quot;don&#x27;t use MD5&quot;) and front-end web dev best practices (&quot;test in different browsers&quot;) but I&#x27;m curious if something higher-level exists. Almost something like a REST API boilerplate, maybe? Something along the lines of:<p>USER ACCOUNTS\n[] Create an account\n    [] Send user email verification\n[] Edit account\n[] Reset password\n    [] Securely create reset token\n    [] Send password reset email\n...<p>Is there anything like this out there? Feels like it could be useful for getting a project off the ground more smoothly, and help keep scope in check while helping avoid missing important requirements. I&#x27;ll probably end up making something myself—and hey, let me know if you&#x27;d be interested in what I come up with—but I&#x27;d love to see what the state of the art looks like.')
