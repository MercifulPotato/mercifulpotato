Sleeping in shifts would allow for plenty, attacks were not constant, especially with good shelter, and shelter only takes so long to construct, if that&#x27;s necessary at all.<p>Remember, we started in an environment which provided everything we needed already, and one we were evolved for.<p>If you look at the lives of other apex predators like lions, bears, and eagles, their lives are pretty good in this respect, and their biggest threats are either their own species or humans.')
