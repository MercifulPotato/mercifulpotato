Item(by='t0mas88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611754650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927053, text='Calling everything a connector is a bit disingenuous. If you look at the PDF it has 8 part numbers listed, which is a number for all of the small parts. Also the doors, doorknobs, hinges etc are all available to order.<p>What&#x27;s left are shelves and the two wooden sides of the bookcase itself. The shelves can be ordered: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;billy-extra-shelf-white-10265293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;billy-extra-shelf-white-1026529...</a><p>So I would rephrase your &quot;no item numbers apart from connectors&quot; to &quot;everything can be replaced except for the two sides of the main body&quot;. And even those you can get by ordering a new cabinet without any doors or extras, since that&#x27;s basically the sides + a number of shelfs.')
