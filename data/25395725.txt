Ryan Taibbi, for example, clearly dislikes Trump, but also thinks the Democrats aren&#x27;t responding to him well[1], which is an interesting perspective to understand if you are anti-Trump. If you are a liberal who fails to incorporate or understand even the criticisms of people who are close to being your allies, you may be less equipped to properly combat Trumpism.<p>Basically, it sounds to me like you are advocating ignoring these people because you disagree with them, which doesn&#x27;t strike me as the best way to rigorously improve one&#x27;s political perspective.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taibbi.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-trump-era-sucks-and-needs-to" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taibbi.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-trump-era-sucks-and-needs-...</a>')
