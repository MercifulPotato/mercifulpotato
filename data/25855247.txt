When you start building taller, you do start having four important issues. First, you start having issues destroying existing housing and replacing it with taller buildings, which in the period in between leads to <i>less supply</i>, and then the rent on the taller buildings often is barely lower than it was before.<p>You also start having issues with traffic, obviously, and air quality, which can easily get so bad that no improvement is possible any more, especially when you cannot force people to use very high performance public transit<p>The third issue is that as you are already at taller structures, it gets more and more expensive to make things taller still - not only are the existing structures already incredibly expensive to build and thus really expensive to replace, but the structures you replace them with are also more and more expensive.<p>Which leads to the result that simply increasing density is not a solution to the problem but instead a temporary fix, as you rapidly brush up against the density limits of your economics and infrastructure, such that even the very densest places such as Hong Kong have hugely unaffordable housing. And as you arrive to your limit, the 6-7% rent increase clock keeps ticking and ticking, sometimes even faster than you can reduce it via increased supply while you&#x27;re doing a massive building, let alone when you&#x27;re not anymore.<p>So yes, there is simply no way to fix skyrocketing rent by simply scaling cities vertically. The truth is that in the end there is a hard limit to how cheap you can make housing in a free market. And you&#x27;re just stuck there. The root cause is that you can&#x27;t build more land. So the only solutions that work long-term require at least partial decomodification.')
