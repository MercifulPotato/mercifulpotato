After a few false starts I ended up switching to DDG as my default search engine. My usage pattern is as follows: for things that are predictably easy to find (e.g. the queries &quot;normal&quot; people would issue), I use DDG. That&#x27;s about 90-95% of all my queries. For obscure stuff, I add &quot;!g&quot; at the end of the query and go to Google. That&#x27;s the remaining 5-10%, and I doubt anyone can do better than Google there. That way I get both the privacy and the long tail.')
