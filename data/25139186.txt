Start early, let kids make mistakes, punish them for said mistakes, let them learn lessons.<p>Enforcing super strict rules has never helped anyone I think. 1h a day is quite strict in my opinion especially if consumed in multiple sessions. If I had just started doing something and it took me 15min to get fully absorbed and in 15min I had to call it quits I&#x27;d be pretty angry myself to be honest.<p>I can make an analogy with access to sweets here. Our boy aged 6 now has had unrestricted access to a cupboard full of variety of sweets since he was 3. And believe me he loves sweets! Technically he can go and take as many sweets as many times as he wants to and no one would probably understand. But we&#x27;ve said it is 2 sweets a day, reasonable quantities. This was strictly enforced early on and now we can 100% trust him to pick whatever he wants when he wants. Because he knows when is a good time and what is a good amount. He&#x27;ll even come home from school some days and say he&#x27;ll only eat one sweet today as they&#x27;ve had chocolate cake for pudding at school.<p>So cut your kids some slack and let them learn themselves rather than locking everything behind locks - physical or digital.')
