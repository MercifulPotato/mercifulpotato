If the task is as granular as you suggest, progress bars would be a great visual indicator, much better than text.<p>But since computers do get stuck, additional indicators should help with that. A spinner is supposed to show that a process isn&#x27;t stuck, but those are fallible too. A textual representation (&quot;bytes currently downloaded&quot;) sounds like a great addition to a progress bar. I&#x27;ve seen this a lot on linux distro installers, where you can click &quot;details&quot; below the progress bar to see the console output.')
