Apple, Google...or Philips.<p>Yeelights you can control directly via self-hosted Home Assistant &amp; the Home assistant app...on your LAN, no internet required, no proprietary hub, no Philips premium.<p>&gt;There are a ton of wifi-enabled lights, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend one in particular.<p>You do realize Yeelight is Xiaomi, right? It&#x27;s their competitor lineup to Hue<p>&gt;which has too many permissions for what it does<p>I used the iphone app for initial linking - permissions look fine to me, but I did disable bluetooth &amp; homekit later. That said the initial pairing process is indeed quite sketchy &amp; fiddly.<p>&gt;it&#x27;s also got another wireless protocol that isn&#x27;t affected by your wifi network<p>Yeah - Zigbee. Considered it but abandoned it due to cost - both on the individual device side and you&#x27;re back to needing some sort of bridge&#x2F;receiver device.<p>&gt;Hue switches should continue to work even if your internet is down<p>Same for the HA solution since it&#x27;s hosted on the local network. Unless your local wifi connection to your router is unstable from interference...in which case I&#x27;d be concerned about zigbee too since they&#x27;re both on 2.4ghz')
