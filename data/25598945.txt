Item(by='y-c-o-m-b', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609460138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25597967, text='&gt; With full remote, the physical boundaries between work and home disappear. It no longer feels safe to tell someone you&#x27;ll follow up on something when you&#x27;re back in the office tomorrow morning, because now technically you&#x27;re always in your office.<p>I&#x27;ve been working remote for many years; started out part time remote in 2010 and been full time since about 2016 (across 5 different companies since). What you&#x27;re saying has never been true for me.<p>I average 40 hours a week. If I go over 8 hours one day, I&#x27;ll do less hours the next. I have no problem telling my manager or anyone else that I&#x27;ll follow up tomorrow. I don&#x27;t give them excuses, I just simply state &quot;I&#x27;m signing off, I&#x27;ll follow up in the morning&quot; once that clock hits my 8 hour mark.<p>You (the royal &quot;you&quot;) are in control of your own destiny when it comes to setting these boundaries. If your company is truly forcing you to do this, it&#x27;s time to look elsewhere. Don&#x27;t blame it on remote work. This is not a remote problem, this is a problem between you and your company.')
