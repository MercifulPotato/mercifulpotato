That&#x27;s a huge distinction and I can&#x27;t help but think you intentionally downgraded his position to cover-up his behavior. &quot;Just an employee&quot; &quot;Not a big deal&quot;<p>But when you read the allegations, they seem like a very big deal that an executive was spying on users, giving their information to the Chinese government explicitly for oppressive purposes, including folks who are not in China, and went out of his way to personally censor non-Chinese groups meeting to discuss the Massacre-Which-Cannot-Be-Mentioned.<p>I would say the headline understates the gravity (it&#x27;s very much a &#x27;by-the-books&#x27; headline that you KNOW went through ten levels of Legal), and that your hand waving here feels much more dishonest than the headline.')
