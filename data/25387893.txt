I recommend a film called <i>Somewhere</i> by Sofia Coppola, it&#x27;s about an actor (not old) going through the motions of his life, always surrounded by people, yet his internal landscape is vast emptiness.  There&#x27;s a scene where he falls asleep while watching twin pole dance routine in his hotel room!  Coppola has a good eye for these &quot;lonely in a crowded place&quot; condition.  The female character at a temple in Tokyo in <i>Lost In Translations</i> comes to mind, and the Bill Murray character calling home.  Likewise <i>Marie Antoinette</i>, two characters isolated and lonely, navigating the party atmosphere in the Chateau Marmont of its time.')
