Apple kept the laptop for over a month and I had to plead for status updates, which generally fell on deaf ears. When they did ship the laptop back, they got my name and address wrong in spite of confirming it multiple times, which caused further confusion and delays. I remain convinced that a vendor on Alibaba would have done better than Apple in a similar situation.')
