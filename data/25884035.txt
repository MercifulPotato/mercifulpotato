Also the title is baity.<p>&gt;&gt; The worst thing Trump ever did to any of them was to say mean things about them in tweets. Those aren&#x27;t assaults on press freedom.<p>It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine him not understanding why consistently denouncing the legitimacy of print media in an era of conspiracy theory (especially post pizza-gate) may matter.<p>&gt;&gt; [Facebook and Twitter] had to start censoringâ€¦because journalists at CNN and NBC and The New York Times demanded they do so.<p>I feel like making any of these arguments without mentioning the capitol riots is somewhat a bad-faith narrative.<p>&gt;&gt; [Seems to be arguing that millenials care about free speech less because they are coddled]<p>I&#x27;m not even gonna touch that one.<p>&gt;&gt; They began to censor because journalists demanded they do so, in part because journalists are authoritarians who believe that the modes of information [should be] regulated by them and by others. That&#x27;s just unfortunately the modern-day mentality of the journalist.<p>If he hadn&#x27;t slipped the word authoritarian in there, I think this might be the most interesting point of the piece. I think a lot of people, including journalists, scientific journals, textbooks, wikipedia, even HN believe in rating&#x2F;filtering information on its quality (is it true?, is it divisive?, does it have an agenda?). In fact, the filtering&#x2F;amplifying of information is the primary job of such platforms.<p>As far as I can tell, pre-internet conspiracy-theorists and demagogues never had a guaranteed platform. We tried a great experiment letting anybody say anything with amplification of the masses. Based on the results of the great experiment (Qanon, Trump presidency, &quot;stop the steal&quot;, capitol riots)  people want to pull back to the tried-and-true pre-web-2.0 journalism (i.e. gatekeepers).<p>This is where a good-faith exploration would really be interesting.<p>&gt;&gt; [Seems to insinuate that the NYT doesn&#x27;t believe in whistleblowers like Snowden.]<p>I hope that&#x27;s not true.')
