Not a commentary on gitlab in particular necessarily, but if someone is screwing you behind closed doors vs doing it openly which is worse? Should you not criticize?<p>I think transparency is so highly promoted by the managerial class and their media because by appearing to have a certain kind of ethics and virtue that do not impact the bottom line, it allows them to rationalize their actions to themselves or to others.<p>For example, if a powerful person performs an action in the open that is kind of sneaky and underhanded and no one says anything because they&#x27;re afraid, then to the powerful person it seems like it&#x27;s A-OK.<p>That said, I prefer transparency to opacity because without information you are blind and have to criticize the lack of information rather than material conditions.')
