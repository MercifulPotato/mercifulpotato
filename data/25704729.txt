It can be cathartic to write out your frustrations.  But HN isn&#x27;t the place for that.  Comments like that, even though they _feel_ like they contribute to something, tend to really just be selfish and don&#x27;t contribute to discussion.  Political threads on HN get filled with 1000s of such comments, and none of them lead to _interesting_ discussion.  Interesting, thoughtful discussion is what we&#x27;re after, and what we tend to see more of here than other places.  That&#x27;s what I, and I believe the majority of users here, come here for.<p>I&#x27;ve personally been frustrated by the recent political threads, not because I don&#x27;t want to see those threads here, but because I desperately want the comments to say something _interesting_.  Something thoughtful that I can&#x27;t get elsewhere (from the news or Reddit).  But about an hour after such articles show up they&#x27;re so bloated only a single thread of comments is visible per page, making it too difficult to navigate and find any useful discussion that might be happening.<p>In other words, HN isn&#x27;t our personal emotional outlet.  It can be used for that _occasionally_, but since _everyone_ uses it for that under certain topics like politics, it&#x27;s best to avoid doing so there.')
