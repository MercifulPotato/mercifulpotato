If you&#x27;re not familiar, they&#x27;re supposed to live in creepy dark houses, and in black and white, the houses do indeed look dark and creepy.<p>But in reality, those sets were bright pastels.  Actual dark walls and floors didn&#x27;t show up well on film.  Which makes me wonder how right we are with some of our other colorizations.<p>You can google [what did the munsters set actually look like] to get some great examples.')
