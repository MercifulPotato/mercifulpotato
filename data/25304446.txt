It&#x27;s not a one size fits all social media site, its meant for tech and startup discussion. Plus, people don&#x27;t seem to reward stupid puns, pithy comments, twitter style &quot;hot takes&quot;, begging for upvotes, etc.. I would hope this keeps HN somewhat inoculated from becoming another Reddit.')
