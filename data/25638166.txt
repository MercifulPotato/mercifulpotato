E.g. Leroy Hood who developed the first automated DNA sequencer, and Mike Hunkapiller who led the commercial development of the technology at Applied Biosystems to the point where it was practical to sequence the whole genome. Hunkapiller was also the impetus behind the formation of Celera, though Venter was its leader.')
