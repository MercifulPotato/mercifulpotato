Item(by='jedberg', descendants=None, kids=[25874838], score=None, time=1611336899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873690, text='&gt; If you only drive far once in a while, then i think an ev is fine... you can always rent&#x2F;take a train&#x2F;miss a flight... might be worth it to save the planet :)<p>Not a lot of people live that close to a transit station.  That&#x27;s why they have to drive a long distance.<p>&gt; a model s with supercharging only adds about 1.5 x on a really long trip (less if you stop overnight every 8 hrs as you should anyway)<p>I have two adults, we trade off.  We can easily drive 16+ hours in a day.<p>Also, even on a short trip it adds a lot of time.  I can make it from my house in NorCal to my parents in SoCal in just under five hours without stopping, but there is no Tesla that can make the whole drive on one charge.  I&#x27;d have to stop for at least 45 minutes extra (that&#x27;s a 15% increase).<p>I still want to go all electric, and plan to do so as soon as someone makes a fully electric minivan, but I&#x27;m not going to downplay the inconvenience of electric.')
