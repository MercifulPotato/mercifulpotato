It was a group that asked about the best pizza in town and pointed out when the high school was putting on a play.  To say it caught the mods off-guard would be an understatement.<p>Mods had to step in and save the day, but it basically requires someone to watch the service 24&#x2F;7 during heated times as the threads blow up quickly.  They don&#x27;t take days or weeks to warm up.  It just takes an active community and some catalyst event.<p>This was effectively just a forum.  It happened in a FB group, but could have just as easily been some local dude hosting a phpbb forum.  Same thing.<p>So this is the thing I keep coming back to: why would anyone ever dip their toes in user-created content if 230 is changed&#x2F;repealed?  It&#x27;s all risk at that point, especially for folks who would aren&#x27;t quitting their day job for it.<p>Or to put another way, with 230 as it is, Trump can&#x27;t use twitter&#x2F;fb&#x2F;etc, but he can spin up his own phpbb and start his own community there.  Why isn&#x27;t that ok?')
