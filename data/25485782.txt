The posts that I mean are about &quot;look how we handled the load for a moderately active web-app which is 90% cacheable with only five nodes in our k8s cluster&quot;.<p>I really don&#x27;t know why that is, my guess would be that few people have really built something beginning to end with the most boring tech possible (start out with PHP+MySQL like everyone did 15 years ago). Or they always operate at levels of abstraction where everything is slow, so they have simply gotten used to it, like their text-editor not running smooth unless it&#x27;s on an i9, because the text-editor now is a pile of abstractions running on top of Electron when vim was able to run smooth decades ago. It&#x27;s sad and both an opportunity at the same time, because you can be the one with the correct gut feeling of &quot;This should really be doable with a single machine, if not we&#x27;re doing something fundamentally wrong&quot;.')
