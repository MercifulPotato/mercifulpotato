Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25833697], score=None, time=1611058959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829250, text='&gt; I do not see any issues telling doctors that they are prescribing the wrong medication because you may know it better than them.<p>If you&#x27;re not comfortable with a medication&#x27;s potential side effects I do think it&#x27;s worth bringing it up (I&#x27;m not a doctor, just an occasional patient) but it really comes down to how it&#x27;s phrased.<p>There&#x27;s a very big difference between:<p><i>&quot;Actually propranolol won&#x27;t work for me because after Googling around I discovered one of the side effects makes me feel anxious, can we try atenolol or nebivolol based on what I read online?&quot;</i><p>vs.<p><i>&quot;I know Googling for medical advice is sketchy but I read one of the side effects of propranolol is brain fog and this really concerns me because my job remains that I stay sharp. I trust your diagnosis and I know just because a side effect is listed I&#x27;m not guaranteed to have it, but are there any other beta blockers that we can start with that don&#x27;t have this side effect and will still work?</i><p>There&#x27;s a lot of very carefully selected phrases in the 2nd way of saying the same statement.<p>- Admission that Googling for medical issues isn&#x27;t usually a good idea on its own to take actionable advice on<p>- You bring up a valid concern about one of the side effects<p>- Saying &quot;diagnosis&quot; vs &quot;advice&quot; is respectful of their decision (&quot;advice&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot; are a bit demeaning because it discredits their decision)<p>- You call out that you know not all side effects will come true (you come off as someone who isn&#x27;t just blindly Googling stuff, this raises your credibility)<p>- You name drop &quot;beta blockers&quot; which shows you&#x27;ve done a decent amount of research<p>- You let them take the reigns and offer alternative medication, giving them a chance to maybe pick the ones you&#x27;ve researched<p>- You close things out as being optimistic by saying &quot;and will still work&quot; rather than questioning their decision before they give it by saying &quot;think it will work&quot;<p>If I said the 2nd wording to a doctor and they denied my request without even discussing it then I&#x27;d leave and look for a 2nd opinion. Asking people questions without demeaning them is a great way to get an honest look at how someone operates.')
