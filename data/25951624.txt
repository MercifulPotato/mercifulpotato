Valve implemented a system to detect these patterns and discard the ratings. Valve had no particular stake in the games being &quot;bombed&quot;, but they do have a stake in the trust people have in their platform. People want to know if a game is truly good or bad and not have to wonder if it was the victim of some kind of vendetta.<p>At the time no one strongly protested the move by Valve, but in the context of this situation with Google, Robinhood, and WSB it seems to have hit a particular nerve.')
