A web dev (laravel &#x2F; php), but totally burned out, to the point I can&#x27;t focus on freelancing hardly at all. Depression has been raging in me all year, and I feel bleak about it ending soon.<p>The only time I come out of my haze is when I work on side projects or think about ways to change the world by creating some sort of dual-power healthcare union co-op that basically is medicare for all without gov&#x27;t control. However, having been 3 months since my last client, I&#x27;m struggling to put food on the table, let alone work on social good projects.<p>if I had 400k, I&#x27;d invest that so I could live off dividends, then work with other left-leaning programmers to figure out ways to build non-statist programs for UBI and Healthcare.<p>I had to crowdfund this month&#x27;s rent and Christmas presents for my two children (under 4). So, financial strain is kind of sucking the life out of me too...<p>i definitely have empathy, in that i&#x27;ve had good months, years, and bad ones. So, I&#x27;ve been at both ends of spectrum, though never earned &gt; 100k before, i&#x27;ve lived comfortable enough for me. I also want to devote the remainder of my life to helping others, and finally start my non-profit&#x2F;union&#x2F;co-op endeavor to build a true sharing economy. Where workers and consumers own the companies they work at and buy goods from, and execs do not get compensated above a decent multiplier of the average worker salary. (Voted on by said workers).')
