I&#x27;m looking forward to giving it a try. My problem with Roll20 and Astral isn&#x27;t that they don&#x27;t have enough features, it&#x27;s that they have lots of features and really want me to use them, when all I want to do is drag tokens around on a grid my players can see while we use pen and paper for the rest.')
