It&#x27;s assumed that a human has read and selected the letter to the editor, which is why they&#x27;d have liability. For the promoted tweet, my first reaction would be to say, if a human affirmatively promoted it, they&#x27;d be liable. If it&#x27;s pure algorithm, they wouldn&#x27;t be if they took it down when served a notice.')
