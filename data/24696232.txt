Do you dispute that this would give them a profound disadvantage in basketball, all else equal? The narrative of all races being functionally the same phenotypically is prima facie absurd as even the most simplistic armchair observation reveals. Anyone who denies that Korean people have a genetic distadvantage in basketball must be acting in bad faith, and if they agree that they are disadvantaged in basketball then they agree with the premise that genetics of racial groups do play an important role in determining over- or under-performance in particular domains.<p>I never ascribed African dominance to sports in general, only running. Presumably the genetics required for elite swimming performance differ to those required for elite running performance, since they are completely different sports.<p>&gt; This is a lie, and you know it<p>Absolutely not. It is an exaggeration, but very much is broadly true. All 100m men&#x27;s champions at the Olympics going back to 1984 have been of African descent. If my hypothesis is correct, we would expect their dominance \nto only continue and increase especially as they are given more economic opportunity, but time will tell.<p>Notably, there are 0 Asian champions going back to the 1800s. Is this just a total coincidence in your worldview? Or is it purely a cultural phenomenon, and if so, do you have any evidence whatsoever for this, or merely a bare assertion?<p>&gt; However, that does not necessarily translates to any culturally meaningful broads characterizations.<p>The extent to which this is true is an open question, the only thing I&#x27;m sure of is that it&#x27;s not going to be addressed honestly because of how politically charged it is.')
