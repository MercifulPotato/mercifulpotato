Levels and encounters are semi randomized, and you can buy items that stack idefinitly. Enemies get stronger with time so you need to be fast and activate the portal to the next level. But when you do that too early you won&#x27;t be able to kill the boss that shows up while the portal is charging. If you die you start from beginning.<p>Risk of Rain 1 was the same only in 2D. Both are totally recommended for people who like shooters, challenging games and such.')
