How you personally justify having pink hair not being a &quot;culture fit&quot; to yourself doesn&#x27;t change anything about that. What it does change however is that you now no longer have to explain that you&#x27;re not hiring someone for their hair color.<p>There&#x27;s no need to invent hypotheticals, by the way. The people I&#x27;ve heard asking how they can stop getting denied for &quot;culture fit&quot; in interviews have one thing in common and it&#x27;s being &gt;40 years old or a woman.')
