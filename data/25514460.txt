Item(by='wolrah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608698512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506750, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the second sentence but you can&#x27;t use most appliances made for Europe in America and vice versa. Most electronic appliances depend on the input voltage and supplying 240V can easily cause a fire.<p>Here in America &quot;electronic appliances&quot; would imply the tech&#x2F;gadget category like TVs or computers where &quot;electrical appliances&quot; would be the big household equipment.  Just to clarify in case that confuses anyone else like it did me, it kind of reverses the meaning of what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>Anyways, at least with relatively modern gear you can generally assume that anything with batteries or USB ports runs off a switch-mode power supply, and all but the cheapest of those will happily accept pretty much anything resembling residential power.<p>Anything with a large motor or any kind of resistive element (lighting, heating) on the other hand is almost certainly built for a specific variety of electrical service and will likely require modification to accept anything else without releasing the magic smoke.<p>The stuff in between those categories, well, RTFLabel.  Outside of audio and ham radio gear I&#x27;d imagine most DC stuff runs on switch mode power supplies these days.')
