Boeing basically made a terribly unsafe plane and put a watchdog to prevent it from crashing too often to make it embarrassing. I will refuse flying 737 MAX even if they implement 100 watchdogs and give every passenger a parachute. Such an outrageous contempt to human&#x27;s life out of corporate greed could not be justified.')
