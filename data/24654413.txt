Never had a problem with latches or straps (well, other than yesterday, when I had to take it out to fold down the seats &amp; transport a piece of furniture).  The car seat stays in the car, the kid plops down in the car seat, and then he either fights us over the 5-point harness or buckles it himself, depending on mood.<p>I think the big difference in perspective is whether you just leave the car seat in the car or take it out for every trip.  I had a similar discussion on Facebook where I was like &quot;Why does it matter how heavy the car seat is?  It just stays in the car?&quot; and then found out that a lot of people detach the carseats and lug them up to the house and back down every time they take a trip.<p>There&#x27;s an element of privilege in being able to afford a complete set of car seats for each car you drive, but it totals about $300&#x2F;kid (less for infants - many infant seats have a clickable base that&#x27;s ~$100).  If you can afford it I would highly recommend it - paying $300 to avoid daily skinned knuckles &amp; schlepping 20-30 lbs. around is often well worth it.')
