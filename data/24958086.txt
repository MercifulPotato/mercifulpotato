By learning things with it?<p>The author of the article is specifically struggling with his evangelism. He says he thinks the world would be a better place if everyone used spaced repetition. I don&#x27;t know (can&#x27;t imagine honestly) what sort of utopia he envisions, but he needs to show instead of tell. Just like I need to.<p>It&#x27;s so insanely hard to lead people. I think the only thing that works is to lead by example. Any sort of talking is just fluff. You have to show people how to accomplish or attain something they care about.<p>As for SR itself... for decades we&#x27;ve had some of the smartest people (and perhaps even some of the best educators) like Richard Feynman decry rote memorization in the classroom. SR takes the worst 8th grade history class you ever had and doubles down on it. You can choose what to memorize, but it&#x27;s still just memorization. Why not use a personal knowledge base (== your Anki deck) that you can refer to, and let your memory naturally cache the things you commonly use?<p>If you have a problem and you&#x27;re considering SR as a way to solve it, my advice is to really drill down into what the problem is. Why do you think you need to fill your brain with snippets of data? (If you&#x27;re just trying to pass a test, then sure, use Anki.)')
