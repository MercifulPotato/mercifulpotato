Our idea is to use a cloud-as-a-service provider and only spin up game server instances as users request them. Thus a user can boot up a game server (e.g. Minecraft&#x2F;Killing Floor&#x2F;etc) anywhere in the world and only pay for the minutes it&#x27;s online.<p>We&#x27;ll charge the same as the cloud provider charges us, plus a small percentage to cover the overhead of storing game server config, running the admin console, etc.<p>From initial research we estimate charging a price of $0.05 per hour for a 20-player Minecraft or standard KF2 server. This works out to be much more than the pay-per-month equivalent, but we only expect usage for short bursts like on some nights or over weekends which should leave users with bills well under our competitors&#x27;.<p>Would you use such a service? Would you prefer it to the normal pay-per-month providers out there? What criticisms do you have of the setup?')
