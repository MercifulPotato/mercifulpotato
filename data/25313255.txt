Eating them as a show of bravado is a tourist thing I think (probably inspired by articles like these), here we eat them because we think they’re good. They’re in season now if you happen to be in Japan.<p>It’s no different from eating oyster. Sure they <i>might</i> kill you, but you don’t expect to be called brave for stuffing yourself at an oyster bar. You eat oysters because you like eating oysters, nothing more, nothing less. The same with fugu.')
