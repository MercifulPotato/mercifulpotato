As the pace of technological innovation increases, and vendor competition increases along with it, absolute prices in BTC terms will go down even assuming everyone already transacts in BTC exclusively. Higher amount of available products&#x2F;services, same amount of money, equals lower absolute prices. Assuming 1% annual &quot;growth&quot;, that&#x27;s 1% you gain. This isn&#x27;t outside the bounds of inflation policies today, and keep in mind those inflation targets skim off the top after haircutting GDP growth — a 1% inflation in an economy expanding by 2% equals the central bank skims the 2% growth plus expands by 1%. In a Bitcoin world, that would be 3% gains for simply holding onto your coins.<p>As such a deflationary global currency could cause a global economic slowdown, which might be completely necessary to save the planet&#x27;s natural ecosystems.')
