That BMW was a used 2011 328i with a manual transmission. <i>Great</i> car and if I had kept it like you suggest I would have been smart. But I had to buy some other dumb used cars before I learned my lesson. Now I’m rocking a used ‘08 M3 to drive into the ground. Put 50k miles on it. Looking forward to the next 100k.')
