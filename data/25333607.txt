Being able to cancel a single merchant&#x27;s card without affecting anything else in your life is a net-positive.<p>Virtual cards are also good for the customer outside of general fraud, such as when you might have a stingy business that only cancels subscriptions over the phone or whatnot; the only downside is that technically the business can send those charges to collections, but even then most small collections charges aren&#x27;t considered in credit decisions.')
