Believe me I would love if XPath was improved because maybe I might see ads for developers with advanced XPath again and I could increase my rates.<p>However I don&#x27;t think it has ever been stated  before that this is what Chrome would like. As such I think it falls under the rubric &quot;Things everybody knows but nobody says&quot;, which generally nobody says these things because nobody wants to go through the onerous work of dealing with the implications. But as it has been said I start to wonder what those implications are&#x2F;would be.<p>SVG has already been mentioned in the linked thread, I don&#x27;t know if that is actually a problem because I don&#x27;t know if SVG has been implemented using libxml in Chrome, I could totally see a point not to implement SVG with that - but then again I could see that if you have libxml and you need to implement the SVG DOM, maybe you use libxml to do it - so does getting rid of libxml impact SVG in Chrome?<p>Obviously applications working with RSS and other associated feed formats in the browser would probably stop to work. Of course people could write applications for these formats on the server, but it certainly seems a setback for RSS.<p>The same thing applies for RDF, and linked data applications running client side. Not many I know but hey, a nail in the coffin as it were.<p>MathML - which has never been implemented by Chrome has client side implementations, for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pshihn.github.io&#x2F;math-ml&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pshihn.github.io&#x2F;math-ml&#x2F;</a> I wonder if these would continue working, I would guess probably not.<p>What about XHTML, is anything there part of the Chrome XML stack - for example DTDs?<p>I can think of a few other things, but this seems like a reasonable start to think of what the implications would be.')
