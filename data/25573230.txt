If we reduce case count sufficiently that we can stop quarantining, that improves mental health, and case count should be pretty strongly correlated with death and long-term effects.<p>In the case of rolling out vaccination, are you suggesting we do something differently? Is there any difference between optimizing for minimizing cases and minimizing those other things in a vaccine rollout? In my mind, to optimize for any of those things, you&#x27;d roll out vaccines asap.')
