I enjoy it quite a bit. It&#x27;s very easy to add a new entity (table) and some screens for CRUD stuff. Even without code you can customise quite a bit, but there&#x27;s always Java (server) and JavaScript (client) actions. Nevertheless, as with many frameworks, it gets awkward when you move too far away from the &#x27;intended use cases&#x27;.<p>However, I do think that you still need a dev mindset, with dev experience, to use it well. Principles like DRY, loose coupling, code organisation, consistent and informative naming, concise logic, etc adhere just as well. Those hard to transfer skills you build up over time. Although a junior may get things working very quickly, keeping things maintainable and extendable is just as hard, or even harder.')
