While Lua as a language works perfectly for me, it will be pretty difficult to compile to WASM as part of a Rust project.<p>The two most mature embeddable Rust scripting languages at the moment seem to be Gluon and Rhai. Gluon, unlike Rhai and Lua, is inspired by Haskell and OCaml and highly functional. On the other hand, Rhai is pretty much a Rusty looking version of Lua from my first impressions.<p>I&#x27;m pretty heavily leaning towards Rhai at the moment since I need the scripting language for SIMple Physics to be easy for beginners with no programming experience to pick up for ultra basic applications, but I think Gluon is pretty unique. I&#x27;d assume that simple imperative languages are just better for embedding since they&#x27;re often just used to send commands, but I wonder if I&#x27;m just close-minded since I&#x27;ve been using Lua.')
