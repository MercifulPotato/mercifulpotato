I understand that there might be situations in which such a style is appropriate, but this article is just very annoying to read. I would not definitely not call it &quot;good writing&quot;.<p>The kind of &quot;clarity&quot; presented here as good writing works well if you assume that everything that can be thought can be directly expressed in words, without substantial loss. This is clearly not the case. Language is a very poor medium to transmit throughts and feelings. So the &quot;trick&quot; every good writer uses is this: don&#x27;t describe something directly, but instead try to construct some secondary clues, hints and a general atmosphere that will start a thought process <i>in the reader&#x27;s mind</i> which leads to the conclusions you want to bring across. This is the poetic approach, it could also simply be called &quot;writing between the lines&quot;. You need beautiful prose, rhythm and images to do that, as those open up this additional dimension (the article leaves it pedantically closed).<p>In my experience, this approach is a much more effective transmitter of ideas than trying to describe them directly, for the simple reason that the reader will assume subconsiously that it is <i>his own idea</i>.')
