Item(by='TimBurr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608394180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476864, text='One more angle - competition &amp; nationalism.<p>The 737 Max and A320neo are direct competitors. The A320neo was announced 6 months before the 737 Max in 2011, and both were certified for flight in March 2017. (Give or take - the A320neo has a few variants.)<p>Back when the 737 was first grounded, initial investigation found that Boeing and the FAA cooperated to rush the 737 into service to beat the A320neo [1,2].<p>The FAA has every incentive to make sure that American companies, especially large ones like Boeing, are treated favorably. Even outside of donations or smells of corruption, Boeing is a major employer and S&amp;P500 member. If Boeing does well, our economic metrics (employment&#x2F;stocks) do well, and the lawmakers who regulate the FAA are happy.<p>Those same incentives appeared in the FAA&#x27;s refusal to ground the Max for days after the second crash. (First crash was 8&#x2F;29&#x2F;18; second was 3&#x2F;10&#x2F;19; grounded 3&#x2F;13&#x2F;19)[3]<p>I suspect we&#x27;re seeing a replay of the original certification. As soon as the 737 Max is recertified, all those grounded planes can get back to making a profit, and Boeing can go back to making them.<p>Not how it should work, but the recertification effort seems consistent with how Boeing and the FAA acted in the initial certification. It&#x27;s not right, but the same incentives still exist.<p>Just my $0.02.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-aerospace&#x2F;failed-certification-faa-missed-safety-issues-in-the-737-max-system-implicated-in-the-lion-air-crash&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;boeing-aerospace&#x2F;faile...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;congress-faa-boeing-oversight-1287902" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;congress-faa-boein...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;702936894&#x2F;ethiopian-pilot-had-problems-with-boeing-737-max-8-flight-controls-he-wasnt-alon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;13&#x2F;702936894&#x2F;ethiopian-pilot-had...</a>')
