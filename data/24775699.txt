One thing in common to all ruling communist parties was establishing party members as a full-frills ruling class with their own schools, institutions, culture, etc.<p>For my own &quot;philosophy,&quot; I make a distinction between ideology and idealism. &quot;Ideology&quot; (in my personal lexicon) is to ideology as Orwell&#x27;s &quot;nationalism&quot; was to nationalism.<p>An ideal (a capitalist one) is Adam Smith&#x27;s pin factory or village economy. Maybe Ayn Rand&#x27;s dissenting heros like Howard Roark or Hank Rearden.<p>An ideological take is to justify a fb or a google by insisting these are like a Smithian pin factory. Explaining good stuff in those term. Explaining bad stuff in terms of government (looters) involvement. Facebook&#x27;s profits and market cap are reflective of the immense value that they provide society.<p>An idealistic take is criticising fb because the aren&#x27;t like a Smithian pin factory at all. In fact, they prevent such pin factories from existing.<p>It&#x27;s notable that an idealistic posture is easier and more common from a dissenting position. A ideological posture tends to be easier and more common in a defensive, incumbent position. That&#x27;s probably why Ayn Rand reads as idealistic (despite being formulaically ideological) while modern \npro-capitalists tend to come off as more ideological. Rosa Luxemburg the idealist vs Leon Trotsky, the ideologue.<p>IMO, you can&#x27;t deal in absolutes. FB is easy to pick on because they are so unimpressive technically or operationally. FB could literally be done on 1% of its budget. Google is a mixed bag, because they do have technical achievements. But, what makes google their money is search and adware.<p>Tesla&#x2F;Musk are an even more complex example. Musk is as close to a Randian hero as reality can offer. Obvious technical and operational achievements. Real, genuine risk taking. So far so good. The ideal does not appear to be trampled.<p>But... what happens if recent investors are right? What if Tesla&#x27;s data is giving them an unassailable edge in self driving cars for a generation. Does that give us a capitalist ideal of innovation, competition and efficiency or a capitalist antipattern of control, monopoly and lock-in?<p>Reality is complex ideals are simple. Ideology is an attempt to square the circle by insisting on its squareness.')
