Netflix may be shooting themselves in the foot a bit here, but  frankly I much prefer &quot;too many series are cancelled before hitting their stride&quot; where the shortsighted decision is being made based only on viewership and budget, than the previous situation where  cancelled shows never developed an audience due to being broadcast in a bad time slot, or because they were repeatedly <i>bumped</i> from their time slot[0] (eg. by sporting events going into overtime) with missed episodes never repeated, or by episodes being shown out of order[1].<p>At least now shows are cancelled based on their intrinsic viewership. Short-sighted cancelations are still an unfortunate problem, but this is still a huge improvement over the previous status quo.<p>A bit more concerning to me is that Netflix&#x27;s &quot;throw the spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks&quot; approach is starting to lean a bit more in the direction of &quot;same but different&quot; clones of other shows with a twist to the setup, even for shows based on existing properties.<p>But, so it goes.<p>[0] eg. Dark Skies<p>[1] eg. Firefly, where the pilot wasn&#x27;t broadcast until the end of the season.')
