Item(by='rmrfstar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610339575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715624, text='&gt; I hope that law firms far and wide encourage their associates and partners alike to update their knowledge with this<p>&quot;But most of all, the legal profession has failed. Democratic governance depends upon responsible individuals throughout the entire system who understand and uphold the law, not who understand and exploit it. On average, lawyers have become so deeply corrupt that it is imperative for major changes in the profession to take place, far beyond the meek proposals already on the table. To start, the term “legal ethics,” upon which codes of conduct and licensure are nominally based, has become an oxymoron. Mossack Fonseca did not work in a vacuum—despite repeated fines and documented regulatory violations, it found allies and clients at major law firms in virtually every nation. If the industry’s shattered economics were not already evidence enough, there is now no denying that lawyers can no longer be permitted to regulate one another. It simply doesn’t work. Those able to pay the most can always find a lawyer to serve their ends, whether that lawyer is at Mossack Fonseca or another firm of which we remain unaware. What about the rest of society?<p>The collective impact of these failures has been a complete erosion of ethical standards, ultimately leading to a novel system we still call Capitalism, but which is tantamount to economic slavery. In this system—our system—the slaves are unaware both of their status and of their masters, who exist in a world apart where the intangible shackles are carefully hidden amongst reams of unreachable legalese. The horrific magnitude of detriment to the world should shock us all awake. But when it takes a whistleblower to sound the alarm, it is cause for even greater concern. It signals that democracy’s checks and balances have all failed, that the breakdown is systemic, and that severe instability could be just around the corner. So now is the time for real action, and that starts with asking questions.&quot; [1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;panama-papers&#x2F;20160506-john-doe-statement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icij.org&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;panama-papers&#x2F;20160506-j...</a>')
