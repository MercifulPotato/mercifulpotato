Cows or pigs don&#x27;t have the same history of domestication to be companions. Dogs share a special bond with humans and a special place in our society. Rightly or wrongly, and admittedly cows and pigs suffer to certainly the same extent that any factory farmed animal suffers, dogs serve a different purpose.<p>Given this history and bond, to eat or put dogs in danger is in my mind almost as morally objectionable as putting a person in grievous danger against their will.')
