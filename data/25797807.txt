Ruby desugars += and similar compound operators into separate operate and assign steps. There&#x27;s no need for an implementation of += in addition to +. I&#x27;m sure Lua could do the same thing.<p>My guess for why Lua doesn&#x27;t provide a table copy function is because then they&#x27;d have to decide whether to provide shallow or deep copies, and deep copies have to do cycle detection and other such stuff. Then there&#x27;s metatables, functions, and so on.')
