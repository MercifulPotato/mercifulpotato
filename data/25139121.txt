Yes, technology in of itself is not the issue, it is the highly addictive nature of certain software, but on different devices, limiting what they can&#x2F;can&#x27;t do is very difficult.<p>When school started online, my 8 year old was initially really engaged, but then started getting a bit bored once she got into it, and would watch Youtube videos.  I was fine with an hour after she finished her school work, but the time she spent watching slowly increased until she wasn&#x27;t even doing her homework.  She&#x27;d erase the history on her browser so I couldn&#x27;t tell how long she was watching for (but fortunately I know the tricks, and was able to figure it out). This led me to blocking Youtube (and all other video sites) on the router.  I looked into Youtube kids, but I can&#x27;t limit it in the ways I want (certain times of day, certain videos), and so I just outright ban it.  I also found Youtube too addictive with its short videos, and so now only allow Netflix Kids at certain times.<p>The best solution IMO would be that I could say something like &quot;these apps&#x2F;sites need my permission&quot;, and then every time she tried watching a video or opening that app, etc, I&#x27;d get a notification on <i>my</i> phone asking if I should allow it.  That would really put the control in the parent&#x27;s hands.  Could apply to tik tok too - I may be OK with it if my kid has to get permission to post a video, and get permission after every 20 mins of use&#x2F;watching 20 videos.<p>Until such controls are available, I just saying a blanket &#x27;no&#x27; to some of these apps&#x2F;sites.  She can use them how she sees fit once she&#x27;s emancipated.')
