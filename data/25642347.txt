It sharpens the pain to about a weeks worth of headaches and just being FLAT, but then I seem to be fine.<p>However, I find when I quit over longish periods (months), i start to lose my focus at work, and become quite scatterbrained and not really productive.  I probably would have been some form of ADHD when I was a kid, and in the real world, it seems caffeine keeps me on track and productive (and probably most importantly, motivated) when sitting in a chair and staring at a monitor all day... without the coffee, I&#x27;m just scatterbrained and not getting work done....  If my day job were different, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need all the caffeine... I dont usually have sleep problems if I cut myself off by 2 or 3 pm... and I don&#x27;t usually have more than 2 cups&#x2F;day.<p>It probably doesn&#x27;t help that I love the taste of coffee...')
