Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604895748, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023680, text='&gt; permanently separate immigrant children from their parents<p>&quot;Permanently&quot; is a new one on me, even Trump-haters don&#x27;t go that far.  This whole thing is about a temporary measure while confirming that the adults with the children really are their parents, and not some random person smuggling children across the border.<p>The system is backlogged so it&#x27;s definitely taking much longer than it should, but not permanently unless it&#x27;s found the adult and child aren&#x27;t related.')
