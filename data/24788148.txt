Stories from any cable news network are regularly full of major holes, which you overlook when they&#x27;re on &quot;your side&quot; because you&#x27;re not invested in finding fault with them.<p>Stephen Colbert&#x27;s perception of reality has a known liberal bias.<p>&gt; And homelessness is a weird metric to use as it is partially a by product of regional economic success, where a good job market coupled with an overheated housing market results in an increasing number of people willing to tough it out on the streets or in their cars.<p>But the overheated housing market <i>is</i> the criticism, and is completely valid. California is correctly criticized for letting housing costs get so bad that people who are making twice the US median income are nonetheless sleeping in their cars.<p>And California may be the worst, but it is actually a problem which is more severe in blue states than red states on average. Housing costs more in NYC than Austin, and more in Chicago than Charlotte, despite having a <i>lower</i> median income.<p>So sticking to the &quot;narratives&quot; doesn&#x27;t get you there. It causes you to ignore the problems in your own back yard. You have to look at the facts, even when they&#x27;re inconvenient, and admit it when it&#x27;s your team making a mistake.')
