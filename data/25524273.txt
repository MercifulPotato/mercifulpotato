I would expect the definition of synchronous to be the exact opposite; i.e., a synchronous function must block the caller until the function has finished executing. For that matter, what is &quot;regular logic&quot;? The name implies there is some sort of &quot;irregular logic&quot; to contrast it with.<p>I get the feeling that the writing may be unclear because the concepts are themselves not well-defined.')
