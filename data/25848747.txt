The work laptop is supplied by my employer and as far as I&#x27;m concerned they can install whatever they damn well please on it, because the only thing I use it for, and I mean the only thing, is work - no Internet searches, no random software downloads, not even HN.  A patch of tape over the camera and away we go.<p>My personal laptop stays personal. It&#x27;s mine and doesn&#x27;t belong to anyone else.  I never use it for work, even if alongside me during working hours.  Zero crapware, minimal AV.<p>I have the same approach to phones.  There&#x27;s my phone, and my work phone.  I was pressured to put Outlook, Teams on my personal phone since my work phone is switched off out of hours - I nearly succumbed, until that Office Portal app wanted to &#x27;manage my device&#x27;.  Nope.  Our primary on-call comms mechanism remains SMS&#x2F;direct call.')
