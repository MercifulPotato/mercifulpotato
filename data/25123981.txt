It&#x27;s not really used, compilers only emit it when code asks for a long double.<p>Personally, I do think they should have banned x87 from 64bit code. But it wouldn&#x27;t have allowed them to remove the x87 units from the chip, as every AMD64 chip to this day still supports 32bit compatibility mode, and regularly uses it.')
