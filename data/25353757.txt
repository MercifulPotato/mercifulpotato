Nevertheless:<p>- Being able to choose between dozens of memory managed and open source programming languages without having to think too much about performance or memory usage<p>- The ability to comfortably do in memory what previously could not even fit on a hard disk<p>- Doing anything with (compressed) video in realtime<p>- Deployment and distribution of software to a global audience of users, using a broad range of device types, screen sizes and processor architectures, all in fractions of a second<p>- Setting up servers and fully managed platforms, data stores and databases at the touch of a button<p>- Full text search in a global database containing all documentation for any available software, including millions of Q&amp;A articles, in a fraction of a second<p>- The ability to use a variety of third-party online services for automated billing, monitoring, mailing, streaming, analytics, testing and machine learning<p>- ...<p>You could probably continue this list for a long time and find many more such improvements that have been made in the past 30 years. If you could find just a dozen of such improvements, each giving you just a 20 percent productivity advantage, you would already have a compound 10x improvement.<p>By the way, I think to make a fair comparison, we should not compare what is mainstream today with what was leading edge in 1990, but with what was mainstream in 1990. The difference between leading edge and mainstream is 10 years or more; so the question <i>&quot;What could you do in 1990&quot;</i> should be <i>&quot;What was typical in 1990&quot;</i>.')
