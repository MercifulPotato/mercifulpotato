Off to a good start.<p>&gt; Yes you’ll build a car, but it’ll be wildly less efficient and strictly worse than all alternatives.<p>The first electric light bulb was certainly less efficient than candles or oil lamps. The first airplanes could barely carry the pilot. Should we give up work on new technology simply because the current iteration is not better than the status quo? What a lame attitude.<p>&gt; That eliminates a good 90% of crypto currencies by market cap.<p>You said it yourself. Market cap is a bullshit metric from the perspective of the technology. Irrelevant to the argument.<p>What <i>is</i> relevant is that a good number of these different currencies are trying different approaches to solve different problems, or trying to implement different financial models, different levels of centralizations&#x2F;trust, and so on. For every aspect of Bitcoin that you criticized, there has been a different project that tries to overcome that. Yet, you completely ignore it just because it is easier to look at what is wrong in the present instead of working to fix things for the future.<p>&gt; Permissionless and irreversible are not things humans want or benefit from<p>Contradicted by the amount of people putting their time, energy and money on. <i>YOU</i> don&#x27;t want it, fine. <i>YOU</i> don&#x27;t speak for everyone.<p>&gt;  North Korea, ransomware, money laundering.<p>FUD and bullshit. Do you blame the use of petrol for enabling Al-Qaeda or left-wing dictatorships in Venezuela? You are very well aware that money laundering already existed before crypto. Have you renounced your use of banking systems because of all the drug and weapon traffickers that used HSBC to launder money for so long?<p>Criminal activity and the need for spending resources in security is never going to go away.<p>&gt; Decentralized prevents the currency from responding to externalities like births, and deaths, and pandemics.<p>Okay, that&#x27;s the third statement based on the current implementation. Hat-trick!<p>&gt; The reality is trust is a huge optimization.<p>Definitely! No serious person would challenge that. No serious person would also challenge that systems that are too optimized are more likely to fail in unpredictable ways and collapse after Black Swans.<p>This is why decentralization is important. It&#x27;s not about efficiency, it&#x27;s about hedging bets to improve our chance of surviving catastrophes.<p>&gt; has yet to, in 12 years, do anything better than what’s out there today<p>That&#x27;s FOUR! This kid is on fire...<p>&gt; There’s no such thing, we live in a society.<p><i>Societies</i>. Plural. To be honest, I am more concerned about people that want to establish an &quot;universal&quot; society than I fear all of the scammers that try to exploit people in crypto.')
