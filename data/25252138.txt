Item(by='senko', descendants=None, kids=[25252408], score=None, time=1606728525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252003, text='&gt; For generations, craftsmen who have dedicated themselves to the art of their craft have existed. Almost all have &quot;worked for someone else&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt; When we only had months of runway left in the bank, there was no work-life balance. We had to work around the clock so that our company could survive. When we were behind on our big product launch, when weâ€™re behind on our revenue goals, when we released nasty bugs to our users, or when our servers were down, there was no work-life balance.<p>This doesn&#x27;t sound like someone dedicating themselves to the art of their craft, and I would argue that <i>we released nasty bugs</i> is the complete antithesis of what you meant. This sounds like making desparate moves trying to stay alive.<p>To me, a perfect modern example of someone putting the craft above all else (including their family) is Jiro Ono [0]. He does that because he wants to, not because he&#x27;d go broke otherwise.<p>I read GP&#x27;s comment as not critizing craftsmen, but criticizing someone prioritizing the daily grind above their life. And let&#x27;s face it, startups (or any other business) is 90% daily grind.<p>--<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi</a>')
