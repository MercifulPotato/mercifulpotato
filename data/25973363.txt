Therefore, any <i>IRC</i> client that has acces to <i>ZNC</i> has <i>ZNC</i>&#x27;s full capabilities, as it does not come with such finer granulation as of this moment.<p>If any sandboxing technology is to be effective, a large number of servers that are in common use often need to provide specific support for that specific sandboxing technology, or simply not be accessible at all from within it.')
