Item(by='koolba', descendants=None, kids=[25764396], score=None, time=1610539909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758593, text='&gt;  Didnâ€™t realize people on HN rationalize sedition and insurrection too.<p>It&#x27;s not sedition or insurrection to wait your turn and speak out in Congress that the results for a State are invalid. That&#x27;s exactly what the Constitution stipulates you should do. It wasn&#x27;t a crime or an insurrection when Pelosi did it and it&#x27;s not a crime now.<p>If you want a word to describe then versus now I&#x27;d go with hypocrisy.<p>On the wider topic, it&#x27;s sad that people&#x27;s biases have become so blatant against others with different political views that they interpret every comment in the most disingenuous light, with the dumbest of assumptions. One does not have to call out &quot;<i>Violence is bad!</i>&quot; in every comment or statement that they make for it to be true. It should be assumed as that&#x27;s the default for any sane individual in modern society.<p>So, yes violence is bad. We all know that. But unless you can show me where Cruz or Hawley actually committed acts of violence or directly instructed people to do the same, talk of them being guilty of insurrection is totally out of line. If telling your supporters to &quot;<i>March to the capital and make your voices heard!</i>&quot; is an insurrection we&#x27;re not going to have room in our prisons.')
