That was one of the small wins I got while working there. We used GitFlow (because someone just decided we should be using GitFlow as it was the most popular or something) and it was a nightmare to manage. Our release process was very cumbersome in the first place, but the fact of the matter is that GitFlow was overly complicated especially when under pressure to get out a release. A couple of releases we had regressions because of incorrect merges to master (from current dev) and then I started looking into Release Flow. Release Flow is essentially regression proof. The team picked up on it quickly and things were a lot better after that. We still used the feature&#x2F;bugfix designations, but in practice it was the trunk based development offered by Release Flow.<p>EDIT: As an extra point I think GitFlow can work if used in a very small team (5-6 devs). Anything above that and it becomes problematic.')
