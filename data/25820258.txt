If your extension works on both Firefox and Chrome, it really should work on Safari too. If it doesn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s fault for violating the standard, not yours for not testing on their broken platform. If you want to specifically test it you can, but if you don&#x27;t see a reason to, you should be able to just port it over and let people use it and beta test it for you.')
