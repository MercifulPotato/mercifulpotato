Yes, there can be more than one HTTP server, but again, there is more than one USB cable and I wouldn&#x27;t call that decentralized. HTTP doesn&#x27;t distribute the functions and powers between the client and the server (the two parties in any HTTP request): the client can hardly serve the response and the server can hardly issue a request. But it does distribute functions and powers between multiple servers because there isn&#x27;t one global HTTP server or party that serves the Internet (now that would be a scary thought--looking at you, CloudFlare).<p>So it depends a bit on the explanation of that definition.<p>I think what I said before might be right: it&#x27;s &quot;stretching&quot; the definition (interpreting it in a way that includes this). I can certainly see where you&#x27;re coming from (anyone can host their own HTTP server just like anyone can host their own email or git server or bittorrent node) but it&#x27;s not really how the word is usually used. But perhaps we use it wrong, because it does seem like a useful distinction to make (a centralized (proprietary) game server vs. a decentralized protocol like HTTP vs. a distributed protocol like BitTorrent).')
