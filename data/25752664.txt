An upper bound of 0.1% is 30 people.<p>In addition to the literal neo-Nazis in attendance, there were also plenty of groups — such as Proud Boys — that may not be technically neo-Nazis themselves, but are definitely Nazi adjacent; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a particular stretch to put them under the Nazi umbrella.<p>Given all that, 30 seems like a real lowball.')
