It remains to be seen what that impact will be, but I don&#x27;t see how it can be positive.<p>A bunch of right-wing trolls leaving for greener grass increases the civility on the platform and thus the attractiveness for everyday people, plus it leads to political good-will in a large part of the population, and especially a more friendly environment for brands to advertise in... few brands want to appear next to Qanon posts, a problem that Youtube and Facebook both have publicly faced in the last years.')
