Generally, we&#x27;re gone at least 2-weekends a month on car trips, fly away for a few weekends a year, and try to fit in 1-2 international trips as well.<p>Obviously, all that&#x27;s changed in the last year.<p>With COVID, we&#x27;ve felt incredibly lucky to live in a rural area where our kids were able to spend basically all summer just &quot;playing outside.&quot;  No need to interact with other people on mass-transit. No shared elevators or public spaces.<p>When we did start socializing a bit, it was very nice to have a nice private, outdoor space to (more) safely entertain our guests in.<p>COVID is hopefully a very temporary, one-time event.  But it has changed my perspective.<p>Still, while I agree that the article takes optimization to sort of silly lengths, I do see a solid point behind it.<p>I apply the same philosophy to boats, RVs, vacation-homes and the like.  (Though, I admit that COVID has tested my resolve there a bit). Expensive investments that aren&#x27;t really going to make sense unless you&#x27;re using them far more than our family would. Plus, with any major purchase like that, you&#x27;re &quot;locked-in&quot; to doing that one thing if you&#x27;re trying to maximize the value of your investment.<p>Buy a vacation home, and you&#x27;re going to have a mental barrier going on vacation somewhere else. Buy a boat, and you&#x27;re going to feel like you&#x27;re wasting money when you spend a week of vacation somewhere besides a lake.<p>TL;DR: Like most things in life, it&#x27;s a balance.')
