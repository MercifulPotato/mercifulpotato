The 1st amendment is a legal right and protection from violation by the government. Free speech ideals go further and are generally the belief that problems are best overcome by <i>more</i> speech--if someone has an abhorrent idea, let them express it so others can refute it and let the audience make up its own mind. Free speech proponents would argue that censoring the idea will look bad to those in the audience who haven&#x27;t made up their minds, and those undecided people in their curiosity will still learn about the unsavory ideas without the guidance of refutation. Free speech is about <i>persuasion</i> and not <i>coercion</i>, so while you could get away with it, &quot;if you say $x, I will get all of my friends to call your employer and demand your termination&quot; (threatening someone with harassment) is not considered to be &quot;free speech&quot; (nor is it &quot;free speech&quot; to carry out the threat).<p>To distinguish between this definition and the first-amendment definition, I usually refer to this as &quot;free speech ideals&quot;.')
