Why can&#x27;t you just use your Twitter account to communicate with someone on Facebook? There&#x27;s zero technical reason for this not to be possible.<p>&gt; This is already a thing. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pidgin.im&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pidgin.im&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=</a><p>It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a third party workaround that Facebook could kill at any point if it gave a shit. Do I really need to explain to you how that&#x27;s different than first party support for something so basic? Just like with email, you should be able to enter a username and a IM provider and just talk to them as if you&#x27;re using the same platform. It&#x27;s really not rocket science.<p>Fediverse (Mastodon and compatible providers) already does that without any hiccups. It&#x27;s possible, we know it works for decades (since we all use email), and it should be a requirement for every social network &#x2F; IM service in existence.')
