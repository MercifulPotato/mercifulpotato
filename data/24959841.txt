The liquor stores admittedly are &#x27;really nice&#x27; but there are long line ups, and prices are out of this world. Even as wine sales are allowed in grocery stores in Quebec, the &#x27;Gov. Liquor Monopoly&#x27; thuggishly enforced rules such that the quality of the wine out of their stores is so bad it&#x27;s undrinkable. The only wine that made it out of their mafia control was what you&#x27;d get in the US for $4 a bottle, i.e. undrinkable.<p>So no, some transparency, good laws and regulation would be appropriate, we don&#x27;t need a cabal forming within the government taking over that system.')
