You should probably start smaller with a couch-to-5k approach and work your way up to it. Going too hard too fast is an easy way to have a terrible experience. I&#x27;ve watched far too many people abandon the hobby because their first attempt was too ambitious and they got in over their heads.<p>If you&#x27;re really starting from zero my recommendation would be to get yourself a decent pair of trail shoes and a small day pack.  Find some short local day hikes and hit the trail for a couple of hours on the weekends. Mix in a little car camping and see how it goes. If you have friends who have gear, start by borrowing what you can and if the camping&#x2F;hiking bug bites you slowly start building out your own set of gear. If you don&#x27;t have friends that backpack find some and go on an overnight trip away from the cars. Ask them about the gear they brought and why. They&#x27;ll have lots of opinions.<p>After you get a bit more comfortable with the basic stuff and have a better sense for what you need then start planning a longer trip like this.')
