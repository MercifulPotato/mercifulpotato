Flu deaths will be down this year because of all the additional precautions taken around transmission, which may disproportionately affect flu virality (ie. perhaps COVID still manages to transmit despite precautions while flu does not.) Then if you say okay compare a previous flu year, you’d have to compare with the same conditions, which in a typical year would be no masks, barriers, social distancing, etc. And I think we all know how much worse COVID would be if we weren’t taking any precautions - we were warned for months about it.<p>So I’d imagine the initial observations that COVID is about 3-4x as deadly as the flu (and not 10x+ as some of these numbers suggest) are probably accurate enough.')
