It&#x27;s the same hash of Slack&#x27;s dev certificate that every other Slack customer is sending.<p>Anyone snooping the connection can figure that out and see that my computer said &quot;Check the revocation status of Slack Inc.,&quot; and the same goes for literally every other software company&#x27;s certificate hash.<p>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s being fixed but it&#x27;s still bad that it was done this way in the first place.')
