Item(by='raffraffraff', descendants=None, kids=[24887395], score=None, time=1603641829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887046, text='I&#x27;m in my 40s and have never (and <i>will</i> never) own a car. So I chose to live within reasonable walking distance of places I need to go. I walk everywhere, and carry groceries in a backpack. I do these things without even thinking about it. I&#x27;m the same weight I was when I was 19. I wear the same size clothes. I don&#x27;t bother with gym membership. The way I see it, it&#x27;s just a different way to live. Kinda like when people say &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna have kids because that&#x27;s not what my life is gonna be about&quot;.<p>Now, this is only possible in a city that was built (at least) hundreds of years before cars. Having visited the US I can honestly say that some cities (not the ones like New York) are designed completely around the car. Trying to walk everywhere in a city like that is futile and you&#x27;ll just hate life and everyone around you.')
