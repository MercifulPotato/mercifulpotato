It also has a unique approach to adverts to try and tackle spam - it detects adverts in results pages and promotes results which don&#x27;t contain them. At the time of writing, users have submitted 768 sites from which it searches 46,176 pages. Some quite fun and interesting content so far, which is hard to find elsewhere.')
