This python article skips over that entirely, making it yet another tutorial about the fact &quot;that&quot; floats are approximations instead of &quot;why&quot; floats are approximations.<p>Spend the time up from to understand the why, <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;re the simple masses. If you&#x27;re programming, it pays to properly learn how something that is integral to programming works and what you can therefore expect when you use it. Which will be <i>all the time</i>.')
