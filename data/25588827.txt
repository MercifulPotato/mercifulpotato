If you don&#x27;t get a stack overflow &#x2F; out of memory error, you&#x27;re good.  But bear in mind that there will be thousands of stack frames. Before you get to time=0 (the recursive base case) in a long-term liability actuarial calc.<p>The recursion isn&#x27;t simple like the Fibonacci sequence .  It&#x27;s more like:<p>f(t+1) = if t &gt; 0 (f(t) + g(t)) * h(t) else initial_constant<p>g(t) = f(t) + q(t) - d(t)<p>q(t) = ....<p>d(t) = ....')
