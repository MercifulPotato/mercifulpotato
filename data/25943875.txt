The &quot;treat code like data&quot; analogy breaks down because unlike (most) data, code is a thing that was intentionally crafted, one piece at a time, by a relatively small number of people, many of whom are probably still in the building. It isn&#x27;t some foreign artifact, understood by no-one, that&#x27;s been measured from impersonal processes. It was <i>made</i>. Almost by definition someone has <i>already had an understanding of it</i> at some point. Reverse-engineering a new understanding from scratch - even via powerful tooling - remains a wasteful path to take compared to simply reading a (written-down) understanding that already exists.')
