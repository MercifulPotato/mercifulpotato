UX is a thing, and Gimp doesn&#x27;t have that. As a now software engineer, I can see the thought process behind the application, but it&#x27;s workflow is treacherous. I switched out to Affinity a few years ago, because PS became too bloated&#x2F;heavy, and Gimp just doesn&#x27;t cut it for real work imho. I mention this because it was easier to pick up Affinity after a couple of hours than wrestling with Gimp. Same goes for Blender Vs Max&#x2F;Maya. I hate to say this, because I would like these tool to be more accessible to all')
