So many think it is harder than alternatives because that is just what you say.<p>It&#x27;s not too hard for people to learn, sure. But it&#x27;s also a much steeper learning curve to get value from compared to IDEs or to VSCode. The latter are really quite nice out of the box.<p>And it&#x27;s surely way easier for a novice to dig themselves into a hole they can&#x27;t get out of with Emacs compared to VSCode.<p>I think spending some time to know your tools better is a good thing. But for those who don&#x27;t have the time or interest, I wouldn&#x27;t say Emacs is a great choice.')
