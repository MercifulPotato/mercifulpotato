Item(by='majormajor', descendants=None, kids=[24703583, 24703737, 24703710, 24703621], score=None, time=1602025583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24703434, text='&gt; Since remote work has become acceptable and they already know the ins and outs of the job, many of these folks losing their visa will just be allowed to work remotely from India. This means the US economy will lose all the taxes and local expenditure in the economy like rent, food, travel, vacations, utilities, cars, home sales, etc. etc. And if that works out, the next hire may just be directly hired in India itself.<p>There&#x27;s a big assumption in &quot;Since remote work has become acceptable&quot;. Some companies are talking about making things permanent, others are already trying to get people back in the office.<p>And <i>if</i> the remote work swing is both big and permanent, then I think this is less likely a &quot;backfire&quot; situation and more of an &quot;irrelevant&quot; one. Companies looking to save money would hire in the foreign country regardless of the new rules.')
