The ubiquity of single parenthood, for example, dramatically increases the risk that a child will end up in foster care if anything happens to the remaining parent. Likewise, in a society where divorce and single parenthood are ubiquitous, other members of the family are much less likely to be in a position to take in a child when something happens to his or her parents.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting we do away with social workers who can check in on kids in abusive situations. To the contrary, if social workers weren&#x27;t overwhelmed taking care of a large number of kids who are in challenging circumstances simply because their dad doesn&#x27;t feel like being a dad, or for other mundane, solvable reasons, they would have far more attention and resources to devote to kids suffering from alcoholism, physical and sexual abuse, etc., in their families.')
