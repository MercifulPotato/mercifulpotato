Is the view expressed by the party of a protected class tied to their class and does it infringe on another persons rights? The answer will depend on the answers to those two questions.<p>&gt; Do you think people should be banned from stores for what they wear in their homes?<p>&gt; So you agree that it&#x27;s okay for companies to terminate lgbt employees?<p>Yes and no. LGBT employees are protected under sex discrimination. I believe you are trying to frame the idea that freedom of association can defeat class based protections by targeting related attributes such as rainbow pride clothing worn by a person at home. Such attempts to circumvent class protections have been repeatedly struck down as unconstitutional because (1) they are not applied to all individuals (2) they are made in bad faith and (3) they have no use other than to target the protected class. I implore you to do research into the current stance of US Supreme Court rulings that define, limit, and explain class protections. My personal stance is very similar to that of the current SCOTUS stance and all of your questions are answered by their cases.<p>&gt; Seems like people have no principles, just political agenda.<p>Unfortunately, the execution of one&#x27;s principles are mistaken for the implementation of a political agenda.')
