As a hobbyist in the last decades, you could learn about IPv4 and DHCP in a couple of afternoons. It was simple the same way as HTTP1 was simple compared with HTTP2. Complexity means the learning curve is enormous and in the end only a fraction of experts will understand.</i><p>That&#x27;s not really the real internet, though. How much did you learn about MPLS and BGP and ISIS from working at home as a hobbyist? I didn&#x27;t know much of anything about that stuff before I started programming routers and switches (real switches - like the ones your ISP uses).<p>IPv6 is so ridiculously similar to IPv4, it&#x27;s a bit funny reading about people complaining about how different they are. Seriously - go to wikipedia and read about something like ATM and how crazy different that is. Compared to the stuff you actually need to know and should know about if you&#x27;re a network admin, IPv6 is easy-peasy.')
