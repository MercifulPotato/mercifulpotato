It&#x27;s safe to assume a LEO soliciting a bribe would not also consent to having that solicitation recorded. So the only way you are getting that recording is illegally. Depending on how you record them, you could be facing several charges yourself and there&#x27;s no guarantee that anything will come of it for a variety of reasons. You might even be caught doing it, which could be disastrous. In short, it&#x27;s a pretty big gamble.')
