Now I just wish I had a landing page ready so I can plug it here instead of over engineering the app itself, but oh well :)<p>Anyway, what I&#x27;m building is meant more for the repetitive kinds of electronic music, but I solved the problem by just making it work like a shared loop pedal that records up to 16 measures of audio.<p>Everyone works asynchronously and can add or remove audio on their own time, but loops get synced to other players as they get recorded.<p>Best part? You can do cool stuff with browsers nowadays (even record uncompressed audio). So it just needs a web browser.')
