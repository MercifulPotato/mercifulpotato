I moved away from Brave because its still chrome&#x2F;chromium based. I am also not confident in their &quot;blockchain&quot; advertising model and don&#x27;t trust they are actually any less private with my data than chrome&#x2F;chromium.<p>It would be cool to see IPFS integrated and enabled by default on all browsers. I doubt Google would ever take the leap, but maybe Mozilla would. I also have doubt that Microsoft would but they would be more willing than Google.
