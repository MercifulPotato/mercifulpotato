Item(by='kllrnohj', descendants=None, kids=[25151231], score=None, time=1605803656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25150849, text='&gt; Thunderbolt with two 40Gb&#x2F;sec links isn&#x27;t tiny either<p>It comparatively is. Thunderbolt is basically a PCI-E Gen 3 x4 slot but over a (very) short cable. Commonly more like an x2 link since getting the x4 speeds is difficult. Commonly 2 thunderbolt ports also share a single controller, so it&#x27;s a 40Gb&#x2F;sec <i>combined maximum</i> not per-port (either port can saturate, but you can&#x27;t hit 80Gb&#x2F;s total). It&#x27;s unclear what the M1&#x27;s controller actually is here, if it&#x27;s dedicated lanes per port or just bifurcation.<p>But lets say the M1 is full on 2 TB3 controllers, for a combined 80Gb&#x2F;s over those 2 ports. That&#x27;s still not much. By comparison the 5600x has 24 PCIe Gen 4 lanes on it. That&#x27;s 380 Gb&#x2F;s of bandwidth off of the CPU. These are all things Apple would need to heavily beef up when they make the Apple Silicon variants of the larger class products. You can&#x27;t do a Mac Pro replacement with 80 Gb&#x2F;s of I&#x2F;O. That&#x27;d be a joke. Apple obviously <i>will</i> scale up the I&#x2F;O, but that costs power, too. It won&#x27;t be free.')
