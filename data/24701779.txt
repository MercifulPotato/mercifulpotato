I made this trivia game because I couldn&#x27;t find a simple, web-based, mobile friendly trivia game without ads and tracking.<p>It is very light, ~300kb (compressed) over the wire, including ~12 SVG illustrations. Each subsequent game transfers &lt; 10 KB.<p>The front end is Nuxt.js and the back end is node&#x2F;express.<p>I tried to avoid user-hostile features that induce users to keep playing. To this end, there is no persistent score or points, just single 10 point games.<p>The questions come from the open trivia DB and there are many categories. You can play with an arbitrary combination of categories.<p>I made this a while ago, but never posted it. I want to share it in hopes that it will inspire me to keep working on it. I&#x27;d really like to add an offline mode and some other stuff. I have a bunch of cool ideas for it.<p>FYI, the contrast is low on the categories view, making it hard to see which categories are selected on some screens.')
