Which is great if you are living in a bubble by yourself, or some similar products. Making someone decide between CI and shared document writing is a terrible choice to have to make.<p>The other way to present this graph is the classic triangle, Cheap, Good, Fast, but the way we typically use that triangle suffers the same failure mode, because &#x27;expensive&#x27; is some weird variant on cheap vs fast, as represented by Brook&#x27;s Law.<p>I think the Discord Team has a different interpretation of this - the maintenance cost of the feature matters more to the user than the initial development cost. I can deliver you a feature now that will cost $X a month to operate, or I can deliver you that feature in a couple of months and it&#x27;ll cost 1&#x2F;10th that amount. Which means we can offer it to users at a price point they can afford.<p>It feels like Gitlab has, like so many of us, a bunch of features that create opportunity costs that the customers can&#x27;t stomach.')
