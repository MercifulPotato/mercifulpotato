No thanks.<p>That&#x27;s an idiotic saying. The person&#x27;s comment above you is also idiotic.<p>When Twitter is banning feminist women for saying something as so patently obvious as, &quot;Men are not women.&quot; [1] then don&#x27;t be surprised when people choose to make accounts at any available social media service because 1) people aren&#x27;t creating blogs that get 100 million visitors anymore (if such blogs <i>ever</i> existed) and 2) no one has any idea which social media platform will become the next 3 billion user juggernaut and which one will be converted into a shitty music-focused platform.<p>[1]: Meghan Murphy, banned in 2018 for &quot;hateful conduct&quot; following a heated exchange which involved misgendering a transgender woman. The fact that someone could be banned for fucking <i>misgendering</i> someone indicates just how pathetic our society has become. These services have a block button, and apparently no one knows how to use it.')
