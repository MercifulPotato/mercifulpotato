Everything was so colourful it felt like it was giving me a headache. I guess I could probably have gotten used to it if I&#x27;d kept with it, but I just didn&#x27;t believe it would make me able to recognise colours correctly - I mean, surely my brain was already pretty much hard-wired to comprehend course a certain way? And I remember they were <i>expensive</i>, and our family wasn&#x27;t exactly well off, so I declined.<p>Anyway, as a middle-aged man now, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been significantly detrimental to my life. For the occasions I need it, I use apps to check the RGB values of things, and I can roughly figure out colours, but in general, yes, it&#x27;s an impairment, but just doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s a big deal.')
