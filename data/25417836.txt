So they needed to do animal&#x2F;crop rotation to keep the costs down (ie not pay for animal food.)<p>When I wasn&#x27;t there I was on my parent&#x27;s allotment. Next to the allotment was a standard arable field. For various reasons It stopped being used and was left to nature.<p>Two things struck me: 1) it was about 80cm lower than the allotments<p>2) nothing grew on it. The strip of land that served as a border had to be mown _every week_ to keep it from exploding.<p>It had basically degraded to sand and stone.')
