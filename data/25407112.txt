Item(by='jonsen', descendants=None, kids=[25407165], score=None, time=1607872784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406835, text='&gt; ... it didnt have the empty statement &#x27;;&#x27; ...\n&gt; Sometimes you were not allowed to end you statements with &#x27;;&#x27; (since they were ended by the block, so this would require the emptystatement).<p>Pascal has empty statements. They are exactly that - empty. \nIn C syntax ; is a statement end token, so the empty statement is ‘;’. \nIn Pascal ; is a statement separator token, so the empty statement is ‘’, and ‘;’ is <i>two</i> empty statements.\nSo the typical error is to write “....... ;” where only one statement is syntactically allowed.<p>Example:<p><pre><code>  if x &gt; y\n  then x := y ;\n  else ...  Syntax error. \n      Only one statement allowed between then and else.\n\n  then { x := y ; }\n  else ...    is Ok. \n      The blocking makes two statements into one.</code></pre>')
