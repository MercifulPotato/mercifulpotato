It renders what you tell it to.  From a component perspective, whatever the output of your component is, that&#x27;s what gets rendered&#x2F;updated on screen.  There are a few escape hatches in place, depending on what you&#x27;re trying to do though.<p>From TFA examples, when faced with similar issues (though not quite the same), I found directly writing SVG markup over a document background to be extremely straight forward with React.<p>For the most part, the problem you are describing is when you are actively trying to <i>NOT</i> use the tool you&#x27;re using.  I&#x27;ve been developing web based applications since the mid 90&#x27;s and React is hands down the best tool I&#x27;ve used in that timeframe for web applications.  That said, if you&#x27;re mostly delivering static content, then it may not be the best fit.  In those cases using something like Vue, or another option for enhancements (even jQuery-like) may be a better option.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use React, you are best off understanding and embracing it... if you aren&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t intend to be mean, it just seems your perspective is off.  It&#x27;s much like asking how you use a SQL oriented database without the inconvenience of SQL or data types.')
