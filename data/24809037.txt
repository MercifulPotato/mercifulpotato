By switching the formatting of that cell to &quot;Date&quot; (Excel right-click <i>&quot;Format cells...&quot;</i> choose Category <i>&quot;Date&quot;</i>), the mystery number becomes a readable mm&#x2F;dd&#x2F;yyyy.<p>Same idea as experienced programmers coming across a 10-digit number like &quot;1602930678&quot; in a JSON or XML data file and instinctively assume it&#x27;s probably a UNIX timestamp rather than a phone number with area code (160).')
