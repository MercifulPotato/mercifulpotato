This is an extremely sensitive matter, as it involves movement of people and people&#x27;s lives.<p>I have been on a Viber travel group supporting people trying to get into Croatia. It consists of many American citizens. Anyways, over the past couple of days, Delta&#x2F;United&#x2F;Iberia have been using artificial intelligence (AI) to &#x2F;automatically update&#x2F; where people can or cannot go, based off of government websites. Instead of having proper staff to look over these requirements, they use AI to screw over their customers, as the AI has errors in its interpretations for documentation required by travelers.<p>There have been a few people on this Viber group who have been wrongly denied boarding, right before their Christmas holiday, due to inconsistencies in the interpretations of the AI (multiple errors, type 1 and type 2), from the company Smartvel. Sadly, people of color have been the ones getting stopped more and denied boarding in the US.<p>This is the technology that I am talking about: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartvel.com&#x2F;covid19-entry-restrictions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smartvel.com&#x2F;covid19-entry-restrictions&#x2F;</a><p>This is the API plugin on Delta.com for Smartvel (fill out the to: Croatia from: USA): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delta.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;plan-your-next-trip&#x2F;where-we-fly" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delta.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;plan-your-next-trip&#x2F;where-we-fly</a><p>This is the API plugin on United.com for Smartvel (fill out the to: Croatia from: USA): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.united.com&#x2F;ual&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;fly&#x2F;travel&#x2F;restrictions-map.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.united.com&#x2F;ual&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;fly&#x2F;travel&#x2F;restrictions-map...</a><p>Ironically, if you booked online using KLM.com (affiliated with Delta but a European airline) or Lufthansa.com (affiliated with United but a European airline) you were not subjected to this problem, even though it was the same flight through a codeshare arrangement via the airlines.<p>It really is inhumane. While people may not want people flying due to the coronavirus (honestly, I don&#x27;t but Croatia does need the business and I want them to see my country too), these people had their plans made and their holidays were ruined over AI. It is cruel.<p>By the way, I am a dual US|Croatian citizen, and if Croatia allows third country nationals, such as Americans in, then I think they should be allowed in. Also, if you spend 14 days in Croatia as an American, you can basically enter the EU without issue, but you may want to check <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reopen.europa.eu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reopen.europa.eu&#x2F;</a> for entry restrictions, country-to-country. It is a loophole.')
