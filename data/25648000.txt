Tons of repetition, tons of boilerplate by other names.<p>Not well or hastily written Go is easily like that. I can only guess why you point out the repetition but when you look at well written Go code like in the Go std library, there isn&#x27;t much repetition happening and it looks rather elegant. At the same time it can be quite some effort to create such code and might take several iterations. Documentation-wise I like the official documentation, it gives a lot of pointers why Go is how it is.<p>Also obviously it&#x27;s not for every use-case. Where it works really well IMHO is where error handling is a vital part of the application. (And of course anything concurrent is quite a breeze)')
