This is an important question.<p>Sometimes NFS is your only option. When you have legacy applications which nobody is going to rewrite, and you need to scale some operations on a set of files over many nodes, NFS works. Its failure nodes are well documented, so you can plan for and work around them.<p>It&#x27;s also supported by most vendors as the default networked filesystem. Whether you&#x27;re using a desktop PC, a million dollar NAS, or cloud storage, it supports NFS.<p>It&#x27;s also acceptable when time is of the essence and you just need to get something working now and don&#x27;t have time to build something better. I rather like &quot;good enough solutions&quot; as a way to get teams &quot;shipping&quot;, with an agreed-upon plan to replace it later.<p>But as someone who&#x27;s used it for nearly 20 years, internally I start screaming and throwing things whenever someone suggests using it. Externally I propose redesigning for a more efficient solution :)')
