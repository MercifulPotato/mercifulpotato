There were also some groups moving in organised fashion with less expensive and more useful equipment. There were people with bombs. There were some people ready to inflict harm on LE and luckily they didn&#x27;t carry on to other people.<p>It was not a homogeneous group with same ideas and goals. That idea is just distracting from what happened.')
