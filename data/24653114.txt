Why not? He served his time- you don&#x27;t want to punish him indefinitely, right?<p>Also a convicted fraudster can start working again immediately in a bank, or as a financial advisor for your parents- after all, he served his time, right? And a convicted Mafioso or gang member can become a cop. Etc. etc.<p>I agree society should help reintegrate prisoners, and find them work. That work might just be as in construction or retail sadly. Unfortunately, if you did something absolutely horrific, the consequences of that may last your entire life. As an employer I am not &#x27;society&#x27;- I&#x27;m not obligated to hire a violent felon because society in general owes him or her something. As an employer I&#x27;m free to make my own decisions, and I personally wouldn&#x27;t hire someone who did 13 years in prison, likely for homicide. If you disagree, that&#x27;s fine- it&#x27;s a free country, you can hire them or even let them into your home, up to you.<p>If you really disagree, tell me how about how daycares should hire pedophiles after they get out of prison. They did their time, right?')
