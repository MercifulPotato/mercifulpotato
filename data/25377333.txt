Wiring servers together using kubeadm is so simple and powerful that the missing pieces of the puzzle (networking and storage, for example) feel frustratingly close.<p>In an ideal world, you could purchase or rent commoditized resources (compute, storage, bandwidth) and have those resources deploy your application in a standardized way. K8s is so close to that out of the gate, that having to use cloud provider&#x27;s expensive and proprietary offerings feels sub-optimal.<p>I agree that cloud offerings are the way to go for anyone without good reasons not to (eg compliance, lack of connectivity, or full control over upgrades). But a lot of the &quot;I prefer on prem&quot; attitude comes from realizing that having a black box of an ingress controller on my cluster isn&#x27;t the end state of how apps get deployed')
