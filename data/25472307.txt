Yes, it seems Projective Geometric Algebra is new enough that the terminology and symbols are still being debated.<p>2. Yes, people who &quot;get&quot; it seem pretty convinced. I think the newish PGA is attractive for convincing real-time graphics software engineers and hardware engineers. For example, it has 16 floats in R(3,0,1) too.<p>3. The community is there to help spread the knowledge and to help as you start finding out about all the other Geometric Algebras. And overcoming the Euclidean mindset is tough.<p>This is the first bit of higher-than-Calc math I&#x27;ve worked at in a long while and it feels like it&#x27;s bending my mind in a good way, like Lisp did.')
