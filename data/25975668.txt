I wonder if it is built on their ‘exalink’ platform?<p>I’m no longer with Deloitte, but I saw that they recently sold off their life sciences department to their only competitor- Model N [1]. The Exalink platform was born out of work being done for the life sciences department. I thought it was an interesting development that Deloitte sold them off since when I was still there it was being peddled as this great in-house cloud-agnostic system that could do whatever you wanted it to do (spoiler: it couldn’t). Anyways, maybe it is completely unrelated?<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;model-n-modn-acquires-deloittes-unit-to-expand-in-life-sciences-2021-01-05" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;model-n-modn-acquires-deloit...</a>')
