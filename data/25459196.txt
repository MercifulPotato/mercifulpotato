You don&#x27;t need a banner if you use CSRF cookies, you don&#x27;t need a banner if you use them for stuff like CloudFlare&#x27;s anti-DDoS script, and you certainly don&#x27;t need a banner if your site requires cookies for basic functionality like logging in.<p>The browser can&#x27;t possibly tell what the server is doing with its cookies. It might even be using a single cookie as CSRF protection and ad tracking at the same time.')
