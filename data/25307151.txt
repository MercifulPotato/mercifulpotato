I&#x27;ve interviewed ex-FAANG employees at some jobs and there was never any pressure to hire them, and I didn&#x27;t feel like any one of them would be treated as a god if hired. They were pretty universally above average though.<p>They were also not &quot;walking in to captain&quot; anything. They were applying for standard engineering jobs. Think of an average individual-contributor software engineer from, say, Facebook. Is a smaller company really going to hire them as Director Of Engineering (a totally different job than software engineering), just because of the company name on the resume? That sounds absurd.')
