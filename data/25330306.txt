Or more specifically, Gwern solved it, and I enhanced it.

There are ballroom themes, battle themes, boss fights, and the last one is my attempt at a final battle track. If there&#x27;s interest, I can walk through how the model works.<p>None of the tracks are stellar, but all of them were made <i>in a single night</i>. There are 25 tracks. You should be skeptical, because I sure would be; that&#x27;s about three tracks an hour for 8 hours. But (to my surprise) that&#x27;s the kind of boost you can get from ML. If you spent a day on each, mixed it into FL studio, etc, you&#x27;d probably have a production-ready track.<p>Note that it&#x27;s not entirely automatic. But that&#x27;s the point. I chose <i>zero</i> notes; didn&#x27;t even have to think about notes. All I thought about was &quot;which instruments sound good together? Oh, this one sounds nice, but it&#x27;s not quite right. But if you put it together with X, then.. yes!&quot;<p>Basically, you tell it &quot;I want a waltz&quot; or &quot;Upbeat tempo!&quot; or &quot;So-and-so key with a slow beat.&quot; It gives you tracks that go together. By default it usually picks piano. So you change &quot;piano&quot; to different things, and it ends up sounding great.<p>The songs each contain the ABC source code that generated it. You can replicate the song for yourself by copying the source code into a text file, then running something like this:<p><pre><code>  abc2midi &quot;${1}.abc&quot; -o &quot;${1}.mid&quot; &amp;&amp; timidity &quot;${1}.mid&quot; -Ov -o &quot;${1}.ogg&quot; &amp;&amp; timidity &quot;${1}.mid&quot;\n</code></pre>\n(That&#x27;s from my bash script called &quot;abc2ogg&quot;.)<p>Remember, protein folding took some 50 years, and then ML dominated it over night. It all depends how your system is trained. Your dataset needs to be &quot;grouped&quot; in a way that the model can understand.')
