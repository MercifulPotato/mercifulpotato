The flagship open-source FPGAs are the Lattice iCE40 series, which are SRAM-based. There&#x27;s also been significant work towards open-source toolchains for Xilinx FPGAs, which are also SRAM-based.<p>The real limitation is in capabilities. The iCE40 series is composed of relatively small FPGAs which wouldn&#x27;t be particularly useful for this type of application.')
