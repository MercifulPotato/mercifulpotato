Most organizations have a dollar limit where we can just charge a purchase card and when they have to seek approval.  In this particular case, the software costs are higher than what can likely go onto a p-card, so now it becomes a real pain to acquire.  In fact, the software is so expensive that it&#x27;s cost would like eclipse the cost of the computer itself.  So basically, we&#x27;re looking at a decision where the client can use a more performant library and save $100k as long as they stay off of Apple silicon.<p>That&#x27;s really the point I&#x27;m trying to make and not to criticize anyone for using a GPL license.  Moving to these new chips, in many cases, will be a much larger cost to an organization than just the cost of the computer.')
