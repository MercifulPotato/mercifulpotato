This isn&#x27;t a CRUD application but is instead a distributed control plane with a lot of reads and a small dataset. Joins and complex queries are not needed in this case as the data is simple.<p>I am also going to go out on a limb and guess that this is all running in kubernetes. Running etcd there is dead simple compared to even running something like Postgress.<p>Congrats on a well engineered solution that you can easily test on a dev machine. Running a DB in a docker container isn&#x27;t difficult but it is just one more dev environment nuance that needs to be maintained.')
