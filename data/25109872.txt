First time it happened I woke up in agony one morning, went to the hospital and they were convinced I&#x27;d broken it. Spent a few years on Allopurinol during which I only ever had an attack if I was dehydrated from illness, then they stopped my allopurinol because of a recurrent kidney infection. Earlier this year they tried putting me back on allopurinol and I had the longest, most painful attack I&#x27;ve ever had lasting over two months and didn&#x27;t stop until I stopped taking the allopurinol. I&#x27;ve now been told the only thing I can do is take colchicine when it kicks off.')
