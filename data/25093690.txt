To their credit, they&#x27;re being painfully honest but all the same I think it does more harm than good when explaining Matrix to technical people who aren&#x27;t familiar with Matrix.<p>As others have mentioned, identity servers only exist to map third party identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers to MXIDs. Most people just use MXIDs to start chats (mine is @cyphar:cyphar.com -- it&#x27;s no more complicated than an email address). It is a useful feature to have, but given that other chat systems don&#x27;t even have such a system (you can&#x27;t find someone&#x27;s email address using just their phone number -- GMail might implement this but that&#x27;s just as centralised as Matrix&#x27;s identity servers) it seems pretty unreasonable to say that Matrix&#x27;s claims of decentralisation are &quot;bullshit&quot;.<p>People have been working to make this system decentralised but it&#x27;s actually an unreasonably hard problem to prove to everyone else that you actually have verified someone else&#x27;s email address or phone number. And to be honest, I&#x27;d prefer they&#x27;d spend their time polishing the actual chat UX instead of a feature most users won&#x27;t even use (let alone redesigning it to provide guarantees that only a handful of users <i>claim</i> to care about).')
