I&#x27;d get rid of my car too if I could afford to have Uber haul me everywhere.<p>It&#x27;s a difference in frequency of use.  In Seattle, a lot of my friends don&#x27;t have cars, but use Rideshare&#x2F;rentals when they need it.  If you are using it a couple times a week, pretty easy to stay under the cost of car ownership when you factor in insurance&#x2F;parking&#x2F;maintenance etc.')
