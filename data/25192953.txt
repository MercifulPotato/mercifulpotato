Item(by='davidbanham', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606172492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186342, text='I run three different SaaS products by myself, spend a couple of days per week consulting and lead a pretty full life with young kids, volunteer firefighting, hobbies, etc. Each of my products probably equates to around a 1&#x2F;4-Man SaaS.<p>They&#x27;re all server-rendered HTML with a little ajax sprinkled around the place where required for interactivity. I use Materialize CSS to give me a leg-up on the design side but the next thing I release will be on Tailwind UI.<p>They&#x27;re all written in Go using a simple MVC-ish pattern. I write a lot of integration tests and a few unit tests.<p>I use Google&#x27;s hosted PostgreSQL database. It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s not expensive either and it&#x27;s been rock solid. The frontends are all on Cloud Run as of a few months ago which has been wonderful. Super reliable and fuss-free. Takes care of all the application logging, etc.<p>Task queue stuff is handled by a library on top of Postgres. It won&#x27;t scale to a billion jobs per second or anything but it handles load just fine. If I ever start pushing it&#x27;s boundaries it&#x27;s all pluggable so I can switch it back to SQS or PubSub or whatever else.<p>The task workers run on a single-node k8s cluster hosted on GKE. A lot of people grump about Kubernetes being &quot;overkill&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t have to be complicated. A single YAML manifest defines your service and your environment variables, you tell GKE to make it happen, you go play in the sunshine. It takes care of restarts, logging, full disks, etc etc etc all for you.<p>I use Amazon SES for emails. I had some real problems with deliverability until I ponied up for a dedicated IP address and now it&#x27;s fine.<p>I use Freshdesk for ticketing. I don&#x27;t love it at all but I don&#x27;t yet hate it enough to replace it with something else.')
