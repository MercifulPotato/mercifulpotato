Item(by='zaroth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610162908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25695757, text='Actually the FBI said today they are still investigating if anyone actually tried at all to take hostages, and still investigating who the person was with the zipties and what they were doing there.<p>The woman who was shot (elsewhere I posted the very graphic video of it happening) was surrounded on both sides of the door by police.<p>My best guess is she was fully enthralled in a mob mentality and obviously not thinking clearly. Violent mobs are dangerous for this exact reason. We saw this play out again and again over the summer, and a lot of people died.<p>From the video I saw there was no need to kill her, she was trying to gain access to a long hallway with a half dozen police in the far side of the door, and the snot fired could have very easily hit the police officer that was standing right by her on <i>her</i> side of the door at the time.<p>I think all we can do is purely speculate on her mental state and her goals.<p>There will be a lot of evidence if she actually went to the capital in order to hurt or capture public officials. None has yet to be shown. All we know basically is that she was a military vet.')
