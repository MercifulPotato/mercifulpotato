As wages rise, doesn&#x27;t inflation rise as well, negating the benefit of a rising wage.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it also be true that as certain goods deflate in price, labor force participation should go up as well since the same wage allows you to buy more stuff?<p>This goes back to wealth isn&#x27;t the money you have, it&#x27;s what you can buy. Today most people, even those at the bottom, have access to many things today than even John D. Rockefeller didn&#x27;t have access to when he was alive.<p>Anyways, not asserting anything in particular here, but just raising that it seems far more complicated than just wages rising lead to greater labor force participating.')
