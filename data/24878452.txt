If they modify the readme, they might be able to prove that the intention of the software is not necessarily to violate DMCA, but maybe just being a general purpose code or one for educational purposes.<p>Regardless, it&#x27;s possible to host PyPi wheels yourself if necessary. The installation process wont be as straight-forward as &quot;pip install youtube_dl&quot;, but it&#x27;s still doable with one command.')
