It&#x27;s wonderfully constructed, people get paid a lot to do it. It&#x27;s also just a lie. To fully half of the American population, and a rapidly growing proportion, this is a bald-faced lie.<p>So please, hold the speculative narrative. Don&#x27;t repeat talking heads to me. Show receipts. Demonstrate with evidence that Trump tried to get his rally to invade the freaking capitol building.<p>In the meantime, respond to the rest of the arguments being represented here. You can&#x27;t conveniently ignore the much worse riots that took place last summer as you try to spin your crazed narrative, we see through all of this now.')
