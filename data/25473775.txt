Subjectively, APL is pretty and enticing in a way that J isn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s very strange to me that someone who promoted Iverson Notation as a better math notation, and wrote Notation as a Tool of Thought, could apparently completely switch notation from 30 years of established APL symbols to pairs of ASCII symbols, effectively overnight, and carry on as if nothing was any different.<p>How much of J&#x27;s success is because J was free and the big APLs were a lot of money, so J has been &quot;the free way to get an array language experience&quot; for years?')
