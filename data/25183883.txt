There was a time when you&#x27;d open a PNG, and the default &quot;save&quot; just gave you a flattened PNG.  Or maybe it did so but complained about the risk.  Either way, it felt off to make XCF default ONCE you specified a file type (either by opening a PNG&#x2F;JPG&#x2F;etc.) or trying to save as such once.  You&#x27;ve decided you want to save only a final output, not something with the intermediary magic.')
