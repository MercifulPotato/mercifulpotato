So the recommendation is that people who need the &quot;sweets&#x2F;sugar&quot; rush in certain situations to eat a piece of dark chocolate, because it gives them the &quot;rush&quot;, but also reduces their appetite, unlike many other sweets which have been designed to want more.<p>Many words just to say that often this is more about the science reporting than the science.')
