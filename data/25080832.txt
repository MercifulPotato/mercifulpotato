In this provocative study, Ha-Joon Chang examines the great pressure on developing countries from the developed world to adopt certain &#x27;good policies&#x27; and &#x27;good institutions&#x27;, seen today as necessary for economic development. Adopting a historical approach, Dr Chang finds that the economic evolution of now-developed countries differed dramatically from the procedures that they now recommend to poorer nations. His conclusions are compelling and disturbing: that developed countries are attempting to &#x27;kick away the ladder&#x27; with which they have climbed to the top, thereby preventing developing counties from adopting policies and institutions that they themselves have used.&quot;</i><p>+<p><i>“Rich countries have ‘kicked away the ladder’ by forcing free-market, free-trade policies on poor countries. Already established countries do not want more competitors emerging through the nationalistic policies they themselves successfully used in the past.”</i> [1]<p>Professor Yash Tandon adds:<p><i>“During the 1980s and 1990s I worked in many countries in eastern and southern Africa, and then for four years at the South Centre—2005–09. I can say from my experience that the industrialised countries of the North have been trying systematically to block all efforts by the countries of the South to industrialise. Their mega-corporations have tried—and, alas, succeeded—in privatising knowledge, and using it to promote corporate profits over the lives of people.&quot;<p>[...]<p>“It is the seeds and pharmaceutical companies of the West that have pirated the knowledge of seeds and medicinal products from the South. But whereas in the South this knowledge was shared as a public asset, the Western companies, having learnt from the South, proceeded to claim it as their private property. They are guilty—morally guilty—for the avoidable deaths of millions of people in the South who cannot afford their ‘patented’ medicines against, for example, AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other killer diseases. It is a sordid story. But it is not all doom and gloom. Those who control the system (the global corporations and the international organisations that the West controls) do not get their own way entirely. Wars do not always end in the victory of the militarily or ‘intellectually’ powerful.”</i> [2]<p>All of this then comes together through Tech&#x27;s Great-Man theory, that has us idolizing those monopolizers:<p><i>&quot;In the movie Steve Jobs, a character asks, “So how come 10 times in a day I read ‘Steve Jobs is a genius?’” The great man reputation that envelops Jobs is just part of a larger mythology of the role that Silicon Valley, and indeed the entire U.S. private sector, has played in technology innovation. We idolize tech entrepreneurs like Jobs, and credit them for most of the growth in our economy. But University of Sussex economist Mariana Mazzucato, who has just published a new U.S. edition of her book, The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths, makes a timely argument that it is the government, not venture capitalists and tech visionaries, that have been heroic.<p>“Every major technological change in recent years traces most of its funding back to the state,” says Mazzucato. Even “early stage” private-sector VCs come in much later, after the big breakthroughs have been made. For example, she notes, “The National Institutes of Health have spent almost a trillion dollars since their founding on the research that created both the pharmaceutical and the biotech sectors–with venture capitalists only entering biotech once the red carpet was laid down in the 1980s. We pretend that the government was at best just in the background creating the basic conditions (skills, infrastructure, basic science). But the truth is that the involvement required massive risk taking along the entire innovation chain: basic research, applied research and early stage financing of companies themselves.” The Silicon Valley VC model, which has typically dictated that financiers exit within 5 years or so, simply isn’t patient enough to create game changing innovation.&quot;</i> [3]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthempress.com&#x2F;kicking-away-the-ladder-pb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anthempress.com&#x2F;kicking-away-the-ladder-pb</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbooks.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;trade-war-yash-tandon-2nd-ed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orbooks.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;trade-war-yash-tandon-2nd-ed...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4089171&#x2F;mariana-mazzucato&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;4089171&#x2F;mariana-mazzucato&#x2F;</a>')
