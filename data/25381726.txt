At the voluntary self disclosure stage it listed epilepsy among the list and it stopped me in my tracks. A few brain surgeries later and I&#x27;m no longer epileptic, but it did make me ask this exact question.<p>For several years, my onset with in 2012 at age 36, I considered it more of a bummer and inconvenience and never thought about it any other way.<p>Personally I was fortunate that I was only having partial complex seizures which meant that I&#x27;d basically space out and stare into the distance completely unattached from my environment for 30 seconds to a few minutes according to my ex-girlfriend and other people I interacted with regularly.<p>Rarely did I have any indication that I&#x27;d had a seizure aside from the occasional, unexpected incontinence. One instance that sticks out was walking back from lunch with co-workers when one walked up to me and said &quot;did you lose something&quot;. I dropped my sandwich while I was having a seizure and was walking all the while.<p>What allowed me to say &quot;yeah... this is a legit disability&quot; was examining how much had changed in my life without the ability to drive. Luckily I&#x27;d just basically moved in with said girlfriend who lived 10 minutes by bus from my job downtown, this was well before I worked from home and there&#x27;s little chance I could have gotten to work from my rural home an hour away with essentially no transit.<p>I was really living a normal day to day life, I just had to make some adaptations to how I got around and had to stop using power tools without dead man switches.<p>Slightly hyperbolic maybe, but I can make a good case for how epilepsy cost me that house, relationship and severely impinged upon my job search.<p>Hindsight... it&#x27;s a hell of thing. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d have felt any different being labeled or self-identifying as disabled but it goes a long way to describing the impact it had on my 30s. I&#x27;m also a guy that occasionally drove 50k miles in a year to travel for shows and work and various other road trips.')
