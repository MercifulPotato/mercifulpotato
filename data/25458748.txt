Simply violating people&#x27;s privacy just because technology has enabled the practice isn&#x27;t acceptable.<p>Remember, no one first asked any of us for our permission to be tracked by our physical features just for walking down the street and going about our daily business as we&#x27;ve always done, nevertheless this all-pervasive technology was introduced without our permission nor with any public debate.<p>I posted this comment several hours ago in a duplicate of this story.  Having now had time to think about it, I seriously believe we&#x27;re just beginning to see the beginnings of a new war on privacy and that this new technology has now given ordinary people the  means of fighting back.  If this war escalates because of criminals&#x2F;bad actors then don&#x27;t blame us—we didn&#x27;t start it:<p><i>&quot;Perhaps we&#x27;ll all be wearing them sooner than we think out of necessity to counter facial recognition.<p>(It&#x27;s just occurred to me that a blank conformal OLED version of the mask would be the ultimate form — one&#x27;s face could dynamically change on-the-fly whilst one&#x27;s out and about. That would give all-pervasive surveillance systems a decent run for their money.) ;-)&quot;</i>')
