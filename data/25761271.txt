In any case, rotational latency for HDD drives is an order of magnitude lower (typically 2-5ms for a seek operation).<p>S3 is great for higher throughput workloads where TTFB is amortized across larger downloads (this is why it&#x27;s very common to use S3 as a &quot;data lake&quot; where larger columnar files are stored, usually at the order of hundreds of MiB).<p>I think it&#x27;s an interesting project but perhaps explaining the use cases where this solution is beneficial would go a long way here.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvassallo&#x2F;s3-benchmark" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvassallo&#x2F;s3-benchmark</a>')
