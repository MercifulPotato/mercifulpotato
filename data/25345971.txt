They&#x27;re not trying to take over Grado&#x27;s market, they&#x27;re trying to sell more stuff to people who have already bought heavily into the Apple ecosystem and value comprehensive and simple functionality.<p>For example.  I own Sony MX3s.  They have decent sound and great ANC but the use is massively frustrating.  Swipe controls don&#x27;t work, the app sucks, pairing with multiple devices is a nightmare.  But I keep them for planes, and use my AirPods pro for everything else.<p>If these headphones have sound and ANC at least as good as my MX3s, and <i>in addition</i> have the standard Apple package of features (insta-pairing with multiple devices, tightly integrated with iOS and Siri for effortless feature control, best in class microphones for voice calls, etc. etc., plus looking cool) I&#x27;ll buy them and give the MX3s away in a heartbeat.<p>(Though... how do they charge?  Its not clear anywhere I see...)')
