There is no wisdom in that crowd anymore.<p>And maybe not party lines but the stench of hypocrisy is overwhelming. This mob helps no one. It&#x27;s just a lot of people making bets against each other and manipulating the market.<p>Just because one side is an angry mob on Reddit does not make it right or moral what happened. I would hardly call r&#x2F;WallStreetBets &#x27;the people.&#x27; It&#x27;s nothing more than an angry mob.')
