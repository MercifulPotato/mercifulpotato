Not really comfortable using Unstable&#x2F;Testing channels which my have newer version.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to download first time you want to install, coming from Ubuntu there is just one x64 .iso and one big &quot;download&quot; button that auto select the right file. In Debian i had to google which file to download from CDs and DVDs version just for x64.<p>And there is the install UI, it give you a 2006 vibe.<p>This small things are easy to fix but still there for some reason, probably because they focus on core and more important stuff, but this are great things to have for new users.')
