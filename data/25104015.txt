I just have to listen to the Qanon dudes themselves. Of course they are convinced they are dissenters exposing the corruption in Big Pizza. Heroes, I&#x27;m sure.<p>Again you keep on strawmanning by saying that everyone is a crazy and ignoring the very prescient point about dissent. It is very tiresome when people engage like you do.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the funny part. You keep bringing up this Big Media Telling You Who Is Real thing like Big Brother is in charge when I kinda don&#x27;t really need Big Brother.<p>Then why are you repeating what they say point for point? Odd that.<p>&gt; When this guy comes walking up to me saying that Joe Biden has a secret sex dungeon where he keeps children he abuses that he farms using mutant tadpoles<p>I am 100% certain this event didn&#x27;t happen. So you are basing your stance on a falsehood. That must be fallacious.')
