I felt great about it when I ordered it, but now I&#x27;m agonizing over whether to cancel and get an M1 MacBook Air instead. I&#x27;ll probably be using the laptop for 4-5 years, and I&#x27;m concerned that anything with a current-gen Intel chip is going to feel like &quot;legacy tech&quot; for most of that time.<p>Amazing how the M1 has changed the landscape. If the MacBook Air could handle 2 external displays, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even hesitate.')
