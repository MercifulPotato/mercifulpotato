Then you think it must be a good strategy, because it&#x27;s complicated to you. This is a very common fallacy I&#x27;ve noticed reading about &quot;options strategies&quot; by extreme amateurs: because the options strategy is complicated, I am smart for understanding it (at a basic level) and thus it must be a good strategy. They don&#x27;t hold up to scrutiny:<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll just sell 10% OTM weekly calls on this stock until I get assigned, then I&#x27;ll sell OTM puts until I get assigned again.&quot; -&gt; You can lose money selling puts. Pays less than investing in the S&amp;P 500 unless you pick a stock with high volatility, which is more likely to hit. No free lunch.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll sell covered calls on SPY and if they get close to expiring ITM, I will buy back the options and start over&quot; -&gt; If you backtested this, it performs worse than holding SPY. You won&#x27;t backtest this though, and feel smart for spending so much thought on a losing strategy.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll enter some hideously complex, multi-leg position. Because it&#x27;s complex, and I&#x27;m smart for understanding it, it must be good.&quot; -&gt; No.<p>&quot;I found an arbitrage opportunity.&quot; -&gt; If you&#x27;re not using computers, 99.99% chance you didn&#x27;t. If you did, it&#x27;s probably very small. Or it&#x27;s due to some misunderstanding like the fact that American options can get exercised early.')
