And the benefits of tools that both unified and abstracted layout construction, like Tailwind, became immediately obvious.<p>Shameless plug: I talk more about a lot of these mindset shifts and how they&#x27;ve helped me finally feel like I truly understand CSS in a book I&#x27;m working on called &quot;How To Debug CSS&quot; [1].<p>It goes over not only the mindset shifts that have helped me gain a decent level of mastery over CSS, but also shows you how to solve the 50+ most common issues that you&#x27;ll come across when developing with it.
