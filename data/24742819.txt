There&#x27;s a favourite professor of mine, teaching evolutionary psychology. He always reminds students that there are many models that can explain something - like why did the chicken crossed the road - from chemistry to motivation theories.<p>This article seems to argue that because we don&#x27;t have a good enough model to explain the experience of free will, therefore free will does not exist. Pack it up boys. Also - neurology deals with disorders of the nervous system. And when somebody tries to write a scientific article and relies on arguments such as &quot;makes no sense&quot; - just wow.<p>Note: I research what is called behavioural causality. And in my subjective experience the concept of free will has less and less relevance. As the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded - just try to have the same conversation with somebody on a full stomach or hungry. We may not realise this, most of the time we are unaware. Our will is influenced by our contexts, internal chemistry, stimuli we were exposed to all our lives.<p>It is arrogant, if not delusional, to think that in an universe where everything is connected, somehow the human mind found a way to break free and be... something else - influencing the world but without being influenced back. Like that doesn&#x27;t break the laws of physics!<p>&#x2F;rant')
