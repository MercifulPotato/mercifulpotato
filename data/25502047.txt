Item(by='JasonFruit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608602293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501915, text='&gt; The funny thing about free speech is it needs to be policed.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with that â€” &#x27;policed&#x27; and &#x27;free&#x27; are really practically opposites.  I wonder if a better formulation is &quot;free speech needs to be parented&quot;: that is, subjected to social pressure by people who have the maturity to exercise their freedom with wisdom.<p>If I could figure out how to <i>encourage</i> communities to develop in ways that encourage parenting, rather than subjecting them to imposed policing, I&#x27;d have a potential product on my hands.  I haven&#x27;t got that figured out, though.')
