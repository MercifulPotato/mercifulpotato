That&#x27;s an onerous requirement for anyone who does want to live in such a community.<p><i>&gt; the idea that local interests should have the power to block community changes is directly responsible for many prescient issues</i><p>I think you mean &quot;present&quot; issues.<p>The problem I see is the idea that local interests should have no power to block the grandiose plans of politicians and bureaucrats who won&#x27;t have to live with the results. At least in the case described in the article you linked to, the city manager, as far as I can tell, was also a resident, so he had skin in the game.<p>I note, btw, that the project mentioned in the article was allowed by zoning rules.')
