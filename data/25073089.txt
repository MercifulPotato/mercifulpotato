Garfield is a great example. Garfield&#x27;s initial popularity stemmed from him being a sharp turn from the cat depicted as the &quot;cute, lovable pet&quot;. He was fat, judgmental, and sarcastic. Countless movies, TV shows, commercials, etc. have watered Garfield down to just a  face that means nothing. Maybe there are still a lucky 10,000 for Garfield but they&#x27;re not getting that same experience.')
