I work in a company that had only few stated rules and operated under the assumption, that people had a common sense of what is right and what should not be done. The implicit rules were actually working quite well.<p>At least up to a point where some people clearly, but mostly not openly acted as if these unwritten rules don&#x27;t apply to them. And these transgressions were not dealt with from management even when they became aware of it.<p>Was a shitty situation if one was trapped in such a bubble within the organisation.<p>Fast forward being acquired by a global corporation with an endless amount of rules and regulations. Nobody reads them. Everybody knows the important ones. Nonetheless nobody really cares in the global corp.<p>Exactly what I see happening in our part of this global org now starting. A sad situation.')
