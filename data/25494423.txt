It&#x27;s 100% the investors&#x27; fault. They pushed CDPR to release the game ASAP and immediately after the release started bitching about how the game is broken... The Investor Call transcripts on the CDPR website make for some... interesting reading.<p>And if I may offer a personal opinion, they should&#x27;ve focused on PC and next-gen consoles and left the last-gen port to an external company who specialize in this kind of thing...')
