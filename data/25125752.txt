They primarily only used the 5950X in single-core tests, and in those tests it doesn&#x27;t come remotely close to 105W.<p>That’s true but keep in mind this is the power going into the AMD CPU only.  The power number measured for the mini was the entire system power pulled from the wall, so that 28W included memory, conversion inefficiencies and everything.  That’s crazy.')
