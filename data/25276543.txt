You can replace the designer with a developer with design experience. It&#x27;s far from impossible.<p>One of the coolest I did was when I was lead dev in a university and our CSS for the teacher&#x2F;student dashboard was less than 20k. I used ASP.NET WebForms components, and we didn&#x27;t have too much variety in terms of components. It looked pretty good for the time (2012) and it was also responsive and teachers&#x2F;students added it to their iPhone&#x2F;Android screen.<p>Another one was a web version of a Windows Desktop App. Also didn&#x27;t use Bootstrap, but got it done pretty quickly. Bootstrap wouldn&#x27;t work for us since we had to keep the look and feel of a native app.<p>I&#x27;ve also transitioned one app that had more than 1MB of minified css to less than 100kb, which is not exactly small but it&#x27;s still one order of magnitude less. The trick was vendoring the three third-party frameworks we were using and removing everything we weren&#x27;t using, and also using PurifyCSS to detect unused nodes and deleting them. Then we refactored to put the CSS back into Vue.js components and voila.<p>A lot of people in HN will say it&#x27;s a huge waste of time but our market was a 3rd world country, so it made a lot of financial sense for us to make me waste a week on that. One of the most fun and rewarding experiences I ever had. I wish most developers weren&#x27;t so bullish about not wanting to spend time optimizing this stuff.')
