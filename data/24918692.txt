I remember talking with a senior engineering exec I knew at Netflix quite a few years ago now and he made a comment along the lines of &quot;People come to Netflix for the movies and they stay for the shows.&quot; (This was before House of Cards etc.) It may have once been better than today, but Netflix never had a great (streaming) film catalog.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that there are relatively comprehensive film catalogs on Amazon and Apple modulo streaming service exclusives and various older content. You just have to pay for it. The financial reality is that you&#x27;re not going to get all the video content ever created for one low $10&#x2F;month fee.')
