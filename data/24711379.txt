Of course, a $1K PC will outperform any of these consoles given enough time :)<p>GPU is important for sure, but I think storage performance is as important, since load times and stuttering take me out of the game in a way slightly worse graphics wouldn&#x27;t (purely my opinion). From what I can tell, equivalent I&#x2F;O for the price is still a ways off on the PC side. One also has to be careful to factor in time spent purchasing and building; I do not value my time at $0.<p>Trying to look at this all objectively... appreciate the input so far!')
