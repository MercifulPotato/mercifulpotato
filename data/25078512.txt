But, inasmuch as an interpretation of the intended effect centered around meaning is appropriate at all, I think the literal meaning is the closest.<p>&gt; How many times have you said something along the lines of &quot;I will kill you if you put that picture of me on Instagram!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not even remotely analogous to what Bannon did here. He wasn&#x27;t personally and privately addressing the person who was the subject in a context (whether immediate or through a preexisting relationship) that undermined the literal meaning of the expression. His act differed on literally every meaningful aspect from that.')
