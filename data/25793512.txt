That person used to be Steve Jobs. It&#x27;s pretty well known that Tim Cook is hands off when it comes to product design. And Jony Ive used to have heated arguments with Scott Forestall - until he was fired because of the whole Apple Maps thing.<p>So for a good chunk of time Jony Ive had no one to rein him in and the result was minimalism run amok.
