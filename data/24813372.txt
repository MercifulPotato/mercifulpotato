Has it ever been more than a niche curiosity?<p>There was actually a fair amount of momentum behind Esperanto in the 1920s.  The League of Nations seriously considered adopting it as their official language of business and was also considering recommending that member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula.  The only real opposition was from the French, who wanted to preserve their language as the language of diplomacy, and vetoed these proposals.<p>But by the late 1930s that momentum had faded away and totalitarian governments (particularly Germany and the Soviet Union) began to suppress Esperanto.')
