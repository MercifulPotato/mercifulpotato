It serves the purpose of showing people absurdity of the concept of revelation and divine inspiration. I use the Book of Mozilla as the religious scripture in my parody religion. My answer to question &quot;How do this verses get written?&quot; is &quot;People add to them from time to time&quot;. I still use it in the religious discussions I engage in.')
