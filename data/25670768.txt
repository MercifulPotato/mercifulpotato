WhatsApp recently rolled out Payments feature in India. In fact WhatsApp for Business is pretty good for SME to conduct business in India. Some of the shops that I went to India has paperless receipts and digital payments thru WhatsApp and UPI. They ask your WhatsApp number by default and sends you the receipt on WhatsApp. I find that very convenient as a customer. The horse has left the barn. Good luck asking people to switch to Signal or Telegram there. Switching to others will only help in making a political statement but wont help in mass adoption at least in those countries.')
