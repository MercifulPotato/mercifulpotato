Item(by='LittlePeter', descendants=None, kids=[25713867], score=None, time=1610278279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25699967, text='The author says that the difference between ETL and ELT is that ETL extracts data from a system with well-established schema while ELT can handle schemaless data.<p>I thought the difference between ETL and ELT was that ETL does the transformations outside the system where the data is eventually loaded, while ELT does the transformations inside the system where the data is loaded. It has nothing to do with whether the data has a schema or not. An ETL process can work perfectly with schemaless data.<p>I also found the language of the author to be a bit abstract with few examples. I could not understand some paragraphs.<p>Then there is this unnecessary comparison with the whales.<p>The author also self-cites their 4 other articles.<p>Overall I did not like the article.')
