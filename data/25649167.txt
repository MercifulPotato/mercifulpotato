It is incredible how Apple can launch a major UI overhaul (which I think looks great) while Microsoft has more or less the same look as Windows did when 10 first launched (granted it has gotten some good features since then.)<p>Edit: this thread is full of Linux stans (I use Linux too!) calling Windows a POS... I don&#x27;t see how that is helpful or relevant to anything. Windows is actually...very good. It has some problems, but uh, using Linux and even MacOS, every OS has its share of problems&#x2F;difficulties.')
