To me, it is a &quot;scam&quot; that a trillion dollar company like Apple avoids putting up activation servers in India because it is more profitable to not do so and just make the indian user pay an international SMS everytime.<p>It is also a &quot;scam&quot; to me that Apple insists that I can only install everything from the App Store, where as apps would actually be cheaper for all of us if Apple didn&#x27;t take a cut from the developer. (And I can go on ... but we have to live with the reality of the world don&#x27;t we - Apple isn&#x27;t going to give up control over their App Store just as carriers will keep trying to monetise on SMS or RCS.)')
