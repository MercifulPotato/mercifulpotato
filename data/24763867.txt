Happy to be corrected.<p>A process is given a connection from a pool when it requests the connection and holds it until it relinquishes the connection regardless of whether the process was in the logic or data access portions of their lifecycle. It is up to you as the developer to ask for the connection and to return it on an as-needed basis...Which is exactly what you should be doing in a lambda as well.<p>Just because a lambda container is persistent does not mean the connection given to it is stuck to that lambda even after that lambda returns the connection.')
