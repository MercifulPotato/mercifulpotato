Will that be the fault of the passengers in the car? Or the car&#x27;s manufacturer? The school bus&#x27;s manufacturer?<p>This infrastructure will need distributed two-phase commit. For safety-critical issues like school buses, eventual consensus won&#x27;t be good enough. And then you&#x27;ll need an infrastructure that detects when an older or simply defective car is present but not participating in the protocol. These problems are all solvable, but they&#x27;re by no means trivial.')
