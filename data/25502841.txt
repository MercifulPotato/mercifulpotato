That feels like a disgrace.<p>Eh, depends on the comment. I recently saw a particularly erroneous comment about COVID-19, so I checked the poster&#x27;s comment history to see whether it was worth trying to engage them in good faith, or just post a dry correction for others to see. I then saw this comment posted earlier that day:<p>&gt; I don’t know if it’s blacks in general that are just retarded or if it’s balcks coupled with the history of slavery that makes them so useless and violent, either way I think this country would be VASTLY better off without them.<p>...I think it&#x27;s pretty fair to label them based off of that one comment. For content that abhorrent, any number of occurrences above zero is enough to tell what kind of person a user is.')
