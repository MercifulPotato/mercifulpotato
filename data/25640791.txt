Running unsigned code doesn&#x27;t exist on MacOS anymore with Big Sur, unless you self-sign everything. Stop kernel development (going to be &quot;higher friction&quot; going forward) and a daemon to delete self-signed code, and it&#x27;s iOS.<p>Allowing neutral parties to do app-signing for Chromebooks, Windows 10 S or i&#x2F;MacOS (the way SSL-certs are issued and trusted by browsers, Mozilla App Store anyone?), alternative app stores (iOS), alternative signed-OSes on hardware (Occulus) are all Ulysses pacts that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and others could do.')
