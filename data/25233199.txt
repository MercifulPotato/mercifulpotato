I was just using 75% and 20 employees because that is the best estimate we got.  The article also stated clearly that 8 Black employees were part of the PDX group.<p>The Coinbase rebuttal was worded very specifically.<p>&gt;only three of these people filed complaints during their time at Coinbase.<p>The New York Times wasn&#x27;t being as narrow with their counting and they said:<p>&gt;11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment<p>There is obvious middle ground between these two quotes.  11 people complained to their manager or HR at some point including potentially after they left the company however only 3 filed official complaints while working there.  Keep in mind that simply complaining about something to a coworker isn&#x27;t the same thing as &quot;filing&quot; a complaint.<p>If this middle ground scenario transpired as I described, doesn&#x27;t the NYT&#x27;s recounting sound much closer to the truth than CB&#x27;s?  Also ask yourself who has a bigger incentive to stretch the truth here.  Is it the newspaper that could instead report on literally anything else or the company that is being accused of discrimination?')
