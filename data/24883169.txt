(Long before getting locked out) bob nominates user alice as <i>trustee</i> for his account.<p>Then bob gets locked out due to losing his e-mail address. Because he nominated at least one trustee, he now has the option of recovering through one of them.<p>Bob select alice and hits a button. Alice gets the validation e-mail.  The e-mail tells alice something like this:<p><i>&quot;User bob is having difficulty accessing the system, and is trying to validate his password with a new e-mail address which is bob123@example.com.  Do you know bob, and can you vouch for this being a correct e-mail address for bob? You are receiving this e-mail because user bob has previously nominated and authorized you to assist in this way.&quot;</i><p>If alice takes affirmative action to vouch for bob, then bob receives the password recovery mail at the new bob123@example.com address and can complete the usual flow.')
