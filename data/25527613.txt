Then I picked it up again in my 40&#x27;s and it did stick. I needed a distraction in my life. I used free youtube guitar teachers such as justin guitar and found songs to play along with. Initially I used tabs (written guides for what strings&#x2F;positions to play) and eventually was able to figure out songs by ear. Most recently I&#x27;ve switched to bass guitar and am having a blast. I play most days. I think the  most important thing is to have fun with whatever instrument you pick. When listening to the radio I listen for songs that have a good bass line. When I hear one I send myself a message or add a bookmark and try to play it later.')
