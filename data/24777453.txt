But to my way of thinking, it&#x27;s a decision with short-term <i>and long-term</i> business impact.<p>Longer term, it makes me less interested in starting to watch a series produced by that company, because of higher odds of ending up frustrated &#x2F; disappointed. And it reduces the likelihood of me continuing to subscribe that service or recommend it to friends and family.<p>I also wonder what the impact on leaving a series unresolved has on its long-term syndication revenue.<p>Of course I&#x27;m just speculating. Depending on the actual numbers, perhaps those long-term downsides are completely acceptable.')
