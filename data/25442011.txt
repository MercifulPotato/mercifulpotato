In algorithms if you only taught the best algo for a particular problem, you&#x27;d lose everyone on the first day, and miss out on a lot of analysis&#x2F;teaching opportunities. Remember that algorithms study isn&#x27;t just about speed, it&#x27;s actually about _correctness_ first.<p>Besides, it&#x27;s pretty rare for someone to need to write their own sorting algorithm anyway, in production. And if they do but they&#x27;re so addled they do it from memory and randomly pick bubblesort, hey at least it&#x27;s fairly easy to be correct.')
