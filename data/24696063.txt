I talk to my neighbors and ask them when they wont be home or when would be a good time to do X hours of work.<p>Most of the time they say don&#x27;t worry about it as long as it&#x27;s not past like 9pm or before 10am. I extend the same courtesy to my neighbors in turn. Just communicate and be reasonable.')
