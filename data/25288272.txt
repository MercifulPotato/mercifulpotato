Item(by='notsureaboutpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606999289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25287483, text='As someone who lived in Saudi and has relatives there, most of these comments are far far off the mark (Saudi has been diversifying for years, they won&#x27;t be reliant on oil when it stops being as profitable, and that&#x27;s also decades and decades away).<p>But this one takes the cake. Haha, they are allowing women to participate for money? Women already participated in Saudi economically from a long time back. They make up a large part of the Aramco workforce. Don&#x27;t confuse allowing women to drive and repealing qawwam system with &quot;allowing women to participate economically&quot;. Women didn&#x27;t need to drive to participate they could just have their drivers drive them around (as is common anyways).<p>Also, Saudi is a conservative society, and the royals are more liberal than the populace (like everywhere in the world). Most people in Saudi dislike these reforms. The royals embark on them to please their allies in Europe and America and Israel as they hope to connect their economies more (they&#x27;ve already invested lots into these places with their sovereign wealth fund and want to protect their investments).<p>HN gets things surprisingly wrong when it comes to non Western places, but this is far off even for those standards!')
