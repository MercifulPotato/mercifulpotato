Just because the UI doesn&#x27;t look like it was designed by a committee of boomers and is instead pleasant to look at and use, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &quot;gameified&quot; somehow. I&#x27;ve had a RH account for years, and the only &quot;gameification&quot; I&#x27;ve ever seen was the little game they had to get off the wait list for their debit card (perish the thought!). Actually trading and evaluating stocks or other assets is nearly the same as what you&#x27;d get on Etrade or whatever, just displayed more pleasantly and without fees.<p>Also, does anyone really believe that we would be better off if everyone were paying transaction fees for trades? The door for HFTs buying trading data is open and can&#x27;t easily be closed (unless there were regulatory action, which seems unlikely), so what good does it do anyone to pay fees if she can avoid it?<p>The whole article just seems like an unfocused attack on finance as a whole, whether the anger is justified or not.')
