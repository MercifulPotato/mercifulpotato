Some technical patterns for some asset classes in some situations (such as belonging to a strong industry group) do, in fact, give an advantage.  Here&#x27;s an example:<p>If a securities chart has been trending downward and the price is below its 50-period moving average (50PMA), the price action cannot change to a rapid and significant upturn <i>without crossing above the 50PMA</i> .  Although this does not mean that all crosses above the 50PMA will result in rapid and significant gains, a system such as this could be used to test whether such a strategy provides enough of an advantage over time.  It can also be used to test one&#x27;s reflexes to make the trade at the proper time. AND also used to test one&#x27;s reflexes to get out of the trade if it does not continue moving in the anticipated direction.')
