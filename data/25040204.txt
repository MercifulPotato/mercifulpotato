I&#x27;ll be upgrading from a Pixel 2, and had a Nexus 7 before that. My purchase cadence seems different than what I perceive to be typical for iPhone users in particular.<p>For me, mmWave seems like a nice to have future-proofing feature.<p>And this reads like a sales pitch crafted specifically for me:<p><i>There&#x27;s no squeeze to activate the Google Assistant, no &quot;Project Soli&quot; hand-waving air gestures, and no Face ID style facial recognition. The only thing you get for biometrics is the tried-and-true rear capacitive fingerprint reader, which works great. There&#x27;s no headphone jack and no microSD slot, but there are two features you might not normally find in the midrange market: wireless charging and IP68-rated dust and water resistance.</i><p>...strangely negative review for a product that seems like a step in the right direction in a number of areas.')
