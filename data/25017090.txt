All you had to do was look at the fact that even though Trump won the early red states, he was not performing as well as he did in 2016. There was a lot made out of FL going for Trump early on, and he was in fact up there compared to 2016. But that was pretty much one of the only places he was. He ran down 3 in TX, down 5 in GA, down 2 in NC, down 2 in IA, down 4 in WY, down almost 7 in MT and KS, down 7 in ME, down 7 in NH.<p>All told by the end of Tuesday he was down in 30+ states (as it is settling now, he&#x27;s down in 38 states compared to his 2016 margin). He won PA, MI, and WI by less than a point each in 2016. So if Trump was seeing shifts of 3 away from him in Texas, it didn&#x27;t take a psychic to know he&#x27;d be losing those states he won at such a small margin.<p>If you looked at the numbers in PA on Wednesday morning, what you saw were tons out outstanding ballots in Lehigh, Bucks, Monroe, Philadelphia, and Allegheny counties, all counties that went for Clinton in 2016. You combine that with the fact that Democrats returned mail-in ballots at a rate of 65% compared to 23% for Republicans, and this thing seemed inevitable since about Wednesday morning.')
