Are they a section, platoon or company level tool? Do they sit with the platoon commander? Having them with Corporals may make sense though \nthat may be too far forward and lose some benefits plus overload them in contact. At the same time they could be very useful in a number of scenarios. I read somewhere the US Marines are testing adding a systems operator to be beside the Signaller in Platon HQ.')
