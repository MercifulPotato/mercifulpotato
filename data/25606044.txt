A second-order digital filter requires what, about 4 stores, recalls, and multiplies per sample? This would seem to be in the same level of complexity as six carrier&#x2F;modulator interactions; you have to do a multiply to do a lookup after all. Or is the issue that the multiplies had to be 12-16 bit?<p>For microprocessors in 1983, multiply instructions, if they existed at all, involved a lot of shift and add cycles.  That took a long time.<p>A simple filter might need 4 multiplies and accumulates.  Times 44,000 times a second, for each sample.  Times the number of voices; 16 in the case of the DX7.<p>Now you are easily over a million multiplies a second.<p>And even though the original DX7 is 12 bits, I think you&#x27;d need those multiplies to be 16x16 bits for accumulated error issues.<p>So the DX7 was an alternative to having to implement digital filters in 1983 technology.  They could introduce a digital synth at a very reasonable price.')
