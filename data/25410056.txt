Fedora&#x2F;Centos&#x2F;RHEL have debug packages though, so the symbols are available for most software that you&#x27;ve got on your machine. GDB prints out a message reminding you to install them, but doesn&#x27;t actually do it for you. We also have PolicyKit, so in principle GDB could just ask for those packages to be installed. We should close the gap, and while we&#x27;re at it we should make PolicyKit not ask for the root password when installing debug packages. Then it could be a seamless process, at least for software installed from the official packages.')
