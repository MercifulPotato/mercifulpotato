I try not to say uninteresting stuff that people are likely tired of hearing (_new haircut?_) but I mess it up all the time.<p>If a barista or anyone else was truly trying to shame me for drinking decaf, I think I’d find another place for coffee. Back before the virus, when I worked in an office, half (or more) of the pleasure of going for coffee was friendly human contact. Or, bonus points if you want to gently correct the person; as I said above I mess stuff up all the time and appreciate when a friend makes me see when I’ve been unintentionally rude.')
