Those messages have to be thought up by someone.<p>Thats not facebook&#x27;s fault. thats the fault of political discourse.<p>The Pro EU side _lost_ because they failed to follow the standard rules of election winning: Make the other side seem like they are going to make you poorer, or less patriotic (or both)<p>They spent their time shouting at the sceptics calling them racists. Waffling on about economics, never emotion, never empathy, Never ambition.<p>Much as its comforting to think that the likes of russia, google facebook and china are at fault, its really not the fault of advertising.')
