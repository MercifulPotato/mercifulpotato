The fact they won&#x27;t automate it is because automating it would lose them money. More people would make claims. Most people give up on claims after time. Literally, we stop caring after a while, so the longer the process takes and the more effort it takes the more people drop off. Airlines make it as hard as possible to make a claim because otherwise they would lose more money. I thought it was very well known this is why Airlines have such painful claims processes.')
