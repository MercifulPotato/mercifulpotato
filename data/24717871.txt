As always, it depends.<p>Sometimes there is value in documentation (or whatever unchecked types in fancy languages), especially for stuff that is read a lot more, by other people, or yourself in the future.<p>For a lot of stuff there is no point in writing documentation. For example, if the code is obvious and pedestrian. Or if you&#x27;ll just throw away everything, or refactor a month later.<p>And very often, writing documentation is not only a waste of time, but downright harmful, because code and documentation easily diverge.<p>My personal advice (not just for documentation) is to strive on the side of doing as little as you can get away with, and only introduce structure and bureaucracy if there&#x27;s a clear indication that it&#x27;s required.')
