I think falling prey to the occasional (hopefully not life-destroying) deception is part of the cost of being an easy to work with and trusting person. There are people who will take advantage of you, but most won&#x27;t. On the balance, this leads to better relationships and a better life. OTOH you can be cynical and questioning of every persons&#x27; motives, and that can make many normal interactions exhausting, at work and in social contexts. It can add an edge to you that most people do not like.<p>The ideal would be to have perfect, instant judgement of character, knowing when to be open or closed with people in various contexts. That&#x27;s the hardest of all, and comes from having great parents&#x2F;mentors and making lots of mistakes.')
