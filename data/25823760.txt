The primary goal was to learn how to make a real-site that can also scale.\nYes, there were a few interesting problems, especially how to make it support a large load; the solution has been to use socket.io and Redis. I&#x27;m thinking about writing a blog post about it.\nI&#x27;m validating all usernames, for now I don&#x27;t have problems caused by ASCII characters.\nFor now the website is supporting well the loads. client and server communicate via websockets (using socket.io), and this drastically reduce requests. Moreover, I&#x27;m using NGINX as a load balancer to further improved the load support.')
