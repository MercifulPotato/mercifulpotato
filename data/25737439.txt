Many Republican officials and judges affirmed it, even under intense and illegal pressure from the President and his cadre.<p>So if the Russian government and Russian courts decide their election was fair and just, should Amazon shut down any websites which counter that viewpoint?<p>Because that&#x27;s the precedent we are presumably setting.<p>&gt; The severity of insurrection in US legal code is such that the military may be deployed domestically, and those service members who abetted it are guilty of an offense whose primary punishment in the UCMJ is death.<p>Yep, same in Russia for questioning election. You get sent to gulag. Or in China - what do you mean you are talking about Taiwan being it&#x27;s own independent country in a group chat?<p>&gt; This platform was used to coordinate an insurrection against the United States Government, and refused to act against those doing so.<p>Most of the coordination actually happened on Facebook, not Parler.
