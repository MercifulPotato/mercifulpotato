Item(by='tromp', descendants=None, kids=[25385107], score=None, time=1607679170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383290, text='&gt; There may still be a truth of the matter about the value of `BB(800)`<p>The reason for independence of ZFC is that ZFC fails to prove &quot;TM M doesn&#x27;t halt&quot;, for some non-halting 800-state Turing Machine M. It has no problem proving the halting of the busy beaver machine in BB(800) steps.<p>Unlike the birth-time of Caesar, BB(800) is still well-defined and an &quot;exact figure&quot;, because we consider the notion of whether any particular Turing Machine halts or not to be well-defined.')
