I&#x27;m open to modern non-medieval ideas even for violent crimes.  I don&#x27;t have the answers there, but I wish there were more people caring about this.  So far it seems to be only the far left (I don&#x27;t consider that an insult) and anarcho-capitalists, but I wish more people that fall into the middle somewhere (like myself) would think about this.  Usually people don&#x27;t think about stuff that affects strangers all that much until it affects them or a loved one.  That&#x27;s a people problem in general and I don&#x27;t know how to solve it either.')
