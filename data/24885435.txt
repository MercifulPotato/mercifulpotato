The cost of retrofitting, say, the London Underground to be fully wheelchair accessible would easily reach into the tens of billions. (New capital projects tend to have accessibility baked inâ€”so the DLR, built in the 80s, is extremely accessible, as is the renovated bits of the Jubilee Line, and Crossrail will be.)<p>The &quot;reasonable adjustments&quot; don&#x27;t necessarily need to be providing physical access adjustments like ramps&#x2F;lifts. For instance, when I was in university, one of the students on my course was in a wheelchair, and they relocated all lectures, tutorials and seminars he was in to ensure they were all in the rooms that were wheelchair accessible.<p>There is some EU legislation that tries to unify accessibility rules across the different countries though. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;social&#x2F;main.jsp?catId=1202" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;social&#x2F;main.jsp?catId=1202</a>')
