Never had to make a longish unexpected trip because of a family emergency? Never had to work 2 jobs to make ends meet?</i><p>I&#x27;ve had to do all of those things. At some times in my life, I&#x27;ve had the first and last for an extended period. To my knowledge, I have never as a result driven in a condition that made me unsafe behind the wheel, though.<p>Yours is another comment that talks about people doing what they need to do to survive, which is an ironic characterisation given we&#x27;re talking about behaviour that is borderline suicidal.')
