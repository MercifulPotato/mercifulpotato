The Japanese labor force participation rate for 15-64 year-olds rose from about 70% in 1990 to 79% in 2020, as estimated by the International Labour Organization. In that time frame, it overtook China and the US (both have falling labor force participation rates) and the only other country with a similar trajectory I could find is Germany. Most other countries I tried have much lower rates.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SL.TLF.ACTI.ZS?locations=JP-US-KR-HK-CN-FR-DE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.worldbank.org&#x2F;indicator&#x2F;SL.TLF.ACTI.ZS?location...</a>')
