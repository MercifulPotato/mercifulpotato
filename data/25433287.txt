But I don&#x27;t really see the wholesale abandonment of a 100 year old form of entertainment just because we couldn&#x27;t do it for a month. Theaters may start to look <i>different</i> over the next couple years, but people enjoy going to the movies. We might see a tendency toward smaller theaters. Maybe more will start serving food and drinks. Maybe we&#x27;ll see a wider adoption of strict rules against talking &amp; cellphones a la Alamo Drafthouse, since those are basically the two things that will truly ruin the show for people.<p>Basically, theater buildings are already built. Projectors are already installed, and film reels are out there. Even if the big studios decided that all new movies are going straight to streaming, the back catalog of amazing movies is HUGE: I would happily go several times a year to a nice theater that showed the old classics. I saw 2001 last year, projected from a 70mm print, and it was fantastic (even though the incompetent AMC theater couldn&#x27;t get the house lights shut off for the first half)')
