The most visible users will be those who post a lot.  And those who are depressed because their life sucks and they don&#x27;t have much valuable stuff to do, or those who aren&#x27;t doing much valuable stuff because their depression makes it too hard, are likely to have a lot of time during which posting on the site seems like the best available activity.<p>It seems really difficult to separate causality here.  Which is something that disappoints me about the article.  The string &quot;caus&quot; does not occur on the webpage; three of the four bullet points say &quot;associated&quot;, and the only bullet point that uses a causative-sounding phrase (&quot;were protective of&quot;) sounds like it may be used to mean another <i>statistical association</i> rather than an <i>established causation</i>.  Clicking through to the study, it seems to be 100% based on association of results that they got via surveys.')
