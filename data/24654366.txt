I am not competent enough to judge either way on this. I am currently back to C++ for a project that is written in C++. If it were C, I would try to write small pieces in Zig. I guess Rust could be used, but I am nervous about the scope of work I would be taking on - learning Rust, getting familiar with a C++ codebase, etc.')
