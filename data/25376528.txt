There is no universally superior language. There are a number of competing factors which means that optimizing for one sacrifices others. So instead of a single point in space that maximizes all of them, there is instead a volume bounded by a curve and going farther in one direction requires lower values on other axes.<p><i>But</i>, there is a <i>lot</i> of space nowhere near that trade-off optimizing boundary. You can absolutely make languages <i>worse</i> in ways that are strictly negative for all users. For historical reasons, all languages contain some amount of that dead weight. So the absense of a perfect language does not imply that all existing languages are right at the edge of the optimizing boundary.')
