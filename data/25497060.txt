Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608571467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496402, text='&gt; this is an extremely privileged take, or at least naive take, on what these loans do<p>&gt; For many underpriv&#x27;d students, that network-buy is life changing.<p>I think that the belief that federally subsidized student loans need to &#x2F;not&#x2F; go away is in and of itself a naive take -- about as naive as believing you can &quot;buy&quot; access to a network. These students you are talking about are not buying a network -- they are buying a signal and a brand. But the signal and the brand don&#x27;t necessarily unlock access to the network, nor the presumed career opportunities that should unlock.<p>And why should it? After all, if universities wanted explicitly justify the expenditure in careerist terms, they&#x27;d offer the ISA-style funding arrangements that most reputable code academies offer. But they don&#x27;t. You should ask yourself why that&#x27;s the case, and why for many of these underpriv&#x27;d students you mention, this is a very expensive lesson they learn the hard way. You should ask yourself what happens when the student slips through the cracks and ends up with no job and a ton of debt. You should ask yourself if the whole thing is a scam -- because if this scenario doesn&#x27;t make you imagine it might be one, I don&#x27;t know what will.')
