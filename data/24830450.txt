(I&#x27;m kidding, napster was great and nothing better has yet replaced it.)<p>As time goes on this lag will reduce and the problem becomes how can I pay my bills?  But that&#x27;s a problem everybody (who doesn&#x27;t own a robo-omni-factory) shares with you.  So UBI baby.  (Universal Basic Income)  Star Trek.  Yay.')
