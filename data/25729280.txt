Which is pretty bad since it’s pretty easy to dispute what their AI is judging.  (Not scientifically, but the team really isn’t acting all that scientific by setting themselves up to be undisputable)<p>IMO I think this is likely to strongly apply to the US, since politics are regional. And which groups&#x2F;ethnicities settled where is regional as well.  (This also exists in Europe to some extent as well, IE: a German person can identify which part of Germany my family came from by my forehead).<p>Though the study claims the AI is judging people based on how often they smiled in life, how many children came before them, and whether they were exposed to alcohol or nicotine in the womb.')
