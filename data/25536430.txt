That is far too dry for most and you’ll likely miss key observations because you can’t possibly be up to speed with every context. In mainstream news the correspondent for X will helpfully add that knowledge to the story being reported so you can understand the new facts in context.<p>News as I’m thinking you’re meaning it, would be that model,  the facts and a curtailed context, often eliding the “for and against” arguments to go straight to a ready to consume conclusion that should neatly fit the reader’s prior preferences.<p>The exploration of the for and against is usually cut out of news since it sells better and costs less to produce.')
