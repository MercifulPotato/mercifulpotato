Expect some serious inflation to happen in the next few years.<p>I think you&#x27;re looking at M3?<p>Yes, currently 2.94T, up from 2.3T at the start of the year, so 22% of current money would be about 700B out of 3,000B.<p>From June 2007 to June 2008 went from 1.5T to 2.3T, so it was valid to say in June 2008 that &quot;34% of all US dollars that exist were created in the last year&quot;<p>On top of that M3 carried expanding:<p>From March 2007 to March 2009 went from 1.4 to 2.6T, where you could say &quot;half of all US dollars that exist were created in the last 2 years&quot;<p>Inflation from 1996 to 2006 was an average 2.54%<p>Inflation from 2006 to 2016 was an average 1.76%<p>So for the response to the pandemic, measured in M3, to have the same affect as the M3 from 2008, the US would have to create another $1.6T by January 2022. Then you could say &quot;half of all US dollars that exist were created in the last 2 years&quot;<p>So far the increase is 74B a month, or 1.8T over 2 years.')
