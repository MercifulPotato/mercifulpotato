Even in time-consuming environments with highly effectful languages it can mean the difference between pulling in and maintaining old&#x2F;archaic dependencies or not. I wish more of our static analysis tools for non-functional languages had better concepts of purity. There are so many places where it fails in languages without this concept. eg: Java annotations can change the behavior of a method from a simple getter to something else entirely with hooks to be used&#x2F;referenced at runtime.<p>One place I have found that static analysis fails is with API contexts. Either they get it wrong and offer to remove API elements or they get it less-wrong and just don&#x27;t touch anything that can be exported. Granted getting it right would require all usages of the API or a blessed list of things we know we want to keep ... in which case we are potentially back at our source code as a source of truth anyway.<p>Another interesting hole is &quot;do we keep code that is only referenced by tests?&quot; In some cases, it makes sense but it&#x27;s definitely a knob that the user needs to adjust manually so far as I have seen.')
