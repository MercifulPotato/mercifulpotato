They&#x27;re far from perfect and frankly weak in the US. There&#x27;s room for improvement for sure. And there are downsides - you&#x27;re committing to a permanently adversarial relationship with management. I&#x27;d argue that relationship often exists without workers even realizing it, but having now entered the world of highly-compensated professionals (and seeing that their management structures tend to be less authoritarian) I can see why people might shy away from that.<p>But the difference a union contract made in my day-to-day life when I was a grocery worker was astounding. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about retaliatory discipline. I had better wages, better healthcare and better vacation. And it built camaraderie among union members even if it damaged relationships with management. I&#x27;m proud of what we accomplished there.')
