The story already had major attention, significant front page time, and hundreds of comments. Having a second major discussion about the same story soon afterward is just what the [dupe] system is trying to prevent. Otherwise the front page would consist mostly of the same hot stories, repeated over and over. HN users definitely don&#x27;t want this, and such repetition is inconsistent with the mandate of the site: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=curiosity%20repetition%20by:da...</a><p>It&#x27;s true of course that for users who didn&#x27;t see the first thread, the second is not a duplicate at all. But we don&#x27;t have a good way to know who&#x27;s who, so we have to rely on a global approach, hopefully one which is simple and easily explicable. (This is in the FAQ under &quot;reposts&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsfaq.html</a>).<p>In the end, there&#x27;s nobody who sees all the threads on HN, or even all the major ones. Everyone misses tons of interesting material, but what it is varies for each person. This is a discoverability problem. Hopefully we can get better at solving it, but the solution is not to allow duplicates of major discussion, because that would just crowd out fresher interesting material.')
