(Polypropylene because it is not attacked by H2SO4.) But with such equipment on hand, making places to walk around is just a matter of construction.<p>Where, on Mars, would you walk to? There is noplace outside pleasant to be. It&#x27;s always colder than Antarctica, but with no water and no air.<p>Survival on another planet would be no picnic on the Cam, dirt underfoot or no.')
