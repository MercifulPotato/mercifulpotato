While commercial things can occasionally save money, they usually don&#x27;t. Furthermore, the TCO calculation has to take into account what you would have done with the same amount of money. Let&#x27;s pretend you buy a $2000 commercial grade widget instead of the $500 consumer grade widget. Over ten years of use, your commercial grade widget cost $100 in parts, running and maintenance costs, and depreciated to a value of $1800; during the same time, the consumer grade widget would have required about $50 in parts, running and maintenence but would have depreciated to a value of near zero.<p>So, you might think, your TCO of the commercial grade widget is $300 and the consumer grade is $550. Easy win for the commercial widget! But then factor in the potential uses of that extra $1500 upfront. Assuming you were earning an average of 3% on your cash during that period, you would have made $515 on 10 years&#x27; interest on $1500. Now, put your money into an index fund, and your returns would be (historically speaking) thousands of dollars.<p>(Before the inevitable comment, there are plenty of ways to earn a return on money that don&#x27;t involve an index fund. Investing in your home, high interest savings accounts, Treasuries, paying down any debt, etc etc.)<p>So you can easily see that for most things - where maintenance is cheap - it&#x27;s not worth it. This includes most white goods, almost all electronics, etc. Where maintenance is expensive, though, you can save a lot by buying commercial. The classical example is the Isuzu crew cab trucks: if you do need to haul a lot of stuff, they&#x27;re far cheaper in every way than comparable consumer options.')
