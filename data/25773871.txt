Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610614522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25768535, text='Yeah, and there&#x27;s Discord, which also has group chat with history, and a decent interface.<p>What Team Speak, Mumble, and especially Ventrilo have going for it is that they are more lightweight. However, Ventrilo has a strange latency which cannot be solved (except by moving on). Team Speak, Mumble, and Discord don&#x27;t suffer from this. Also, Ventrilo cannot be self-hosted (while Team Speak and Mumble can).')
