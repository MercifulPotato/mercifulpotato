That is männlich&#x2F;weiblich&#x2F;divers in German (m&#x2F;w&#x2F;d abbreviated, you will find it on every job posting or you face serious fines).<p>Most people call it männlich&#x2F;weiß&#x2F;deutsch already, which translates to male&#x2F;white&#x2F;German.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is a good initiative. Acceptance cannot be enforced and this is something that gets on peoples nerves. The gender activists constantly try to create new  spellings and words and I have never seen it adopted naturally aside from places where it is enforced.<p>Maybe it will come with time, but people only started to not give gender a second thought.<p>I also think this kind of legislation is created by people that are behind the general population on topics like gender, where everyone has their own opinions, which is completely fine.')
