I have no formal CS background and I&#x27;m arguably at the pinnacle of my career.<p>My biggest tip to anyone who wants to get started would be to find a project you love and then build it. But be extremely realistic. There&#x27;s no shame in building pong and then going to the process of releasing it on Android. If instead you want to build Tekken 8 super hitbox edition, you&#x27;re going to find yourself quickly frustrated as you bump into limitations of a time and skill. The enemy of good is perfection.<p>I&#x27;ll also say avoid getting involved in any projects where there&#x27;s tons of team members but you&#x27;re the only programmer, these people are going to ultimately end up thinking that despite not adding a whole lot they&#x27;re just as valuable as you are and you&#x27;ll grow to resent them.<p>My perfect side project team is generally myself as the programmer, and then a single artistic or business-minded partner. This partner will keep you grounded, and there&#x27;s a ton of validation which gets delivered once you ship it to them . However when you start dealing with teams of 10 or 12 people you have a bunch of these people throwing out their stupid ideas about how you need to build the best thing ever which needs to implement what took Facebook you know hundreds of millions of dollars to build. You&#x27;ll quickly get frustrated and you&#x27;ll ultimately leave the project.<p>Finally remember to enjoy this s<i></i>*, even if I was working at Starbucks I&#x27;d probably still work on games in my spare time. To be clear working on games in my spare time wow I was unemployed and dropping out of college is what led to my career today. Programming is a gift, oh yeah start with an easy language.<p>JS and Python being good choices. C# isn&#x27;t too bad assuming we&#x27;re talking about Unity and not traditional .net')
