Let&#x27;s see some screenshots of these cutting edge applications developed 15 years ago.  I&#x27;d love to see how you made them rich, interactive, and work across a wide variety of devices (mobile, tablets, workstations) with varying screen densities.  I&#x27;d also be curious how performant these applications were, how much data was being conveyed on screen, etc...
