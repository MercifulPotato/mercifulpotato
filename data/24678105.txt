Item(by='plastman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601810432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670746, text='was 12 yo. installed Windows 7 on our shitbox PC with 2005 tier hardware. but internet would not work (ancient ethernet driver for that chip with no updates for the changes that oocured with windows vista). I never knew how drivers worked. I just press install and it works. so I spent the next few years reading stuff. Now I understand a bit how these things work. and how operating systems work to some level.<p>Later on I got into programming because I wanted to impress my teacher with my visual basic.NET skills. (I had no prior programming experience at all and that course was in VB.NET). and then I discovered C++, C# (and what .NET actually is) and python. now I am a year away from graduating with a computer engineering degree.<p>I was introduced to linux through a friend. and used it for a bit and had it on some machines. and wrote some shell scripts to automate stuff. but I never fully embraced it. as I would only install it on machines struggling with Windows. either due to aging or faulty hardware. I know about what makes linux &quot;better&quot; and how one customize it to the kernel level. but Windows is simply a better workstation OS regardless of the great amounts of bazinga we hear nowadays. linux on server&#x2F;embedded systems is greatness however.')
