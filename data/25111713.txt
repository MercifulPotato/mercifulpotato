The incessant drone of “Apple owns its users and they’re basically slaves to their own devices” is what annoys people so much.<p>There is no such thing as a perfect computer. Every purchase involves tradeoffs, including Linux. I, personally, started out on Macs in late 1995 and then switched to Windows in 2002. A few years later I switched to Linux and then ran Arch until summer 2017. I switched back to Macs with a MacBook in fall 2017, just as I began university.<p>Why did I switch back to Mac after all those years learning Linux? Because I was tired of my computer breaking all the time. I wanted something that would just keep working and not randomly boot to the system console, unable to start the graphical shell, after an update. This tradeoff in stability came at the price of customization, something I was glad to give up anyway since I knew I’d have a ton of actual work to worry about in school.')
