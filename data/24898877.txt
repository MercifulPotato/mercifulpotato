You do not index pages served by a server anymore, you index pages rendered by javascript apps in the browser. So as a part of the &quot;fetch&quot; stage I usually let parsing of title and other page metadata to a javascript script running inside the browser (using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserless.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserless.io&#x2F;</a>) and then as part of the &quot;parse&quot; phase I use cheerio to extract links and such. It is very tempting to do everything in the browser, but architecturally it does not belong there. So you need to find the balance that works best for you.')
