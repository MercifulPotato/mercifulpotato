It&#x27;s not like the vaccine appeared out of thin air on Friday. Its arrival was known for weeks&#x2F;months. The staff and where they work is known. The error itself is understandable but the conditions leading to it and its propagation are not.<p>The further, unforgivable sin is that the error was brought to their attention internally on Tuesday, the administrators didn&#x27;t bother to fix it, and then when it became more widely known to the hospital staff Thursday afternoon they still did not act to fix it.
