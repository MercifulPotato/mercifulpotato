For example, it can parse the executables, and show structures:<p>Disassembler supporting many different architectures\nARM32 (ARM, Thumb, Cortex-M, aarch32)\nARM64\nMIPS (MIPS32, MIPS64, MIPS32R6, Micro)\nx86 (16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit)<p>Just to start, along with a ton of other file parsing, etc.<p>This looks pretty cool. Compiling it needs a C++20 compiler and no small list of dependencies...but it’s cool.')
