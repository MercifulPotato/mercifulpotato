The original multi million dollar positions with WSB are static now. They&#x27;re not trading anymore. They can&#x27;t possibly boost the stock price any further.<p>The way the stock price goes up is by more volume coming in at the highs. But we are talking 57 M shares traded at noon today with outstanding float of 65M. Those are professional day traders propelling the stock. Buying high and selling higher. It&#x27;s not WSB.')
