Also would be nice to have integrity checking backed in. It amazes me how bad file systems are in 2021. No integrity checks, no transactions, slow&#x2F;incorrect file watching, etc.<p>I know these features are provided by some newer file systems like zfs and btrfs, but those are not used by most consumers and are mostly used on servers.')
