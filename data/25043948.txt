Crashes do happen but I wouldn&#x27;t call the time sunk there a lot. If you get a ctd, usually a callstack and a bit of thought is enough for figuring out what is going on. At worst case you have valgrind. Very rarely it goes beyond that but even with that I would say it is a well trade off on how relaxed C++&#x27;s memory management is compared to Rust. And I believe C++ is relatively safe when you have well designed systems where ownership is clear enough. I have a feeling that if my company suddenly flipped to Rust now, the struggling against borrow checker would be a bigger time sink<p>For me majority of game development is feature development and fixing gameplay related bugs. Which will be same regardless of language you use. And depending on language feature development might be even slower')
