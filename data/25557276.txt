It is extremely inefficient compared to photovoltaics. &lt;1% vs &gt;20%.<p>A better approach might be to produce hydrogen via photovoltaics and electrolysis, then use hydrogen metabolising  bacteria to create more complex carbon hydrates and proteins from that.<p>The raw output of this might be edible in an emergency, but you would typically further refine it. Either you use fungi and end up with something similar to Quorn <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quorn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quorn</a> , or you feed it to livestock (fish, chicken).<p>I think that this might be the base of the food chain for space settlements. On earth, traditional agriculture works just fine to produce an abundance of food, and I don&#x27;t see more than aesthetic reasons to change it.')
