Item(by='hollerith', descendants=None, kids=[25267534, 25269733], score=None, time=1606842025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265590, text='&gt;Eventually Proof of Work WILL kill Bitcoin - but I have to admit this may be decades out in the future.<p>I always thought the hardwired reward for mining, namely, X btc every 10 minutes, is the cause of Bitcoin&#x27;s wasting electricity.<p>The electricity used is roughly proportional to the hashrate, which in turn is roughly proportional to the price of btc -- until the next halving, which I think is more than one year but less than 2 years from now.<p>These halvings of the reward every 2 years (which occur on a schedule set before Bitcoin was launched all those years ago) will some time in the next 10 years (which is 5 halving, representing a reduction in the reward by a factor of 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 == 32) or 12 years bring the Bitcoin network&#x27;s electricity usage down low enough that a reasonable person will no longer avoid Bitcoin out of worry that it is bad for the global climate.<p>Note that this <i>mining reward</i> doled out every 10 minutes is not a <i>transaction fee</i>. E.g., neither of the transacting parties (i.e., neither the sender nor the receiver) pays it.<p>So tell me again what will eventually kill Bitcoin.')
