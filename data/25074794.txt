Assuming you work a day job to pay the bills, there&#x27;s a fixed amount of time left over to work on the side project. And that limits how much &quot;stuff&quot; you can get done in a given calendar period.<p>And that can be very frustrating mentally, when you see other people working on the same (or similar) ideas, and they can move faster because they&#x27;re funded and have full-time people working on it.<p>OTOH, there&#x27;s another sense in which you can move <i>faster</i> than competitors, in that you have less inertia involved. If it&#x27;s just you (or you and maybe one or two other people) you can potentially switch gears and change directions much more quickly than larger companies with more people involved.')
