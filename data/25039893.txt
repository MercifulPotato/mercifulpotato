We need a human to fix things when they go wrong. If my bank account or my visa card get stolen, eventually there is somebody I can talk to to get this fixed. If there is an economic crisis or runaway inflation, people smarter than I am are at least going to try to mitigate it. When the shit hits the fan for unprecedented, unforeseen reasons, we can resolve that with judgment and fairness. This centralized human factor can go terribly terribly wrong, but it&#x27;s no less necessary for it.')
