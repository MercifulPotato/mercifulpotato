Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605936199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25167965, text='FWIW these are 16GB DIMMs. So 64GB there are roughly 512 times as many bits in that memory as opposed to 128MB of memory. Assuming a linear relationship between bit flips[1] and time (it is a statistical event after all) 1 bit flip a month would be the equivalent of 1 bit flip every 42 years in 128MB.<p>Or put differently, your survey size was quite a bit different than mine has been. Also there is always a chance that the bit flip is in the ECC bits not the main memory bits. ECC DIMMS typically have 72 bits per 64 bit long word, vs 66 bits per 64 data bits for parity memory, and 64 bits for 64 bits on memory with no protection at all.  So it&#x27;s hard to make a 1:1 comparison without knowing the exact layout of the memory and whether or not error detection bits are present.<p>[1] Soft (and Hard) bit errors are generally spec&#x27;d as a probability per unit time per bit, so more bits means higher probability of a bit flip per unit time.')
