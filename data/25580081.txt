If we change that context then I can agree with Dan, but if you want to refute argument you have to operate inside the same context.<p>What I see that Dan argues, is accidental complexity is not getting easier throughout the years. He does not touch anything about essential complexity being well &quot;complex&quot; and that we cannot do much about it. So I don&#x27;t agree that you can refute whole idea based on those examples.')
