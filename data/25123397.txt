However, here&#x27;s some (across different genres) that are in my memory at this moment:<p>Finance&#x2F;statistics :\nThe Black Swan by Nicholas Nassim Taleb\nThe Drunkards Walk by Leonard Mlodinow<p>Math&#x2F;science history : \nEuclid&#x27;s Window by Leonard Mlodinow\nA Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson<p>Physics: \nNewton&#x27;s Principia for the Common Reader by S. Chandrasekhar<p>Lit: \nThe Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky\nHouse of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski\nEast of Eden by John Steinbeck<p>Philosophy: \nZen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki\nAny of the upanishads but probably Kena Upanishad, Isha Upanishad, or Prashna Upanishad at first (selected for (relative) ease in readership by yours truly) \nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig (for a gentle introduction into Eastern thought)<p>I&#x27;m missing countless others but this is what I have right now. Thanks for the prompt and happy reading! :)')
