But the point of having a free country with the rule of law is supposed to be that might does not make right. The fact that the government <i>can</i> take your house if it decides it wants to does not, in itself, mean it has the <i>right</i> to.<p>Any such right ultimately depends on the government being responsible to the people and the people accepting that the government is acting in their interest and that what it does is for the overall good of society. The larger and more bureaucratic the government becomes, and the more it uses its power based on utopian visions of people who do not suffer the consequences if they are wrong, the harder it is for the people to accept that the government is acting in their interest and that what it is doing is for the overall good of society.')
