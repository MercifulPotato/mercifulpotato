There is very real and powerful anti-democratic fervor over here. Hundreds of members of the House of Representatives are involved in it, and several members of the Senate also. One member was actually heard outside on a loudspeaker yesterday invoking Hitler, by name, as a virtuous figure. There is white-supremacist anti-government infiltration of the police involved, including the Capitol Police. These same white-supremacist anti-democracy people have even stormed a military base in recent years, and they were NOT met with lethal force in that instance either, so it&#x27;s not just because the Capitol represents a symbol of democracy. It&#x27;s a complicated dynamic over here, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less chilling.<p>I live in Florida, and just a few minutes ago on the way to work this morning I passed a white commercial truck with a large commercial logo on the side. The logo reads &quot;Confederate Electric, Inc.&quot; laid over a waving Confederate flag (which is a flag of treason and white supremacy.) Anti-government fervor is right in your face, and taken as a very normal and matter-of-fact way of life here now. Florida&#x27;s Senator Rick Scott last night voted against allowing Pennsylvania the right to participate in representative democracy in voting for the new president. It&#x27;s a very serious and very sad thing what&#x27;s going on in America.')
