Item(by='the8472', descendants=None, kids=[25392845], score=None, time=1607722682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390897, text='&gt; There is no summer which have had no winds, no winters that have had no insolation or vice versa.<p>The part of &quot;no production&quot; were not meant to be taken literally. If you want a more precise statement then let me put it this way:<p>For PV in central europe even an overcapacity factor of 5 would be insufficient to cover the difference between summer and winter. Germany&#x27;s PV plants produced 7.3TWh during June 2019 and 0.58TWh during december 2018.<p>Wind does look a bit better as far as seasonal differences go (about 4-5x) but it suffers from more short-term variability, so you might need less seasonal storage for it but it would require more medium-term (multi-day or -week) storage compared to solar which is a bit less variable during its peak months compared to wind&#x27;s peak months.')
