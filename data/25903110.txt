If I can way a week or two then online ordering is just something I do because it is either very easy to do, or a lot cheaper.<p>Right now I&#x27;m waiting on the delivery of some NE555 timer chips, so I can build a clock circuit to drive a Z80.  Since I&#x27;m in no immediate rush I just ordered a bunch from aliexpress, I have no doubt they&#x27;ll turn up in six weeks.<p>(I did look at how much it would cost to buy a single 555 locally, and found a couple of online sites such as mouser.fi, and partco.fi, but they were quoting â‚¬10-20 for delivery which was just not something I was going to pay, even if the delivery would have been speedy.)<p>Also last week I got nostalgic for when I used to have the complete collection of Discworld books, so I ordered half of them online, I was given a delivery estimate of a week which is perfectly fine, I&#x27;ve no shortage of books to read here in the meantime.')
