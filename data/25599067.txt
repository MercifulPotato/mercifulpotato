Size is the same, no pixel offset. If you change the div (not the selected SVG, but the div itself) into a button and then add `border: none` to the .button class, there should be no visual changes at all. I&#x27;m checking both the Firefox and Chrome dev tools, it&#x27;s a 24 px high button with 8 pixels of padding.<p>If there&#x27;s some other visual change that goes along with that, I can&#x27;t find it.<p>----<p>&gt; None of that has anything to do with why this person built this tool the way they wanted or makes it any easier for them to do so while adding better accessibility.<p>There&#x27;s another side to this though which is that it is genuinely helpful to tell people that there are very simple changes they could make to increase accessibility on a platform that we have a vested interest in making accessible.<p>It&#x27;s not helpful to be a jerk about it, but I&#x27;m not going to act like there&#x27;s no right way to build something like this. I understand why someone might cut some corners on a quick project, or why they might not know everything there is to know about accessibility. I don&#x27;t fault any developer over that. But there is a correct engineering answer to the question of how a button should be designed, and it actually does genuinely impact real people in the real world.<p>Part of what we&#x27;re doing here is trying to as much as possible without being jerks get across the idea that accessibility matters. We&#x27;re trying to get across the point that it&#x27;s not OK to have the web mostly not work for blind people and to say, &quot;there aren&#x27;t enough of them to care about.&quot;<p>And especially in an area where fixing the problem is genuinely way less work than even having this conversation, and where fixing it would have zero downsides for the finished project, it is genuinely disheartening to see people putting forward the idea that literally any extra work at all means that accessibility has to be optional.<p>How far are you going to take that? Is it unreasonable for me to ask people to spend an extra minute captioning the photos they upload to Twitter? There are categories of things where it reasonable to ask people to put in a tiny bit of extra work so that the web doesn&#x27;t completely fail in its mission to be a universally accessible platform. We ask developers (even Open Source developers) to put in far more work over way more trivial, meaningless things than this.<p>So yes, maybe it would have required an extra minute or two of work to style this as a button. And if the developer didn&#x27;t know how to do that, fine, I&#x27;m not here to shame people for not knowing things, I have no ill will towards the developer for making that mistake. But I am here to shame people who say that one extra minute of work is too much for accessibility advocates to expect, and that asking developers to even think about accessibility is inherently unreasonable. We want developers to care about accessibility, we aren&#x27;t neutral on that. We want developers to have a code of ethics and values that prioritizes equal access for everyone. That&#x27;s part of the value ethos of the web as a platform.<p>We spend so much time as advocates trying to dance around that issue and trying to make it easier for people to be &#x27;accidentally&#x27; accessible when they build on the web, and to add tools and features that make accessibility the easier, natural engineering path. All of that is good, and we should keep doing that, and the accessible path here <i>is</i> the easier path, but on the other hand at some point we also have to be willing to say, &quot;no, we expect you to genuinely care about blind people at least a little bit.&quot;')
