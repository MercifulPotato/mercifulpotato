The main reason for the current state of affairs is the petro-dollar system and the need for US to run deficits. Changing regulations for domestic manufacturing has very little to do with it.<p>There are quite a few European countries with very robust manufacturing bases who are far more regulated (both from a labor and capital perspective). So, minimum wages, labor unions etc have little to do with the US&#x27; manufacturing base. In fact, one could argue that weaker unions, if anything, have contributed to the decimation of the manufacturing base.')
