Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610910191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812036, text='Exactly, SD card support would be largely meaningless as far as professional work is concerned.<p>My Sigma fp has to record 12-bit CinemaDNG to an external SSD (SD cards larger than 64 GB can’t maintain the required throughput and 64 GB is enough for probably minutes). I might use the SD recording capability if I take the camera for a leisure photowalk (as far from professional work as it gets); I keep reminding myself to simply get a Wi-Fi enabled SD card so that I never have to take it out.<p>A memory card format that might be a bit more relevant here is CFexpress; but then again, it’s unlikely that as a professional you’d ever use your laptop’s built-in reader for this as opposed to sticking it into a box that automatically copies everything onto a 4TB HDD while you fill up another card.<p>By the way, tethered operation (wired or wireless) is used in professional photography as well, not just videography.')
