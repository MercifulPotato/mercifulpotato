I&#x27;ve had experience speeding up tracking immensely using the same big hammer I talk about in the article - moving the larger parts of tracking compute to GPU.<p>Also, in a tracking pipeline you&#x27;ll generally have the big compute on pixels done up front. Object detection and ReID take the bulk of the compute and can be easily batched and run in parallel. The results (metadata) can then be fed into a more serial process (but still doing the N&lt;-&gt;N ReID comparisons on GPU).')
