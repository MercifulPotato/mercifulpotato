You are arbitrarily picking this as an example of being right because it was done this way in the past. We changed so much for the better despite those things being done like that for generations.<p>If you want a more technical analogy, this isn&#x27;t about having a dedicated connection but about proper QoS. You can live in a mansion with family because you&#x27;re still unencumbered. But reality is that for most living with their family is like having 3 Netflix streams on the same 128K line. And the fact that this is how every civilization has done things so far doesn&#x27;t make it less of a pain. Makes it a traditional pain though.')
