He was Iran&#x27;s equivalent of the Secretary of Defense, and also a folk-hero to Iranians. Soleimani was assassinated by US drone strike in January 2020.<p>Iran responded with a carefully-targeted retaliation - a small  missile strike against an unused&#x2F;unmaintained US military installation in Iraq. There were no casualties.<p>Iran chose a target with low strategic value and no personnel present. Just enough of a strike that they could sell it as retaliation, but not enough of a strike to escalate into a full war.<p>I won&#x27;t pretend to know if the assassination was warranted or necessary. But it&#x27;s easily something that Iran could have used to justify a war.')
