Their &quot;feelings&quot; do not matter - what matters is ensuring that we have reliable, self-reproducing, adaptable sources of protein for the population. Your lab-grown burgers that depend on thousands of years of technological development and piles of infrastructure are not the solution. Forcing everyone to become vegetarians is not even an option at all; the market demands meat and factory farms have stepped up to fill that niche at scale, reliably delivering meat to everyone in the first world even in extenuating circumstances. It&#x27;s quite phenomenal, what we have accomplished in terms of livestock agriculture, and to call it &quot;horrific&quot; is a massive insult to the hundreds of thousands of people who work in that industry keeping humans fed while keeping costs to a minimum.<p>I don&#x27;t care if the animals I eat were happy, because no matter what happens they are going to be killed and I am going to cook and eat their bodies. Accepting that is simply part of being the omnivorous animal that millions of years of evolution has produced.')
