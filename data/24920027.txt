And unlike human drivers, every fatality involving an SDC can become a fleet-wide software improvement to, ideally, prevent that failure from ever happening again. That&#x27;s not something we can do with people; nobody but traffic engineers and wonks read NHTSA reports to find out how accidents could have been avoided.')
