Out of curiosity: what kind of screencasts&#x2F;demos did you have in mind (e.g. web app development)? I just ask, since I’d love to think through if there are opportunities to improve the experience.<p>Also, just as an FYI: even though the core of CodeSwing is local, you can also store your swings in GitHub repos or Gists, via an integration with another VS Code extension that I maintain called GistPad (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aka.ms&#x2F;gistpad</a>). That way, if you want to create samples or share swings with others, you can simply use GitHub + VS Code to do it.')
