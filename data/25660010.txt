I believe that God is actually there - not just an idea, but a Person who truly exists.  To me, life is very much not meaningless.  I was made to know God, to love Him and be loved by Him.<p>But maybe you don&#x27;t agree with that.  Maybe you think that&#x27;s just a fantasy, a nice game of pretend that I play to keep the meaninglessness at bay.  Even so, I think that our human nature is to need to love and be loved.  If God isn&#x27;t there, well, people are.  Love them.  Be loved by them.')
