Also recently I had an issue trying to use hardware that was intended for Win98 but that is kind of expected.<p>Win10: randomly updates without permission, reboots itself, break stuff that I need working (for example one time its unexpected updates broke the software my company use to generate invoices, meaning Windows10 update managed to singlehandedly shut down my company income for a couple days until we reinstalled our bank invoice software on Win7), has telemetry, insists in re-enabling telemetry after we disabled it, has ads, has games without permission, insists that we use Cortana, but then complains Cortana is not available in my country, and the list goes on.<p>Ubuntu issues: the default interface is weird, there is no way to type file paths on filepickers, and this is quite maddening, it requires command line to do basic stuff too often, even native Ubuntu games might have bizarre issues with Fullscreen or random notification software hijacking the focus, and weirdly, it crashes more often than Win7, usually because of out of ram issues.')
