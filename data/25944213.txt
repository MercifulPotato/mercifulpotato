EG Sarbanes-Oxley.<p>Day-2-day, the SEC works mostly by signalling. They might make a policy declaration, or send letters to CEOs.  They&#x27;ll note things in periodic firm reviews. Publicly raise an eyebrow. Take action against or investigate one firm and publish findings. Rarely are specifically worded edicts issued.<p>Regulating bodies are designed to work largely through pressure instead of (ironically) through regulations. This is by design. Regulators are usually created in response to firms having won the loophole cat and mouse games, and the prohibitive complexity of actual regulations. If government wanted rules, they can just legislate directly instead of delegating to a regulator.<p>&quot;Compliance&quot; is often about staying away from trouble by playing a sort of guessing game. It doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s &quot;hands off.&quot;')
