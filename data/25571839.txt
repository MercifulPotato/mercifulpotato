This reminded me of my recent discovery. You&#x27;ve probably seen this[0] image test circulating on social media the other day. Few days ago, when working with my wife through some issues between us, I showed this to her. To my utter disbelief, she scored 6. I score 2. 3 on a good day. Suddenly, both of us realized why we&#x27;re getting annoyed with each other whenever talking about things like remodelling the kitchen, rearranging the living room, or planning the layout of a new flat. As it turns out, she <i>truly</i> can visualize everything in her head. And she now understands that I really do need to measure everything and drop it into CAD software before I&#x27;m ready to talk.<p>All because of a simple test that I only remembered because I&#x27;ve been obsessed with my aphantasia for over a year now. This makes me wonder: how many of such undiagnosed differences of perception are there between couples, that make living together difficult, because neither side can understand the other truly perceives the world differently?<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Aphantasia&#x2F;comments&#x2F;aioyga&#x2F;simple_aphantasia_test&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Aphantasia&#x2F;comments&#x2F;aioyga&#x2F;simple_a...</a>')
