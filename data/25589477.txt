Yes it&#x27;s $5 shipping, but you can actually buy low quantities at good prices instead of being forced to buy 50 packs of small components for a high $&#x2F;unit to cover for the free shipping. Because shipping cost is per order instead of built into every item. And they ship within 24 hours, plus everything is good quality, no fakes. I still order stuff like microcontrollers and wire from amazon though.<p>The disadvantage is since you&#x27;re paying for shipping you need to do planning and get your final BOM established. If you make a mistake it&#x27;s $0.20 for the right part and $5 shipping... Which isn&#x27;t bad, but feels bad.')
