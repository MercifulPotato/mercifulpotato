Unfortunately we weren&#x27;t as successful, or at least, our results were not as fruitful. A good score for our site (tracker.gg) is 70 on mobile. Turns out it&#x27;s pretty hard to optimize the bootstraping of an application that can render 20 different websites! Mobile devices spend 1200ms on the main thread. It will be interesting to see how these changes impact our page rank when Google starts incorporating Core Web Vitals into its algorithm this year.')
