Now instead of sucking it up and maybe wait for the next submission deadline and modify her article, she went and complain its discrimination on a internal mailing list of employees and then making ultimatums. :roll-eye: Any manager would have been fired.<p>Its only a special situation because she&#x27;s black and work on ethics.
