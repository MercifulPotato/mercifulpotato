If enough people are vaccinated, the spread will effectively stop and countries can start to reopen.<p>My hunch is that enough people will be willing to take the [apparently small] risk and we won&#x27;t have to pressure anyone. Also, for at least the next few months we won&#x27;t even be able to meet the demand for vaccines, so it&#x27;ll be a while before that&#x27;s a concern.')
