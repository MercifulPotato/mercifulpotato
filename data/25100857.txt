Some motorcycles might have only one.<p>&quot;gives legal grounds for a traffic stop but doesn&#x27;t really justify it.&quot;<p>What do you consider justification? According to the law and police regulations, it would be justified. Logic also supports the idea that if there is a law on the books, it should either be enforced or removed. In this case the law has the purpose (as almost all traffic laws do) of promoting safety.<p>&quot;circumvent the default protection against unreasonable search and seizure&quot;<p>How so? As I stated before, the law&#x27;s purpose is to promote safety. Also, when you sign your registration card or driver&#x27;s license, you are agreeing to obey the traffic laws. This isn&#x27;t just some made up excuse to violate people&#x27;s rights.<p>&quot;can&#x27;t we find a way to hold these people accountable that doesn&#x27;t involve a face-to-face encounter with an armed officer?&quot;<p>We already do this for some infractions like red light cameras (what a disaster) and speed cameras. It&#x27;s possible this could be expanded further, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit all driving laws or areas. Also, what&#x27;s wrong with the officer being armed? This shouldn&#x27;t have any negative impact on the stop and should be reasonable since there is a likelihood that the person could be armed too, which most of the time is not also not a problem.')
