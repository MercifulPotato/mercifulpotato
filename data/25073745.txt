I took the logical leap into touching upon embedded ML. I should point out that the current achievable complexity of embedded neural networks doesn&#x27;t at the moment remove edge ML from being the method of choice where on-device inferencing isn&#x27;t applicable. Edge ML is already alleviating much backhaul traffic otherwise generated by cloud inferencing. There are many scenarios where the latency introduced by transmission over network to cloud servers is prohibitive. Also where power contraints are not applicable nor remote operation absolutely vital (in the forest, as an animal tag, on oil platforms, etc) an edge hub to the sensor spokes is the way to approach a problem.')
