Only problem is everyone&#x27;s got an ax to grind and everyone&#x27;s biased. I&#x27;d rather talk about facts on the ground. I go to the hospital multiple times a week the whole place is shut down with lights turned off most of the nurses are laid off that I used to know that worked there. They keep saying that the hospital is full because of covid patients it&#x27;s not true the covid wing is full 30 beds and a hospital designed for an entire city.')
