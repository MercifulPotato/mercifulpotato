Item(by='criddell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612016775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964428, text='&gt; Given the price of an average Mac being higher than a Windows machine, it would also be fair to suggest that Mac users, on average, tend to have more disposable income as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think it means much to talk about averages when the Windows market is so much larger. There are plenty of Windows gamers who spend thousands on their machines. There are also plenty of highly paid developers and white collar workers who primarily use Windows. So I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a shortage of Windows users who could buy indie software, but for some reason they don&#x27;t.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a financial reason. Maybe it&#x27;s cultural? Maybe Mac users enjoy their computers more than Windows users and aren&#x27;t afraid to pay a little bit more to make it even better. Mac users picked the minority platform whereas Windows is the default and people who don&#x27;t care about computers end up on the default platform.')
