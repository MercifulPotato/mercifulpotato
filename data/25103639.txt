It&#x27;s based on Python (and now Go), runs on Alpine on baremetal in a datacenter in the US. Some of the above aren&#x27;t just views for SourceHut though, they&#x27;re more like a way of life. If you&#x27;d like to test that join the SourceHut channel on Freenode and ask if anyone has any reference for Dockerfiles or Kubernetes and see what response you get.<p>SourceHut and other code hosting sites are popping up as a wave of programmers push for decentralization. Some may say that it&#x27;s in response to youtube-dl, but this has been happening slowly for a while. If SourceHut isn&#x27;t right for you there&#x27;s always Codeberg which is essentially a Gitea instance backed by a non-profit in the EU.')
