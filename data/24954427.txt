Item(by='jleyank', descendants=None, kids=[24961508], score=None, time=1604172308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950096, text='In chemistry &quot;then&quot;, and I assume still &quot;now&quot;, a MS is viewed as a &quot;failed to complete the PhD&quot; degree unless it comes from a smaller school lacking a PhD program.  Or, &quot;wanted to go to Med or Law school and didn&#x27;t get in&quot;.  When hiring, BS&#x2F;MS chemists are seen as a pair-of-hands&#x2F;technicians.  There&#x27;s a noticeable rank difference in how they enter Pharma - BS&#x2F;MS with several promotions end up where PhD&#x27;s walk in the door.  Is this right or fair?  Probably not, but PhD&#x27;s are seen as somebody who can work (more) independently than a technician.  Ironically, a significant fraction of the lab work is done by the BS&#x2F;MS as PhD&#x27;s graduate out of the lab if they learn medchem properly.  So the best lab hands have the lowest status to outsiders.<p>It might be different in Process Chemistry, which is where the best lab work is work.  Perhaps those who have the magic in scaling up a reaction into production are like those who can debug anything?  I&#x27;ve never worked with those groups or with the Analytical chemists in Development.<p>Disclaimer: I have a PhD, but never wished to go into academia due to the politics.  And yeah, it&#x27;s a union card.')
