I&#x27;m a very happy Mullvad customer - but I&#x27;d like to know other peoples thoughts on using Mullvad through Firefox VPN - the price is the same - what cut do Mozilla take? is this detrimental to Mullvad?<p>I&#x27;m guessing Mullvad wouldn&#x27;t have cut the deal if they weren&#x27;t to benefit from it - so maybe I&#x27;m overthinking and should use this opportunity to put a percentage of my monthly $5 in mozilla&#x27;s pocket as well')
