There&#x27;s probably a lot out there at the university level.<p>I took it well over a decade ago, but the current material is largely similar.  Going in you were required to know C and C++, and math pre-reqs (Calculus, linear algebra).  Other university classes might skip the rasterizer building, but I think its a useful foundation.<p>We started with basic OpenGL to render models.  Then we replaced the OpenGL with our own rasterizer, adding features as you went.   It was a tough class (10 week schedule), but very rewarding.  Probably the worst part was debugging rendering issues.  You could see the problem, but it was hard to locate where your math went wrong.')
