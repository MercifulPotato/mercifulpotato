We used to use Skype (for softphones, video meetings, and IM), which sucked for group messaging. Slack unofficially picked up steam to fill the void, among some teams.<p>Now we&#x27;ve migrated from Skype to Teams internally. Groups that originally filled the void with Slack have pretty much continued due to momentum, but those that didn&#x27;t have picked up Teams pretty enthusiastically. There&#x27;s not really an advantage to one vs. the other, besides network effects and momentum.<p>We don&#x27;t actually have an official Slack org, and but rather a smattering of Slack orgs (some paid, some not). But they&#x27;re all used outside of the purview of IT, which probably isn&#x27;t a good thing. Even the paid orgs are just expensed directly by various business teams, rather than centrally managed&#x2F;invoiced by IT.<p>One thing of note is that we&#x27;re an agency (well, a holding company with many agencies), and it&#x27;s not uncommon for some of our clients to want us to sign into their Slack orgs and use it as a preferred means of communication. So our central IT makes the Slack client available for download, even though we don&#x27;t have an official Slack org ourselves. This ease of access is probably one reason it started getting used in the first place.')
