Apple has apparently started returning with errno=EINTR from some system calls that previously never returned this error. Fixing this problem on the PostgreSQL side is not trivial, since it seems to require changes in both PostgreSQL itself and possibly in extensions as well, so it&#x27;s unlikely to be fixed quickly.<p>&gt; These are the possiblities:<p>&gt; Try to disable security software (eg. Antivirus products) that might trigger the problem\nDowngrade to macOS 10.15\nSend feedback to Apple that they should fix the issue. PostgreSQL is unlikely to be the only affected software.\nHope that someone fixes the error in PostgreSQL<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PostgresApp&#x2F;PostgresApp&#x2F;issues&#x2F;610#issuecomment-770178375" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;PostgresApp&#x2F;PostgresApp&#x2F;issues&#x2F;610#issuec...</a>')
