Everyone across the board wants to take more risk because they can&#x27;t make their numbers stack up with the less risky part of the credit spectrum. As a result over the long term some credit becomes mispriced and when there&#x27;s a wave of defaults credit investors wind up losing money overall then we start the cycle again.')
