My basic strategy is to replace the time I spend watching tv or doom scrolling (Twitter, HN, etc.) with reading a book instead. And diversify sufficiently in book style to make this sustainable (i.e. interesting). But I can&#x27;t give up watching tv or doom scrolling completely, so that&#x27;s some &quot;efficiency&quot; lost.<p>There are people who read significantly more than 50 books a year and that&#x27;s nuts to me. Even hitting 60 would require a lot more effort and slight discomfort than I&#x27;m willing to go for.<p>That said, it&#x27;s incredible that I&#x27;ve already got a to-read list longer than I could possibly read in my life.')
