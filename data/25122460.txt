This is not capitalism. Even the word &quot;maintainer&quot; seems to put you into this mindset. Software does have a point where it can be considered finished. At some point the best course of action might very well be to just frigging stop.<p>I actually value software that is mostly static.<p>Then again this website is extremely biased towards people who develop network services, which for some reason tends to require constant maintenance.')
