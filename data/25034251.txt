What&#x27;s the point of open source if companies just steal it, build billion dollar industries on top, and then lock everything down?<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a VPN company is a thin front on top of Tor and they charge $50&#x2F;year for their &quot;service&quot;. They&#x27;re not stealing Tor. It doesn&#x27;t mean Tor should stop existing. Sure, it&#x27;s a scummy thing for the company to do, but Tor is still a valuable resource that remains free for anyone to use.<p>The point of open source is the creation of value. That some companies capture some of that value (usually less egregiously than this example - AWS is actually providing a dynamic host scaling service that happens to host open source software, Apple is providing a software vetting service and top-notch hardware that happens to be built on Unix) is irrelevant in the bigger picture.<p>&gt; Remember when the Internet was actually pleasant? When it was nice to build stuff for others to use?<p>This is still true if open source developers are more focused on delivering overall value than they are on their jealousy that a company is integrating their software and charging for it. This could definitely be frustrating if the developer was hoping to make a business out of their software, but if that&#x27;s the real problem then the license should reflect that.')
