It grew in the 90s out of a Starcraft Brood War clans&#x27; website and the forum blossomed into the one stop shop for Starcraft content.<p>In 2011 when SC2 came out, r&#x2F;starcraft became a huge community hub that supplemented with TL synergistically. Reddit brought a wider audience to more advanced gameplay and discussion, and it slowly enhanced the TL audience with fresh blood. On top of that, a ton of other Esports blossomed, and TL became huge hubs for discussion of those games as well.<p>TL was massively aided by its benevolent leadership and policy of hiring very honorable players who were respectful and classy. Their players ended up doing well in DoTA, as well as some limited success in SC2.<p>Then streaming with Twitch came through and it&#x27;s insane, every single player and commentator has their own subsample of fans, who give donations and take such joy from this content.<p>So, thanks to TL, one great community on the Interwebs!')
