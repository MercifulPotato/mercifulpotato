That doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of a bank saying they&#x27;ll list for a high price, winning the bid, and then coming back later and saying that intervening events cause them to think it should be listed lower.<p>But presumably companies that are about to IPO have advisors&#x2F;lawyers who can see these sorts of shenanigans coming and fight against them?')
