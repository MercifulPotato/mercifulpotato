And great questions regarding the marketplace. To answer:<p>- re: interview requirement - Since launching we&#x27;ve had a lot of interviewers (moonlighting journalists) come inbound and we feel lucky for this. It&#x27;s also a great help that George, one of my co-founders, has been a journalist and editor for 15+ years, so his network is deep and he&#x27;s developed trust over the years. This is fine for the immediate future, but we will need to build out an interview portal in the future. Just not there yet.<p>re: interviewer vetting - We ask for writing and audio samples in advance. Each interviewer will then conduct at least one and sometimes up to four practice interviews with Artifact team members or friends of the company to collect feedback. There is a lot to build out here over time but we feel good about the quality of interviewers. It&#x27;s core to the experience and so I&#x27;m really glad you asked about it!<p>re: interview &lt;&gt; guest matching - We make note of interviewer attributes like language proficiencies, skill at speaking with children, grandparents, subject matter expertise, etc. Based upon the information an Artifact buyer provides in their Artifact creation flow, we are then able to match an interviewer appropriately. That said, this is also something that we will build upon heavily going forward. Early days.<p>I hope the above helps and very happy to answer additional questions you may have!')
