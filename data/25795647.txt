Even Windows doesn&#x27;t have flawless support with every game on day one.<p>&gt; Itâ€™s quite common to have a bit of trouble getting anything working, and you will run into problems far more often than with any other brand of GPU (which will just work perfectly).<p>That&#x27;s a joke. I&#x27;ve been using Linux on Nvidia since the Riva TNT. It was <i>always</i> Radeon that had garbage drivers and really didn&#x27;t give two shits about Linux. Not sure how much this has changed with AMD owning them, but I never bothered to look at Radeon since Nvidia was always the best card and always worked. It&#x27;s almost never more than just doing a single package install.<p>&gt; software has to be written against the NVIDIA proprietary drivers, rather than using the standard tools that everything else uses like OpenGL and Mesa.<p>I think you fundamentally do not understand Mesa or OpenGL to say this. And no, nothing has to be &quot;written against&quot; Nvidia. It&#x27;s literally OpenGL (or Vulkan, today). Unless you&#x27;re talking CUDA or something, which I don&#x27;t touch.<p>This all just sounds like so much FUD that you wrote.')
