I belong to one that was originally set up for firefighters and their families but is now open to people living and working here.<p>Pros:<p>- Most credit unions cooperate on a shared ATM network, so I have zero-fee access to <i>way</i> more ATMs than any bank does that I know of. Also, they reimburse any other ATM network fees (but I try not to rack up too many of those because I don&#x27;t want to cost my CU money).<p>- They also usually cooperate on physical location resources: although my CU doesn&#x27;t have a branch nearby, I can walk into another CU&#x27;s location around the block to make deposits and withdrawals. Try walking into Wells Fargo and depositing money in your Bank of America account.<p>- Their lending rates are <i>SO</i> good. When I wanted to buy a new vehicle, I emailed the loan manager who gave me a pre-approval for about 50% more than I needed (just in case I stumbled over an awesome offer on something more expensive that I was looking for) at a ridiculously low rate. Then they recommended a dealership to me. My wife and I went to the dealer and picked out our vehicle. The sales manager said &quot;I know you have financing, but let me see what I can do for you. What&#x27;s your APR?&quot; I told him and he started laughing: &quot;yeah, I&#x27;m not gonna be able to touch that. Congratulations on it!&quot;<p>- They have amazing customer service. Any time I&#x27;ve need something, from adjusting the date my loan payment is due to asking them to please stop putting a hold on the deposits of my wife&#x27;s paychecks, has been a call or email and they just do it.<p>Cons:<p>- Nothing that I can think of after being with them for 5 years.')
