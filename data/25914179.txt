What I realized, the reason we are pay less in Canada, is caused by our perceived value from management.<p>In the American company, the managers want me to succeed because that is directly link to their success. I&#x27;m part of the team, I&#x27;m accountable, but I had more freedom.<p>In the Canadian one, managers want all the credit (pay+bonuses+recognition), because they are the incredible one who made the monkey produce the value. I&#x27;m part of a pool, managers will decide what programming language I&#x27;ll program in, he&#x27;s managing the risk after all. Oh, and by the way, it was a hard year, not all goals where reached, so they need to cap the bonuses, but the company is glad for the all-time profit record.<p>Of course, itâ€™s a bit of a caricature. It surely applies to US or Canadian company. But our perceived value struck me in all my employers.')
