I&#x27;m not convinced this is something your product can help me find. Instead, it reminds me of a lot of the touchy-feely engagement stuff management pushed at Deloitte when I used to work there, stuff like &quot;business chemistry&quot; and their &quot;strengths inventory&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad product, but it&#x27;s not for techies like me. I just want to do the job and get paid. Meaning and emotional fulfillment are too important to trust to my employer.')
