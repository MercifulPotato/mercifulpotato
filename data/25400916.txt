The painter&#x27;s tool, on its own, can&#x27;t be de-composed to do those things simultaneously. Plus, it&#x27;s not as good at being a general purpose hammer or a general purpose wrench. But in the context of the tool, you don&#x27;t really need a full fledged hammer or wrench. Having a single small tool you can hold in one hand is usually more pragmatic, even if less versatile.<p>Probably still gonna want the toolbox to be available for when you need it, though.')
