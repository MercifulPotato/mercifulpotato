Seroprevalence data shows undercounting of up to 24 times (rather than the 5 or 10 this tool shows.)<p>Also, this tool assumes you are only seeing people from your county.<p>And humans are <i>terrible</i> at assessing compound risk. If the tool shows a 5% risk from a gathering, people will likely attend multiple events. (&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s only 5% to go to Thanksgiving. And 5% to go to Friendsgiving. etc.&quot;) When you consider multiple events, risk doesn&#x27;t stay constant.<p>So while that tool is interesting, don&#x27;t look at it as a mechanism to say, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s probably ok to have a gathering.&quot;')
