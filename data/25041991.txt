I spent months forcing myself to use nothing but Emacs to get past the &quot;this is unfamiliar and therefore hard&quot; stage.  My final conclusion after the experience was that Emacs is pretty powerful out of the box but it is absolutely a general purpose environment and you have to meld it to your own workflow to truly unlock its potential.<p>Even though I don&#x27;t use Emacs these days, one thing I did keep was swapping capslock and ctrl on my keyboard.  That is useful for so many other things and I&#x27;m never going back.')
