I thought it was clumsily executed, but it had a point. You knew what you were doing and the game told you it was wrong.<p>The problem with Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla is that, rather than presenting you with the option to kill civilians and take slaves and letting you choose not to participate in this aspect of the time period&#x2F;history, the game is hiding that historical fact in order to let you safely indulge in a sanitized historical fantasy. As a player who doesn&#x27;t know better (AKA most people in the world), you don&#x27;t even know the alternative you could be choosing.')
