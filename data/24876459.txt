What I&#x27;d like is something bash-like to handle running programs, pipes, tab-complete for file names, and so on, and something like Python syntax for control flow and strings (quoting &#x2F; escaping), and access to something powerful like Python&#x27;s standard math libraries (and ability to import other stuff like requests). I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d roll all that into a single shell, but as close as you can get is what I&#x27;d like to see in a new shell.<p>(I&#x27;ve briefly looked at Oil before, but it has seemed a bit complicated to merit trying to switch full time at this point. I&#x27;m definitely following it for future developments though.)<p>Edit: just found Xonsh from another user&#x27;s comment, which seems almost exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, if a bit hacked together at first glance. Going to try that out.')
