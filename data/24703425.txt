The previous administration spent 8 years coming up with a terrible agreement that all candidates wanted to quit. Meanwhile the high tariffs have forced companies to leave, and sure, Biden has said that he’d end Trump’s China tariffs, but at least the many companies that have already setup shop elsewhere are unlikely to return.<p>For years countries have also been forced to waste taxpayer money to deliver cheap junk from Aliexpress&#x2F;Wish&#x2F;etc. because Universal Postal Union wouldn’t allow countries to increase postal rates from China. The previous administration was unable to do anything about it, but Trump succeeded where they failed.<p>Huawei has also been significantly hurt. Being banned from using Android and chips with US tech has effectively destroyed their mobile products (as their stock runs out), and countries are abandoning their 5G deals (either as a result of USA paying them to drop Huawei, or simply because China&#x2F;Huawei’s reputation has dropped so much in the last four years). Trump also dragged other countries into it by e.g. requesting Meng Wanzhou’s arrest, which resulted in China arbitrarily arresting Canadian citizens.<p>He’s also the first US President to speak directly with Taiwan’s President since 1979, and has made the largest arms sale to Taiwan in the past few decades.<p>TAIPEI Act and Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was signed under his administration, and Hong Kong lost its special status.<p>If judges hadn’t temporarily stopped Trump’s executive orders then TikTok and WeChat would also be banned now (it’s absurd that the west for decades have put up with China blocking western companies from their markets while freely allowing them into our markets).. hopefully the bans will go through, and hopefully TikTok&#x2F;WeChat will just be the first of many.<p>Trump is also one of the few world leaders who continuously remind the world that China are responsible for the pandemic, and China still won’t allow WHO&#x2F;others to investigate the origins in Wuhan.<p>Trump has also been pushing for China to lose WTO developing country status, which will surely happen if he’s re-elected.<p>As a liberal I disagree with most of Trump’s policies, but I could really go on-and-on about his effective&#x2F;positive actions towards China.. you could make a solid case that Trump in four years has done more to stand up to China than the rest of the western world combined (including the previous administration) has done in the past decade.')
