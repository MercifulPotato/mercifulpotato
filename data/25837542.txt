The crowds protesting racial injustice and police brutality? Or the literal, self identifying nazis, white supremacists, and cultish conspiracy theorists trying to kill political leaders.<p>Alas our moral non cognizance in a post modern perspective.<p>edit: to the below, really, no. There&#x27;s no hyperbole. If your group features nazis, and your group is not making every effort to expel associations with said nazis, your group is, at best, nazi adjacent. Nazis are the hyperbolic euphemism of peak historical immorality. It is preposterous that anyone feels they&#x27;re making a good faith argument throwing whatabout comparisons when the starting point is nazis.')
