It appears to be around 3 times as bad as normal flu season (going by infection fatality rate), yet for flu we don&#x27;t really bother much at all. A bad flu season may get some attention in the press but not much more, though a bad flu may double the IFR.<p>We are destroying economies because of covid, and I predict that the long term damage will be far worse than the virus. I think its important to keep a sense of perspective.')
