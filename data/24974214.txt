What TCP does is make sure your packets are not lost, even if you have 99% packet loss. On the flip-side, that means that if TCP can&#x27;t deliver a single packet (say out of a billion), the whole stream stops at this one packet...<p>Which is why TCP is a horrible choice for any streaming service and a horrible choice for lossy connections, and I would be quite surprised if Netflix relied on it. UDP is the perfect choice for streaming, since video decoders can handle packet loss pretty well. The rest you can achieve with good tradeoff between Reed-Solomon codes and key framing.')
