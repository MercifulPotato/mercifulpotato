I guess a lot of RFPs requiring software of that nature have probably been largely dominated by the Java and .NET ecosystems for decades and your Nodejs, Python, Ruby, Go ecosystems don&#x27;t have any compelling offerings or much interest from their community to work on that sort of software?<p>I feel like a lot of what I see online fits into either SaaS web apps, or well known open source projects &#x2F; core infrastructure used in building large-scale, distributed systems.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more out there, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get talked about much.
