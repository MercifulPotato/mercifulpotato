Fishburn&#x27;s work, issues in MAUT and MCDM, seminal work by Bouyssou, Vincke, Pirlot, Keeney, or the older discussions about SEU vs. EU, evidential vs. causal decision theory, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a rather technical book, focusing on issues like advanced sensor data fusion, control theory, and optimization.
