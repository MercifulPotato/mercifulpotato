I expect a slim headphone cable wouldn&#x27;t have this problem, but I switched to bluetooth instead because of this.  It also makes me less likely to accidentally pull my laptop off a table.<p>I agree that &#x27;it&#x27;s old&#x27; is a shitty reason to dismiss something though.  I&#x27;ve had somebody suggest I replace my USB intellimouse because it&#x27;s so old, but that&#x27;s just not going to happen.  It still works great.')
