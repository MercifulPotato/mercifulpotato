I&#x27;ve noticed how common it is that interfaces can&#x27;t keep up with me when, by all rights, they should be able to! I&#x27;m a limited, slow human, while their instructions execute billions of times per second. And yet I&#x27;m constantly running into scenarios were the next screen comes up and I try to give it an input, but it&#x27;s not ready. Or when I hit the next-preset button for my car radio, and yet it has to pause to load that station before I can use the button again.')
