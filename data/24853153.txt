They pay because they hate ads and Youtube gatekeeps basic app functionality behind the paywall. It&#x27;s not a service it&#x27;s a hostage negotiation.<p>To which my response was that it&#x27;s a commonly accepted business practice to create free and premium tiers (it&#x27;s so common it even has a name: &quot;freemium&quot;), and that this doesn&#x27;t remotely constitute &quot;gatekeeping&quot; or &quot;hostage negotiation&quot;.  And it is common for companies to switch models over time, starting out with free in order to spur quick growth and then figuring out monetization later.  Make no mistake, YouTube was originally losing catastrophic amounts of money, and what has happened to it is the only path that was even viable.  You either need <i>a lot</i> of advertising <i>or</i> a substantial paid subscriber base in order to not suffer huge ongoing losses and be forced to shutter.  Just ask every newspaper ever.<p>I just don&#x27;t see what YouTube has uniquely done differently vs any other company that has a paid tier or that has grown over time and needed to find additional ways to make money because it turns out that you can&#x27;t turn around a loss by scaling it.<p>I don&#x27;t live advertising either.  But I accept that it pays for the vast majority of the content that I consume online.')
