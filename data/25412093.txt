There are situations where we can see that the only apparent way to do something needed very considerable resources, which suggests a state actor.<p>Equation Group is presumed to be (a front for) the NSA. It forged a (code signing) certificate that otherwise shouldn&#x27;t exist, using an MD5 collision.
