He gave me a tour of the new(ish) building around Tysons Corner, VA. It is a very modern building, with a lot of charging stations and Tesla model S EVs in the parking garage. Public events happen there, they have two cafeterias, and probably a whole bunch of networks supporting all of that. They constantly evaluate new cyber tools, so I was told. It seemed to me that, yes, there could be something behind this idea that they are &quot;a tech company.&quot;<p>So I went through the hiring process. There&#x27;s an online proprietary aptitude test that&#x27;s required of all candidates, and it&#x27;s apparently such a big deal, that you can only take it once per 6 months. They start you off with a practice test served from a non-CapitalOne FQDN, then the real one served from a CapitalOne FQDN. Well, I took both, and got an error at the end of the real one. Apparently, Firefox is explicitly supported on the practice test, but only IE11 is supported on the real one. The error meant none of my exam results were recorded, and due to some technicality, that meant I was SOL for 6 months.<p>My experience with CapitalOne, the &quot;tech company&quot; whose aptitude exam required a legacy browser, ended right there.')
