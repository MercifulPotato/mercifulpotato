There&#x27;s none sold in the shops, there&#x27;s none advertised in newspapers, tv or on the radio. And there is definitely no gun offered when opening a bank account.<p>Basically if you want a gun for whatever reason - usually for recreational shooting at the shooting club, then you have to go out and look for it.<p>In the US I have the feeling that they&#x27;re marketed as a penis extension, and you&#x27;re not a proper man unless you shoot things, with the view that you&#x27;d be quite happy to project a slug of lead into somebody else at high velocity to prove you&#x27;re more of a man than they are.<p>To solve the problem in the US I think you need to ban the advertising - like cigarettes.<p>Caution: This weapon inflicts pain suffering and death to others. User may be incarcerated for murder if ever used. If in a situation of conflict, gun only increases likelihood of extreme violence - leave at home.')
