If the node is unavailable or lost, so too are the messages the node was keeping for future publish.<p>Also, there is no visibility in to the messages that are awaiting delay. 10? 100? 5000? Your guess is as good as mine and you&#x27;ll never be able to figure out what&#x27;s in to-be-published pipeline.<p>Signed, someone who has dealt with these issues.')
