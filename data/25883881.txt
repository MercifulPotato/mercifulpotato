It&#x27;s possible to live a fairly normal life despite all this. I do it. Don&#x27;t carry a cell phone, turn off javascript everywhere, use a non-onstar&#x2F;etc car, don&#x27;t fly commercially, use cash for in person transactions and bitcoin (or monero) online where you can.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m not planning on trying to overthrow the government or anything stupid. I just don&#x27;t like being spied on. I&#x27;m glad these treasonous idiots carried their ankle bracelets (cell phones) while they committed their crimes.<p>I&#x27;m not too surprised at the spatial resolution that basestation multi-lateration gave either. The low noise and synchronization of clocks in <i>modern</i> cell phone basestations are getting really good. GPS is not required.')
