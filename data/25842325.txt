While I didn&#x27;t put it through the paces, I didn&#x27;t have any issues on linux. In the end, I ditched it<p>- Powershell is too verbose. I might as well use Python or node. Hard to beat lodash and node.js for processing objects.<p>- Powershell starts slow, almost 2 sec. I use i3 and it&#x27;s noticeable when I start a terminal with Powershell. Sure it&#x27;s a one time cost but I&#x27;m nerdy like that.<p>- If I work on Windows I use virtual machines or WSL2 obviating the need for a cross platform shell.')
