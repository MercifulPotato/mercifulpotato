But I personally feel I cannot in good conscience be found supporting someone who directly time and time again organizes boycotts against middle Easts only somehow working democracy.<p>I cannot live with supporting companies that are openly hostile to values I find important.<p>So I end up outside the unions, at least until someone creates one that promises to not do that.<p>&gt; If companies can engage in political activity, it follows that workers&#x27; unions are just as entitled.<p>Yep. And that&#x27;s ok. But I won&#x27;t support them as long as they try to meddle in international affairs or even push national lawmaking in directions I think are abhorrent.')
