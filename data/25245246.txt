Shouldn&#x27;t the only bar to putting some videos up on the internet be bandwith? We can solve that with IPFS.<p>The content hosting with youtube is nice, but the bigger problem solved by YT is search. So a video up on a server somewhere might as well be dark unless something can link to it and someone looking for it or something similar can be pointed to it. That search feature itself can&#x27;t be centralized or else we have the same censoring problem.<p>It would be nice if a type of searching system could be bundled with IPFS, though I don&#x27;t know what that would look like. The sooner we have a system where no one can close the gates, the better.')
