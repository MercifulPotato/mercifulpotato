If you have iCloud Backup turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your Messages. This ensures you can recover your Messages if you lose access to iCloud Keychain and your trusted devices. When you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated on your device to protect future messages and isn&#x27;t stored by Apple.<p>I didn&#x27;t realize messages was an exception to storing the key on local devices.')
