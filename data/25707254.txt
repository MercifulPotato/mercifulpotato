Having a gander at one subdirectory with 94 photos @ 354 MB in size, running cbrunsli on them brings the size down to 282 MB, which brings in savings of about 20%. And if I ever wanted to convert them back to JPEG, each file would be bit-identical to the originals.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a little early to trust my data to JPEG XL&#x2F;Brunsli, but I&#x27;ve ran tests comparing hundreds of MD5 checksums of JPEG files losslessly recreated by Brunsli, and have not yet ran into a single mismatch.<p>I can only say that I am very excited for the day that JPEG XL truly hits primetime.')
