Item(by='momothereal', descendants=None, kids=[25297477], score=None, time=1607034976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296023, text='No problem, my fault I misread your comment. `row_id` is a unique identifier for the row, for example my API will need it when the user wants to delete the specific row. Since it&#x27;s possible for multiple rows to have the same `time`, even for the same `user_id`, I cannot assume uniqueness there.<p>Partitioning on the row_id by making it an ordinal instead of a UUID could work, however I feel I would be missing out on TimescaleDB&#x27;s advantages for querying based on the `time` filter?<p>Consider that my main queries are:<p>* DELETE FROM t WHERE row_id = xyz AND user_id = xyz<p>* INSERT INTO t (...)<p>* SELECT FROM t WHERE user_id = xyz AND time &gt; xyz and time &lt; xyz')
