There have been mass purges of users before spam bots, accounts liked to the Islamic state, etc. Multiple hosting providers terminated Gab&#x27;s services.<p>Usually large companies don&#x27;t take action like this until they are under public scrutiny and have something to loose.<p>The mess the US is in right now can in some ways blamed on the way way it&#x27;s democracy works: candidates can win elections with a plurality of the vote.
