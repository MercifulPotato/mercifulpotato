Also, they&#x27;re pointing a much deeper issue with computing nowadays.<p>I guess that I&#x27;m close to the author age-wise and, can relate to their feelings. I feel the same thing from time to time and had reflected upon that.<p>They&#x27;re missing the time where capacity and capability is visible from outside and, somewhat overt.<p>You needed a powerful computer with SMP capabilities? You needed two actual CPUs, a special board, a lot of RAM, appropriate power supply, cooling and case. Now, a phone or a lowish-end SBC has more processing power than that beast.<p>You wanted a lot of fast storage? Get the SCSI drives with big ribbon cables and terminators, set it up install the controller with its own dedicated XOR processor (for RAID) and listen disks spin up and sing with head seek and platter resonance sounds. Today a run of the mill USB 3.0 stick can transfer my first hard disk&#x27;s capacity under a second.<p>You wanted good network? You had to get a good NIC with its on-board offloading engine with lots of components and LEDs and shove it to your PC. Now? A measly battery powered Huawei modem sucks data at 100Mbit ethernet speed and shoves to a USB cable without you ever notice. A simple on board NIC can transfer 100MBps for days and whole system barely notices the streaming data.<p>This visibility and explicitness of tech also brought simplicity with that. The most complicated thing was X86 protected mode and it wasn&#x27;t that hard to fathom. Nothing was optimized beyond comprehension and with an in-order CPU, you can visualize everything from keypress to screen in your mind with some experience.<p>Now a simple webpage is behind a webserver which is a load balancer to a K8S cluster which runs 10+ containers to keep everything scalable which runs deep inside a Linux system where you pass thru at least three networks (Internet-&gt;DC LAN-&gt;K8S-&gt;Docker) to access to the page you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Your cloud files are behind a REST API which terminates at a library which queries an object storage front end which retrieves your file from an object on a disk array god knows where (forget the details about array controllers, RAID, network, etc.)<p>Even learning basic K8S is a multi-week effort now.<p>This is what makes computing un-cool today. Migrating from a Raspberry Pi to a production system is not straightforward anymore. Nothing is simple anymore. Nothing is easily graspable anymore. Building abstractions to make things simpler has gone too far and the middle layers are just too many and too thick. It&#x27;s too time consuming to try to learn everything just because of curiosity now.<p>This is what makes computing uncool now.<p>Note to self: This could be a blog post, heh.')
