They can do whatever they want there, I don&#x27;t care, and neither should the DOJ. I also don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re meaningfully leveraging their phone market power to increase their computers market power, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something ;needing an Apple computer to develop for Apple phones is maybe a concern, but doesn&#x27;t strike me as rising to the level of anti-trust litigation.<p>On phones, in the US, they have a dominant position. US Anti-trust doesn&#x27;t require a absolute monopoly; merely having a dominant position is enough to prohibit anti-competitve behaviors.')
