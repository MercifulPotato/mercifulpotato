But Indians are extremely diverse. My wife is Brahmin, and I am white, and I&#x27;ve been around Brahmins as a result. I have found Brahmins who come to the US often are not particularly religious but still practice some of old customs. They complain about a lot of Brahmin hate in India and like escaping from it in the US. There are some subtleties though.<p>* Indians from India like old ways of addressing superiors. They appreciate if you call a manager Sir. Address him as Dear Sir.<p>* Religious Brahmins would not tolerate being around a Dalit because it will adversely effect their purity. There are terms for all this. Aversion to Dalits is deeper than culture, it&#x27;s a religious belief. This might even be protected by religious freedom. Less religious ones I don&#x27;t think care as much. Very religious Brahmins in general do not get high paying jobs and do not have a lot of power but also would hold the most discriminatory views.<p>* Indians have a culture of going the extra mile at work. So  I think in general they don&#x27;t appreciate the American view of work.<p>* Indians from India prefer being around other Indians but I think they also don&#x27;t understand Americans well and think the American work environment is strange.<p>* There are a lot of horrible things that happen in India and it&#x27;s not just one group that does it. There isn&#x27;t really any one universally accepted victim group there. There are billionaire Dalits.')
