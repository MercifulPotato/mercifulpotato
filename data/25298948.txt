I start with a phone interview that is more about discussing their background, expertise, what they need to feel productive, and explain the role. If I think they’d be a good culture and expertise fit, I send them something like this (I’ve made a few): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;tywalch&#x2F;cf60e4c942ab6a80e481f4ba6754e626" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;tywalch&#x2F;cf60e4c942ab6a80e481f4ba6754...</a>.<p>It’s a small “api service” that represents a POC with some bugs and bad practices. I  tell them to look over it,  write down notes on how to make it production ready, setup a time to discuss their thoughts in a second call. No code writing necessary.<p>It ends up being an excellent Rorschach test where folks can really show&#x2F;express their unique skill sets and experience. I ultimately let them drive the conversation and it gives me great insights into what experiences have shaped their career and what it might be like to collaborate with them. Best of all it does resemble what some of their day to day might look like better than hand crafting some tree algorithm.')
