I can pick up most languages and frequently use others like Rust or Elixir, but I _love_ Ruby. It&#x27;s plenty fast for most tasks and it&#x27;s fantastic if you want to write small scripts.<p>I went through the same stages as many people of trying out the new hotness, but I always come back to Ruby. Most recently I had a need to write a bunch of different Prometheus exporters for my home dashboard. I tried ~n languages, and most of the popular exporters are written in Go. But it was so, so easy to just write them in Ruby.<p>Lots of people focus so heavily on performance of the interpreter but it&#x27;s honestly fast enough for most tasks. And there&#x27;s a lot you can do to improve your code before you hit the limits of the interpreter. My job is at least 50% working on awkward performance issues at GitLab and I still learn new things all the time. And I have fun doing it.<p>Ruby is still so much fun. Thank you to everyone who has made it what it is.')
