Some countries have cheap data, others are unreasonably expensive. European internet infrastructure isn&#x27;t as homogeneous as people seem to think.<p>Here in the Netherlands, you&#x27;ve got national coverage with  unlimited data for â‚¬25 per month (practically unlimited, not theoretically unlimited, of couse, because fair use policies exist everywhere).<p>One country to the south is Belgium, where even the landlines have data caps, something that would be unthinkable here.<p>There&#x27;s some connection between GDP&#x2F;purchasing power and the price of data, but there&#x27;s much more going on. Things like nationalised internet connections, government investment in public internet infrastructure and geography are more important than how much money someone in a certain country makes on average.')
