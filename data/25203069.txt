If we needed to do that, I&#x27;d try wrapping the CSSOM API prototypes.<p>(Of course DOMRec does handle changes to &#x27;style&#x27; attributes on DOM nodes, because those do generate mutation notifications.)<p>Similarly, DOMRec doesn&#x27;t handle cross-origin frames, because our app doesn&#x27;t use them. To make that work I guess we&#x27;d have to port to a browser extension and even so it would make things quite a lot harder.')
