I&#x27;m a little skeptical that there was a carefully thought out and plausible &quot;alternative outcome&quot;, but the sort of thing that some people have suggested was that the trump supporters would have taken control of the certification process in some important way (with or without actual violence towards various existing government members). This would have then led to Trump declaring some kind of emergency, the certification process would have &quot;finished&quot; with a different outcome, and a new winner of the election would have been declared.<p>As I said, I am not sure I buy that anyone with half a brain thought that a plan could work, but there seems to be some supporting evidence that something like this had been imagined by at the very least some of the people at the protest. How far into the Trump administration that might have gone, I don&#x27;t know (or if went into it at all).<p>Had something like that happened, it would definitely have been a decisive, sudden show of force in politics.')
