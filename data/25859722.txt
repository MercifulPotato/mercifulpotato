Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611242402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857587, text='I think there&#x27;s a stray &quot;no&quot; in your second sentence, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m understanding you correctly.<p>If I am, I&#x27;m not sure how to reconcile your first paragraph with your third. None of the issues you mention are &quot;broadly agreed&quot;. They may poll well with everybody, but the opposition in Congress has been repeatedly re-elected on promises to oppose them. If they are passed along partisan lines, they will be battlefronts in the next election. Expect to hear &quot;rammed down our throats&quot; a lot.<p>Maybe, just maybe, you could get some actual bipartisan support on policy changes about China. But it&#x27;s not actually all that popular an issue -- except when reduced to racist name-calling. It&#x27;s important, to be sure, but any policy change will have winners and losers, and you can expect the losers to scream bloody murder. That will quickly become cemented along partisan lines. It&#x27;s a thorny, tangled issue with many, many parts, and and substantive policy change will require years of detailed negotiation.<p>There&#x27;s an argument to be made that they should go ahead and ram through issues important to their base, on the grounds that they might as well be popular with somebody. Centrism and bipartisanship sound great in the abstract but rarely please people in reality. At best, they result in boring incrementalism. At worst, one side sees a partisan advantage in portraying everything you do as extremist. Actually, the worst case is that <i>both</i> sides use that tactic.<p>I myself still support the idea of bending over backwards to assemble a centrist coalition and passing things that have broad support. But I&#x27;ve watched those efforts fail, over and over, with very few successes, and have become very jaded.')
