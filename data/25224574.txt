I agree that requiring connectivity for essential home appliances and door locks is downright foolish.<p>My mum saw this news, and asked me &quot;Did this affect your client&#x27;s IoT system, Peter?&quot; Here&#x27;s my reply.<p>Cloud computing is just somebody else&#x27;s computer. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;908&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;908&#x2F;</a><p>Amazon sells time on their computers, and calls the service &quot;AWS&quot;. \nActually, Amazon have 24 computers•. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;global-infrastructure&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;global-infrastructure&#x2F;</a><p>One of their computers is called US-east-1. That is the one that broke. The other Amazon computers (e.g. EU-west-1 in Ireland, AP-northeast-1 in Tokyo) were all fine.<p>Some of our programs run on AWS, but we are using the computer in Sydney (AP-southeast-2). So our services weren&#x27;t affected. \nOnly the people using US-east-1 were affected. This is the default computer for many people in the US. Even big companies like Google and Facebook sometimes use AWS computers.<p>We also use DigitalOcean&#x27;s computers for some other clients. That&#x27;s like AWS but cheaper and slower. I helped copy files from one computer to another. That&#x27;s called &quot;DevOps&quot;.<p>Peter<p>• Technically it&#x27;s a huge server farm with many computers, but they all have the same basic inputs and outputs: power [0], Internet access, air conditioning. \nAnything in the same physical location could be affected by earthquakes, fires [1], power cuts, Internet connections going offline, etc. This is why daddy likes to keep an off-site backup, for safety. \nThe government spies on people by seeing what is happening on Amazon&#x27;s computers. Wikileaks [2] has more detailed information about who is doing the spying in each place (usually a company around the corner).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carolinajournal.com&#x2F;news-article&#x2F;amazons-wind-farm-links-nonexistent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carolinajournal.com&#x2F;news-article&#x2F;amazons-wind-fa...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacenterknowledge.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;fire-amazon-data-center-construction-site-ashburn-contained" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacenterknowledge.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;fire...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikileaks.org&#x2F;amazon-atlas&#x2F;map&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikileaks.org&#x2F;amazon-atlas&#x2F;map&#x2F;</a>')
