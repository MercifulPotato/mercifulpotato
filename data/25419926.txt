At a company I worked at, we had a well known saying: &quot;Favor mechanisms over good intentions.&quot; As the saying went, if good intentions worked, we &quot;wouldn&#x27;t need mechanisms.&quot;<p>The right answer here (as stated in sibling comments) is to install a mechanism into the build. A push that accidentally commits credentials should break the build. How it goes about doing that is up to you, but the specific way I&#x27;ve done that in the past is a git hook [1] specifically the pre-commit hook. It looks like there&#x27;s a reasonably well-updated package by Yelp to help do this kind of thing [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2&#x2F;Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Yelp&#x2F;detect-secrets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Yelp&#x2F;detect-secrets</a>')
