It&#x27;s technically &quot;released&quot;, but Eth2 cannot be used to transact. If you move money to Eth2, it must stay in the same wallet&#x2F;address until more features are rolled out.<p>Everyone who uses Eth today is still on Eth1 because Eth2 is only good for having your coins sit there and accumulate interest.')
