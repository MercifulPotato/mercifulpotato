As a software engineer, LinkedIn is a place you can also get a bunch of inbound interest (I got my last 3 jobs on this platform, from inbound messages). I don&#x27;t use it for anything else: the data is deleted after I manually validate them.<p>But you raise a good point, thank you. I updated instructions, so anyone with no LinkedIn profile can email me directly with some other proof of their online presence.<p>Originally, I got a lot of spam requests from throwaway emails that I could not validate.<p>People who get the book this way also get access to updates: which will be fixes, corrections, and additional content.')
