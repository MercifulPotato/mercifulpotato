I would have thought that when you stop distributing the product containing the source code the responsibility to continue hosting the source code ends too?<p>It doesn&#x27;t cure the past violation, but a whole lot of legal importance rest on knowing violation, and continuing after being informed of the violation can, in addition to being evidence that you violation after the notice was intentional, weaken your argument that the violation before was not, so stopping a violation once you are informed of it reduces, though does not entirely eliminate, the legal risk. So, a hard stop on use when you are informed your currente use may be illegal is a perfectly sensible response in most cases <i>even if</i> you are evaluating whether your use <i>was</i> illegal and whether, if it was, you should, in the long term, either stop the use permanently or conform to whatever legal requirements attach to use.')
