Maybe because they&#x27;re putting &quot;business&quot; before &quot;human rights&quot;? Or maybe because it makes it seem like &quot;business rights&quot; and &quot;human rights&quot; are somehow similar? Or equal even? I&#x27;m not sure what it is that rubs me the wrong way but the name just feels totally out of touch and it doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about the center&#x27;s purpose.')
