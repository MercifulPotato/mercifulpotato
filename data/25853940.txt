Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[25858382], score=None, time=1611190200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853568, text='&gt; Why the need to defend this hot mess and everything it does as democratic, when technically it is not?<p>If we&#x27;re arguing technicalities, the US is &quot;technically&quot; a type of democracy - specifically a representative democracy. If we go by your more exacting standards every government decision, ordinance, or law except those by referenda isn&#x27;t democratic. Which is neither technically correct, nor is it correct as generally understood by laypeople. I agree with all the problems you pointed out but those are orthogonal to the question at hand.<p>DPRK is not a democracy because it fails several criteria. Russia is a de jure democracy but not a de facto one.')
