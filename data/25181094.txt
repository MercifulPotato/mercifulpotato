They just choose it to do it in different directions. Most often when someone says they don&#x27;t want to involve themselves with politics they are alright with the status-quo, which is a political position in itself. Politics is not just about a vote at a presidential election, it&#x27;s the how and why of everything you do and will do, be it in the tech startup or elsewhere.')
