Severe case, but <i>less</i> impact on nasal&#x2F;smelling membranes.<p>An initial infection in the outer nose - which is to some extent the body&#x27;s evolved sample-invaders-and-contain-them zone? Definite temporary impact on smell, but a relative immune-system head-start before viruses reach the lungs, so milder case overall.<p>(Some health-care workers have shown repeated positive nasal swabs, but remain asymptomatic &amp; seronegative for blood antibodies, suggesting they had a very mild infection fought-off completely in their nose&#x2F;throat. Some of these have also then generated re-infection reports, but similarly mild. It seems if the body has an easy time confining the infection the 1st time, it also never bothers to create a large standing army of antibodies â€“ but that&#x27;s exactly the situation where it doesn&#x27;t need to.)')
