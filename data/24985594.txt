France sends the army on patrol to mitigate the risk of terrorism. A friend in the army told me that when it is at the base level, the troops are patroling with empty rifles and no have bullet on them (basically just a display of force to make the population feel safer). When it is the medium level, they have bullets on them but none loaded in their rifles. When it is at the highest level their guns are loaded.')
