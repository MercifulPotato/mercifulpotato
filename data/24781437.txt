I moved from a 4k sqft house to an 800 sqft apartment with a ton of  hard drives (I&#x27;ve had this reliable 14 disc tower for years so it has a mix of HD&#x27;s that could be consolidated if I wanted), so having a NAS sitting in my small closet already is a bit annoying. I&#x27;d rather not have anything like that around anymore and just be able to stream from s3 would be great, especially if I want to move across the country &#x2F; world again and don&#x27;t have to worry about hardware.')
