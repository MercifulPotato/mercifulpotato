So many frontend let performance go by the way side when making interactive web apps.<p>And performance can also be UX, how things appear and the flow of the loading. Things like placeholder boxes [1] with the same size so the load isn’t janky is one good hack. The sort of thing you don’t have to care about with native apps.<p>[1] I’m on the fence about the value of loading icons in each placeholder, they’ll figure out something is loaded soon enough. Not need for the distraction or highlighting loading times. Errors for components are another matter.<p>Although of course server side rendering of everything is the ideal initial state.')
