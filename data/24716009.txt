Rubbermaid, for example, makes a variety of high quality reusable plastic food containers.<p>The Just Salad restaurant chain in NYC will sell you a reusable plastic salad container that you can wash and bring to them to prepare your meal in and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any issue with food safety regarding those bowls. It&#x27;s heavier duty than the clear disposable ones they give you otherwise.<p>There&#x27;s certainly a usable life to anything, plastic will degrade over multiple washes and being battered with utensils.  I&#x27;d expect well used ones would need to be retired but it should still be better than the current situation where they are primarily single use.')
