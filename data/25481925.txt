This includes all valuable rocks, minerals, oil and gas found on or within the Earth. Organizations or individuals in those countries cannot legally extract and sell any mineral commodity without first obtaining an authorization from the government&quot;<p>In the USA is not exactly liked that but &quot;Property rights and mineral rights were originally tied to the land. The owner owned both. However, mineral rights and property rights can be severed, meaning the owner can sell one and keep the other. So, the original owner of your land may have sold the property rights to one person and kept the mineral rights or sold it to another person. By the time you bought the land, the mineral rights may have been sold already.&quot;<p>So you could be committing a crime by mining gold with only the property rights, you also need mining rights.')
