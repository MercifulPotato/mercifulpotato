Devs hate adding comments, writing documentation, maintaining tasks&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;etc., and everything else that we need them to do. Some people try to make them track their time, which I think is both pointless and unlikely to happen.<p>The only solution to this is to move it out of the &quot;discipline&quot; column and into the &quot;process&quot; column. For example, I set up git hooks so that a commit will be rejected unless it&#x27;s tagged with an issue number. And then I have another rule that says that issues aren&#x27;t accepted unless they have the important fields filled out (&quot;steps to reproduce&quot; for a bug, &quot;user story&quot; for a feature).<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it definitely creates better habits overall.')
