It&#x27;s a calculating and deliberate effort, not to separate his personal life from politics - which would be reasonable - but to create a more attractive persona to present to the electorate. It&#x27;s one which is quite different from his real persona. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all unreasonable to resist that effort.<p>No idea what Harry Houdini has to do with this.
