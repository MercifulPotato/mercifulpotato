It doesn&#x27;t even make sense.  If GME was objectively such a good bet, you really think that those institutional investors out there were simply ignoring it?  That Robinhood&#x27;s users <i>alone</i> were the <i>sole</i> reason for the speculative spike in this stock?<p>This is a SCAM. Robinhood users were the VICTIMS.  And I won&#x27;t speak to their motives, and am no real fan, but the truth is Robinhood saved you people a ton of money by refusing those trades.')
