We have apps from official repos, downloaded DEBS and&#x2F;or RPMs, flatpak apps, appimages that dont&#x27; integrate into menus, snaps (if you&#x27;re locked into Ubuntu), maybe a docker image or two. Nevermind half these apps are probably Electron based regardless of their crappy packaging<p>Unfortunately this seems to be the best that can be done with the Linux Desktop community&#x27;s extremely fragmentary and complexity-worshiping nature. There is no agreement on what constitutes the base &quot;Linux Desktop&quot; platform, and very little ABI back and forward compatibility.')
