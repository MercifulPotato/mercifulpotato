Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607967634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419483, text='Once again I am getting the message that I am posting too fast.  I think its when I am flagged for my &#x27;contentious viewpoints&#x27;.  Last time it was 3 hours before I could post, but I will submit this when I can.  HN can be very frustrating.<p>Whether we agree or not, if you appreciate my taking the time to reply and provide you my thoughts, feel free to upvote me - I think a higher score may help in allowing me to respond in a more timely manner!<p>Back to your post.<p>Strangely (or perhaps not so strangely given my &#x27;feralimal&#x27; handle) I was thinking about feral children and their inability to speak.<p>I think you would say they live a worse life than you.  But why?  How do you know?  You do not.<p>You and I live in our classification systems - we probably share a very similar type.  We were taught our classification systems at school and they are self-evident, right?  Eg: &quot;A whale is not a fish, its a mammal.&quot;, &quot;this is a tree, not a bush&quot;, &quot;tomatoes are a fruit&quot;, &quot;peanuts are a legume&quot;, etc.  This is an example of how we live in the ideas that we were given.<p>Think now about the feral child.  This child will also have some sort of system to interpret the world.  But its system would be very different to ours.  It would have developed it on its own.  The feral child wouldn&#x27;t necessarily see a distinction between itself and the nature it lives in.<p>Now step back and apply some value to that.  Which is the better way of living?<p>Is it better to live in your head, with layers and layers of classification systems filtering your engagement with the world?  Going to work, coding, making some money to be able to pay your mortgage, and afford some takeaway?<p>Or is it better to feel a connection with the external reality, even if you can&#x27;t talk about it?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know.<p>I can say that trying to engage more deeply with &#x27;reality&#x27;.  I suspect I am forever separate.  Maybe feral children are too.  But, I think innately, connecting to whatever is the source is what I yearn for.  And I suspect it is the same for everyone else.<p>And then, my assessment is that the education we receive is about making that possibility almost impossible to even conceive of.<p>I just realised I didn&#x27;t answer your question: &quot;Who decides what is neutral? What if you are trained by masters or schools with conflicting thoughts? What if you read all sides of an argument? Is this information not valuable to the informed choices of an individual?&quot;<p>You decide.  You are free to view all information, and consider it.  You can judge for yourself whether the argument you are presented with is sound or not.  Whether all the assumptions are stated and whether the conclusion that follows is rational.  If you don&#x27;t have all the information, that is fine - you can work with your best hypothesis.  I think the key thing is whether you are acting in good faith.  If someone presents some information that you can&#x27;t reconcile easily, that is likely an indication that you need to investigate further.  You may get some data that will better inform your understanding.')
