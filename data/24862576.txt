Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603396199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24860203, text='It doesn&#x27;t sound like the university publicly and transparently revealed this -- the BBC wouldn&#x27;t have to be cagey about how they listened in on the chat if that were true, they could just say &quot;according to UCSF&quot;. But it wasn&#x27;t that, it was an &quot;anonymous tip-off&quot;.<p>So we already know the university was not being transparent and open about it. When I say &quot;whistleblower&quot;, I mean someone who secretly gave the BBC the info and remains secret because they weren&#x27;t supposed to and would be disciplined at work for it.<p>The university has PLENTY of incentive to obscure facts here, because the official line is that it&#x27;s immoral to pay hackers like this (it encourages future hacks, law enforcement says not to do it), and because it reveals them as having made IT mistakes that led to a ransomware takeover where they decided their best&#x2F;cheapest recovery option was to pay up (instead of restoring from backups etc). It does not make them look good to have paid up, that&#x27;s plenty of incentive to not want the BBC to report it.<p>Also, having spent many years working for universities, I think it&#x27;s kind of cute that you think they &quot;have to operate in a transparent manner.&quot; Would that it were true.')
