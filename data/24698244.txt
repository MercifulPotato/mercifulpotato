A &quot;hello world&quot; program could fetch every character from a separate database; same output but enormously more complex process.<p>A small car could have 16 wheels, 2 engines, and be controlled by typing commands on a keypad (&quot;steer left 3 degrees&quot;).<p>Don&#x27;t tell me these examples are just exposing some complexity that was already there, or that complexity is a conserved constant, etc.<p>It&#x27;s amazing what can be made to sound plausible with an erudite wiring style.')
