Item(by='eloff', descendants=None, kids=[25402862], score=None, time=1607814782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402627, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, but this is a profound misapprehension of the humanities: one of the first things you do in the study of history is learn that history is a human project, subject to human flaws. We don&#x27;t take Thucydides and Herodotus at their words; we expect the &quot;facts&quot; of history to be distorted.<p>Sure, but there&#x27;s still a basis in facts where can corroborate accounts from different authors, even different sides in a war. yes it&#x27;s subject to interpretation, and there&#x27;s no one right answer. But you also can&#x27;t just make stuff up and get people to take you seriously. There&#x27;s some rigour to making and presenting your arguments. Very different to gender studies.<p>&gt; I know that it&#x27;s difficult, but please consider whether your own positions have become dogmatic. You don&#x27;t have to agree with prevailing views in gender studies (I don&#x27;t even know what they are!); you merely have to ask yourself whether you&#x27;re qualified to dismiss it as &quot;an ideology with very little basis in reality.&quot;<p>Maybe. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of terrible examples of things from gender studies. I&#x27;m sure there have to be some redeeming ideas right? The whole field can&#x27;t be 100% worthless. But by and large there&#x27;s not much value in it and a lot of nonsense, incorrect, and even dangerous thinking to be found there.')
