I&#x27;d indirectly see it when every few years my employer would change providers, and then I&#x27;d have to worry about whether or not my doctor was in the new provider&#x27;s network.<p>Co-workers who wanted to add spouses to their plan did have to pay for it themselves on some of the plans, and they grumbled about the cost.<p>Now that I buy insurance myself on my state&#x27;s health insurance exchange, cost is one of my top complaints.')
