Keep in mind there’s also a wide variety of “medical practitioners” like chiropractors, therapists, various “unlicensed medical practitioners” who practice eastern medicine etc. Even within traditional medicine you’ve got your small GP whose struggling to keep their practice afloat (it’s a regular business) and extremely wealthy surgeons or other doctors who identify a niche they can make extremey lucrative (eg unscrupulous pain management doctors who process high volume and low effort clients).<p>There’s a wide variety of outcomes even after the great filter that are MCATs and medical school.<p>For example, Thomas F. Frist Jr. is worth ~13 billion. Now granted at those levels he’s more an entrepreneur&#x2F;businessman as all such people are. Still, the difference between his net worth and a regular GP making $400k is probably about the same difference as a musician worth $300 million and a musician making $200&#x2F;year.')
