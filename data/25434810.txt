Users on dating apps are also rather fickle, and will jump to the next best app once that becomes available, so even with a big market share, there isn&#x27;t much lock-in and there isn&#x27;t much of an outsized benefit to the position as a market leader. E.g. in the European market Bumble appeared a few years after Tinder and within 1-2 years basically everybody that I know that used Tinder before at least tried out Bumble and many continue to use both or switched outright. Of course that&#x27;s very anecdotal, but current statistics for number of US users for both apps paint a similar picture[0].<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s safe to assume they own 80-90% of the market share. That is pretty close to monopoly if you ask me.<p>In 2016, they apparently owned 25% of market share[1], which is pretty far away from a monopoly if you ask me.<p>It seems a bit weird to me to group them together with Alphabet&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Apple. The others span far more markets, and have much much stronger lock-in effect which they can unfairly leverage to push other products. Compared to that, Match Group is laughable.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;826778&#x2F;most-popular-dating-apps-by-audience-size-usa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;826778&#x2F;most-popular-dati...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;why-match-group-stock-climbed-157-last-month.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fool.com&#x2F;investing&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;why-match-group-st...</a>')
