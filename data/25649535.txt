Some research may be done elsewhere but AFAIK it&#x27;s the only lab in the world doing lots of work with SARS and relatives. The &quot;batwoman&quot; researcher who works at WIV is somewhat famous for gathering thousands of bat viruses from caves across China.<p>In addition RATg13, the closest related virus to COVID, wasn&#x27;t published by the lab until after the pandemic outbreak. Even though the sample was supposedly collected years ago. If they&#x27;re sitting on random unpublished coronavirus genomes doesn&#x27;t it seem likely that COVID was one of these?<p>Theres too many coincidences for me. I would bet money that it&#x27;s a lab leak')
