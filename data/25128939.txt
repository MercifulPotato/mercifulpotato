My open source pet project is an audio plugin that I developed to use in my own music projects. For whatever reason, it has become popular among a certain niche of musicians, and now I get reports of a rare bug that blasts their headphones with a high decibel noise. It&#x27;s super unnerving that it threatens to damage people&#x27;s ears and equipment, and I still don&#x27;t know enough about why it is happening in order to fix it, because I mostly just wrapped an existing library that I wanted to use.')
