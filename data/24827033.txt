Would it mean they prefer the government to run everything? Nonsense.<p>Are the Democrats the socialists and the Republicans the capitalists? These words are little more than partisan shibboleths. The media portrays the Democrats as socialists, and the Republicans capitalists. Yet Republicans vote for socialist policies (Medicare, social security, unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, etc.)')
