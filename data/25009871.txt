Be politically active; get on a committee or two and get to know the local boards and elected officials.<p>Years ago I read of several Boomers who settled in north Boston in a rather bombed out neighborhood, invested themselves into this area and became politically active.  The city was more responsive to them because of the fact that they were known and active and vocal.<p>Of course also support business investments and reasonable taxes &amp; zoning regulations in your city, because without money, nothing else will succeed.<p>Also support your local public schools, take an active interest, get on the school committee, volunteer if possible at the school, and just be involved. Schools are vital to attracting solid families to an area to anchor it and reduce crime and negligence.<p>Good luck and keep in mind that it&#x27;s a decades-long pursuit, not something that is solved in a month, or even a year.  This is a marathon, not a sprint.')
