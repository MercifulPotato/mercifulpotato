The bigger banks are usually chummy with all institutional investors and will certainly pull shit to make a higher profit. An elite boutique bank, or a reputed banker running the show, can work wonders. For tech, one such bank is Qatalyst, for healthcare it&#x27;s Centerview, like that, for instance. Even better if they can run an auction process for you.<p>That being said, the number of good &quot;reputable&quot; bankers is increasingly declining as they&#x27;ve soon realized they could make much more money on the investing side. There is a serious dearth of excellent bankers and a lot of mediocre bankers. This policy could not have come at a better time, if not earlier.')
