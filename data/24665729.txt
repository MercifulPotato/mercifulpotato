Sometimes I see &quot;he&#x2F;him&#x2F;his&quot; or &quot;she&#x2F;her&#x2F;hers&quot;, &quot;they&#x2F;them&#x2F;theirs&quot;, etc.<p>I doubt people are mixing and matching among the different types. In other words, I&#x27;ve never seen someone prefer &quot;he&#x2F;them&#x2F;hers&quot;.<p>Seems like we can standardize this to just one type (e.g. the subject pronoun). A simple &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, or &quot;they&quot; will do the trick.<p>Yes, I bikeshedded it. Sue me.')
