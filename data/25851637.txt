How, you might ask, does salmonella get into lettuce? You will probably be grossed out to hear the answer.</i><p>Spoiler: field workers who don&#x27;t get bathroom breaks.<p>I think a lot of people don&#x27;t understand that farming is messy work.  After highschool I worked at a bean processing plant where my job was to pick dead small animals (usually rodents, snakes, and frogs) out of the beans as they sped by on a conveyor belt.  The machines needed to harvest the massive quantities of food our civilization requires do not discriminate between beans and the animals living in bean fields.  But here is the thing; almost nobody gets sick from this.  Wash your produce.  Raccoons do it, and so should you.  If you do, you&#x27;ll almost certainly be fine just like nearly everybody else.  It&#x27;s gross, but it&#x27;s not really a problem.')
