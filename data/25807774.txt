From the middle of Bach&#x27;s life onward his music gets increasingly challenging and dissonant. Play some of the alto lines on a flute and it&#x27;s indistinguishable from bebop to a layperson&#x27;s ear. Seriously crazy shit.<p>Also, even though Bach was a also string player (and probably an expert one, because he could play Bach pieces ;) some of the published works end up with errors that are hard or impossible to play. This canâ€™t be attributed to deafness. As with Mozart, Bach and many other composers (maybe not Haydn), Beethoven seems to have got bored with his older styles and kept moving aggressively forward.')
