Until that I haven&#x27;t noticed it, but at some point in my history with Windows boxes, crashes and issues became a rare notable event. I started relying on them. I was surprised.<p>Alas, it turns out my OS drive was busted. Not Windows&#x27; fault. Before that, more than a year ago I had some crashes with Windows, by then it was my GPU dying out. It&#x27;s all anecdata, and it still doesn&#x27;t feel right to praise Windows for its stability (guess everyome from earlier days would feel the same), but hey, in last few years my Windows OSes outlasted the hardware they worked on.<p>In the meantime I can&#x27;t count how many times I had to reboot my Macs (two of them) for one reason or another. Crashes after wakeups, permanent visual bugs that only get solved after reboots, weird slowndowns, Mac&#x27;s disdain for external monitors and adaptors, etc etc. Back then Mac was the it-just-works machine, nowadays I would attribute that to nothing but Windows.')
