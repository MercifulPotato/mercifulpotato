Most of it would also be fine on Twitter or Facebook, except that some of the conspiracy stuff might get a misinformation warning and&#x2F;or a fact check link.<p>That&#x27;s why sites like Parler, Gab, and Voat end up as cesspools. Those who don&#x27;t feel the need to post racism and calls to violence can just stay on the mainstream services, getting both their political discussion and their non-political discussion in one convenient place.<p>Voat tried to have the non-political stuff too, but it just ended up with racism there too. For example, in &#x2F;v&#x2F;movies people complaining that the &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; cast included a black actor, and going off about how it was the Jews in Hollywood behind this for nefarious reasons.')
