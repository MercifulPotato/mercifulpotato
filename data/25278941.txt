I have a family plan and both my wife and I have the same issues.<p>First, Spotify has no idea how to pipe its playlists to Alexa and Google ... so you can&#x27;t ever seem to get either to play playlists.<p>Second, Spotify randomly decides sometimes that it won&#x27;t connect to the Internet, even when your phone has a 4G connection and everything else works fine.  To compound the issue, Spotify doesn&#x27;t know how to show you your offline downloads when you are in Android Auto mode ... so you basically can&#x27;t even play your songs when on a drive.<p>I need to figure out how to export my playlists and then I&#x27;m off Spotify forever.  Worse customer experience ever.')
