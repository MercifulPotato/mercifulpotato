This might just be due to my use cases, but the Ruby documentation is 100x more useful for getting me from point A to point B than anything I&#x27;ve seen from Python&#x27;s docs.<p>I still use Python daily, since its so ubiquitous, I just find myself having a difficult time using it for anything remotely complicated without a lot of extra research.')
