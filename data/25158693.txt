I bought all capacity up front and paid the ZFS tax. So I don&#x27;t need to expand as I go.<p>But if you want to expand as you go, Linux + MDADM are still fine in my opinion. It&#x27;s a tradeoff. Do you want to &#x27;pay&#x27; the ZFS tax and expand at a cost, or do you want a bit more risk (on paper)  but more flexibility?<p>I ran a RAID6 of 20 drives before that using Linux + MDADM and that worked fine. And MDADM allows you to expand as you go, exactly as you want.<p>I think the risks ZFS protect against are very small.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;louwrentius.com&#x2F;what-home-nas-builders-should-understand-about-silent-data-corruption.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;louwrentius.com&#x2F;what-home-nas-builders-should-unders...</a>')
