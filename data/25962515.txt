More than &#x27;native born&#x27; Americans, that&#x27;s for sure.<p>Even for &#x27;native born&#x27; Americans, they almost all moved to the bay area (or the office&#x2F;city they are in) from another state, sometimes half way across the country, and almost none grew up in the area the business or office is in.  People who are ambitious will move to the opportunity.')
