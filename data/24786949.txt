I lived there for thirty years and my ideas, boring and mainstream by European standards, were constantly considered &quot;laughable&quot;, &quot;na√Øve&quot;, &quot;ignorant.&quot;  Now I live in Europe again, where I again get all the things that Americans thought were laughable and impossible.<p>In particular, America&#x27;s been continuously at war for my whole life, and I&#x27;m no longer a young man.  America&#x27;s spent more money on weapons than the next ten countries put together.  Calling America &quot;peaceful&quot; is totally false to the fact - it&#x27;s obscene considering you&#x27;ve killed hundreds of thousands of completely innocent people in the last twenty years.')
