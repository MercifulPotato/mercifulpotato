When I first ordered something from Anker (a USB-C dongle IIRC), I was worried it&#x27;d be knock-off trash. Their brand hadn&#x27;t been established long enough for me to evaluate their reputation. But the quality was high and now I trust it. I was happy to pick up one of their MacBook Pro USB-C hubs on Prime Day, and would happily buy more Anker supplies in the future.')
