Things change. Just because one company is up now doesn&#x27;t mean it will be up forever.<p>I think one thing TSMC does better than intel is they have a more long term view. They aren&#x27;t as concerned about hitting next quarters earnings. Their single biggest shareholder is the government of Taiwan. One of their board members a is Taiwanese minister, So I think the government wants to make sure TSMC is around for the long term. They also provide a lot of jobs in Taiwan. If have ever been to Hsinchu you could see how many jobs the semi industry provides. Everything from engineers to more blue color workers.')
