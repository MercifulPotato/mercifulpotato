This plug-in is just a sampling strategy to make rendered depth of field less noisy.<p>The video you linked just talks about a shot that was purposely made to be an homage to a classic cinematic technique even though it isn&#x27;t necessary.  Depth of field in production computer graphics is almost exclusively done with depth maps in compositing.  Because there are many different layers that won&#x27;t give seam artifacts around the edges as well as floating point outputs that don&#x27;t clip, depth maps are even easier to make work.')
