It takes a bad situation and makes it worse. Because even if the US and Chile are having issues and Chile then prints 1 million for all its citizens and then comes to my county and they all say we have a million now we want to spend in your country it doesn’t really work. I think my point is it is two separate matter yes there was something crippling their economy ie sanctions but printing money still was the cause of inflation. Another option would be look at what is causing sanctions and work to resolve that.')
