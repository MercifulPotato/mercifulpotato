The app will give you directions tailored for your specific mode of travel.</i><p>FWIW, there are at least two layers of map that map apps have <i>no</i> clue about that I find essential as a cyclist: how much shade am I going to get while going down a road in a city that routinely has temperatures that are near the top end of what the human body can deal with? And how bad is the road surface in a constantly-sinking swamp city full of potholes and half-assed repairs?<p>There’s other layers - I don’t need to worry about whether or not I want to trade a longer route for clawing my way up a steep grade now that I don’t live in Seattle, for instance.')
