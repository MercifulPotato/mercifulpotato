If you’re using LTO-8, which is the current generation, you’d get a 10-pack of 12TB tapes for around $500. Noticeably cheaper per byte than hard drives.<p>I don’t recommend LTO-2 just because I don’t think that the drives are well-supported.<p>&gt; While tapes are theoretically cool, the the drives are just too rare for them to be of any practical value to a home user. Even if the media has a better archival life than a hard disk (say 50 years), it won&#x27;t do you a damn bit of good if there are no drives available in 50 years to read it.<p>If you’re evaluating just on the basis of the price of drives &#x2F; media, then there’s a cutoff where tape becomes cheaper than hard drives. The easy way to calculate this cutoff is to divide the overhead cost (tape drive price) by the difference in the cost per TB of tapes and hard drives, which in the example here, is around $3k divided by $25&#x2F;TB, or 120 TB.<p>In other words, if you have more than about 120 TB of data, then it is cheaper to buy a tape drive. I think any comments about whether tape drives are suitable for home use are really comments about whether you are interested in the use case of people who need to store &gt;120 TB at home.<p>If you are running a YouTube channel as a hobby, or you run a side business doing videography for weddings, the tape drive starts to sound a lot better. The 120 TB cutoff might be around 300 hours of video, which might be only 50 events.<p>There are a lot of other reasons why you might NOT want to use tape, but it’s easy to have enough data that tape is the cheapest storage option. At “enterprise” scale the cost calculus is completely different and involves things like support contracts with Oracle (not necessary for hard drives), power&#x2F;cooling in your DC (tape is very low-power), etc.<p>And let’s not forget that if you have 120TB of hard drives, you’re in the regime where you start having to buy multiple machines.<p>As for longetivity—I don’t have the data handy. If you are storing data on tape, you need to migrate to newer generations of tape, as old generations become obsolete and unavailable. If you are storing on hard disks, you also need to migrate because hard disks eventually fail (even if they are not powered on).')
