Unless there are very progressive taxes or other mechanisms to correct the imbalance.  Itâ€™s just always amusing to me how apoplectic the ultra rich get at the suggestion that their taxes get raised.  The future of the nation literally depends on it.  They really do want to collect the wealth generated by the working people of the country and not pay for the public services that maintain that population.')
