Plants tend to be limited by light, so when you go up you shadow horizontal land. There is some efficiency gain because solar panels -&gt; LED can convert light wave lengths, but I don&#x27;t know if it is enough to overcome the losses in the system plus the cost of the building.<p>Vertical farms are all niches: lettuce is high value, and spoils fast. Thus they can get closer&#x2F;faster to market by going vertical. They convert electric (coal and natural gas) to light, so they are not very environmentally sound.')
