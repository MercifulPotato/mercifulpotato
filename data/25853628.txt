It&#x27;s a way of using a label to dismiss ideas and policies people have good, legitimate reasons to support.<p>The article opens with a broad caricature of &quot;Right-NIMBYs&quot;, which is completely farcical and made in bad faith:<p>&gt; We’re all familiar by now with Right-NIMBYs — conservatives who block transit and housing development in order to keep poor people and minorities out of their quiet white-flight suburban neighborhoods.<p>People have reasons to block housing development that don&#x27;t have anything to do with poor people or minorities. To ascribe this intention as the primary motivation is ridiculous, and completely self-serving. In reality, the main reason for most people to block development is simply that they enjoy their present neighborhood character, lifestyle, sense of space&#x2F;openness, access to amenities that are not over-subscribed, etc.')
