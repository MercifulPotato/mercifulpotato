A lot better than either one, though, is splitting your logic into multiple lines and assigning a descriptive identifier to each step. Maybe even throw in some inline comments if you&#x27;re particularly respectful of others&#x27; time.<p>As tempting as it is to do something super clever and cram a ton of functionality into a small number of lines or characters (it does feel good), it&#x27;s just better to be a bit more verbose and write simple, obvious code. I feel like code should be read like a book, not a puzzle.')
