For one thing, they do not have any shortage of apps coming in to their app store. They&#x27;re no longer in the business of begging people to deploy apps. Instead, they&#x27;re in the business of vetting the apps people submit.<p>Raising barriers to entry for new developers is a cost-cutting measure for them. And fewer apps on the store, even at the margins, is a revenue enhancer for incumbent app developers.<p>This may or may not be an explicit factor in their decision making. But it surely contributes to their lack of focus on docs: better docs will improve their profitability not at all.')
