Item(by='Loughla', descendants=None, kids=[25873753, 25878372, 25873484, 25873498], score=None, time=1611334413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873223, text='&gt;a depleted battery pack means less range or costly repair, etc.<p>This has actually stopped me from buying a used EV in the last year, twice. Dealers aren&#x27;t up front about used cars history in general, and, again from just the two I looked at, they are 1000% hiding any information they can regarding the battery packs.<p>This is the largest hurdle to the used car market (after the shortage of used EV&#x27;s because of their novelty). People hesitate to buy used combustion cars, because of unknown mechanical issues that may pop up; but this can be alleviated by using a trusted mechanic to once-over the car. They ABSOLUTELY hesitate to buy used EV&#x27;s because of the battery packs, and who can you go to in order to evaluate that? Nobody.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m just really curious to see if&#x2F;when middle- and lower-class Americans start adopting these in large numbers.<p>When they have no choice. I&#x27;m in this boat - I work in education and my spouse works in education. We are solidly middle- to lower-middle class. We can&#x27;t afford most new cars. Used cars are pricey anymore as well. The only way we will upgrade to an EV is if we can find a trustworthy used model, or when we have no choice, because gas is $10&#x2F;gallon.')
