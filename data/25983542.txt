Part of what&#x27;s allowing gamestop stock to explode recently is that it&#x27;s next to impossible to find shares to borrow for shorting.  If everyone who wanted to short the stock could do so without having to borrow shares, price discovery might work significantly better.  (I assume the counter-argument would be that short squeezes could be even more intense. But perhaps they would be less likely to occur in the first place.)')
