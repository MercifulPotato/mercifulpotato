One day the captain of the ship was transporting containers filled with crabs. When he discovered it was crabs he got upset and said to his fellow sailors to make sure there is lids on those containers so that they do not get out. To that one sailor said “Dont worry captain. These are Indian crabs. If one gets up another will pull him down.” I remember thinking of this story and feel we are like crabs in India and some of it has to do with huge population and limited resources. If we had a limited population and plenty of resources we would not be doing Jugad.')
