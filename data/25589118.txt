They take issue with verbiage <i>they personally hear</i> from younger people. Here is a quote from the article:<p>&gt; “ The first thing I tell them is to talk less and listen more. I don’t know if this is a generational thing or they’re just nervous to talk to me or what, but most of these conversations begin with me getting machine gunned to death with someone’s line of shit right out of the gates. Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang…bang…bang bang bang bang…\nI’m thinking to myself, “Oh my god, take a breath, kid.”\nMaybe I sounded that way in my twenties too – being excited, feeling like everyone wanted to hear every thought I had on every subject under the sun. I don’t remember.\nSo I give them the best advice I can think of for building a practice in financial advice and developing client relationships. First of all, I says, “You don’t even know what the f<i></i>* you don’t know.””<p>So it does not seem the author is talking about sales &#x2F; client relations, at least that isn’t the primary issue they raise and the context of when they advise younger people to be quiet and listen is very different than any sales &#x2F; client relations context.')
