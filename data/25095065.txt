It&#x27;s true, typing the command to deploy takes no time at all.<p>However.<p>It took an entire day&#x27;s work to install the prerequisites.  Docker.  Node.js.  The authenticator tool that for some reason needs an entire headless Chromium.  The tool that actually does the deployment.  Configuration files with magic strings in them.  YAML.  JSON.  After a year and a half of fairly stable operation (at least as good as you can get from Windows 10), my work laptop now randomly bluescreens.  Neither he nor I understands what most of this stuff does -- it&#x27;s tribal knowledge he found on a corporate OneNote somewhere.  I have no idea what we just automated away, or how difficult it would be to send my 500 lines of Python code to this cloud service by hand.<p>On the plus side, I can now deploy my code by typing ten characters in the console.')
