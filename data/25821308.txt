You lose the conveniences of having it auto-start and using the GUI configuration, but you still get all the functionality. You also can&#x27;t use the installer, but you can just copy the Synergy directory from a working machine. You also need a MS C++ runtime DLL, but you can copy that too. I&#x27;m not in front of my computer at the moment. I&#x27;ll edit&#x2F;reply to this comment with details<p>For example, on my client&#x2F;project-specific machine (where I don&#x27;t have admin rights), I have a batch file (start-synergy.bat) that lives on my desktop with:<p><pre><code>  C:\\Users\\jdbernard\\Synergy-1.12.0\\synergyc.exe -name client-pc 192.168.1.120</code></pre>')
