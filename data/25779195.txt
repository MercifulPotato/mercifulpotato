Animations work properly inside Windows VM through Parallels, so I guess this is what their proprietary driver does.<p>Apart from that I played Witcher 3, Sekiro and Dark Souls through CrossOver with no issues and very solid performance on basically the weakest ARM Mac that will ever exist.<p>But I of course agree that Linux is much better option for gaming.')
