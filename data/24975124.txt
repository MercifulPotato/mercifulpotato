In the US, USSF lightened it’s stance on hats at lower levels because of skin and eye cancer cases involving “people everyone knew.” But you won’t see it a high level (e.g. professional matches) and young referees seeking to move up are discouraged from it in practice. And because the parallel system of High School and College officiating allow hats, USSF is probably more open than many national associations. The ADA also creates some legal liability as well that is unique to the US.')
