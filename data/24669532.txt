Item(by='franciscop', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601699295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669482, text='&gt; Maintainers can now gatekeep your contributions, so even if it&#x27;s something meaningful the maintainer can deny you a +1 PR for your work. It can be frustrating spending a non-insignificant amount of time to get the t-shirt the right way and then have that time nullified.<p>As someone else replied, if you say you are making a significant contribution but the maintainer says you are not, you are not. If you strongly believe the maintainer is wrong and care enough, forks are always there.<p>Would also like to note that &quot;putting a non-insignificant amount of time&quot; is also not a valid premise for contributing to OSS, what counts is your actual contribution, not the time you spent making it. (e.g. for a given fix, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it took 1 min or 10 hours, what matters is other things like the quality of it).')
