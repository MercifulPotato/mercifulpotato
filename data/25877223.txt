I am honest with recruiters about what I make, some of them to &quot;oh shit that&#x27;s 3x what we are looking to pay&quot; and some go &quot;oh ok cool that&#x27;s probably doable.&quot; Then you go down the road with the second set and depending on how well you interview they make you an offer you can take, negotiate or leave. So I am in a position of strictly more options than if I had a rule of not speaking to folks who didn&#x27;t state a range.')
