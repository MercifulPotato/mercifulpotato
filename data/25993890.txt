It&#x27;s the worst part about psychiatric drugs and why I&#x27;ve bailed on almost everyone I&#x27;ve ever been on. It&#x27;s that initial hump and having to struggle through ~two weeks of hell.<p>My partner has run the gamut so he constantly assured me it was normal and that I&#x27;d be fine.<p>&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d like to add is that diet for me made a huge difference. I might as well not be taking the meds if I have a carb-heavy breakfast. Prior to taking the meds I had quit eating breakfast altogether because I felt like such crap around lunchtime if I ate breakfast. Obviously taking stimulants on an empty stomach is not a great idea, and my psychiatrist helped me out to go for a breakfast that doesn&#x27;t provoke such a strong insulin response.<p>Diet is my next interest but haven&#x27;t gotten tools perfected to track the variables that I think will be affected (productivity, happiness, energy and sleep).<p>I am vaguely on the train of diet affecting productivity but my daily lunch is a McDouble and large caffeine-free soda to sip on so... non-conclusive currently. I also skip breakfast because of the same reasons (too heavy + no good breakfast foods, even 30-in-30 always slows me down)<p>I have found that many &#x27;healthy&#x27; foods make me feel sick or worsen productivity so I am tentatively sticking to my weird diet for now. I have suspicions I may have food allergies and that could be causing it.')
