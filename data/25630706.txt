Item(by='humanrebar', descendants=None, kids=[25631450], score=None, time=1609765069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25630590, text='&gt; Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#x27;t have a marketplace of options...<p>I&#x27;m not sure the cause and effect work that way, at least not entirely.<p>Unions do restrain roles of workers and structure compensation to particular patterns. It seems plausible to me that those sorts of restrictions are in some ways detrimental to companies that wish to (or need to) disrupt incumbents. It&#x27;s plausible that they function as a sort of regulatory capture. In some cases, as with unions of government workers, literal regulator capture enters the picture too.')
