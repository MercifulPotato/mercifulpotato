I think even in my age group, you saw tech skills primarily being taken up by people my age as &quot;you can make a lot of money with this&quot;, or at least that was the mindset of most of my classmates at a mid tier state college.<p>Most of them seemed to have taken CS classes in high school and enjoyed it reasonably enough or have had CS recommended to them as a major since you could easily get a job in it (like the other reply to your comment suggested).<p>On the other hand, my interest in CS and programming was a lot more old school. I got on the internet for the first time in the mid 2000s and learned to make basic websites for my hobby and then JS, PHP, MySQL to make them interactive. I&#x27;m not sure I would&#x27;ve followed the career path I&#x27;m in now if I&#x27;d been born 5-10 years later. The epicenter of my hobby moved to FB&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;Youtube and if I were growing up now I think I would&#x27;ve tried to share my hobby through those platforms and therefore never gotten into what I did now. I&#x27;m lucky I was born the time I am and thanks for an interesting question to think about!')
