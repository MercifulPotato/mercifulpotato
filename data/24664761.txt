There do exist hyper-sensitive people seeking out reason to be offended... and other hyper-sensitive people seeking out evidence of others&#x27; hyper-sensitivity and getting offended about that.<p>Both are further stirred by major media trawling through minor media and social media for something to declare as &quot;controversial&quot;. I had never heard of the Adele thing, and a quick Google turned up a CNN article which said[1]:<p>&gt; The singer was quickly accused of cultural appropriation by some users for the hairstyle and top.<p>How many users is &quot;some&quot;? A dozen? A hundred? Does it really merit &quot;controversy&quot;?<p>Much of the time, I&#x27;ve found, one hypersensitive person is piled on by a thousand people who have found yet more evidence that there is an enormous social effort to repress them. They rarely or never encounter anybody who actually puts them down, but they hear about somebody else, and that&#x27;s repeated so often that it sounds massive.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen it here on HN an awful lot: &quot;I can&#x27;t even say X anymore without being told how bad I am by a bunch of snowflakes&quot;, blithely ignoring how much of a snowflake that makes them. All they want is to be able to say whatever they want without anybody disagreeing -- is that so wrong?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;adele-bantu-knots-notting-hill-carnival-trnd&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;entertainment&#x2F;adele-bantu-kno...</a>')
