Propaganda always existed and political parties always paid for billboards, ads and submarine articles to mislead people. This dates back centuries (remember how &quot;snake oil salesman&quot; term came to be?).<p>Facebook however makes the reach of these propaganda articles larger by order of the magnitude, it makes it utterly cheap to reach a vast amount of audience with any kind of message.<p>It exposes the rotten core of society, where demagogues and liars can be hugely successful and where truth isn&#x27;t really all that important. And then amplifies this until things start breaking.<p>So anyone who puts blame solely on Facebook is wrong. But Facebook also isn&#x27;t the naive neutral entity here just like a person using a fan to spread fires isn&#x27;t.')
