Render the widgets and 2. Evaluate the layout and process input accordingly. You invoke the GUI code in the second context on every input, and after that invoke it in the first context only if the calls in the second context potentially resulted in a change. This minimizes re-rendering and eliminates page tearing while allowing you to re-render reactively to events.<p>You will of course still need some kind of basic state tracking to make the GUI re-render to reflect changes that are not triggered by input.<p>In general, I agree, though. The right tool for the right job.')
