Item(by='yarcob', descendants=None, kids=[25920324, 25920013], score=None, time=1611688449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919194, text='This is getting a bit off-topic, but there are good reasons why biometric data is especially sensitive.<p>For example, the GDPR emphasizes the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;. If something bad happened to you, you may not want to be forever defined by that event. A kidnapped person might not want to be forever known as just a crime victim. So they can ask Google to remove mentions of their name, and they can even legally change their name as a last resort.<p>But if eg. Facebook stored their face measurements and then automatically tagged them in a newly uploaded photo all that would be pointless.<p>So it makes sense to treat certain data as more sensitive.<p>At the same time, the GDPR doesn&#x27;t want to go overboard with regulation. Name and address are data that lots of businesses need to process -- eg. every online store needs to collect customer name and address and pass it on to payment providers, shipping companies, etc. It would be really inconvenient if you&#x27;d need explicit permission for each use (&quot;Do you consent that I can tell the post office where to deliver your package?&quot;).<p>Sure, someone may find a way to abuse a list of names and addresses, but it&#x27;s just not as sensitive as other data.<p>I think the GDPR actually strikes a great balance between protecting people&#x27;s privacy and not inconveniencing businesses. If you only collect and process data that&#x27;s absolutely necessary for providing your service, the GDPR won&#x27;t inconvenience you much.')
