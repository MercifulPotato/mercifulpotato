The design goal is to dissemphasize downvoted comments, but in practice it biases a reader toward downvote bandwagoning, anecdotally. (if comment scores were made public again I could quantitatively verify this, ahem)<p>IMO comment graying should only start after a comment hits -2, instead of graying after a single downvote.')
