The problems are in the frontend unfortunately. It seems to be a Javascript app, and that s just bad choice for a real-time video app. Split mode doesnt work, scrollback fails on long conversations, can&#x27;t control the placement of windows, designed for maximized windows, private mode disconnects randomly. And please do not ring all the devices in the house when there&#x27;s a call, let me select only the one i m using  its ridiculous, like a band playing the skype ringtone in the house.')
