I&#x27;d love to know some numbers actually, I know EU doesn&#x27;t have as many unicorns like Uber, Google, Amazon, etc. But that is a tiny amount of people who started those (and now employ a staggering number of people).<p>I think there are two reasons why that may be:\n- Generally larger regulatory barriers. GDPR is an obvious recent one, but also market complexity with EU countries regulations&#x2F;laws differing more than US states. I think (without knowing). That coupled with &quot;first to market&quot; advantage of US companies.\n- Money isn&#x27;t as big as a driver for Europeans. &quot;Rags to riches&quot; is a pretty American thing. &quot;Get educated and live well&quot; is closer to our lookout I think.')
