It feels like our CPUs and RAM have grown, but our ambition has atrophied.<p>What we need is a new synthesis.<p>A personal computing platform that picks up in 2020 from where the lisp machines left off in the 80&#x27;s. Something built from scratch to be interactive, dynamic, and hackable.<p>It will never actually happen, for &quot;worse is better&quot; reasons, of course. But it&#x27;s nice to dream about.<p>If anyone out there is working on something like this, even on a conceptual level, I would love to hear your thoughts :)')
