Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603235572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843113, text='&gt; The incentives in academia are complex and it affects how open some folks are or can afford to be with such knowledge.<p>&gt; Sometimes this leads to public feuds however, and some academic communities are small enough that if you make too many enemies your publications may be visited upon with disfavor when it comes time for peer review. It&#x27;s not worth getting into public tiffs unless there&#x27;s a principle at stake.<p>This is more the kind of thing I was using the word &quot;toxic&quot; to describe. Of course I know this is a widespread and deep-seeded problem and not one that could be fixed overnight, I was just commenting on it')
