Item(by='barry-cotter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604201833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947237, text='&gt; the argument is that they earn far less than equivalently trained professions which is objectively true no matter how you dice it<p>I am not aware of any other profession where the statistical impact of training is not reliably distinguishable from zero so this is a thin reed to hang any argument on. If we’re going to reward people for the length of time they’ve been in training without regard for the value of their skills or outside demand that seems unjust. If no one wants to pay someone to be a minister or theologian after doing a Master’s in it that’s fine. Equally if someone is dissatisfied with the salary they earn, whether as a teacher, librarian, lawyer or bin man they are free to find other work.')
