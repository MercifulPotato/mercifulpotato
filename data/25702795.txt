I will ask there the reason for the flag.<p>I understand the concept of the feature, and I understand that a flagged post would be hidden by default from listings.<p>But I don&#x27;t understand why, when showdead is false, the title is hidden by default when you are already on the page. Also vouch should probably be available there already.<p>Before I was surprise to not even have an option like that.')
