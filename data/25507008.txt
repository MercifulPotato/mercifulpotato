A decent person will feel at least a little bit like a creep searching for someones name on Google to dig up personal details about them, but when all that info just comes along with their email address, it just doesn&#x27;t sit right. My boss even felt compelled to tell me it happened, not because he saw anything bad, but because he felt like a creep just getting the info like that. Then I started thinking about all the Windows users in the business world that might get the same results under the same conditions, and I just don&#x27;t need everyone I interact with, across the country, knowing, for example, I&#x27;m an atheist before they send me a request to add a new question to a web form.')
