Item(by='cormacrelf', descendants=None, kids=[25636104, 25634853], score=None, time=1609776972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631222, text='This fell into a broader question of whether the Extradition Act 2003 has to be enforced notwithstanding the terms of the extradition treaty. The treaty refers to political offences; the Act does not. The answer to this question was yes, the Act is self-contained. Therefore the judge did not need to decide the  question of whether it was a political offence. So she did not discuss it or decide the question.<p>You are correct in a way -- judges do not decide issues that do not need to be decided, and things they do say about those issues are ignored, so yes, she omitted to discuss it.<p>But you couldn&#x27;t say she &quot;sided with US prosecutors&quot; on whether it was a political offence or not. If you put that language in the Extradition Act, then you would get a decision on it. It&#x27;s not so much &quot;chilling for investigative journalism&quot; as a deficiency in the Act itself not accounting for the particular US-UK treaty language or the US&#x27; categorisation under the Act that should reflect its recent anti-democratic bent.')
