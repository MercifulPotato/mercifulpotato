Other than that, as long as a state properly sends its designated number of electors to vote, how it chooses those electors is nobody&#x27;s business but the state&#x27;s alone. If the state is not able to decide, or sends the wrong number of electors, then it creates a problem for the Federal Government, so the Congress can pass a law to clarify what to do in such a case, and since this was the case in 1873, it passed the Electoral Count Act, which essentially sets a deadline for such troublesome states 6 days ahead of the 14th December date [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crsreports.congress.gov&#x2F;product&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;IF&#x2F;IF11641" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crsreports.congress.gov&#x2F;product&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;IF&#x2F;IF11641</a>')
