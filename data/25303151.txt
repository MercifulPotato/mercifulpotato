However, it is still trading a future vacation day away.<p>I don&#x27;t think there should be any verification for minor illnesses.  My company has an unlimited sick leave policy, and I&#x27;ve never needed to do more than send a quick &quot;I&#x27;m not feeling well, should be back tomorrow.&quot; email.  One of the other commenters mentioned Norway&#x27;s system of having a doctor&#x27;s note only after X sick days have been used, which seems reasonable.<p>Agreed that (x+y) PTO is individually preferable to (x vacation) + (y sick leave).  That said, as thaeli mentioned, usually it isn&#x27;t a summation.  In moving from a standard of (10 vacation) + (10 sick leave) to a merged pool, the result was a standard of (15 PTO) rather than 20.  That there isn&#x27;t an individual push for the separation is also why it needs to be a regulation, rather than something left to the free market, because there is definitely a public health argument on it.')
