This involves high volume, low latency data processing for some of the world’s largest organisations. Our mission is to keep the world’s most sensitive data private and secure - to do this we&#x27;re bringing on all stripes of engineer to help build out our platform to support our next stage of rocket-ship growth.<p>Principles we believe in:\n- Infrastructure as code (mostly Terraform)\n- Unit Testing &amp; Integration Testing (NUnit, PyTest, Mocha)\n- Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (using Concourse)\n- Designing security in (rather than testing for and adding it later)\n- Measuring everything (ELK &amp; Prometheus)\n- Reproducible builds and environments (if it’s in production, it’s in Docker)\n- Cloud Deployments (AWS gives us the flexibility we need to move fast)\n- Right tool for the right job (PostgreSQL, Spark&#x2F;Hadoop, Redis, Elastic Search)')
