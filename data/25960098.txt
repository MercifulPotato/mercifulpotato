Very valid points, I left out all the nuances to get some counterpoints and yours are very valid. I think the biggest issue, as in most federated&#x2F;decentralised scenarios, is the inevitable(?) backend&#x2F;server hosting providers that will crop up. In this case there would be very large incentives to try to provide &quot;easy solutions&quot; that hide the technicalities allowing for loopholes to aggregate and sell data. The individual datapoints might be encrypted but you might monitor what kind of data consumers are attached to the PDS and based on how much activity the consumers generate aggregate and sell data about eg. users with many&#x2F;active fitness related data consumers and target these users with ads about fitness equipment.<p>Disclaimer: I couldn&#x27;t really grasp how Personium works from the &quot;app screen demo&quot; but it didn&#x27;t stop me from commenting...')
