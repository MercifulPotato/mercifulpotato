The mistake most PhDs make when going into the tech industry, especially when coming from non-traditional academia-to-industry fields (say, biology, genetics), is trying to shove down the throat of hiring managers or recruiters their specific papers or research, when they have zero relevance for the industry job they are applying to.<p>So, where is the competitive advantage? It is in the PhD itself (first), the methods that have been used and the skills acquired (second), maybe the volume of publications and the number of citations (third). Talking about research and papers is like trying to convince a potential partner that you are interesting and charming and lovable, when you are extremely good looking. Use what you have, not some idea on what other people should appreciate in you.')
