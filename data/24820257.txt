Though those are mostly the ones that try to obfuscate and hinder access to data.<p>I can already use up one hand counting the webistes that just deleted all user contributed content or disappeared for other reasons where if I didn&#x27;t do this, the content would be lost completely to me. Or services (like online banking) that just offer 2-3 year history, and you need to pay to access older data.<p>Just allow users to write their own clients.')
