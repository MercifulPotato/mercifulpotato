While US companies have a huge presence on the Internet there&#x27;s plenty of huge non-English language sites that have next to no presence in the US but are extremely popular in their linguaspheres.<p>The norms you&#x27;re seemingly complaining about are pretty common in Western-style liberal democracies. It&#x27;s not like US companies are exporting many norms that aren&#x27;t common to most first world countries. Cryptocurrencies abound so I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;re complaining about filters.<p>As for nudity norms...when the fuck has the Internet <i>not</i> been rife with nudity. If you can&#x27;t find nudity on the Internet I&#x27;m wondering if your WiFi is working correctly.<p>Really it seems you&#x27;re trying to project onto the US&#x2F;US companies the sort of filtering and censorship Russia and China (to name two countries) engage in with gusto. They have &quot;enclaves&quot; because they actively block foreign sites and services from their citizens.<p>The Trump administration&#x27;s efforts against TikTok and WeChat face legal challenges <i>in the US</i> and have a good chance of being struck down as unconstitutional. Despite fantasies by the current administration to the contrary the US is not an authoritarian dictatorship. They can&#x27;t just unilaterally block a foreign website without some due process.')
