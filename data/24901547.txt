Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=[24905800], score=None, time=1603747134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24895272, text='&gt;It&#x27;s mostly covered in the wiki under each of their paragraphs though.<p>You&#x27;re hoping that people won&#x27;t bother to read said Wiki, or get confused by the legalese.<p>Papadopoulos: Indicted for making a false statement to FBI.<p>Manafort and Gates: Indicted for not registering as foreign agents of Ukraine (which, you might have noticed, is sort of an enemy of Russia right now)<p>Flynn: Indicted for making a false statement to FBI. (Forced by lack of legal fees into pleading guilty, which later caused problems when the government tried to drop charges.)<p>Pinedo (Who? Exactly): Indicted for identity fraud.<p>van der Zwaan: Indicted for making false statements (and not an American, anyway).<p>Cohen: Indicted for making false statements.<p>Stone: Indicted for making false statements and witness tampering.<p>Then we have people like Carter Page, whose name was raked over the coals for years because a FBI lawyer intentionally altered evidence (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;fbi-ig-report-russia-investigation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;fbi-ig-report...</a>) showing that far from being a Russian asset, Page had for years briefed the CIA every time he met with suspicious Russians. (Got to love how the <i>Times</i> describes said altering evidence as a &quot;serious error&quot;.) You want an actual Russiagate-related indictment and guilty plea? Kevin Clinesmith, said FBI lawyer, is your man.')
