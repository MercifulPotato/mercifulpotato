MIT&#x27;s married student housing isn&#x27;t large and is off to one side.  There is no faculty housing beyond the president (all of whom have had no kids or adult kids).  Stanford&#x27;s married student housing (and the faculty neighborhood) is a larger percentage and includes playgrounds, rec facilities and even two elementary schools.  Still, it&#x27;s less family friendly than Palo Alto or Menlo Park.')
