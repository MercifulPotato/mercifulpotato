There&#x27;s a whole class of laws around protecting children (two quick examples here in the US: age of consent; being tried as a minor vs tried as an adult) because the reality is that, in general, children are easier than adults to exploit. I mean, I convinced my nephew over the holiday that eating all his broccoli was like doing extra credit for Santa Claus, so it would cancel out the naughty action of eating one of the cookies he put out for Santa.<p>Saying that an adult agreeing to an unread ToS is unenforceable because we don&#x27;t hold children accountable for signed contracts is plain nonsense.')
