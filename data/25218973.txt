His agenda (which I agree with, fwiw!) is to influence US government policy. He is trying to do this by encouraging the belief that American innovation has high returns on investment right now, as the &quot;great stagation&quot; may be coming to an end.<p>Because it&#x27;s political rhetoric rather than scentific argument, some fudging of the facts is to be expected. The only people likely to be offended at having credit for the innovations stolen are outside the US, and they are not the audience.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really detract from the force of the argument, since anything that can be said about American innovation could reasonably be said about European innovation, and &quot;America&quot; could be taken as short-hand for &quot;developed nations at the technological frontier&quot;.')
