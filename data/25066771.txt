A couple of critiques though:<p>1. Objectives. The article might be correct if your objective is marriage. If your objective is to schedule as much low-effort sex as possible, or even just juggling multiple long-term relationships, especially if you operate over a wide geographic area......expanding your search online is invaluable. Treat paid sites as just another tool in your harem management toolbox.<p>2. Stale profiles. This is why I really liked the $COUNTRYNAME_Cupid websites. They take more effort to put a profile together, AND they have a &quot;last logged in&quot; feature, so when you do a profile search &quot;No smokers, no kids, etc...&quot; you don&#x27;t have to worry about messaging people who haven&#x27;t touched the site in 9 months, and it&#x27;s easy to ignore blank profiles. Also, typically women with free accounts will &quot;poke&quot; you or view your profile, and that webpage listing those women is where you start your screening.')
