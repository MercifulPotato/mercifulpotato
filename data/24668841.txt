Had most of the mild sympthoms, but was completely unique for me was the first day when I stopeed feeling hunger.<p>No feeling of hunger at all, but smell and taste are allright (never failed). I actually have hunger, I can feel hear the noise in my stomach after some hour of having eating very little.<p>But still, I still don&#x27;t feel any hunger whatsoever, this was going on for the last 10 days.<p>At some point this morning I put a lot of salt to the food, see if somehow I&#x27;m just remembering the taste, but even if I don&#x27;t look what I&#x27;m eating, some portions had salty taste.<p>I&#x27;m mostly recovered now, and bit weak (tried to do a little run in the garden, and I couldn&#x27;t run more than a few meters without getting a cough and feeling without air), even given that I didn&#x27;t had much of trouble with breathing during the maybe 4 days with 2 hours per day of low fever.<p>But still, the lack of hunger is the weirdest thing I ever experienced.')
