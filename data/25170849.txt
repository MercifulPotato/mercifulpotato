The real losers if we cancel student loan debt is probably decamillionaires+ due to taxes.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not in favor of immediate student loan cancellation. I think we need a sustainable solution to prevent a rebuild-up of student loans first, and I think we also need to aim to implement the same solutions for those in trade school for the same reason the author mentions. If we&#x27;re in favor of public funding for secondary schools, why not post-secondary where folks actually tend to learn to critically think and learn their skills for the job market?')
