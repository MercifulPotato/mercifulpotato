My point isn’t that Slovenian, German et al are special in having many dialects. Slovenian has way many for such a small language, but all languages have them.<p>What’s interesting about English is the relative lack of dialects outside the UK. It’s already a very standardized lingua franca because of how it spread.<p>And what’s left is solvable with the BBC&#x2F;Hollywood English. Similar to how germany has hoch deutsch – an invented standard dialect everyone learns in school.<p>You can have a standard form of English taught in schools without demanding say-to-day stabdardization in common use. And we kinda already do. Just unofficially.')
