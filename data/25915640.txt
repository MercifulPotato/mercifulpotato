Quoting can be painful.  And it has a number of annoying limitations.  In retrospect, I think it was a bad choice, and I wouldn&#x27;t choose to use it again.  Trying to understand what&#x27;s going on with multiple levels of nested macro expansions is painful, particularly when you can&#x27;t directly introspect all the intermediate expansions.<p>When it comes to M4 usage within Autoconf, I&#x27;d happily see it dropped entirely in favour of shell functions.  It&#x27;s a historical implementation detail which should have been removed over a decade ago.')
