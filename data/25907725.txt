It can predict future states, it does things like attention, it can classify states that are abnormal and direct attention to it, it can make analogies between different objects and use those to decide what is normal and what isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a lot more than just object recognition - it can also generate object classes on-the-fly and use them in the future.<p>We are very, very far from that. And having such a developed visual processing system is a prerequisite for feeding an executive processing system that can do counterfactual reasoning.')
