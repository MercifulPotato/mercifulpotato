I get that it&#x27;s considered distasteful, but it&#x27;s the reality of the world we live in - much of one&#x27;s success comes down to dumb luck.<p>That said... I feel the same way as you do.  For some reason I have always wanted more than I seem able to achieve.  I strive, and I strive, but because of this or that short coming, or chance, I don&#x27;t seem to reach the &quot;brass ring&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m trying these days to just find peace and happiness with my life.  I haven&#x27;t jumped off the treadmill entirely, I&#x27;ve just turned down the speed.  If I start a company and make millions some day, great.  If I don&#x27;t... if I end up a career man my whole life, but live comfortably with my wife... well, that&#x27;s great too.  I&#x27;m going to let go of the rudder a little bit and let the boat sail itself for a while.')
