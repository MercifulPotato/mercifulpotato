The Navy and other US military organizations cannot produce what&#x27;s described in the patents alone and need outside companies, like Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Those companies themselves often need imported parts from other countries. IP law (and patents) help define the legal boundaries of each involved party&#x27;s responsibilities and capacity. Although companies based in like China or Russia may be protected in their respective countries for potential espionage, they may still face legal repercussions in the countries they do business in.<p>With that said, I believe most US military patents are kept confidential, so your final question is still pertinent: &quot;Why reveal any details about the work being done?&quot;')
