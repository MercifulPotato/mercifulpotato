Which means, while they can drop in value, they will not do so because somebody decided to turn the printer on and print a few trillion BTC. BTC is capped at 21 million coins. And some of it gets lost every day, so its cap is actually shrinking.<p>(not all cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design, in case I wasn&#x27;t clear)')
