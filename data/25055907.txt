We badly need alternatives to the hegemony of stagnant one-size-fits-all public schools and bloated 4 year colleges. I’m also concerned about these institutions may negatively impact our society, as they are rapidly turning into ideological monocultures (colleges) or vehicles for indoctrination (K-12). And for all the increased spending, we are seeing no tangible improvement in quality of core education. A lot of the ideas in this article are interesting and may solve some of these problems - let’s hope we (parents and students and employers) are ready to accept bold experimentation and not put up barriers (like with teachers unions resisting charter schools).')
