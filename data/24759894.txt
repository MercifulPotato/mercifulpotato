So I agree with you, we all have different needs and thresholds. Pre-covid I&#x27;d found a nice balance going in just once or twice a week when it made sense to do so. I do need some socialization, but I won&#x27;t seek it out usually, so work is a great way to remember that I do need people in small doses and force myself to get those small doses.')
