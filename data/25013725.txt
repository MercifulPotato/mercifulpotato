Item(by='achow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604735694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013597, text='True.<p>Was in Google for a brief while; the pull of free and great food wore off very quickly when I had a realization that I actually should be eating 30-40% of what I consume any given day. And to rustle up something for that 15-20% is no big deal (rest 15-20% one can easily figure out from healthy&#x2F;ok restaurants without it making any noticeable dent in your pocket or health).')
