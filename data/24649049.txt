I wrote quite a bit of C++ from 2011 to 2014, while I was ramping up at programming. C++11 wasn&#x27;t really a thing back then in my experience. The new features are really nice, but the syntax truly feels alien to me.<p>I am now looking forward to learning Rust, which seems more cohesive in general, and less of a bag of weirdly shaped features. Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll probably keep on using C++ as &quot;C with classes&quot; when I have to. And I feel like codebases have to pick a subset of C++ they are comfortable with to be approachable to outsiders.')
