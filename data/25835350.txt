Some people (myself included) are pointing out that while this event was violent and violence is never acceptable, that it alone wasn&#x27;t a serious threat to our democracy, it wasn&#x27;t a real insurrection, etc. The violence needs to be prosecuted, but no one needs to hang for treason.<p>To your point though, this forum does occasionally flirt with violence. Over the summer, some were waxing poetic about how &quot;riots are the language of the oppressed&quot; and arguing that burning someone&#x27;s business to the ground isn&#x27;t violence but rather &quot;just property damage&quot;. Some were arguing that antifa and other violent groups were &quot;freedom fighters&quot; and so on. So yes, it does get pretty toxic here, but this thread isn&#x27;t it.')
