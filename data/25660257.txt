Writing low level algorithms is a waste of time, not a skill.  That said, I think it&#x27;s ok to expect people to be aware of them.<p>Could you describe the algorithm for it, though?  What about traversing a tree?  Would you be able to talk it through and then be able to implement it?  What about proactively verifying that your algorithm was correct for standard and edge cases? Can you evaluate your solution for time &amp; space complexity?<p>If the answer to these is yes, that&#x27;s sufficient to pass the coding interview.  This is also where I think think more experienced candidates really shine.  Aside from handcrafting algos that are best left to libraries, the others are things that senior folks who have been there and done that just do intuitively.<p>Interviewers definitely want code that works, but being able to do the other things is equally important.  The review process itself also doesn&#x27;t allow one bad interviewer to sink the candidate.')
