The tweet would probably lower your social score, which in turn is in violation of the Apple EULA (&quot;Our exclusive products may only be used by persons with high social score&quot;), stopping the car and blaring the alarm &quot;Please disembark.&quot;.<p>And since you&#x27;re in the middle of the highway in rain, you don&#x27;t get out. &quot;Your license to use this car has been terminated. You are now trespassing. The authorities have been alerted.&quot;. And then the police show up and shoot you because their data mining software says it&#x27;s mostly black people that have such low social score, so the iGlasses the cops have say you are black.')
