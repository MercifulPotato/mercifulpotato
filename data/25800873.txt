The singer repeatedly asks the Lord, &quot;How long can this go on?&quot; and complains that when the weekend arrives, he&#x27;s too exhausted to have any fun. In the instrumental section, as in the song&#x27;s fade, he says: &quot;Lord, I&#x27;m so tired &#x2F; How long can this go on?&quot; </i>')
