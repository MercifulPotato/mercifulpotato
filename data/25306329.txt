Or do they also incorporate the bias of the author?<p>Sure, you could argue that news are facts, and that they should be free from copyright. But that would only work if your news is just bullet points of the factual stuff. But if any element of bias is present, it become a distinct property of the author, hence it should be copyrightable.<p>Of course, with today&#x27;s tech, it&#x27;s easier to remove the bias element from the factual data.')
