If you get a wrong result one day, it&#x27;ll probably be corrected in the next day or two with more tests.<p>Huh?<p>Continuing to accumulate bad data just leads to a higher accumulation of error.<p>If you have a high percentage of false results and you continue to test over and over the data are still not reliable. How would you know which the correct results are?<p>Say you test 14 days in a row, over those 14 days you&#x27;ve experienced no symptoms, yet 6 tests showed positive and 8 showed negative.<p>Do you have any better idea after those 14 days of testing as to whether you&#x27;ve got covid or not?')
