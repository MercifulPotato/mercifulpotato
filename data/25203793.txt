The roads aren&#x27;t physically blocked, ambulances and such have to be able to get everywhere. Moving day is a pretty rare event for any individual, so you just have to accept that you&#x27;ll be a bit inconvenienced that day. If you don&#x27;t own a car yourself you rent a moving van for the day. Street parking downtown is expensive, but it&#x27;s just for that day. But since it&#x27;s expensive there&#x27;s hopefully less competition for the spaces. Then you have to navigate the streets to your new place with your car. It might be slow and you may have to take some detours because some streets are only for pedestrians, bikes and public transportation. But it&#x27;s just for that day, the other days <i>you</i> are the pedestrian&#x2F;biker&#x2F;bus rider that can get around without worrying about cars on that street.')
