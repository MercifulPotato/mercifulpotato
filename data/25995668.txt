This isn&#x27;t the case.  There was a game I wanted to play, it doesn&#x27;t run on Linux, I bought it 50% off on Stadia and I&#x27;m a happy user.  I&#x27;m not going all in on Stadia of course; I realize that there&#x27;s a good chance Stadia will disappear eventually.  For the convenience and quality I&#x27;m getting now I don&#x27;t mind buying this game on Steam again later if it happens that Stadia is gone and I want to play it again.  For the right use case I recommend Stadia.')
