They really thought they were zeroing in on a lasting, almost ideal style, but it turned out to be a style that was quickly made obsolete by changing languages, programming concepts, processes, and architectures.  Also, in software, you&#x27;re designing for the machine and for other programmers, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to discover how well a software design performs for machines and colleagues than it is to discover how an architectural design performs for a family, a company, or a society.  I do appreciate the intent, but it&#x27;s hard to see why someone would still be sticking with the design patterns concept twenty years later.')
