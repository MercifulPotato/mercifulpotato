They want to pressure you on the spot to make a decision or choice you otherwise would rather think about. They want to use well planned out strategies and game you with social or culture pressures to manipulate you into doing something you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t.<p>I limit synchronous communication to those I either have to or those I enjoy to be around and aren&#x27;t there to try and exploit me for some reason. If you&#x27;re new, you get some leeway but quickly progress one direction or the other as I decide which list you get chucked into.')
