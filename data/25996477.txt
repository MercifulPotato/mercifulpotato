(None of my current personal experimental use cases call for repeaters.)<p>What I do recall is it can &quot;repeat&quot; encrypted &quot;channels&quot; by just replaying the encrypted packets without having any keys to read them (I think there&#x27;s some very minor metadata in the unencrypted part of the packets, perhaps just a hop count?)<p>Also note that &quot;channels&quot; in Meshtastic are not frequencies like in typical UHF terminology - but pre shared encryption keys. I _vaguely_ recall maybe they get used to seed freq hopping algorithms (but I might be misremembering that).<p>I think the big difference between &quot;repeater nodes&quot; and regular nodes is that the repeater settings shut down the GPS because its unnecessary power draw (on the assumption you know where you installed a repeater node), and participate in the mesh in a &quot;hidden&quot; way, so they don&#x27;t show up as members you could communicate with.')
