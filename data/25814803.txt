You can take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myaccount.google.com&#x2F;data-and-personalization" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;myaccount.google.com&#x2F;data-and-personalization</a><p>The &quot;Ad personalization&quot; bit is probably what the parent comment is referring to. But it sounds like you&#x27;re interested in the &quot;Web &amp; App Activity&quot; bit, which will turn off the non-ads usage of your data. To a certain extent at least, since there are some grey areas.<p>For example, I&#x27;m on the team that sends Google Shopping emails. If you click a button to track the price of a specific TV, we&#x27;ll still send you an email if that price drops even if you&#x27;ve opted out of &quot;Web &amp; App Activity&quot;. But if you&#x27;ve just been browsing shopping pages for TVs, we won&#x27;t send you a general email about TV deals if you&#x27;ve opted out. Both of those cases are in some literal sense &quot;web activity&quot; but it&#x27;s still pretty clear what the user expects.<p>But you might imagine- if you&#x27;re tracking the price of a specific TV and opted-out of Web &amp; App Activity, should we send you an email if a near-identical TV drops in price? We probably wouldn&#x27;t, and we don&#x27;t have anything like this today, but it&#x27;s not quite as clear. And Google has so many features across different teams, I can imagine there&#x27;s probably at least one where some privacy reviewer made a different call than what you would have made.')
