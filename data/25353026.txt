Item(by='dhodell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607470106, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352560, text='Without intending to either minimize or represent OP&#x27;s opinion, my thought is the cases people get frustrated about are really unfortunate. In these cases, community opinions have been solicited -- sometimes committees are even formed -- and folks put in significant effort.<p>The oft-cited case with Go (and I&#x27;m paraphrasing heavily, so this account is likely unfair to everyone involved) was when Peter Bourgon formed a committee to design a Go packaging system, there were a bunch of meetings held that included core team members, and Russ apparently surprisingly came out with the Go modules proposal. The core team decided to adopt Russ&#x27; work. The team&#x27;s perspective is it solved their problems simply and cleanly, and it came with an implementation. The community perspective was that the core team was now a sort of cabal.<p>I think the issue here isn&#x27;t that the community&#x27;s project was rejected, it&#x27;s that there is a perception that folks were let to waste their time. It seems that sometimes people want this idealized model where an open project has a community that is on equal footing with the project owners, but I rarely see this to be the case in practice. Ultimately some individual or group holds a &quot;voting share&quot; that outweighs the community.<p>We have a documented process for system changes in Fuchsia that we have already been following internally. I&#x27;ve seen various proposals rejected; I&#x27;ve had proposals of my own rejected. It&#x27;s always disappointing to have work rejected, because no matter what, it takes effort to come up, submit, and socialize work proposals. It&#x27;s easy to feel slighted, especially when you&#x27;re contributing for free while the folks making the decisions... well, it&#x27;s their job.<p>I think I can say that it is nobody&#x27;s goal on Fuchsia to waste folks&#x27; time. But I think it would be naive to think this kind situation couldn&#x27;t or won&#x27;t occur in the future. I just hope our transparency about our process and our availability to communicate with the community through lists will help mitigate negative feelings when a proposal representing a non-trivial effort is rejected.')
