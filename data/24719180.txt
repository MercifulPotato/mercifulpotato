Thought it would be the future of automation. Perhaps people actually use it, I just haven&#x27;t seen it implemented anywhere.</i><p>I had a similar thought. Obviously Java &quot;the language&quot; is, indeed, widely used and did become &quot;the future&quot;... but certain parts of the broader Java vision didn&#x27;t quite pan out: the &quot;mobile code&quot; and &quot;agents&quot; stuff in particular. &quot;Java in the browser&quot; <i>was</i> big for a time, but ultimately faded. Which I actually find quite disappointing on many levels.<p>All of that said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s out of the realm of possibility that some of the &quot;agent framework&quot; stuff comes back into vogue at some point - at least in specific niche domains - although it may or may not involve Java.')
