So that you could say &quot;Hey Steve!&quot; to your kid&#x27;s classmate&#x27;s dad that you&#x27;d met 3 times before and still couldn&#x27;t remember his name.<p>Way better than today&#x27;s tech of saying &quot;Hey!...&quot; then introducing him to your friend Bill and hoping Bill asks his name or he volunteers it.  Then hoping you&#x27;re remember to memorize it this time.<p>Glass woulda fixed that.  But it would have made everything else worse.')
