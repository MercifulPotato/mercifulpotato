Would your statement hold true?<p>Or, a child comment makes a remark about house-cats killing more birds than wind turbines. What if the number of wind turbines was equivalent to the number of house-cats?<p>You&#x27;re not comparing like-to-like. If you&#x27;re recommending scaling the number of wind turbines greatly (to combat climate change), you should instead consider a metric like &#x27; number of birds killed per turbine per year&#x27; like &#x27;number of birds killed per glass building per year&#x27; to at least get to the data.')
