And that’s why the Hollywood Production Codes were a kind of censorship:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code</a><p>And the idea that criticizing censorship when private organizations do it is “whining” is quite odd. Not everything bad is illegal. Lots of people criticized the Hollywood Production Codes as bad censorship, even though it was voluntary. Except back then it was liberals complaining that the Hollywood companies that controlled distribution were using their power to entrench conservative ideas and suppress liberal ones: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;17&#x2F;cens-m17.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsws.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2018&#x2F;05&#x2F;17&#x2F;cens-m17.html</a>')
