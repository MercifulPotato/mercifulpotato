That somebody is not me.<p>&gt; If Parler built their product without considering vendor dependencies that is on them.<p>&quot;You fucked up. You trusted us&quot;. (C)<p>Parler was operating under naive assumptions that Amazon does not ban services for partisan political reasons. It was reasonable assumption in America pre-2021, but now it&#x27;s clearly a different America. Where to participate in the internet, you have to pass ideological purity test. I can predict what happens next: Parler would be blocked by the majority of CDNs, payment processors and hosting&#x2F;DNS providers. And you&#x27;ll be saying &quot;well, they are idiots for relying on the existing internet without considering the dependencies. They should have just built their own internet, their own banking system and their own payment system.&quot;<p>&gt; While unrelated to this issue, Parler&#x27;s ux and service as a whole was awful.<p>If it&#x27;s unrelated, why mention it? To create an impression services with bad UX (which is not true btw, especially compared to Facebook whose UX is atrocious) deserve to be silenced?<p>&gt; Apple, Google, and Amazon are doing Parler users a favor.<p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#x27;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.')
