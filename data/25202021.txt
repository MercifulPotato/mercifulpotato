DC is a slightly unfair comparison, as you&#x27;re comparing a city to a state.  CA is not significantly higher than TX.<p>Your general point- which really seemed to be &quot;knowing that everyone is armed in TX results in less gun violence&quot;, is easily disproven by other states with totally different laws having similar or lower gun violence rates.<p>To your last line- I agree with you, I don&#x27;t believe crime rate should have any effect on our right to keep and bear arms.  I want a complete repeal of the Second Amendment, though.')
