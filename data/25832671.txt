The internet - we want to have many independent websites, but they all need to use a common protocol in order to have wide reach. In politics we want multiple independent parties, but they should play fair with constitution and elections.<p>We need both the ability to centralize some aspects and diversify other aspects. For Google, FB and Twitter I&#x27;d like more diversity on the front end part - UI, personalisation of filtering and ranking, and on the user data storage part - portable user pods.')
