Item(by='unemphysbro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602115171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712561, text='| I feel completely demotivated that most companies (and all big companies) weren&#x27;t considering me when I applied to them (and probably still aren&#x27;t). It crushed my motivation<p>I understand that feeling. I lived a very structured life, gym in morning, breakfast in the office right after, clean diet eg. the lockdown + moving back in parents, removed those structures. When I first started looking I got my DS&#x2F;A in tip-top shape, and consistently applying but after grinding for months with no interviews and ghosting recruiters I&#x27;ve hit a point where I&#x27;m tired. I think I&#x27;ve accepted that I&#x27;ll need a new career and it&#x27;s been an ego blow but it&#x27;s freeing. I feel like I&#x27;m 17 again with no idea what the hell I&#x27;m going to do, thankfully, I&#x27;ve got my health and no dependents.<p>I too did just learn about hooks for a little side project. React is interesting, I&#x27;ve never done any frontend so it&#x27;s different. I&#x27;ve also been playing around with rust as a backend too, that&#x27;s such a cool language.')
