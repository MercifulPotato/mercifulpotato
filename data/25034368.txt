It&#x27;s full of issues and details.<p>But it&#x27;s something that poor countries manage to do successfully with a reasonable reliability even on rural areas.<p>I am sure there will be plenty of new problems for that lower temperature. And a number of smart people will have to work really hard to solve them, a large amount of money will change hands and all that.<p>But I think the GP&#x27;s point is that it&#x27;s doable. It doesn&#x27;t need any sci-fi tech or any large restructuring of humanity (and we already did some of the later for this virus).')
