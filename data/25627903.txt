Thanks for sharing your experience.<p>The obvious feedback is to let go of perfectionism and ship a real mvp. If you&#x27;re spending 2 years on it, it&#x27;s not a mvp.<p>Before jumping on a new idea, I&#x27;d suggest to think how you&#x27;re going to sell it and test the market by talking to people in it.<p>Getting better at finding cofounders (as in, cofounders who would think about these problems while you build the product) would be good as well.\nPersonally, I gave up on that last one and I&#x27;ll just fly solo and smaller, but you may be more optimistic.<p>Also I&#x27;d recommend you to pick something smaller and easier to sell. \nA generic B2B SaaS API to solve a small problem can help you build a passive revenue stream and free you from worrying about money and plan bigger, better, more interesting projects.<p>Funnily enough, during uni I made an app which was making a decent amount of money in advertising (netting everyday a daily rate of a mid developer contractor rate in London) but didn&#x27;t have a future.<p>I decided to start a company doing something bigger and better and failed miserably.<p>Some contracting, some more working and a few kids later, I&#x27;m back at square one building more small passive revenue streams.<p>Look up Pieter Levels&#x27;s presentation Bootstrapping Side Projects into Profitable Startups.')
