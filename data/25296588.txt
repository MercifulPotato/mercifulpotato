One party claims they had been going through review for 2 months and one said the review was submitted with only  1 day ...<p>It seems likely that both sides are mis-characterizing events in pursuit of their own goals -- which to me suggests a general environment where parties are tending not to communicate with the goal of arriving at agreement -- but rather as adversaries.<p>Hackernews will of course assume that the only reason for an adversarial relationship in this scenario is &quot;cancel culture SJW memes&quot; and other &quot;deemed toxic&quot; trends for which the minority voice is almost always the only guilty party.<p>I think that level of dismissal is unwarranted as it seems pretty likely to me that there is a definite gotcha-oriented communication style coming from the google leadership here -- which very well might reflect an intentionally or unconsciously adopted strategy to create obstacles for voices of disagreement like this.')
