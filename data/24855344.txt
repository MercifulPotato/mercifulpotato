Its always going to be there but reducing this should be a goal.<p>2) Focusing on small business vs large corporate. Literally making policy that favours smaller companies be it lower regulation, taxes etc. But you have to actively help the up and comers to disrupt the market vs protect large interests.<p>3) Break monopolistic behaviour. We really need to reduce the acquisition takeover culture. And not just mega corp but so often to see things like all the Dentists in a small city are owned by one family type thing. Im not sure the way to deal with this but possibly proportional asset taxes?<p>Generally I think governments role is to run the nation for the benefit of the people and economic efficiency is the the be all and end all of achieving this.')
