The CEO and other bosses are very intransparent. There are hardly any meetings or any other communication, and that&#x27;s the way it always has been - although because of work-from-home due to the pandemic, it has become even worse.\nIt&#x27;s probably not malicious, I guess, but they are very young, inexperienced, and just not good at communication overall.<p>I&#x27;m aware that the company only has funding for some more weeks. Now I&#x27;d really like to know if there are any remaining options for them to get funding or other money.<p>Which questions should I ask in an upcoming meeting (about totally other topics), to get them talking about strategy and options?')
