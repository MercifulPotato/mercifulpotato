Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602114837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713920, text='&gt; Immersion gives a very weak version of this<p>Agreed. Many adults <i>attempt</i> immersion by e.g. moving to a place where the language is spoken but then set themselves up in an expat bubble, which is roughly equivalent to wrapping a sponge in plastic and then immersing it in water.<p>In order to truly immerse yourself you need to actually need to have a life, friends, coworkers in that language, and the things that occupy your mental energy for 80% of the day (probably work, but in the case of children, schoolwork and homework) need to also be in that language.<p>Adults also often get &quot;homesick&quot; and create those expat bubbles for themselves to have a piece of home. Understandable, but children don&#x27;t get homesick in the same way -- they didn&#x27;t have any prior culture to think back to, and they don&#x27;t have a concrete sense of self-identity until later in their childhood.<p>In many cases one may find that the locals actually are a force against immersion if their English is better than your knowledge of their language. It&#x27;s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem but I do feel the right time for <i>adult</i> immersion should probably be after you&#x27;ve surpassed the local average English level, which then turns the local language into the preferred working language. If you haven&#x27;t gotten there yet, you may find that you move, and then everyone wants to use English with you because time is money (and in some cases they want to practice their English, but less so in the workplace). And then -- you don&#x27;t learn.<p>Children are at a huge advantage here, because schools mandate a certain language be used regardless of who knows what other languages to what level.')
