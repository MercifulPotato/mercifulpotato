Either someone records a classified fact&#x2F;detail on an unclassified system through carelessness or lack of caution, or compiles a set of facts that are (in aggregate) classified but individually unclassified.<p>The latter can be particularly pernicious as it&#x27;s hard to know the aggregate classification. I may be able to say in separate contexts &quot;The XF-42 is capable of exceeding 1200 nautical miles per hour&quot; and &quot;The XF-42 is capable of flying in excess of 60k feet&quot; but placing the two facts together can actually be classified (in practice, usually more than two details).')
