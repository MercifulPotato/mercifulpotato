There&#x27;s already product market fit and the company grew to 6-figure ARR since May 2020. Cash-flow positive &amp; profitable since day 1. Slated to double again in Q1 2021. Goal is to reach $1mil ARR with or without investment. There&#x27;s decent amount of investor interest and growth has only been organic word of mouth so far.<p>The primary needs are someone who can head up R&amp;D (BigQuery, DBT, Elixir, Node) and Sales. For the sales side, we need someone with extensive inside&#x2F;outbound sales experience at fast-growing SaaS before (+1 if in ecomm space).<p>Interested? Send me a note at fei@sourcemedium.com')
