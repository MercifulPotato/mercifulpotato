I&#x27;ve inherited a few sites with custom themes and it&#x27;s the changes in plugins that I&#x27;m most interested in so I can track issues. Almost anything else that comes from latest.zip I am not concerned with.<p>I just haven&#x27;t found a good workflow I guess. I&#x27;m gradually trying to strip all the plugins which are not required (there are so many) so I can just focus on the core ones that are hard requirements but even one or two decent -sized plugins is a huge responsibility to manage if you&#x27;re trying to pretend you&#x27;re tracking all the changes to any level of detail.')
