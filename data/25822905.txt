It’s very true. Almost no one lives in the city proper anymore; everyone commutes from outside.<p>On a related note if you decide to go: the city proper is very much a tourist trap. The food is not good and everything is overpriced. If you decide to go I wouldn’t spend more than a day inside the city itself. I had a much better experience taking the water taxi to the surrounding islands. The food is better, people are nicer, it’s way less crowded and the sights are just as good.')
