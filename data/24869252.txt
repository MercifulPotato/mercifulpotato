Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[24869332, 24869771], score=None, time=1603459829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869115, text='&gt;Here is why the statement feels dangerous, it doesn&#x27;t make arguments directly related to the group and can easily be expanded to: &quot;But there&#x27;s some very, very, very wrong stuff that happens when [people of color, poor people, lacking education, etc] move in. It shouldn&#x27;t be that way.&quot;<p>When poor people move in they don&#x27;t have the resources to tell everyone else what to do and they don&#x27;t tend to pick fights with whoever is there first.  When rich people move in they get the government to cater to them and local laws change, often to the point where what was previously normal behavior (burning brush, discharging guns within city limits) is no longer even legal.  They often pick fights with the local businesses (&quot;I don&#x27;t like how that second generation pig farm I knowingly bought property adjacent to smells&quot; or  they complain about the environmental impact of some third generation junkyard not because it&#x27;s not folowing the law but because they find it unsighl).  Furthermore they co-opt locals with their money.  People who genuinely hate all the other changes they bring bury their heads in the sand because the newcomers are spending more money at their business (or whatever) until it finally negatively affects them personally.<p>I would much, much, much rather have poor people move in than the white collar crowd because the former has bigger problems than me and the people around me Doing It Wrong(TM).')
