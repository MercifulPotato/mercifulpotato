Item(by='bipson', descendants=None, kids=[24807103], score=None, time=1602876341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800667, text='Are you talking about Tesla AutoPilot?<p>This system is meant for cars without level 2 driver assist, so not for Teslas.<p>Further, the system has no control over what &quot;disengages&quot; in the car itself - it is sending bogus sensor inputs to elicit a reaction according to level 2 driver assistance. Thus, if it sends such bogus inputs and fails at doing this &quot;reliably&quot;, it will result in misbehaving steering, breaking, etc. which it does not control itself.<p>Further, if it was in control, my argument would stay: If your controlling device has left the building (crashed), it can also not disengage anything any more reliably.')
