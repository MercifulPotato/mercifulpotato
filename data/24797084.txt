The computer failure methods are new to us, but we&#x27;re all too familiar with human failings. Humans have much slower reaction times. Humans get sleepy, drunk, or distracted. Humans sometimes get angry or impatient and do dangerous things with their vehicles.<p>The important metric is accidents per mile driven. Right now, Teslas on autopilot seem to be significantly safer than human drivers. From Tesla&#x27;s vehicle safety report[1]:<p>&gt; ...we registered one accident for every 4.53 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with our active safety features, we registered one accident for every 2.27 million miles driven. For those driving without Autopilot and without our active safety features, we registered one accident for every 1.56 million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSAâ€™s most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 479,000 miles.<p>Yes autopilot has issues and limitations, but it&#x27;s already 3x safer than unaided drivers. Also, it seems to be improving in safety. Two years ago, autopilot&#x27;s crash rate was only 1.5x lower than unaided Tesla drivers.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;VehicleSafetyReport" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;VehicleSafetyReport</a>')
