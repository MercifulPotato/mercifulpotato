However, we have pretty accurate information about airliner fuel consumption, and one transatlantic flight is just not the same as a single Falcon flight. That&#x27;s a fact.<p>&gt; And then when it comes to Musk, it just seems weird to say he isn&#x27;t doing enough to combat CO2 on a post about him donating $100M to help improve CO2 removal and also ignore what electrification of cars can and already has done for CO2 emission reduction.<p>Forget Mr. Musk for a second. If Philip Morris reports 7.5B of revenue alongside a widely publicized anti-smoking campaign, are you going to give them a pat on the back or are you going to say that good PR can be an intentional distraction from the tangible externalities of profit-seeking activity?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;tobacco-giant-philip-morris-launches-anti-smoking-campaign.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;22&#x2F;tobacco-giant-philip-morris-...</a><p>Now, back to Mr. Musk, a man who runs one business whose profit depends entirely on government market controls, and another business that depends largely on government contracts. When Trump was president, Mr. Musk decried COVID lockdowns as un-Constitutional. However, now Biden is president and Mr. Musk is pushing a few dollars (relative to his vast fortune) toward a green initiative.<p>In that context, and given the fact that petroleum-powered flight on the scale publicly suggested by Mr. Musk&#x27;s future plans would definitely produce a nontrivial amount of pollution, we shouldn&#x27;t be so quick to herald Mr. Musk as some kind of druidic entrepreneur who loves Earth so much that he wants to make a second one on Mars.<p>Someone else accused me of having strife with my family rather than interpreting my comments as a good-faith dissent from widespread adulation of Mr. Musk&#x27;s ostensible benevolence. I don&#x27;t think that would have happened if I had expressed skepticism about Big Tobacco instead of Big Rocket.<p>EDIT: Methane from Starship is particularly problematic because, if leaked, it is so much more damaging to the atmosphere than CO2. This is part of the reason that venting natural gas from wells unequipped to capture it is a huge no-no. I agree that evaluating emissions from Starship is a bit more challenging.')
