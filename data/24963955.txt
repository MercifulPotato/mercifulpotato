Nobody has ever implied that there is any intention behind most of this type of sexist behavior, it is just useful to be aware that it is a thing so you can work on actively avoiding it, as with any other unconscious bias.<p>I&#x27;m in this situation a lot, I&#x27;m trans and my voice really does not match my appearance. People get confused, I understand, but beyond the first &quot;please address me this way&quot; I am in no way responsible for the difficulty people have in going through with the request. Do note that I personally really don&#x27;t go out of my way to confront people if they keep doing it, I just avoid them as much as I can, because in current corporate cultures, you cannot win a confrontation like this if the person you&#x27;re complaining to has issues relating to you. And for most people pronouns and honorifics are not a big deal. As I&#x27;d expect that sexism is not for men. But ideally anyone in my situation would be entirely justified to make a fuss about it.<p>It is not the fault or responsibility of anyone negatively affected to treat you with gloves. You should know better than taking it as a personal insult when someone pulls you aside and tells you &quot;you&#x27;re are possibly having this common bias, please be mindful of it&quot;.')
