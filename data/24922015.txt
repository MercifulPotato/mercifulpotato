Twitter has the unanimous consent of everyone who is subject to their rules. Every Twitter user became a Twitter user by choice and no-one is going to use violence against them for no longer using Twitter or for creating an alternative. That couldn&#x27;t be further from the situation with the government.<p>Cruz and other politicians impose their rules on people who never had a choice. The US government did not create the land it claims as its territory, it took control of it by force killing thousands of people. The government is both willing and able to use extreme violence to prevent people from avoiding it or creating alternatives to it.<p>A Twitter user who is angry about Twitter&#x27;s censorship only has to spend a few minutes to delete their account and create an account with another service (Gab, mastodon, etc.). A US citizen who is angry about the US government&#x27;s censorship have to abandon their home and be accepted by another government. Even then, the US government may still demand their money and loyalty.')
