Also, putting Florida aside, everything else so far has been well within the error margin, even if the overall mean is 3-4 points shifted towards Trump. I&#x27;m not an expert, but that&#x27;s the whole point of confidence intervals. Polls will never be accurate, but it&#x27;s about using the right uncertainty, and also mixing uncertainties properly.<p>EDIT: Let&#x27;s look at a few of the tipping point results from 538 [1]<p>Florida: 50.9&#x2F;48.4 -&gt; 47.8&#x2F;51.2 (2.8 diff) [99% reporting]<p>Arizona: 50.7&#x2F;48.1 -&gt; 50.7&#x2F;47.9 (0.1 diff) [86% reporting]<p>Texas: 48.8&#x2F;50.3 -&gt; 46.4&#x2F;52.2 (1.9 diff) [85% reporting]<p>Georgia: 50.1&#x2F;49.2 -&gt; 49.1&#x2F;49.7 (0.7 diff) [98% reporting]<p>Minnesota: 53.7&#x2F;44.6 -&gt; 52.6&#x2F;45.4 (0.9 diff) [99% reporting]<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that a lot of these are still at 85-95 percent reporting, so it&#x27;s not over, but yes I don&#x27;t see anything that&#x27;s very off, even Florida that was so off was only 3 points off. I do consider 3 points to be well within the toss-up category.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;projects.fivethirtyeight.com&#x2F;2020-election-forecast&#x2F;</a><p>EDIT2: I think the main thing that surprised people is how in some places, mail-in votes came first, whereas in some other places, mail-in votes are coming much later. This really skews the early data but as things settle, everything is coming much closer to the predictions. But this is something 538 and others have been warning about since May or earlier.')
