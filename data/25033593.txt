It does not belong to his nature. He does not realize himself in his work, that he denies himself in it. That he does not feel at ease in it but rather unhappy. He does not develop free physical and mental energy in it... The worker is only himself when he does not work, and in his work he feels outside himself. He feels at home when heâ€™s not working. When working he does not feel at home...His labor is not voluntary but forced.<p>tl;dr:<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t hate Mondays, you hate capitalism.')
