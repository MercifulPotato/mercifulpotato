Microsoft&#x27;s adoption of Chrome is a tacit admission that they lost the browser wars and are not interested in continuing that fight. Apple isn&#x27;t trying to get Safari adopted en masse on any other OS, it just seems to want to have a browser that it controls on its platform, which I guess makes sense. But it&#x27;s not a play for &quot;controlling the browser&quot; - they don&#x27;t even stop you from installing other browsers on their platform.<p>This just isn&#x27;t an area anyone is fighting for any more. Building a standards-complient fully-featured browser is a huge project, but not so huge that a large corporate couldn&#x27;t afford it. Persuading people to use it is a larger problem, but again, nothing that hasn&#x27;t been done before and can&#x27;t be done again. But no-one at this scale is even trying.<p>There are a few attempts from the other direction, dedicated companies like Brave trying to make this happen, and I hope they succeed.')
