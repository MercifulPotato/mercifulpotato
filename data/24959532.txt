Would be nice to have null here as a default return value. But what about Arrays containing null as a value? What about the case of null || false? What about the case of false || null?<p>There were a lot of design discussions to come up with those APIs...but I agree with you that technically, undefined should not exist. I&#x27;d rather have a syntax error being thrown than having to deal with undefined.<p>As undefined is specified as a hackaround as a global property, ... most of the implications are just a workaround, too.')
