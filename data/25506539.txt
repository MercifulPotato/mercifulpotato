Item(by='senko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608647313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506287, text='EdTech is &quot;enterprise software&quot; in the sense that the people controlling the purse strings are very removed from the actual users. In education, the decision makers are the school district leadership team, while the actual users are twice removed - students.<p>This scenario encourages focus on features that are important for the decision makers and less focus on the features (or usability) important for the actual users - exactly as you describe.<p>A bottom-up approach where students and teachers would identify what works best for them and push for it is extremely hard. Teachers try the best but are limited by their budgets (many pay out of their own purse for tools and equipment!) and students have basically no say.<p>This leads to the situation where most successful (profitable, largest) edtech software has no relation to what actually might be the best tool.')
