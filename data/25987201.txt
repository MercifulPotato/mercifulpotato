If you want to turn rnnoise on&#x2F;off you could create a new pcm rather than overriding the default, and then having the software select it. The README example of asoundrcs is for the most part the same, you&#x27;d just remove this secion:<p><pre><code>  pcm.!default {\n      type asym\n      playback.pcm &quot;cards.pcm.default&quot;\n      capture.pcm &quot;rnnoise&quot;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAs for the second thing, you could do what I do and use pcm_jack, like this:<p><pre><code>  pcm.!default {\n   type asym\n   playback.pcm &quot;plug:jack&quot;\n   capture.pcm &quot;plug:rnnjack&quot;\n  }\n  \n  pcm.rnnjack {\n   type rnnoise\n   slave.pcm plug:jack\n  }\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind this will need more setup, specifically to set JACK up, and is definitely overkill, but may be fun. Also, this config is how my setup works exactly.')
