If you do, you will also see the definitions <i>I’m</i> using—nobody is “re-defining” anything.<p>I am simply using these words because they mean what they mean, and not trying to make some broader “encoded” point about politics or whatever else. If you choose to ignore the intended meaning of my comments (which I have more or less spelled out for you at this point, no contextual awareness required), that’s not my problem, and I’m not going to follow you down that rabbit hole.<p>edit: If there is one political point I am sort of getting at, it’s probably the hypocrisy of older self-identified “liberals” who oppose densification&#x2F;upzoning. Viewed through either a classical liberal <i>or</i> a left-liberal lens, using regulation to block affordable housing is not good, yet a lot of these people support it because they’re the beneficiaries of the status quo. And that, in a sense, is the attitude at the core of practical conservatism.')
