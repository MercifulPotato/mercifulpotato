While it&#x27;s gotten better with revision, fundamentally, you start in an assume-nothing mode in Rust and then boilerplate appears to say &quot;actually, this one is mutable&quot;. This incurs friction on nearly every line of state manipulation and when you&#x27;re doing game-style allocation, you mostly don&#x27;t care. You have a tremendous amount of mutable state; some of it you blow away every frame, the rest you may want to lock sometimes.<p>What Vale does that is attractive is to make simplifying assumptions that address this problem domain  closer to the level of granularity that it deserves.')
