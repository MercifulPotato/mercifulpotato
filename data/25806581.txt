The issue with buffer overruns is that they&#x27;re usually silent. If you have an array of pointers, and you overrun that array, you could end up assigning garbage to another pointer variable. Then when you deref that, if you&#x27;re lucky it&#x27;ll be outside the mapped memory addresses for that process and you crash. If you&#x27;re unlucky, you read or write to a random location.<p>Basically the point is, it&#x27;s very easy to end up in a situation where you know you have a bug but you&#x27;re 2+ levels of indirection from the actual logic error. Those sorts of issues are always the biggest time sink.')
