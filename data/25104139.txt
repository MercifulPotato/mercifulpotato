That seems like some pretty stiff kool-aid...<p>Via ye olde wikipedia:\n&#x27;In the context of United States law, originalism is a concept regarding the interpretation of the Constitution that asserts that all statements in the constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding &quot;at the time it was adopted&quot;.&#x27;<p>This is the start of a very short road to bandying around conflicting subjective interpretations of what the original founders believed, rather than what&#x27;s in the text of the constitution or the law. You can have rule of law without second-guessing the founders; if you get unintended consequences, update the law and&#x2F;or constitution accordingly. It&#x27;s meant to be a living document, right? In the meantime, protections for gay and transgender people based on equal rights laws is a feature, not a bug.<p>[on edit: To put an even finer point on it, Alito&#x27;s arguing originalism because he doesn&#x27;t like the text. That is fundamentally against the rule of law.]')
