Crypto <i>democratizes trust</i>. It&#x27;s true that anything you can do on Ethereum you can do inside of JPMorgan. JPMorgan can execute financial contracts for you easily. However, in order for you to trust JPMorgan do execute them faithfully, it has to be huge in size, and heavily regulated. Ethereum allows anyone to be as trustworthy (more, actually) as JPMorgan, without any massive upfront capital investment, or centuries of continuous operation. If you can&#x27;t see the value in that, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.')
