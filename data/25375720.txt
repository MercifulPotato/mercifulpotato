No it isn&#x27;t. You are the one who is &quot;butchering&quot; a language&#x27;s pronouns by improperly mapping considerations into it from another language here, not vice versa.<p>I have a Slavic last name, and I speak English fluently and Russian not-so-fluently-anymore.<p>If you use &quot;оно&quot; to refer to me in Russian because you don&#x27;t know my gender, it would sound weird to me. (I haven&#x27;t been to any Russian-speaking countries in a while, but I suspect there hasn&#x27;t been a shift in Russian to use that pronoun that way while I&#x27;ve been gone.) I personally wouldn&#x27;t be insulted, but I can easily imagine how somebody might; it would carry a subtext of referring to me as an inanimate object.<p>If you use &quot;they&quot; to refer to me in English because you don&#x27;t know my gender, it would not sound weird to me at all. (Though it might have 5-10 years ago, for different reasons.) A much closer (but still imperfect) analogy to using &quot;оно&quot; to refer to me in Russian would be using &quot;it&quot; to refer to me in English, which <i>would</i> sound weird to me.<p>Hope that helps.')
