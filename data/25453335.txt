The declarative behavior that HOCs and render props enable is one of the best parts of React, used in libraries like react-motion. But man, debugging layers of render props makes me itch.<p>Hooks have been a savior for me. I agree that there are <i>a lot</i> of sharp edges with hooks, but they&#x27;re not magic. They&#x27;re powerful and they compose really well. If you&#x27;re doing anything behaviorally complicated on a React app, it&#x27;s easy to build whatever abstraction is appropriate to your project.')
