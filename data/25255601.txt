There was no point to a &quot;functional taxonomy&quot; of proteins, because we were never trying to predict with protein-structure as the only data available.<p>In a world where protein structure is &quot;on tap&quot; in a data warehouse, part of the game of bioinformatics <i>will</i> become &quot;structural analysis&quot; of classes of known-function proteins, to find functional sub-units that do similar things among all studied proteins, allowing searches to be conducted for other proteins that express similar functional sub-units.')
