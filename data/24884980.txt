I&#x27;m also skeptical of wireless headphones<p>i used logitech h600 for a decade, they had a usb-bt dongle which connected instantly, the range was good, they were lightweight an cost around 60euro at the time. i liked them but the battery died.<p>replacement is 50% heavier has no mic-arm and the bt connection is a mess everytime.<p>i&#x27;d say no, bt-headphones have not improved.')
