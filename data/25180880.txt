As an Eastern European, I have noticed the use of this meme regularly, it&#x27;s basically a recurring joke.<p>With that said, I think it mainly refers to actually bullcrap research that sometimes comes out of Western (and for some reason, mostly British) universities. For example, back when radio was a thing and I was listening to it in public transportation, the radio hosts would bring up these faux science papers - e.g. &quot;Some British University found out that chocolate actually helps you lose weight. That&#x27;s some great news to start off the weekend&quot;. And after a million of these papers that were most likely flawed in methodology, misinterpreted by media or simply fake, what would you expect?')
