Everybody is talking about them rather than how bad the game actually is.<p>The combat is simplistic. The AI opponents are basically broken. The quickhack system does indeed feel like a quickly hacked together game mechanic. V is stuck in a weird state between existing background (a la witcher) and player action defined: I didn&#x27;t get the feeling of any player agency in what my character is, but neither did I get the warm feeling of learning&#x2F;experiencing Geralt&#x27;s(Witcher series MC) life. Life paths, also, are basically devoid of any meaningful relevancy to the storyline.')
