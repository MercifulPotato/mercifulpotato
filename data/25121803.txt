Would they be able to do the full flow of writing -&gt; gathering feedback -&gt; publishing the article without you? Did they know what articles you wanted written? Same goes for the random &quot;awesome lists&quot; people are building. If it&#x27;s not clear what&#x27;s missing and what should be added, people really don&#x27;t know where to get started, so the contributions will be very small.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a project where we want to get designers to contribute to open source design. I expected it to be very hard to find any designer who would understand and wanted to contribute, as that&#x27;s what I found before on other open source projects I&#x27;ve done.<p>But this time I focused on making it really easy for them to contribute, and lo and behold, just one week after soft-launching, we already have 2-3 designers onboard who contribute their time to help out with our open source design.')
