Even if the other person doesn&#x27;t know about NVC, it becomes painfully obvious that you&#x27;re doing something different and not communicating normally.<p>I use 2 categories to break down people who talk about NVC - those who think the words matter, and those who don&#x27;t.<p>It is impossible to tell if someone is practising NVC by listening to the specific words. NVC is about reactions and interpretations. Specific word formulas are tools for beginners and so anyone using them is probably not great at NVC. That gives NVC an undeserved bad name; it really is the most sensible way to communicate. There isn&#x27;t such a thing as &#x27;overusing&#x27; NVC, it is for full time use.')
