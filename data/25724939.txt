Given his diet that&#x27;s an assumption I&#x27;m not comfortable making.<p>&gt; These companies like Twitter, FB, etc are finished if he runs in 2024 and wins.<p>I don&#x27;t think he can EO his way into killing SV. Sometimes people need to be reminded that the USA is a democracy, not a monarchy, and any president doesn&#x27;t have the power to unilaterally dead companies that prop up Wall Street earnings. Nor would they given the bloodbath that would occur on the markets as a result of a move like that.<p>&gt; This economy is going down the shitter real quick.<p>Primarily due to the impact COVID has had on the US economy, right? Trump is still in office, right? I don&#x27;t think you can blame Biden on Trump&#x27;s economic woes due to his COVID response. If Trump would have shown some leadership in that space I expect he would have won the election. Thankfully that didn&#x27;t occur.')
