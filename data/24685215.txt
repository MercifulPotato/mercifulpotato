Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=[24685467, 24685322, 24687109, 24685971], score=None, time=1601880946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678472, text='&gt; [UHT is used] for most milk sold in Europe.<p>&gt; A lot of Americans find [UHT] offensive ...  Europeans, however, donâ€™t seem to mind.<p>Here in the UK, this statement is not true at all. UHT milk is certainly available in the supermarkets (not in the chilled section) but the vast majority of milk sold is fresh. I guess this is the risk of generalising a whole continent of people in such a short statement. (Probably the article&#x27;s claims about Americans don&#x27;t generalise to every part of that either.)<p>The most ridiculous thing about this statement is that it is claiming Europeans care less about UHT. Yet it&#x27;s evident that at least some Americans don&#x27;t care that much because they needed this article to be written <i>to even notice</i> that some of their milk was UHT. I&#x27;m confident that if all organic milk in UK was UHT then its consumers would be furious, without needing it to be pointed out to them.<p>I suspect part of British preference for fresh milk is due to the tradition of milkmen delivering fresh milk every morning, now almost entirely stopped but still in living memory. I&#x27;m reminded of a quote from the excellent British&#x2F;Irish comedy Father Ted, where Father Dougal becomes a milkman: &quot;You better get going, milk gets sour you know. Unless it&#x27;s UHT milk, but there&#x27;s no demand for that because it&#x27;s shite&quot;.')
