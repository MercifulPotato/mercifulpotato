Nope, it’s just not true.&quot;<p>Yep I agree fully with that being nonsense. But at least it implies some modicum of responsibility or necessity of action even if it&#x27;s just &quot;belief&quot;.<p>One I&#x27;ve heard a few times lately (from some people) is stuff like &quot;The universe will provide&quot; &quot;the universe cares about us&quot;. That&#x27;s even more irritating because not only is it nonsense, it implies a complete lack of personal responsibility.')
