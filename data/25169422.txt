That differs significantly from industrialized societies. People you work with don&#x27;t necessary share anything with you. Socialization has become rote and fake. Your tasks are often meaningless to you.<p>This creates a feeling of alienation and powerlessness in a lot of people. For them, staying at home meant reconnecting with tasks that carry actual meaning (improving their home, looking after their loved ones, etc). Their socialization might have actually increased.<p>Obviously, if you found the pre-covid arrangement meaningful and life-fulfilling, now you&#x27;re unhappy that it was taken away from you.')
