Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=[25420882], score=None, time=1607968875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25414562, text='Let&#x27;s not apologize for Apple&#x27;s lack of numbers, please, and assume that this is something you should do yourself. The M1 is fast. Fast enough that you can get away with putting &quot;2x&quot; on the screen without much qualification. <i>But you still need the qualification!</i> If you look at Apple&#x27;s product page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;macbook-air&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;macbook-air&#x2F;</a>) every single number they put up has a little footnote next to it, and you can see the details of how they measured it below it. Apple&#x27;s keynote slides got well-deserved flak for not including a scale–they can and should have put one there. There are only so many metrics you can take out before people call you out as being full of it. Apple still uses numbers–just not many–and they pair it with good copywriting. Your page about a processor that&#x27;s 5% faster paired with someone who writes something like &quot;accelerating the speed of life&quot; and no numbers thinking they&#x27;re emulating Apple&#x27;s writing style isn&#x27;t going to do nearly as well.')
