This difference is usually only like 50..150 us vs 500..3000 us but can multiply up over thousands of files.<p>This only matters on the first run of `rga`, of course.  While the dispatched-to decoder is likely mostly out of one&#x27;s linking control, this overhead can be saved for the dispatch<i>er</i>, at least.  So, I would suggest `rga-preproc` should have a static linking option&#x2F;suggestion, at least on Linux.<p>Of course, this overhead may also fall below the noise of PDF&#x2F;ebook&#x2F;etc. parsing, but maybe not the decompression of small files in some dark horse format. :-)')
