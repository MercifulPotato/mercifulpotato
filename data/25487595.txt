Item(by='shrimp_emoji', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608483296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25485599, text='I grew up with IMs like Yahoo! Messenger and WLM. I tried to use IRC a few times when I was younger and found it impenetrable (a mosaic of text-only boxes that look like a mature emacs configuration -- way before I knew what emacs was -- and immediately greeted by a long wall of text telling me I had to do this and that to post in that server).<p>My qualms and expectations are indeed very different. For example, fat clients like WLM were more peer to peer, which meant unlimited file transfers, sending voice clips, and uploading custom emotes all for free since they&#x27;re not sitting on someone&#x27;s data farming server. I miss that. Thin clients like Discord are of course more profitable but are more limited&#x2F;onerous even as you&#x27;re paying a subscription like Nitro to be able to bump up your file transfer to 100 MB and use custom emotes (despite the great UX).<p>An older person&#x27;s IRC is my WLM. xD')
