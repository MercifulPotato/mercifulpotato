Now it isn&#x27;t, because the government decided that it didn&#x27;t like that.<p>At some point the crypto needs to be converted into USD - either so you can pay someone who doesn&#x27;t accept crypto, or so the business who accepted crypto can deposit safe nonvolatile USD into their bank account. And the government will regulate it there at the transfer point.<p>The other option is that a cryptocurrency replaces USD, becoming the new de-facto currency. The government and the people&#x2F;corporations who are in control of the economy won&#x27;t allow that to happen. I don&#x27;t think that last claim needs to be backed up with any more facts&#x2F;arguments, it is very obviously true.')
