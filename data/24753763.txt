The PB100 is good value for the money, but donâ€™t expect hifi quality. Its currently the best off-the-shelf solution for something you can still stuff in a backpack, unless you spend the big bucks and go with a Soundboks.<p>They really half-assed it tho:<p>- the LED lights are erratic and don&#x27;t look that great<p>- the BT range is crap<p>- no built-in connector to connect external DC power like in the PB300<p>- internal battery life is not great, just 2400mAh, also not swappable<p>- no second set of tweeters like in the PB300<p>- takes a long time to boot (~20secs)<p>- no app to adjust the DSP or disable the startup sound')
