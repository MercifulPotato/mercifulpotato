There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to shame people into &quot;looking at their feet&quot; over it. Throughout the ages, countless people have read the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, but very few people beyond actors who have actually performed it would know who said this, or even in what act it was said:<p><pre><code>    Both by myself and many other friends:\n    But he, his own affections&#x27; counsellor,\n    Is to himself--I will not say how true--\n    But to himself so secret and so close,\n    So far from sounding and discovery,\n    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,\n    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\n    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.\n    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.\n    We would as willingly give cure as know.</code></pre>')
