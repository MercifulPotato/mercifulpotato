He should be, and not just because of Tesla.<p>I&#x27;m a diehard Toyota fanboy, because I believe in things being built to last. It&#x27;s good for the environment, and good for consumers. Nothing frustrates me more cars designed to last only as long as the warranty or lease term.<p>I had a BMW 3 series that I loved driving which broke down far more than a non-performance variant had any right to, so the Lexus equivalent I bought afterwards was a welcome change that I&#x27;ve loved driving ever since.<p>But Toyota has hidden behind their &quot;reliability&quot; moniker for so long, their offerings aren&#x27;t really competitive in any segments anymore.<p>For pickup trucks, both the Tundra and Tacoma have weak inefficient engines, with the Tacoma having a dog of a transmission. For luxury sedans, Lexus has no performance variants anymore, and their mid-performance variants have fallen woefully behind the competition (the 2021 IS350 has gained 5hp since it&#x27;s debut in 2006).<p>My wife wants an EV so her next car is looking to be a BMW i3 (despite how much I swore I&#x27;d never buy another), and I want a reliable performance car so it seems like my next car will be a used Porsche (with maybe a mid-step at an IS-F, a car Lexus hasn&#x27;t produced since 2014).<p>They haven&#x27;t just missed the boat on EVs, their ICEs are falling terribly behind as well, what are they doing over there? Reliability doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re not producing anything people want.')
