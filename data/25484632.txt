Followership, we don&#x27;t hear a lot about, but is actually a critical skill as well. In some ways, it can be harder than leading, because you have to pay very close attention to what the leader does and support them without getting in their way, and they might not be able to spell everything out for you.<p>In software, perhaps B talent can thrive in an A team, and even be essential to them, because they bring firepower that the A players can aim efficiently. I would venture that it requires developing that followership attitude, of paying attention to the environment, identifying gaps, and covering them for the team.')
