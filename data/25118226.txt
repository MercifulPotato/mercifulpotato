Programmers (myself included) tend to rather drastically underestimate the likelihood that data can end up in an error state.<p>Humans make more mistakes, to be sure, but they can also sensibly correct mistakes when they discover them (or have them reported). Automated systems make fewer errors but once they do, the problem can be nigh irresolvable. Just look at the endless trouble we read about every few weeks from people who get their Google accounts suspended. Those people are suspended incorrectly by automated systems, and the widely-responded best recourse is to be well-enough connected to be able to get a human who works for Google to bat for you.<p>Machines are great for increasing scale, but they are terrible for handling edge cases. If edge cases are important to your system, you need humans deeply involved.')
