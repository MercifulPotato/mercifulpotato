Subsequently during national register and citizenship act protests where religious riots were used again to suppress a year of peaceful protests.<p>Than again during university protests in New Delhi. Here again students were attacked inside the university, police beat and shot university students. Still even one person from ruling party who participated in violence or a cop who shot is to be prosecuted. On the other hand most of those opposing are being charged with terrorist charges.<p>India to really progress out of poverty needs to first learn to respect its diversity and be united. Current administrations and ruling party’s policy has taken India on a downhill path of economic disaster, lower HDI, more poverty and more hunger. United Nations data and research don’t lie, India constantly slipped compared to its neighbours like Bangladesh on this index. So probably it will be better instead of hardline approach things change in India, otherwise it will be too late for a divided country to progress forward. It might on the other hand will move towards authoritarian dictatorship very quickly. India needs to come out of tyranny of majority and authoritarian mindset of current government for a change.<p>I hope this same story and violence does not repeat in Bengal, where already violence is being promoted to unseat local government which does not believe in Hindu supremacy like the central government.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;blood-and-soil-in-narendra-modis-india" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;blood-and-soil...</a>')
