If you are so sure, and your idea is so good, you should be able to convince somebody to lend you the money to do it.<p>I didn&#x27;t say I know of a guaranteed way to make money.  I was saying that domain squatting isn&#x27;t novel or difficult or some kind of genius idea.  The primary driver of success in the domainer market is having a big pool of capital and the rest is easy enough that if someone has the capital for it they&#x27;re not going to cut someone else in.  They might hire a domainer as an employee, but they&#x27;re not going to be looking for partners.<p>&gt; It always shocks me how ready poor people are with their excuses.<p>The person that wrote this article is holding ~200 .ai domains at a cost of ~$70&#x2F;year at Namecheap.  That&#x27;s $14k per year.  The federal minimum wage in the USA is ~$15k per year ($7.25&#x2F;hour).<p>Why don&#x27;t you lay out a financial plan for me where a person making $15k per year can hold a $14k per year .ai portfolio?')
