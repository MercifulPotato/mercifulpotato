Would they have been without philanthropy to launder their reputations?<p>Don&#x27;t assume society is ergodic in what has been a period of rapid technological change.<p>&gt; Definitely not enough to overshadow all the good done through philanthropy.<p>What are the greatest hits beyond mosquito nets?<p>At least in the current era, the &quot;undeveloped&quot; country is a bit of a rarity, and the main malaise is rampant Anocracy where institutions are weak, and social coordination of any sort is weak outside that which stems from the private fortunes of the elite.<p>How could private fortunes in developed countries tackle a problem like that?<p>And frankly, even before that, the absolute material standard of living is not necessary the best utility function. Hierarchy of needs means yes got to do the basics first, but it also means that people don&#x27;t know what they aren&#x27;t missing and relative distribution and other less obvious things may be more important for happiness and societal function.<p>If I were billionaire, I would throw all my money into improving democracy (and creatively, if it&#x27;s easier to allow people to emigrate from US to better democracy than fix US, work on the former.) That the US government is exceptionally shitty makes for a too-easy straw-man when defending philanthropy against democracy.')
