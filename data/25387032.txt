If ARM machines can do that with their own UEFI&#x2F;ACPI&#x2F;ServerReady setup, then great. But if I need to alter that disk for each machine I want to use it on (inject board.dtb, add a custom u-boot, whatever), then that&#x27;s not okay. I would happily accept u-boot and whatever else being on an onboard flash chip that I could update but didn&#x27;t need to care about otherwise - that would get us back to &quot;your PC boots via a UEFI system that&#x27;s a whole OS unto itself, but it chainloads GRUB via standard interface so who cares&quot;.')
