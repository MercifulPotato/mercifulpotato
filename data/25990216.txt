There is code that&#x27;s just egregiously bad.  There&#x27;s code that&#x27;s just egregiously good (and it&#x27;s not clear which is more expensive to produce and maintain).  But the vast majority falls into the grey area in between those extremes.<p>The other poster (koonsolo) has just seen enough different codebases to have come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not nearly the most important aspect of a projects success.  And I agree with them on that point (wholeheartedly in fact).<p>Developers concentrate on it because it&#x27;s what they&#x27;re in all day, the same way that a DBA is going to concentrate on the data model because that&#x27;s where they&#x27;re at all day.<p>But in the grand scheme of things, developers way overblow the value of great code.  I also have reservations about the claim that most developers even know what great code _LOOKS_ like, I&#x27;ve seen too many terrible codebases that were claimed to be well designed by their creators.<p>My point is that if the code isn&#x27;t actively causing you problems then leave it be, and stop calling it good or bad.  Call it what it is, working code that doesn&#x27;t need to be bikeshedded over.')
