Wade. If legislature isn&#x27;t prepared, what are they waiting for? Just pass the relevant bills already, so that impact of a potential Supreme Court verdict that returns the control to legislatures has absolutely zero consequences, because the state legislature already has enshrined the current status quo into law. What&#x27;s the problem?<p>&gt; Like it or not, the battle for abortion was fought with the Supreme Court.<p>Yes, and this is fundamentally wrong approach to issues on which there is no broad public agreement.<p>&gt; Saying &quot;she just has a different view on where it should be fought&quot; ignores the fact that it would essentially set us back 50 years in terms of reproductive rights.<p>So would moving to, say, Canada or Sweden, which hardly makes it sound like a disaster.')
