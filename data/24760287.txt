After working with more and more serverless applications (despite the development pains, the business value was still justified) I realized that local development was difficult because I was coupling my code to the delivery. This is similar to the way you shouldn&#x27;t couple your code to your database implementation. Instead, you can write a function that takes parameters from elsewhere and call your business logic there. It definitely adds a bit more work, but it alleviates quite a bit of pain that comes with Lambda local development.<p>Disclaimer: I work at AWS, however not for any service or marketing team.
