You&#x27;d then have to understand not only how things work at the low level, but also how your particular layers of abstractions affect things.<p>With today&#x27;s tech stacks, that becomes nontrivial real fast.<p>With that said, yeah, writing at least superficially efficient code isn&#x27;t really much harder than writing grossly inefficient code if you have a good base understanding.<p>[1] In this case, in terms of energy efficiency, which is even harder to judge without specific knowledge. Time efficiency is easier to test.')
