They wanted to hire me after the first set of interviews, but I took a different opportunity at the time. Interview process was an intense, and the interviewers were sharp. I came out even more impressed with Google. This was way back in the day -- early &#x27;00s. I would totally be excited to work for that Google. It&#x27;s just that, well, there are lots of awesome things to do, and I had (what seemed like at the time) a more interesting option. I sometimes had regrets and sometimes not.<p>Second process was maybe 2-3 years ago. It didn&#x27;t get to a full onsite, since after a few conversations with the team, it was clear there wasn&#x27;t a fit. The old arrogance was still there, but without the same sharpness or cleverness. I spoke to a team working on a new product (under NDA) in a field I had a lot of experience in, and:<p>1) There were computer scientists without a clear understanding of the target market domain.<p>2) They believed they were the best-and-brightest, and didn&#x27;t need to consult experts in the field.<p>3) There was a lot of hype and salesmanship.<p>I like to be surrounded by smart people, and it felt like I&#x27;d be the sharpest guy in that room. I was a better computer scientist, AND better domain expert in the field the product was in than anyone on that team. That&#x27;s not a position I want to find myself in.<p>And I have a job which pays a lot less than Google, but I&#x27;m surrounded by smart people I learn a heck of a lot from, where I&#x27;m working on meaningful things, and having fun. I&#x27;m also continuing to build my personal brand.<p>Now a few years later, the product they were working on never shipped, so if I worked for Google, I would have likely been on a failed project. On the other hand, my mortgage would likely be paid off.')
