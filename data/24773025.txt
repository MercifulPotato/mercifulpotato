And mosquitoes.<p>The other problem was I grew up in a reasonable, livable suburb, and now, when I go back there, I see that rents and housing are really extremely expensive compared to salaries. Jobs suck (there&#x27;s no real tech industry anymore). And traffic in the suburbs is constant gridlock wherever you go.  It&#x27;s become a real horror show and I couldn&#x27;t ever contemplate moving back. Weather&#x2F;Climate is not even the consideration.')
