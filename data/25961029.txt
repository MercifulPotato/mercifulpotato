We’ve seen that overwhelmed hospitals can’t do normal things like cancer treatment either, so tally that up too.<p>This is worth some inconvenience and higher taxes to me. I guess some people have no vulnerable relatives and no co-morbidities, or maybe value things like going to the pub above their gran. Personally I would rather have my 80 year old dad and 76 year old mum around for another few years than spend a week in Tenerife this year.')
