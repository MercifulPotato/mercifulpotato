It sure sounds like he&#x27;s trying to paint it a way that makes him look good and the Intercept look bad. Lots of claims of &quot;censorship&quot; etc.<p>I want to hear their side of it as well.  My guess is that there&#x27;s a lot more to this story.  My guess is if all his peers thought the claims were not solid enough to publish, there is probably a reason for that -- not simply a desire to &quot;censor&quot; someone they&#x27;ve worked with for years.<p>Remember also that the NY Post writer behind the original &quot;Hunter Biden laptop&quot; story refused to put their name behind the article, probably due to the flaws in the claims and evidence presented.')
