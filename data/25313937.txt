You can see bits of both next to each other, and the ugly coexistence of pretending not to see the problems.<p>Trump surprised a lot of people by suddenly manifesting the politics of the Latin American country - he&#x27;s a lot more like Peron than GWB. He&#x27;s a sort of &quot;business generalissimo&quot;: rather than going around in a uniform with a bunch of unearned medals, he talks about his business &quot;successes&quot; (inherited or bankrupt) endlessly.')
