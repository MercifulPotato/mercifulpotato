It&#x27;s a great story.<p>I was reminded of the story of Mohan Srivastava[1], an MIT&#x2F;Stanford-trained statistician, who found a flaw in the Ontario Lottery&#x27;s &quot;Tic-Tac-Toe&quot; instant game. There&#x27;s a great quote from Mr. Srivastava re: his morality and exploiting the flaw he found:<p><i>&quot;People often assume that I must be some extremely moral person because I didn&#x27;t take advantage of the lottery,&quot; he says. &quot;I can assure you that that&#x27;s not the case. I&#x27;d simply done the math and concluded that beating the game wasn&#x27;t worth my time.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;ff-lottery&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;ff-lottery&#x2F;</a>')
