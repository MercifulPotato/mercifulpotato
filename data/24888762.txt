In one now infamous exchange with Transmission developers a GNOME dev claimed that he didn&#x27;t even know what XFCE was and, furthermore, that cross platform applications  like Transmission should choose whether they would be &quot;GNOME apps or XFCE apps&quot;, suggesting that they can&#x27;t be both.  The context of this exchange was that GNOME developer asking that a feature be removed from Transmission because GNOME would no longer support it.<p>That&#x27;s just one example, but GNOME has a reputation for not respecting Linux desktop diversity for a reason.')
