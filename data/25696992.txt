It&#x27;s a word that means different things to so many people.<p>It frustrates me when the media tries to make a big distinction between protests and riots. Those words have become emotionally charged.<p>Rather, if we&#x27;re going to have discussions about this, we should be sure to be extra clear about what we&#x27;re trying to say.<p>I think it&#x27;s fairly pointless to debate what the precise definition of a riot is.  Rather, I was trying express why people see this as different from the &quot;sit-ins&quot; (another wishy washy word) the the poster above you talked about.<p>The reason that I find Wednesday&#x27;s acts worse is because of the violence. And I think that there could be a much more productive conversation off of that pretense, than over what is a riot vs a sit-in.')
