If you know incidents per day, but don&#x27;t know hours driven per day, you can&#x27;t compare safety of two modes of driving. One mode might just be parked more often, and that&#x27;s why it has fewer incidents per day.<p>Similarly, if you know interventions per mile, but don&#x27;t know miles of challenging circumstances per mile, you can&#x27;t compare two modes. Maybe people only turn self driving on in particular circumstances. Or maybe tesla opened the beta to people in easy locations. Apples to apples safety comparisons require a lot of detailed data when they aren&#x27;t part of a randomized trial (which is still hard to do correctly).')
