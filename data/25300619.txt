Neither the original article nor my comment where about interviews asking to implement a breadth first search. That&#x27;s a different topic.<p>This was about him having to learn C# since it wasn&#x27;t really around 20 years ago. And having to polish up Python cause it was very different 20 years ago. And other programming practices. You definitely need to stay up to date on the stuff that&#x27;s relevant to your job. Not because of interviews, but because .. it&#x27;s your job. If you prepare for an interview and notice <i>that&#x27;s</i> what&#x27;s holding you back, then you definitely started to grow complaceny in your job. And maybe your environment made you become that way, then it&#x27;s not a good environment.<p>If you are up to date on this, then writing a BFS from scratch or debugging a null pointer issue or even json will be a piece of cake. Interview questions are an excuse to have a technical conversation, not to see if you remember some algo from school.')
