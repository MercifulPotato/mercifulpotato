Most serious programming languages have a bias towards concepts explored in the academic study of programming languages. Of course academic theories sometimes provide a great foundation with some pretty solid ideas but they needn&#x27;t be the only source of good ideas.<p>Programming is a design exercise and figuring out how to help humans think and explore design is something I think practitioners have more to say on than theorists. Or at least if not more to say, they certainly have more of a contribution to make in this space than we&#x27;ve seen so far.
