It sounds like you don&#x27;t really go any deeper than ordinary open-water diving, but you get to see creatures migrating from much deeper than you would ordinarily get to see.<p>Including, apparently, a lot of transparent juveniles. (I&#x27;m not exactly clear on why juveniles in particular can be transparent.)')
