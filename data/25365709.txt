It&#x27;s not an inevitable progress toward &quot;better&quot;. Some new moral &quot;innovations&quot; lead to horrible moral outcomes, like when John Punch was turned from an indentured servant into a lifetime slave, presumably on the basis on his skin color.<p>And how to describe Nazism except as a moral abberation? That wasn&#x27;t moral progress after the (already declining) morality of the Weimar republic.<p>And I&#x27;m getting weird dystopian vibes from a significant % of the present left.
