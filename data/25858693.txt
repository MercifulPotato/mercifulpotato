Then if you&#x27;re on a cheap flight, you get another announcement about last chance to buy something from in-flight duty-free. Some Airlines don&#x27;t care about satisfaction, just maximising profit where you have no other options.<p>The most annoying things are often those that have been explicitly added by the airlines.<p>Added: My hack for the volume issue - take your own short audio cable with inline volume control. Set the system playback to max volume and turn down your own analog dial.')
