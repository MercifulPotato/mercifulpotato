In reality, there is no such thing as The Market; there are many markets. Even the civil service is a market (for funding, promotion, reputation etc). Competition and collaboration are inevitable functions of any human system. Similarly, the concept of ‘big’ or ‘small’ government makes no sense. In the end, we are always taxed and regulated by someone, it is just a question of who, and to what end?<p>A better way to understand the relationship between ‘the state’ and ‘the market’ is to see nation states as platforms: makers and shapers of markets. They provide the land, infrastructure and set the rules and goals – in the same way that, for example, the App Store creates, regulates and taxes the market for iOS apps.<p>The moment you begin to look at government through this lens, two things immediately become clear.<p>First, a lot of what has been sold to us as ‘free market’ capitalism was in fact the opposite; the privatisation of the platform, creating a series of privately owned monopolies protected from competition, extracting taxation without representation, and profits without prosperity.”</i><p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@AlastairParvin&#x2F;progress-again-6f6213bdcde8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@AlastairParvin&#x2F;progress-again-6f6213bdcd...</a>')
