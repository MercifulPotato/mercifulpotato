The main consequence they have for modern mathematics is that there is no &quot;one axiom system to rule them all,&quot; since you can always extend many systems with a new axiom, which doesn&#x27;t change much, since mathematics since time immemorial has been engaged in the practice of tweaking various axioms and seeing what consequences emerge.<p>Indeed Godel&#x27;s <i>completeness</i> (not incompleteness) theorem (which applies to most mathematical settings such as anything that uses ZFC) is a strong indication that everything mathematicians would care to prove is in fact provable.')
