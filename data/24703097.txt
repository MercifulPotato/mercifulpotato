If anything almost everyone I&#x27;ve came across here in Canada talks about their salary using the gross amount. So not only are wages employers advertise pretty low already, they are usually pretax too.<p>Unless there&#x27;s something more that is taken from wages that isn&#x27;t shown on paychecks. Which would be weird considering that paycheck stubs usually have a full breakdown of where your money went and how much taxes were taken.')
