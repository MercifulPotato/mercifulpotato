If you&#x27;re writing API documentation, you need to be enough of a coder to understand what the engineers are talking about -- and what they aren&#x27;t talking about but really should be! -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean you need to be coding at a level where you could have a career writing apps built on that API, let alone coding at a level where you could have a career implementing the API itself.<p>It&#x27;s the &quot;culture that rewards and values the work&quot; that&#x27;s really the issue, I suspect. Apple certainly <i>used</i> to have a culture of good documentation, and I know they&#x27;ve hired good writers, technical and otherwise, over the years. It&#x27;s actually kind of difficult to explain why their docs are the way they are, other than just not putting any real priority on the necessary work.')
