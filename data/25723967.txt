I mean you can use high smoke points oils, but you want your oil to start smoking.<p>I used avocado, coconut and flaxseed oils for seasoning - flaxseed is the easiest and delivered best results IMO. Plus it&#x27;s nice oil for salads and some smoothies. It&#x27;s not a &quot;special&quot; oil.<p>As for soap, I used it from time to time. However, why my pans are at the peak of seasoning - there is just no need to use soap.')
