Not all acquisitions involve purchase of capital stock.<p>Lawyers refer to the field as &quot;mergers and acquisitions&quot; or &quot;M&amp;A&quot; for short. A good bit of what good M&amp;A lawyers do is navigate the various operational, strategic, tax, and other factors to find an optimal structure. Often, buyer and seller won&#x27;t agree, as because stock and asset purchase carry different tax implications, and have to negotiate structure as part of a broader deal with potentially offsetting concessions.<p>Usage of &quot;acquisition&quot; and &quot;merger&quot; varies between lawyers, managers, and finance people. But it also varies among lawyers, and between states&#x27; laws. I&#x27;d recommend you just say &quot;M&amp;A&quot;. And try to stay out of the Delaware Court of Chancery.')
