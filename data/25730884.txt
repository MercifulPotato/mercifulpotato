Remember the &quot;2014 Obama Unlocking Law&quot; [1] ? It was supposed to not only not make it ilegal to carrier unlock a phone, but also forced all carriers to adopt a specific code of conduct to assist users with unlocking.<p>Fast forward 6 years, and it is much harder to unlock a phone than it was then. The whole thing backfired for consumers. It was actually easier to unlock a phone in a &quot;non-legal&quot; way before the law than it was right after.<p>This whole new code of conduct for carriers actually made them convert their SIMlock departments to be more like a customer retention lifecycle.<p>This mainly applies to US carriers (in the US and Latam), and there certainly are exceptions in Europe where EVERY cell phone is unlocked from day one, regardless of your contractual status.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obamawhitehouse.archives.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;heres-how-cell-phone-unlocking-became-legal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obamawhitehouse.archives.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;heres-h...</a>')
