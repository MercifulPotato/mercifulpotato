Beliefs of humans are path-dependent. Nobody can perfectly rationally re-evaluate all evidence they&#x27;ve encountered and compute a belief to hold. We always start with a belief, and adjust it over time. Some more eagerly than others, some more correctly than others, but it&#x27;s always an additive shift. Integration of evidence, if you like. That&#x27;s why when I see someone believing something that&#x27;s <i>clearly</i> (to me) absurd, I&#x27;m mostly interested in how did they get there - something must have convinced them, and I found it useful to discover what it was, because often it&#x27;s a piece of real evidence I haven&#x27;t encountered before.')
