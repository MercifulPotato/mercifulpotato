The idea of locality of change, of encapsulation, of interfaces as a way to reduce the amount of stuff you need to know in order to change the system. It is a pretty effective strategy for keeping the &quot;cost to change&quot; a software product low.<p>There have been downfalls for me though - interestingly never the obvious problem. To me the obvious problem is performance, there&#x27;s usually an overhead in a plugin system of some sort but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me yet, maybe i&#x27;m just lucky.<p>An annoying real issue has been adding in dependencies between plugins, that has always introduced horrible issues later on. I think based on my current life experiences i&#x27;d even choose to duplicate functionality over introducing dependencies now - despite the fact that idea is basically anethema to conventional wisdom.')
