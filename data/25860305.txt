IMO perfunctory rationalization extends into this labelling as well. Of all media sources, state media is probably the easiest to identify. Presumably that&#x27;s what Twitter&#x27;s labelling is for, unless it&#x27;s actually a wiki style reliable source list, in which case it should be advertised as such. If not then BBC &#x2F; CBC is government funded state media and should be labelled as such.')
