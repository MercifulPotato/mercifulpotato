But then again, that shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise - basically a lower bar (on accuracy) should result <i>both</i> in lower reaction time, and in more false positives.<p>A comment to a sibling comment: I <i>personally</i> find lower time-to-publish <i>immensely</i> valuable - I prefer to assess the accuracy of news stories myself (usually considering the original source and how aligned their interests are with the published information), and I find almost no value in the supposedly &quot;trustworthy&quot; media because they&#x27;re not <i>actually</i> trustworthy to me (besides the obvious political bias, there&#x27;s also plenty of high-profile non-culture-wars fake news, e.g. Iraqi WMD, Bloomberg&#x27;s China spying debacle, the current (non-)coverage of Assange, ...). If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned in the past 10 or so years, is that the &quot;experts&quot; are barely any better than myself at discerning what&#x27;s true or not, and much less trustworthy.')
