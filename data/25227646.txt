(I jest; you are of course correct).<p>As for cross-walk making more sense; Zebra crossing are so named because of the black and white stripes they comprise of, they require you to have seen one, yes, but, I&#x27;d argue that without context &quot;cross-walk&quot; is no more descriptive.<p>Collectively, we call our crossings (Toucan, Pelican, Zebra, Pegasus), &quot;road crossings&quot;. They are so named due to their properties; Toucan because &quot;two (types of user) can&quot; cross there, Pelican (formerly pelicon) because it stands for PEdestrian LIght C[O]Ntrolled crossing), Zebra for its stripes, and Pegasus due to the buttons being accessible at heights suitable for those riding horses.')
