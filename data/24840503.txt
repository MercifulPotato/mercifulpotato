Literally never interacted with any of these in any way, yet I&#x27;m already banned from them...<p>&gt;regardless of the content and context of your reputation<p>If they had bothered looking at the &quot;content and context&quot; of my singular, years-old comment then they would have realized I was actually criticizing the subreddit in question (and its users) rather than supporting them.  Instead, I was preemptively banned from multiple communities.')
