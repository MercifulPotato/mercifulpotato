You could be a solo driver in an HOV lane for a long period of time, in a part of the world where rich people&#x27;s negative experience with the outside world is disproportionately traffic.<p>For every two Teslas worth of subsidies, for rich people who might actually drive very little, you could buy a poor person who actually needs a car a whole Prius.<p>&gt; Encourage drivers to move to lighter vehicles which cause less wear and tear on the road<p>As other people said everyone benefits from roads. Cyclists still need food delivered to grocery stations in trucks. Parents still have their kids driven around in busses. Everyone needs construction vehicles to build more housing.<p>The vast majority of the value of roads is realized by commuters. It&#x27;s not even just the long-ass trip some sucker makes commuting from his low cost community in the boonies. There are a dozen different trucks that need to go that same trip to wildly inefficiently provide him with services.<p>The most logical thing to do would be to tax surburban and rural residents at a state level, and sending that money back to cities. That lifestyle is so preposterously inefficient as an alternative to paying a landlord absolutely more but relatively less to live in a city. Suburban and rural dwellers just externalize their costs to the city people collecting their garbage, running their government, banks and hospitals, teaching their kids, training their police, firefighters, running their courtrooms, etc. - stuff they imagine is in &quot;their&quot; communities but is essentially welfare from vastly richer cities.')
