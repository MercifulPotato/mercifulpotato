Kinda of asking to play louder the band on the Titanic.<p>- Swedes keep on &quot;trusting the government to do what they do as they know better&quot;, while it is unclear on what their trust is based.<p>- To outsiders, this attitude of all sides involved sort of means &quot;we accepted &#x27;the devil take the hindmost&#x27; philosophy as we want to keep our daily happy about routine unchanged, so be it&quot;. Again, as I said - typical thinking of USSR of 80s. It didn&#x27;t end well.')
