Nevertheless, despite being generally anti-centralization and pro-free speech I have to conclude:<p>Large-scale social networks political bias should not be fixed by making social networks more free, it has be fixed by making social networks less free.<p>When &quot;conservatives&quot; call for violence or actual hatred (not just antipathy or disagreement) they must be stopped.<p>When &quot;liberals&quot; storm people and destroy their careers and lives for merely using wrong vocabulary or having and expressing an unpopular (even plain wrong) opinion they should be stopped too.<p>Large-scale social networks meant for general audience, those websites which have serious effects on off-line lives, are the new streets and they have to be policed the same way streets are. We don&#x27;t want to live where street violence is a norm.')
