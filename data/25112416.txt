You could try Dell or System76.<p>Incidentally, it would be nice to live in a world where I didn&#x27;t have to check for MacOS compatibility; I could just buy MacOS from Apple and run it on whatever. The answer is very similar: if you want that experience, buy it from the laptop manufacturer that ships their machines with MacOS.')
