Item(by='gelert', descendants=None, kids=[25306181], score=None, time=1607104048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300870, text='&quot;contradicts the central thesis of the article&quot;<p>No, actually extending the quote makes Martin&#x27;s position worse. Instead of just generally &quot;steppe peoples&quot; he is making a more specific claim that the Dothraki resemble Mongols, Huns and Amerindians but not peoples like the Turks who were (and are e.g. Turkmenistan) also steppe peoples. By extending the quote you establish only that Martin believes the Dothraki are drawn from a few specific Earth cultures<p>The motte and bailey distinction is a fun way to characterise an argument (even if you did get them mixed up initially :p) but I don&#x27;t think you can be as sure as you are in it. I&#x27;ll limit this discussion to the article so I&#x27;ll just discuss clothing. So, your question becomes; has the essay failed to establish a link between this inaccuracy and it being harmful to how people perceive the cultures martin claims to be relying on?<p>I think that it has. In the discussion of buckskins and linens the articles author is establishing that these groups tried to wear clothes which were comfortable, practical and beautiful. In a word, they were human. The Dothraki by contrast are dressed like an&#x27;80s fantasy novel cover. Their clothes (in book and tv) are the clothes of inhuman people. They do not express human priorities. By depicting the Dothraki in this way, while making the claim that they are based off of real world cultures, Martin is essentially dehumanizing these specific peoples by implicitly arguing that their style of dress is less human.<p>I&#x27;m really unsure how you can accept that the representation is historically inaccurate and encourages people to have an inaccurate view of history but then try and deny that a poor understanding of history is a problem.')
