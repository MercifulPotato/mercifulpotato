Which ones would hurt us most if they had a CVE?<p>- are there certain kinds of dependencies that are quite fragmented? e.g. six different datetime libraries in use<p>- which files seem to cause the most contention in code review?<p>- which files require the most edits?<p>- which repositories listen to which SNS topics?<p>Et cetera<p>My idea was a package of helpers for traversing e.g. the repositories under a GitHub organisation, visiting certain files (e.g. package.json. requirements.txt, CloudFormation configs) and building up arbitrary graphs and categories.<p>Then what I could do is write a simple program calling my framework to e.g. create a graph visualisation of uses of internal library X<p>My main usecase would be JavaScript &#x2F; TypeScript applications, so possibly I could even support using TSC to resolve uses of a symbol, e.g. to answer questions like &quot;Who uses this legacy React component?&quot;<p>I wonder how useful this could be - especially compared to existing approaches - and which features would be most valuable.<p>I&#x27;d also be really open to hearing ideas about the design I could use, ways to store or query the graphs built.<p>Broadly, what I&#x27;d like to know is: does this sound like a useful project?')
