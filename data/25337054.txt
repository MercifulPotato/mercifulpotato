Like many other people, I&#x27;ve been struggling with carpal tunnel during the pandemic and I&#x27;ve switched to dictation based coding. Since making the switch, I&#x27;ve realized how much of how I code is specifically due to the keyboard being my way to tell the computer things.<p>And graphical programming paradigms that I&#x27;ve seen are really just switching from keyboard to keyboard + mouse.<p>Right now, dictation is still at the point where it&#x27;s a royal pain in the ass to have it as the primary input method. As soon as that changes, I expect that we will see a flurry of new programming paradigms.<p>Code is best represented as text when it is input (and modified!) as text. My current dictation set up includes lots of it asking me &quot;did you mean X,Y, or Z&quot; and as natural language processing improves, those questions are going to get a lot more interesting. Even if NLP weren&#x27;t going to improve, dictation+keyboard+mouse(+touchscreen+eyetracking\n...) based programming will probably be a very different experience from keyboard+mouse based programming. Until then, I really only expect incremental change.')
