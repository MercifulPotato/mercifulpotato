Sitting around and wallowing in our own guilt won&#x27;t accomplish anything. But I do think we should accept that our own nature is part of what has led to this and be honest about the problem. I couldn&#x27;t have put it better than you did: we should think about how to support humans as they are.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what I said is a straw man. I was being a little flip, but I think it&#x27;s a normal human impulse to blame &quot;that thing&quot; or &quot;those people&quot; and to feel that a problem can be fixed by just eliminating whatever that is. Maybe nobody is explicitly saying &quot;if we eliminate Facebook the problem will go away,&quot; but I do think some people implicitly feel that way.<p>The deeper problem, in my view, is that network technologies encourage our tendencies toward runaway group think and villainization  due to their effect of disinhibition (making us react to something more quickly than we can rationally think about it).')
