Item(by='Rebelgecko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609542685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25607816, text='Out of curiosity, have you worked at a megacorp? A lot of the things you say in the article don&#x27;t really ring true for me. Maybe it&#x27;s team-dependent, but I actually have much better visibility here for how my actions impact &quot;the bottom line&quot;, and I&#x27;m fairly confident that nothing I&#x27;m working on is being used to support genocide or slavery.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at small smaller companies and actually had the opposite experience. Way more NDAs, way more issues with HR (at a megacorp, it&#x27;s true that HR might not give a shit on a personal level about outcomes when there&#x27;s issues. I&#x27;ll take that over the situation where HR is a blood relative or close personal friend of someone involved in an issue). This sort of vague apathy is awesome--I can make code contributions to a team I&#x27;ve never met and they&#x27;re happy to accept them. At smaller companies I&#x27;ve worked at, crossteam collaboration was a lot more difficult because everyone had a little fiefdom they wanted to protect.<p>Even though I don&#x27;t think (reasonable) NDAs are that big of a deal, I had way more of them at a smaller company. A bigger company is much more vertically integrated so they aren&#x27;t necessary. And it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m gonna impress people at a party by reciting proprietary Xilinx datasheets.')
