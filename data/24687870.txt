You lay in bed last night or had lain in bed.<p>lay, laid (past and past participle).<p>Also, to get laid is something that often happens while lying in bed. And of course, lie has multiple meanings, and people will sometime lie to get laid and then lie in bed to do so.<p>(English is lunatic language.)')
