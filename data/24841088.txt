I&#x27;ve been given poor legal advice before by a lawyer, and been given even worse tactical advice. I&#x27;ve gone against a lawyer&#x27;s recommendations before when their explanation and recommendation did not jive with my reading and understanding.<p>You should educate yourself and seek counsel if you believe you need it. Because ultimately the situation is no different than getting a physician&#x27;s opinion or a consultant&#x27;s opinion or whatever else - you seek that expertise because you feel you need it. And usually that means you have to pay for it. But a lawyer&#x27;s opinion, even if it&#x27;s a good opinion, doesn&#x27;t inoculate you from being sued or threatened or whatever else an antagonizing party may do.<p>But don&#x27;t freak out. Everyone is terrified when they get their first lawyer letter. Everyone is outraged when they get their second. And when they get their third (or fourth or however long it takes to learn), they use it for toilet paper.')
