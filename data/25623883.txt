The model starts with defining the Need, followed by Approach, Benefits, and lastly, Competitors... the competition section is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it&#x27;s not the only one.<p>OK, what are the competitors to this model? :)')
