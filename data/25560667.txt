I built a house which is largely ADA compliant, and lost maybe 10 square feet, most of that was due to converting traditional doors to pocket doors, which requires wider walls.  For the most part, all of the doorways could accommodate the wider door requirements without moving any walls.<p>If I got rid of my oversized two-car garage, I could recover maybe 400 square feet.  Without a driveway, another house of the same exact size could be placed on the same lot.<p>Cars are antithetical to density.  Discouraging their use will greatly improve city density, while also having environmental benefits.')
