I strongly doubt that &quot;distill[ing] the all definitions of remote areas of mathematics&quot; is even possible, or a fruitful project to attempt. Could you give an example of how definitions from, say, probability theory and algebraic geometry might be merged in a useful way?<p>&gt; No you need formal proofs to check that there aren&#x27;t errors along the way. And lack of formal proofs slows down new weird stuff like the ABC conjecture proof candididate.<p>I think this comment misunderstands the problem with the ABC &quot;proof,&quot; which is (speaking roughly) that a certain lemma asserted something that was crucial to the argument, but which was never actually proved. Peter Scholze and others spotted this pretty quickly. Formalization wouldn&#x27;t really have helped at all.')
