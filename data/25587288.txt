A lot of these problems would go away if things had gone the other way.<p>Groups can be encoded in one pass, they are efficient to decode (unless you were trying to skip the sub-message, a la LazyField), and they don&#x27;t have the string&#x2F;message ambiguity in UnknownFieldSet that messages have.<p>Do you remember how that came to pass?  Maybe some of this happened during the evolution of proto1, which was before my time.')
