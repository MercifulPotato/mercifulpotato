One caveat, when I first started there was a bit of a learning curve on how to get core bracing and posture right, and bad form made my back a bit sore.<p>Unfortunately in the current virus situation the gym is out and my place isn&#x27;t suitable for weight training. I&#x27;m starting some bodyweight exercises but they don&#x27;t seem to help my back like the weight training did.')
