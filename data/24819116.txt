Unlike most other competitors in this space, we’re looking to keep things simple: we’d like to bootstrap the company, we won’t sell user data for advertisements, and we’ll avoid gaudy graphics that require the latest phone as much as possible. We’re trying to be good stewards and provide quality games rather than being just another race-to-the-bottom game company. We’re trying to be as friendly to join and play as possible: joining someone’s game will always be free.<p>I started this project in August with my brother, Nick, our other co-founder. We’re still in the early stages, but very curious to hear feedback about what we’ve built so far. We have lots of ideas and plans for the future but figured we might as well see what HN has to say! At least for us, we&#x27;ve had a lot of fun playing this under our states&#x27; quarantines. We&#x27;ve recruited several friends and family members to help beta test and it has been a blast reconnecting with everyone.<p>Some cool things we have brewing are:<p>- Video and text chat integration<p>- Other types of games, including some of our favorite card games<p>- Improving the experience on older devices<p>- Building mobile apps<p>- Alternative dictionary support<p>Feel free to email us at willowpatchgames@gmail.com if you have any questions.<p>Let us know what you think and may the odds be ever in your favor!')
