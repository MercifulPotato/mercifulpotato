Read a book like &quot;All About Asset Allocation&quot;, recognize that every time feels unique but it&#x27;s really not, and choose a mix of assets that reflect your risk and reward profile. It&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>If you&#x27;ve got 10+ years, keep it mostly in stocks. If you need it sooner, keep it mostly in bonds. Trust in the power of compound interest.<p>Prefer assets that have a logical reason to go up based on history, not fancy. Businesses and governments pay back bonds from their revenue. Businesses are worth more over time from improvements in efficiency and scale which raises the stock market. Stay away from assets that are basically speculative (gold, crypto, oil, metals, real estate). History shows that speculative investments tend to just track inflation over time, but since they&#x27;re noisier people can find all kinds of short term patterns to justify investing. Don&#x27;t fall for it.')
