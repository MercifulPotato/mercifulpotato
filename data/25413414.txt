HN is a place where most of the participants are wealthy, and your worldview is skewed by that. An unexpected $16,000 cost would totally blindside <i>most</i> families, and they shouldn&#x27;t have to &quot;manage their finances&quot; to avoid predatory businesses.<p>That it&#x27;s even <i>possible</i> to spend $16K on predatory micro-transactions - for a child OR an adult - is absolutely sickening. I hope Apple gets their ass handed to them in the current round of antitrust lawsuits.')
