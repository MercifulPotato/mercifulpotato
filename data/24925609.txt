Bazel offers deterministic builds (which allows things like content-based caching and early stopping), but for that to work well, you often need to build the toolchain itself using Bazel as wellâ€”since the object files depend on the compiler too, not just the source files. Currently, the system is kind of broken: if you upgrade your compilers, Bazel doesn&#x27;t catch the changes, and your build cache ends up potentially breaking as a result.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t just hash the compiler and library binaries instead of building them from scratch... but that&#x27;s a different question.')
