I wouldn’t be surprised to read FB has a policy of deleting the ‘leaked’ information and subsequent pages because an authoritative source (seeded by the government and&#x2F;or at the will of some random uninformed employee) claims its fake news or some unsubstantiated claim or it’s some ‘terrorist’ group or something.
