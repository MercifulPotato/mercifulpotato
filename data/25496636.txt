He lamented that so much of the 80s and 90s was ephemeral, not saved in a cloud, or large hard disk, etc. Maybe a Zip disk, or a print out but largely unsaved. Imagine the first emails, correspondence on BBS’s, and other closed gardens, all of that is likely gone. Whereas since about 2001&#x2F;2002 much, much more is getting saved, and growing by the second. It’s created for him this gap of information and reference creating a longing for that time period.')
