Compared to flaming combustion smouldering combustion is slower, lower temperature (900 C) vs and flameless. Smouldering is typical for porous fuels like peat.<p>The burning is sustained by heat. The burning beat is little underground. The burning peat is insulated so that the heat does not escape and the smouldering can continue.')
