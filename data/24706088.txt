Item(by='colechristensen', descendants=None, kids=[24706324], score=None, time=1602056223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705533, text='&gt; As a SW engineer my interpretation has always been that USB3 speeds are just too high to work really reliably with consumer grade hardware. This article gives technical details that tell me I have been correct.<p>The last section of the article is the most relevant: the hardware, tools, and documentation for USB3 are of mediocre quality.  The whole history of moving bits over cables is adding and adapting tricks for getting more and more data through, we’ve always been at the point where poorly implemented solutions would cause problems, and we’re several orders of magnitude away from it being possible for a novice to implement a hardware and software solution from scratch  (bit banging a serial interface on a microcontroller GPIO is possible for a reasonable person to do in a week to achieve less than a megabit connection). Super fast data rates are all over and most of them are very reliable, USB isn’t up to the same quality.  You can make any speed reliable and fool proof, you just have to do it.')
