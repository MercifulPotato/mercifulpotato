If you think you could use it, I&#x27;d highly recommend keeping some around.<p>If Loperamide alone (as opposed to other opiods) ends up being useful for this treatment in humans, I wonder what the impact will be on the price or OTC availability, if any - possibly nil because a special method of application might be required (nanoparticles)? Has something similar to this happened previously with another OTC drug and actually made it to market?')
