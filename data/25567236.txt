Something like voyager.<p>Nearby civilizations will send interstaller probes to the closest stars first. Because that&#x27;s what everybody would do.<p>And their scientists are more likely to get money to communicate with probes than speculative aliens.<p>And as an interstaller probe gets closer to the target system, the amounts of power needed to communicate with it is enormous.<p>Altogether this means first contact is likely to be a radio or laser signal meant for an interstellar probe that&#x27;s headed towards us.<p>All theory crafting though lol. But it would jive 100% with funding realities on our planet. I think for this reason alone we should listen to our ~20 closest neighbors extra well.<p>The sad downside is that if they&#x27;re the closest star to us, we&#x27;re also likely the closest star to them. That means very few civilizations would send a probe to us first :&#x27;(')
