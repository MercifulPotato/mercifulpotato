If the executive team is trying to raise the median salary of their employee base, however, there&#x27;s now a strong incentive to outsource the lowest-paid portion of your employee base to contract work (even if contractors might cost marginally more), since it&#x27;ll raise the median wage of your employees.<p>e.g. let&#x27;s say my employees&#x27; wages are:<p>[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 10, 10]<p>Now let&#x27;s say I could replace each employee with a contractor by paying 0.5 more than the salary of an FTE.<p>In the above example, let&#x27;s say I want to raise the median salary of my employees to 10. I could do that by either:<p>* Paying one of my employees 9 more (boosting them from 1 to 10), at a total cost of 9<p>* Replacing all my 1-salaried workers with 1.5-salaried contractors, at a total cost of 2.5 (five workers, each getting a 0.5 bump)<p>It&#x27;s clear that I&#x27;d never want to do this if contract workers and full-time workers were just as favorable for me (since I&#x27;d be paying more to get the same work done). If all of a sudden the company were incentivized to raise their median employee&#x27;s salary, though, all sorts of non-common-sense solutions can come out of the woodwork, and replacing FTEs with contractors (even at a cost) could be the incentivized solution.')
