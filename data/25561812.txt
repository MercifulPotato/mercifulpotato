I think this is becoming more of a norm, and they were the norm as far as what was available at the time, but this could also have been that units with kitchens were getting filled faster at the same time I was making my observations.<p>What infuriated me personally wasn’t that there were so many, but that the asking prices were about the same as the asking price for an equivalent unit with a full kitchen. It’s a seller’s market, that’s what I’ve been more or less communicating all up and down the thread, but damned if that doesn’t peeve me.')
