That kind of defeats the whole point[1].<p>Either: 1) Be comfortable being extremely poor.  This was the route I initially took:  I was homeless during the time I learned UNIX and Python, etc. and had plenty of free time to work on writing code.<p>2) Be wealthy already.  The easiest is to be born to wealth, but if that didn&#x27;t work out for you you&#x27;ll have to acquire wealth yourself.  There is a wealth (pun intended) of information on this already, and it&#x27;s beyond the scope of this comment, but I&#x27;ll recommend &quot;The Art of Money Getting or, Golden Rules for Making Money&quot; by P. T. Barnum  (Yes, <i>that</i> P. T. Barnum!) esp. the last chapter: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;8581&#x2F;8581-h&#x2F;8581-h.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;8581&#x2F;8581-h&#x2F;8581-h.htm</a> and &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; which &quot;remains in print almost a century after the parables were originally published, and is regarded as a classic of personal financial advice.&quot; ~ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon_%28book%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Richest_Man_in_Babylon_%28...</a><p>3) Get paid for the writing itself (which is hopefully solving someone&#x27;s immediate problem, eh?)  (This is what RMS himself does, FWIW.)  (Can be combined with option #2 to bootstrap wealth.)<p>[1] The &quot;whole point&quot; being something like, &quot;Let&#x27;s accelerate the techno-singularity and go live in Star Trek with cool aliens who like us.&quot; yeah?')
