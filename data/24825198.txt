Turns out we are saying the same thing.<p>Well, depends on the Metro. Chennai is notorious for power cuts. Delhi is supposed to be better - but I used to live in Noida (Part of NCR, but technically UP and not Delhi) and the power cuts were ridiculous - around 60-90 minutes without power every day (I was fortunate enough to have backup power where I stayed).<p>My small hometown that was approx 25km outside Cochin in Kerala had far more reliable power supply. The point I&#x27;m trying to make - power supply varies greatly, and being a &quot;tier 1 metro&quot; does not always mean more reliable power than some obscure town you&#x27;ve never heard of.')
