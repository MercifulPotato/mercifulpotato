When I think of American buses, I think of Rosa Parks and racism, because that&#x27;s the only context I have - but that doesn&#x27;t make that the only relevant characteristic of them.<p>We here in India hear the &quot;caste as abhorrent discrimination&quot; side from a very early age (and that&#x27;s certainly important), but it&#x27;s taken me years of experience to learn that in practice it&#x27;s more than that. People think of caste as a form of extended family, or as shared culture, or of understanding someone&#x27;s roots. That person might have said that just as someone might say &quot;I can&#x27;t figure out if their accent is from New York or New Jersey&quot;: that <i>might</i> be an intent to discriminate, but might also well be idle curiosity about the person.')
