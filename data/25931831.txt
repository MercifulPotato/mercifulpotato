Sure there are benefits from the purchases from these workers, but there are significant costs like displaced workers on unemployment and other aid, costs for healthcare, good businesses in these industries that are unable to compete against companies that avail themselves of the cheap labor close down along with the better paying jobs, financial and social impacts on certain communities (mostly poor ones) that must deal with the inundation of people that do not speak English and are largely not tied to the community (at least initially).<p>However, the wealthy love this policy.
