If you want to mitigate the brittleness of a single personal server hosting your toots, distribute&#x2F;duplicate them across many personal servers? Then I guess we&#x27;d need to change our concept of &quot;host&quot; from &quot;physical server&quot; to &quot;private&#x2F;public key pair that enables encrypting toot history (so writes&#x2F;edits&#x2F;deletions) from an author and decrypting them for author+host subscribers&quot;.<p>Admittedly I&#x27;m a bit out of my depth here so maybe there&#x27;s some reason this wouldn&#x27;t work&#x2F;would be a bad idea I&#x27;m not seeing at the moment (aside from the additional technical overhead).')
