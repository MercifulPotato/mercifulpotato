The company had a fleet of HP LaserJet Series II printers (that having been introduced in 1987). They worked fine, same as anything today, with regard to jams and whatever. (Mostly, they were used for cranking out documents written in WordPerfect.) Though modern printers are more affordable and capable, the basic physical user experience is about the same. Modern printers don&#x27;t even look all that different: vanilla boxes with some slanted aperture on top where paper comes out; drawer for blank paper. If I walked into, say, an insurance agency or whatever and they had a HP LJ II from 1989 sitting on a counter in a corner, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice the antique. :)')
