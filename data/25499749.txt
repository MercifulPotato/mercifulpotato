Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[25499937], score=None, time=1608585869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499526, text='&gt; The hosting&#x2F;caching of those pages on outside caches is a bit more problematic, especially when it gets used by Google to de-emphasize the destination site in favor of flicking through Google results.<p>I think this gets at a core tension - there are <i>three</i> parties involved in a search results page. The search engine, the destination site, and the user. Each has its own set of incentives. Both search engine and destination site have this bizarre idea that they have some kind of root-given right to the user&#x27;s undivided attention for as long as they like.<p>The user&#x27;s interests are frequently poorly represented. They rarely include giving either search engine or destination site the amount of engagement each feels they deserve. Often, but not always, the search engine is somewhat better aligned with the user.<p>&gt; I think the same idea implemented as a browser standard would have much better reception.<p>I personally have quite deep doubts. A standard like AMP works only because it can require adhering very strictly to a tightly written specification that blocks a lot of the things website authors want to do. I suspect AMP as a browser standard would produce a vast amount of forever broken webpages before publishers ditched it due to poor ad revenues and went back to their crappy, bloated, slow, ad-laden pages.<p>The ability to load it into a CDN controlled by someone else - kind of a huge deal for performance reasons - is exactly the key feature that&#x27;s user-friendly and hated by publishers. It&#x27;s the kind of thing that would be cut out of a browser standard or just ignored by publishers.')
