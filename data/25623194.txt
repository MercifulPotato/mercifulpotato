They required an antenna on a pole and cryptographic keys to be loaded too (for the unjammable encrypted signal)...<p>They didn&#x27;t have maps - you had to use coordinates on the screen to look up your location on a paper map...    Everyone thought they were kinda pointless, because why not just triangulate off some hilltops which would take 5 mins rather than waiting an hour...')
