At best they annoy your readers.  At worst people leave your site and give revenue or eyeballs somewhere else.  Since publishers are in the impression business, shouldn&#x27;t they be selling ads that make revenue by impression instead of by click?  My dream is for publishers to wise up suddenly, leaving Taboola and its underwriters holding the bag.')
