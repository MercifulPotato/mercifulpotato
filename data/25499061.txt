Its approach is closer to the Disney &#x2F; 90s Microsoft monolith: lots of vertical integration, redefine processes at every level, etc. Commoditizing the supply chain would be if they hired intermediaries and encouraged competition between them, but they mostly do things in-house.<p>(well, except for hiring, but the commoditization of jobs unfortunately isn&#x27;t a new phenomenon)<p>On the other hand, maybe it can be argued that Amazon is trying to commoditize <i>the physical marketplace itself</i>. It notoriously makes very little money on physical goods, and most of its profits come from its cloud division. But I think we&#x27;re getting a little far from the concept described in the article.')
