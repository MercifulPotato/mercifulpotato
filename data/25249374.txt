And some overhead of the basic infrastructure services like provisioning numbers and 911.<p>In my experience with these projects, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s safe to conclude that they add up to enough to significantly change the economics of the network. I know working on the projects feels like a huge waste of time and energy, but we&#x27;re talking a million dollars here and there, when the cables, towers, and core people are spending 500 million plus per year. I&#x27;m sure it adds up, but all businesses have overhead, and I don&#x27;t see it as a game changer.<p>As for charging a flat rate, I&#x27;m actually of the opposite perspective. I realize it&#x27;s probably unpopular for this community, but for a long time I&#x27;ve been an advocate that mobile usage should be metered by use. The problem I have with the flat rates, is the users who use less always end up subsidizing the power users who use significantly more. Much of the network investment goes into supporting the top end users, but it&#x27;s everyone else who has to pay for it. For wireline access this might be a bit different roi calculation, but for mobile wireless I think this is a real economics problem, and flat rate is not an incentive for a carrier to support or retain a power user who wants to use lots of data.<p>So personally I prefer a model that works more like electricity usage or filling a gas tank, where you pay for what you use, and you naturally get a feel for watching 4k video all day costs more. This of course needs the tools in place to understand where the usage is coming from, not to surprise anyone, etc, etc, so it&#x27;s not a perfect model, but compared to years ago and the rates that could be offered, it seems atleast to me like a more natural model.')
