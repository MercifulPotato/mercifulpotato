Should African Americans descended from slave traders be paying reparations to African Americans descended from slaves? Should African Americans pay reparations to Native Americans for living on land that was stolen from them?<p>There are so few records for any of this, it just seems absolutely insane to me. I am a huge history nerd, and there aren&#x27;t concrete answers for a lot of things that happened <i>this decade</i>, even with impeccable records.')
