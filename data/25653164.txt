Item(by='CPLX', descendants=None, kids=[25654113], score=None, time=1609891929, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652913, text='&gt; Economists solved that one along time ago: revealed preference.<p>I&#x27;m quite certain they didn&#x27;t solve the problem of determining the correct long term value system for the human race. For context I have looked into the idea, I have a degree in Economics.<p>We don&#x27;t even have a perfect optimal strategy for the completely bounded game of chess yet. But somehow we&#x27;ve solved the problem of determining optimal strategy for the unbounded game of social and economic interactions between millions of independent actors? It&#x27;s a pleasant thought, but no, we haven&#x27;t.<p>In real life what people are doing is making economic tradeoffs within a narrowly constrained section of a complex adaptive system within which no actor can do much more than guess at the prospective outcomes of their decisions.<p>Or put another way, in economic terms how would an economic actor express a clear preference for a sequence of events that leads to a personal connection with someone who doesn&#x27;t have any money, when they are not aware that&#x27;s even a thing they can do?')
