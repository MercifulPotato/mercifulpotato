Item(by='xoa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609036953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25548167, text='&gt;<i>Like it or not they are patented <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US7499962" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patents.google.com&#x2F;patent&#x2F;US7499962</a> (FMA, for example)</i><p>Yeah, and AVX is also relatively new, intro&#x27;d in 2008 and first shipped in a chip in 2011. AVX2 wasn&#x27;t until 2013. So even with R&amp;D and patents happening years beforehand it&#x27;ll still be a good long while before they expire (that FMA example being a case in point, not until end of 2026).<p>Granted in Apple&#x27;s specific case that&#x27;s actually not a bad thing. Precisely because AVX is so new, many Macs supported up until the last version or two of macOS didn&#x27;t have it. So AVX isn&#x27;t at all a widely expected dependency for the kind of older software that may never get an ARM port and in turn most needs Rosetta 2.')
