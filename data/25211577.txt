E.g. disputing charges and chargebacks?<p>I don&#x27;t work in that space, but my understanding is that the card processors essentially serve as dispute mediators in those instances.<p>So it would seem unavoidable (although not great) to have some sort of trusted, third-party middle person between collectors and end users, who can handle disputes and vouch for consent.<p>Blockchain doesn&#x27;t seem like a solution, given that the problem is precisely in the digital-physical gap. E.g. I have proof of consent (digital) but no way to tie it to a (disputed) act of consent (physical).')
