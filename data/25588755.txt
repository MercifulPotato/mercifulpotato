If there&#x27;s approximately 250M adults in the US, at $600&#x2F;week&#x2F;adult, that would be $150B&#x2F;week, or $600B&#x2F;month. So far, over the course of 10 months, that would be $6T.<p>Also, that would be the max amount so far and could ask people who don&#x27;t need the money to either opt out of receiving it or to donate it to an org or person they think needs it.<p>&gt; Each party is dedicated to making sure that their constituents and only their constituents get money. After all, if the other guys can write endless checks for you, why on earth would they vote for the other guy.<p>Fair points. I think often political parties can get so insular they miss the point that for some problems, we are all on the same team.<p>&gt; Also, sooner or later the US dollar&#x27;s reserve status will disappear, and all of a sudden, all of the money supply we have flushed into the economy will manifest as inflation.<p>I don&#x27;t know too much about what you mean here regarding the reserve status and how it prevents inflation, but I&#x27;m curious to learn more, so thank you for mentioning that.')
