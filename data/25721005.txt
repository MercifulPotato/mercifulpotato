The issue is, once I write in my notebook, I tend to never reread what I’ve written.<p>Enter Typoglyph. I assign blocks of text a glyph or symbol (#, &lt;, ~, etc). I can then map these symbols to any command using the text as input.<p>At the end of each day I simply snap a picture of my notebook pages and all the queued actions in my notebook are executed.<p>Unfortunately I’m using Google Cloud OCR, as it’s the most accurate at detecting handwriting (that I’ve found). It also doesn’t allow for custom glyphs.')
