When you build an internal PaaS you aren&#x27;t building the k8s part, you&#x27;re building and prescribing the entire developer workflow to the team. If you do it well then it makes self-service super easy but the opinions on how to do everything are baked in. For example, you get opinionated versions of a build pipeline, SPA hosting, deployment models, yaml templating (or some other config language), dependency trees, monitoring and alerting systems, identity, secrets management, etc. All of those things end up being baked into the system if it&#x27;s going to be successful. It&#x27;s a tall order and I&#x27;d love to read more about internal PaaS failures than successes; thats where the learning is going to be.')
