Item(by='kmill', descendants=None, kids=[24974251], score=None, time=1604270616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962798, text='I read through the MIDI 1.0 spec last night, and I was very surprised to see it said nothing about default note number to pitch mappings, other than that 60 is middle C. The only time frequencies seem to come up is for the (optionally implemented) messages to retune individual notes! (I&#x27;m not sure I have a copy of the whole thing, so I could be wrong.)<p>From what you say, it seems like the VST2 spec sets a standard scale to fill in this gap, which is interesting. It certainly would help with interoperability.<p>Anyway, I learned something from the clarifications arising from each of you correcting each other :-)  (Though it&#x27;s probably not worth continuing discussing whether there&#x27;s any difference at all between &quot;deals in 12-TET&quot; and &quot;uses 12-TET only as a reference&quot; since you both seem to mean the same thing by these by now.)')
