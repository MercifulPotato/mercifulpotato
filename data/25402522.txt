Because it feels like QA could just as easily be priority tasked on the next point release RHEL and starve stream of QA while it carries on ahead. I guess this boils down to the workflow which there doesnt seem to be a simple guide of with this news.<p>And no, I wouldn&#x27;t agree that they just swapped places. CentOS stream is a rolling release. Unless I am mistaken that&#x27;s not how RHEL is built right now.<p>I can see a reason for swapping them in that adding RHEL goodies&#x2F;licencing into the free version is easier than removing, but the release cycle change, dropping CentOS 8 and as you admit, absolutely shambolic official press release, with lines that reek of a salesperson trying to squeeze out a bonus, do not inspire faith.')
