He knows (at least) the first three words, and he knows that they aren&#x27;t nonsense.<p>What he <i>also</i> knows is that he&#x27;s whistling to a specific audience, and that <i>that</i> audience either doesn&#x27;t know those words <i>or</i> thinks that any sort of academic terms of art in the humanities are already nonsense.<p>In sum: for an essay titled &quot;Earnestness,&quot; it&#x27;s a shockingly dishonest rhetorical tactic.')
