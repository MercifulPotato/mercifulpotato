In general, folks with money are able to have things like comfortable shoes, entertainment, and not worry about their electricity being turned off if they have a flat tire.<p>Every &quot;windfall&quot; takes care of a need, makes you more secure with things like food and shelter, or gives you some mental relief by providing a few moments of entertainment. There is no saving for those other things if you have been walking to work because you can&#x27;t afford to fix the flat tire or if you&#x27;ve been in pain due to poor shoes.<p>There is no advice on how to afford things if you only have $5 extra at the end of the month and definitely no advice on how to afford life if you simply don&#x27;t earn enough. &quot;Saving a windfall&quot; is pointless if you have a hospital bill that is threatening to sue and deduct the money from your paycheck.<p>I am not sure you really understand poverty.')
