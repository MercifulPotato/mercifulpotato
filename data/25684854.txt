That&#x27;s how eg reduce or map or filter work in Python.<p>That holds in general for combinators.<p>Haskell is actually a bad example to use here, because the tail recursive foldl is rarely used.  Thanks to laziness, foldr is usually preferred, and it is not tail recursive.<p>OCaml or Scheme are perhaps better references?  Especially given the history of Javascript: the author originally wanted to write a Lisp, but got told by management to add curly braces.')
