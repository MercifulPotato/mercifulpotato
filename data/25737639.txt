Later it was ruled that 2 of those nominations were unconstitutional (I think because they were for justices who&#x27;s terms expired after the new legislature was seated), but the newly elected Law and Justice government refused to seat any of them and elected their own slate of 5 justices. When the constitutional tribunal refused to include those 5 justices until the dispute was resolved, rather than back down the new government raised the threshold to conduct business so that the new justices would have to be included and even worse chose to interpret a clause requiring a majority to mean a supper majority and gave themselves the power to remove justices.<p>The constitutional tribunal ruled this new law unconstitutional, but because that ruling was not made under the new rules introduced by the again according to them unconstitutional law the new government ignored it.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to pass unconstitutional laws and quite another to pass unconstitutional laws and refuse to listen to listen when you&#x27;re called out on them')
