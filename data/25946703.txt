The car design as a whole. A car designed with a bomb in it is a different design than the other civics. Do you not understand that?<p>This makes my point even more clearly.<p>If you have Civics with bombs and civics without, and the ones without have a safety result that is higher overall, even if there is some arguable benefit of the bomb (ie, less likely to be carjacked?) if the design of the cars without the bomb results in a better safety result, those cars should be preferred.<p>I&#x27;m going to leave this here I think - I&#x27;m not sure who is on HN anymore, but it does feel like the actual engineering type folks are a smaller group, and so normal tradeoff analysis has turned into the outraged &#x2F; condemn them type yelling.')
