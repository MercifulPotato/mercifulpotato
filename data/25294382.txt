Particularly mentioning the Mac Pro in the same paragraph.<p>Apple&#x27;s M1 isn&#x27;t competing with higher end Intel&#x2F; AMD desktop class CPUs with external GPUs. The M1 is a laptop CPU, designed for good performance with good thermals and excellent battery life. It will be interesting to see what they come up with over the next couple years to replace the CPU in the iMac and Mac Pro. But that is next year.')
