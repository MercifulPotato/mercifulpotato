However, it needs to convert this common number format to 32-bit integers in order to perform bit-wise operations. Conversions from double-precision float to integer, as well as the need to check if the number converted really was an integer, are therefore relatively common occurrences.<p>&gt; Armv8.3-A adds instructions that convert a double-precision floating-point number to a signed 32-bit integer with round towards zero. Where the integer result is outside the range of a signed 32-bit integer (DP float supports integer precision up to 53 bits), the value stored as the result is the integer conversion modulo 2^32, taking the same sign as the input float.<p>The semantics of numbers in JavaScript behave in a specific way. Since we are talking about numbers, it hardly gets more low-level and thus it makes good sense to design ALU operations targeting common numerical operations.')
