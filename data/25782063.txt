Two jobs (and&#x2F;or extreme overtime) for both people to make rent, home ownership rates dropped because even simple homes run up for well over a million dollars, 2008ff&#x2F;corona have caused an immense wage depression, and people regularly go to gofundme for medical issues or go bankrupt.<p>Add to that: highly processed, unhealthy food is way cheaper than fresh, selfmade food, and people living paycheck to paycheck can&#x27;t afford bulk purchases or Whole Foods. The effect of food on health is more than sufficiently documented.<p>That is an immense mental toll, and not just in the US but worldwide.')
