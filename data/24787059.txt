Even if half of the things they say are true - putting anyone in camps for sporting a beard or praying in public, forced prison labour, physical torture, separating new borns and kids from parents in camp, sending kids to brainwashing schools, sexual abuse, organ harvesting etc - it&#x27;s enough to make anyone feel disgusted at this state of affairs.<p>But the west won&#x27;t care because of the ethnicity and religions of the victims just doesn&#x27;t cause as much outrage as it should because the victims aren&#x27;t white or christians. I know some of you will outraged at this suggestion but even Hollywood knows this - that&#x27;s why the in one of the Rambo movies, where he is in Myanmar &#x2F; Burma, the victims are Christians (instead of highlighting the real victims there, the Rohingya muslims facing persecutions - another genocide that the west prefers to turn a blind eye to).')
