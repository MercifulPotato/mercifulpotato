Item(by='mtmail', descendants=None, kids=[24963194], score=None, time=1604270077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963082, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;showhn.html</a> lists sign-up pages and newsletters as off-topic. Even with zero comments there was the chance it was deemed not a fit for the Show HN category.<p>It&#x27;s curious that on the one hand founders are told to start with something super basic to check user interest, and a landing page promising something (which may or may not exist) is such an option. On the other hand Show HN requires something ready and filter submission that only promise but hide the product.<p>Link to the archives helps, removing Show HN, too.')
