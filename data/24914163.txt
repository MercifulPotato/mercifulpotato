I don&#x27;t mean to imply pure mathematics shouldn&#x27;t be studied, only that I don&#x27;t believe math was a time waster for me.<p>&gt; According to whom?<p>I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of very good mathematicians, including people who&#x27;ve studied and collaborated with people in the HoTT orbit, and people from many other subfields. I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have exact quantitative data for you.<p>&gt; They are in the minority. Again, if you&#x27;re arguing about consensus you can&#x27;t just point to one or two individuals and say &quot;look! They agree with me!&quot; For goodness&#x27; sake, the thread your referring to is well-known partially because it was controversial.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re in the minority. Also, there&#x27;s way more than one relevant thread. That particular fight was litigated over <i>years</i>.<p>&gt; The content of Lurie&#x27;s comment and yours are quite different.<p>He makes many <i>comments</i> on that post. I invite you to read them all. Certainly, I&#x27;m not just regurgitating what he says there, but it does provide an example of a top mathematician expressing skepticism about the entire enterprise.')
