Using this one as an example, I disagree with many of the assertions in the first section, some in the second, and find the third to be quite solid.<p>In particular, his take on the nature&#x2F;nurture aspect of thinking for yourself is something I disagree with. He specifically notes that he got a fair amount of fastidiousness about the truth from his father and cites high school as a bad place for independent-minded people due to social mechanics – both things that I feel point in the other direction.<p>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that most education systems beat the curiosity out of children with great effectiveness and encourage conformism, and given the lack of classes like philosophy and critical thinking, thinking for yourself has become something mostly passed from parents to children because the parents that have it find it important that their children learn it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything stopping a great portion of the population learning to evaluate information they receive critically, or qualify the quality of their own knowledge – in fact I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not only possible but becoming essential, as these seeming once-a-generation satanic panics are beginning to tire me out.')
