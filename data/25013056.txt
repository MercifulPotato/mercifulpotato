You&#x27;re going to find content on there long before it hits anywhere else - if it hits anywhere else to begin with. Even &#x2F;pol&#x2F; itself, prior to the 2016 election, had plenty of interesting discussion. Hopefully once this drama blows over it will return to a more nuanced place. As for Vice trying to paint &#x2F;pol&#x2F; as this ultra-edgy super radical place, I can&#x27;t help but laugh at how hard they&#x27;re trying. It&#x27;s a board full of early 20-something year old shitposters. Give up the nonsense RWDS-tier fearmongering please.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6747373" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6747373</a>, which is as valid today as it was back then.
