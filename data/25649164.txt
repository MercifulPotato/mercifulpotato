I&#x27;ve seen many product teams create personas or jobs to be done that literally come from their own idea of what &quot;someone like that&quot; or &quot;someone in this role&quot; would need. Conversely, when we start with the idea that we <i>don&#x27;t</i> know, define a customer and then ask them unbiased and non-leading questions about what they have done (NOT what they &#x27;want&#x27;), it doesn&#x27;t matter as much whether the framework is personas, JTBD, or any other approach.')
