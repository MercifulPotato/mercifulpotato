I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s why presidents and senators care. Also, you should care about all the jobs FS creates both at the top and further down. Without financial services not only would your taxes go up, you wouldn&#x27;t get half as good a mortgage and there would be a lot fewer jobs across the economy...<p>Edit:<p>The only examples of account closures I can find are either for right wing groups (HSBC closed a load of those) or 1 democrat in Florida whose account was closed after she was told they couldn&#x27;t accept cannabis cash and she said she&#x27;d pay that in anyway...')
