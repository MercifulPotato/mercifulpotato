Saying inflation is 2% instead of 7% can be seen as &quot;insisting there&#x27;s no inflation&quot;.<p>I.e. the statement was a bit of hyperbole to indicate that the ECB is hiding or misrepresenting the real rate of inflation.<p>And without more detailed info, hiding&#x2F;excluding inflation increases in one of the biggest expenses that people have to account for in their daily life seems like confusion of the highest order.')
