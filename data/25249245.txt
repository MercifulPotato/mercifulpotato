It has been doing really well. In march of 2020, we invested modest sums of our own money (in the 50k). Today we trade around 1B per day (or 3 to 7% of binance futures volume depending on volatility).<p>We incorporated a company in July in France. Now, we want to exit France and live somewhere else, both personally and to continue our business. In the past two weeks, we moved to Hungary and I am now seriously questioning if it was a good idea.<p>Our respective goals in ~1 year: My partner just wants to exit as some point and live another life. I want to create an AI&#x2F;ML research lab by reinvesting the profits. This has been my plan all along: I started algo-trading with deep learning as a fancy way to raise money to then do AI research.<p>My criteria for where I want to go:<p><pre><code>  - English speaking country\n  - Availability of talent in the crypto&#x2F;trading space (short term) and AI&#x2F;ML space (long term) for networking and recruiting\n  - Not polluted\n</code></pre>\nMy partner&#x27;s criteria:<p><pre><code>  - Not France\n  - Not Switzerland\n  - Good social life\n</code></pre>\nOur common criteria:<p><pre><code>  - Good corporate + tax law and economic freedom\n  - If possible, not too high cost of living\n  - If possible, sea, mountains and&#x2F;or good weather\n</code></pre>\nWhere would you go ?')
