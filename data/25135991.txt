It made sense. Adwords is an auction. Doubleclick&#x27;s novelties in search ad auctions were proven levers, big levers.<p>The interesting part (to me) was that the auction didn&#x27;t just optimize price. It regulated advertiser behaviour. Explicit feedback. Black box. Commentary on black box. It all played a role influencing advertiser behaviour in an economist&#x2F;regulator way.<p>These days, that would be quaint. Google has the android ecosystem and play store marketplace. Adwords&#x2F;adsense is a market too, one that has been dinged for &gt;$1bn monopolism fines. Youtube is a marketplace. Youtube affect content with monetisation algorithms and policies, the recommendation engine, censorship&#x2F;classification. Appstore. Amazon. Big &quot;markets,&quot; with corporate policies looking increasingly like state-scale economic policies.<p>Even stuff like social media is market-ish. Lots of participants are interacting. Attention&amp; influence stand in for prices, but there are still producers and consumers. Many of them. More than FB can understand in all but the most abstract ways.<p>The search&#x2F;seo&#x2F;antispam codependency was an early exhibit.<p>Anyway.... besides the superficial similarity, I suspect the logic to this new app store policy is more &quot;tax cut&quot; than &quot;price decrease.&quot; My guess: Apple&#x27;s trying &quot;fix market failures&quot; showing up in data.')
