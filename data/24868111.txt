Spring is a bloated mess with lots of legacy &amp; misuse of annotations, a.k.a necromancy.<p>It has somewhat improved with Spring Boot, but still to be avoided.<p>Database layer in Spring, especially if you combine it with the monstrosity called Hibernate, is enough to apply to an insane asylum. Trying to debug what combinations of annotations that work and doesn&#x27;t work is time you could have used writing PHP instead and get results.<p>The idea that you can annotate a SQL schema &amp; query language into a Java class with annotations is one of the most asinine ideas I ever come across.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started on Java collections.')
