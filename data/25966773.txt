It&#x27;s not a secret. It was almost openly said that the best outcome is for Germany and USSR to weaken each other so much, that USA can join later and kill off the significantly weakened party. It didn&#x27;t really matter whether Germany or USSR will win because it was assumed that the winner would be too weakened to fight one more war.<p>USA even secretly helped Germany until 1943.')
