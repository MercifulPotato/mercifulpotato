Rather, you (and the cartoon) are confusing the abstract general principle of free speech, for the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<p>If one steps back and observes this conversation from a disinterested 3rd party perspective, one might notice that these same arguments, based on falsehoods from both sides, reoccur <i>every single time the topic comes up</i>.  And if one exercises this practice over time, across many conversations, one may notice that this same pattern is present <i>always and everywhere</i>.<p>Might a reason that we never seem to move the ball forward on these conversations (or representations in physical reality) be that everyone thinks they&#x27;re talking about &quot;objective reality&quot;, but in fact, each person is actually talking about their individual snapshot (perspective, worldview) of reality?  If this is what was actually happening, what might the conversations look like?  Might they bear an uncanny resemblance to the conversations we see before our very eyes, year after year after year, on topic after topic after topic?<p>Even funnier about the situation is that typically, at least here on HN, most everyone probably has enough depth in psychology to decently realize the degree to which each individual has a &quot;unique&quot; (to put it mildly) perspective on reality.  However, if one is to then consider this, and then observe the nature of the conversations, it appears as if this knowledge is not possessed by people who are arguing over a particular, object level topic (politics, racism, sexism, sexuality, etc).  But while people can realize that individual bias exists <i>in the abstract</i>, they seem curiously (and passionately) unwilling&#x2F;unable to realize (and acknowledge) that <i>it actually comes into play in real world conversations</i>, like this one.<p><i>&quot;Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn&#x27;t mean politics won&#x27;t take an interest in you.&quot;</i><p>- Pericles<p>I think &quot;politics&quot; in the above sentence could be replaced with &quot;reality&quot; and it would fully retain it&#x27;s truth.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_speech#Origins" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Freedom_of_speech#Origins</a><p>Freedom of speech and expression has a long history that predates modern international human rights instruments. It is thought that the ancient Athenian democratic principle of free speech may have emerged <i>in the late 6th or early 5th century BC</i>.  The values of the Roman Republic included freedom of speech and freedom of religion.<p>Concepts of freedom of speech can be found in early human rights documents.  England&#x27;s Bill of Rights 1689 legally established the constitutional right of freedom of speech in Parliament which is still in effect.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_Amendment_to_the_United_...</a><p>The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which regulate an establishment of religion, or that would prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of assembly, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. <i>It was adopted on December 15, 1791</i>, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;5th_century" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;5th_century</a><p>The 5th century is the time period from 401 to 500 Anno Domini (AD) or Common Era (CE) in the Julian calendar.
