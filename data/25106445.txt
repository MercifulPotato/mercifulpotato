Just because &quot;we come from nature&quot;, doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re bound to whatever patterns of behavior we observe in animals, and it especially doesn&#x27;t mean the &quot;nature&quot; tells us what we should or shouldn&#x27;t do. The world of non-human living things is a very bad place to look for lessons in morality.<p>&quot;Humans are different&quot; isn&#x27;t arrogance, it&#x27;s observable reality. And we need some words to separate the categories of &quot;things done &#x2F; caused by humans&quot; vs &quot;things done &#x2F; caused by everything else&quot; - hence the common meaning of &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;nature&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>the building blocks of a human are the same as everything else in the universe (as far as we know).</i><p>Building blocks of everything in the universe are the same, but there&#x27;s still meaningful difference between things.')
