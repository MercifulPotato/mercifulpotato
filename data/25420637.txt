A complete revolution in the way things work for only 7%! I can&#x27;t emphasize how disturbing that is. We have an albeit limited but at least hard datapoint that the current mindset is doomed. In a technical sense, it will indeed be a market and political approach but it will be so different from what most people mean with this phrase (i.e. carbon taxes will fix it, let&#x27;s just carry on as usual but more carefully) that it&#x27;s no longer a meaningful conversation')
