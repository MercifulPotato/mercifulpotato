Bare metal as in: no OS (talk to the hardware registers directly from code), possibly a custom compiler, use all the relevant instructions that your CPU offers you. \nOr at the very least mess with the compiler to optimize it more to the specific make&#x2F;model of the CPU&#x2F;hardware that it will run on?<p>What are the considerations in those companies for or against this?')
