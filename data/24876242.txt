Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=[24876320], score=None, time=1603504072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876032, text='It makes it worse because otherwise they could have argued that the README was separate from the development of the tool itself, so the <i>tool itself</i> wasn&#x27;t intended for violating copyright.<p>By putting the infringing act into the <i>code</i> of the tool itself, they lose the ability to make that argument, and moreover show that the tool was built to infringe copyrights, because clearly they thought it was important enough to be able to infringe copyrights that they created multiple unit tests for it.<p><i>are there any greater damages that aggrieved parties could calculate than the loss of advertising revenue from my repeated viewing of that file?</i><p>The loss of advertising revenue is largely irrelevant unless the RIAA chooses to demonstrate the amount. Copyright law provides statutory damages starting at $750, and for that they just need to show a single infringing act (and for each additional act they prove, they get another $750).<p><i>What incentive is there for me to share this file in violation of copyright if anyone can download a fair use copy for themselves, with the tools provided by youtube-dl? </i><p>You&#x27;re assuming a fair use case for using youtube-dl to download a copy of a licensed music video. But fair use is <i>defense</i> to a claim of violating copyright, so you need to show <i>why</i> your use is a fair use, you can&#x27;t just say &quot;fair use&quot; as if it were a magic spell that makes your legal problems go away. And generally, it would be difficult to prove fair use for any of the content covered by an RIAA license because they make that content available for use offline, time-shifted, etc...they simply require that you pay for that.')
