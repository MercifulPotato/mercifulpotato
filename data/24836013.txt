But this was a profound separation from tradition and I sold my shares on learning of the new HQ.<p>The problem is that real engineering often absorbs &quot;the fluffy stuff&quot; in hardware. Server composition with independent subsystems accessible over the network is such a compression of OS services in controllers. This is when the value added IP gets recaptured, particularly in standards dependant technology which enables you to play snakes and ladders across the ecosystem board.<p>Why is the IP element to close only in 2025? Without looking, I suspect that Intel has booked some very high goodwill and other intangible values on the NAND IP that realistically are wishful thinking about that fluffy stuff.')
