To my understanding, there are still laws such as the European packaging &amp; packaging waste legislation (PPWD) that require registration in each country you&#x27;re selling to. The exact law differs from nation to nation as well, so you still require knowledge about each jurisdiction before you can safely sell to other EU members.<p>Also, while sending products directly to consumers shouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue, I would imagine that there is some re-packaging &#x2F; re-labeling needed if you&#x27;d actually want to have your German product in the supermarkets of Spain.')
