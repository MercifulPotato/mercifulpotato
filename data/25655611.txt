Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609920415, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651998, text='&gt;The blunt truth is that arbitrary lives are probably nearly valueless and certainly worth less than $1000. I have tested this hypothesis by describing GiveWell&#x27;s mathematics to people at varying stages before they would spend money similar to that: in every case, people choose to spend the money rather than save arbitrary life.<p>Yeah it is pretty obvious that the value doesn&#x27;t lie in the person but rather the relationships. In that context a job is just a beneficial relationship between an employee and employer. Parents and children form a strong relationship. Same with friends.<p>The idea that you value your own life and thus it gains inherent worth doesn&#x27;t work out because how are you going to pay for that value if not from a currently ongoing or previous relationship? Are billionaires really a million times more productive than the average worker? Did they really do everything themselves?')
