I think it&#x27;s fair to say there&#x27;s no way Apple is paying anything close to $0.33 for those many, many, many transactions, losing $0.03 on each one. If I had to take a wild shot in the dark, I&#x27;d guess Apple is paying $0.05 to $0.10 for those.<p>Of course this is part of the problem: We can&#x27;t even properly evaluate the situation because this side of it is an opaque black box.')
