Item(by='lmeyerov', descendants=None, kids=[25471323], score=None, time=1608299560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465950, text='typing pandas seems like an r&amp;d-level problem as it seems quite close to tricky areas like row types &#x2F; dependent types that mostly only work in theory<p>attempting manual workarounds  like pure nominal typing for it as you describe is against the grain of a type system and pushes a lot of work to the user. We just... don&#x27;t. We stick with class (&#x27;pd DataFrame&#x27;), and the one extension we are thinking is Index, while getting into actual columns gets into a mess quite quickly.<p>I tried to engage some PL researchers on this awhile back but no go. IMO would be a great project for most type system  research students.')
