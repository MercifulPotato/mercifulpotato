Item(by='cookiengineer', descendants=None, kids=[24727776], score=None, time=1602229331, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723695, text='Someone could also argue your analogy with a cookbook is wrong, because if we talk about headers and APIs, it&#x27;s more like Oracle claiming that their stove&#x27;s interface to the pot is copyrightable.<p>How is heat transferred to the pot? From the stove to the pot, this is the API, and how it&#x27;s implemented doesn&#x27;t matter. Oracle claims that this specific thing, that you turn on any button and make it heat up is copyrightable.<p>But we all know that a stove is useless without that API. We would have to buy a whole new kitchen equipment for all stoves that we are going to buy.<p>A further question is: When will it end with copyright claims? I mean, at somepoint somebody will claim that the effing powerplug is also copyrightable. But we all know that nobody (speaking of % of the population) even has the skills to connect a device without a power plug without potentially harming themselves.<p>All technology is useless without APIs. Nonetheless I think that copyright laws is essentially full of flaws here, because if we focus on speech alone (of which most copyright laws are based on), someone might even argue that specific words are copyrightable if they are &quot;uncommon enough&quot;.')
