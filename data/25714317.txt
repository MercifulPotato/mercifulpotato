Keep in mind these exams can be four hours long.<p>Don&#x27;t recall for sure if it&#x27;s a CYA policy or the state law, tend to think it was the latter.  They can claim it&#x27;s not allowed, but more savvy students will know better and you have to allow them. You can however have a TA accompany them and wait outside the stall. You can also make them leave their phone but of course they can keep another phone on them.')
