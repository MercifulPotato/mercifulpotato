I&#x27;ve had lounge access a few  times because my father in law used to travel from California to Asia every other month for a large part of his career, so now he has lifetime lounge access and can bring guests.  Sometimes when we travel together some of us get bumped up to first.  And when my dad was flying cross country every week for work, he was almost always sitting in first class on upgrade.<p>But we&#x27;re definitely not going to be flying private. :)')
