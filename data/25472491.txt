At best this is an unattainable ideal that&#x27;s too pure, impractical and abstracted from the problems developers need to solve. A system of single function processes communicating with a message passing framework is effectively an actor model. And while the actor model is a beautiful way of solving problems, slavish devotion to it will become a hinderance quickly.<p>Practically &#x27;serverless&#x27; is a kind of an operating system to rent. Rather than Linux and Nginx managing the process invocation, you devolve that to the cloud provider that shares that resource (as if you&#x27;re on shared hosting).<p>Often people fail to see this and think &#x27;serverless&#x27; demands a new architecture, when there&#x27;s absolutely no reason to. I always get a bit scared when I see a &#x27;serverless&#x27; project; usually the developers throw away all of their conventions leaving an unstructured incoherent mess.')
