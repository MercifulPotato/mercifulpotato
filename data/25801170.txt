It becomes really messy moving all that state around.<p>Still in its infancy but we’ve settled on a model where we use Hasura to sync the whole datastore to the frontend as a mobx graph. It’s relatively easy to then drive the frontend off layers of computations on that graph. We’ve also put a transaction layer on mutations of the models so they’re automatically batched and sent as a single request &#x2F; dB transactions.<p>It’s liberating to get to a place where I can just update models in the frontend and have that reflected everywhere because, as you point out, there’s enough to coordinate in all the bits you have to mutate.<p>Edit: we borrowed the idea from how linear.app does it')
