We have a <i>thriving</i> PC ecosystem with Linux and BSDs, most of which I would consider no less secure than my iPhone; in fact, those are the platforms on which we backup our private data.<p>The issue has been the incredibly fragmented landscape of mobile computing. The free mobile ecosystem has never had the chance to mature because it did not have a reliable foundation (like PC-compatible desktops[0]) to continue building upon.
