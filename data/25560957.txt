The entire point of these questions is to reduce the risk of heart disease.<p>February is National Heart Health month in the USA!  Americans dedicate an entire month to talking about heart disease.  A time in which we are inundated with news reports and ads about how to improve our overall well-being and reduce our risk of heart attacks.<p>The American Heart Association is one of the most influential non-profits in the USA and they run ad campaigns, lobby politicians and healthcare providers, finance research, and issue guidelines for improving cardiac health for everyone.<p>The same is true for cancer.  There&#x27;s a National Cancer Awareness Day in the USA.  There are several high-profile non-profits that raise awareness and finance research into cancer.  Medical professionals have guidelines for when cancer screenings should be performed, etc, etc.<p>Cancer is not ignored; heart disease is not ignored.
