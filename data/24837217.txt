I&#x27;ll give you one guess which companies the hundreds of millions in highway and infrastructure &quot;improvements&quot; contracts went to. (Also, why did we even need to do those &quot;improvements&quot;?) Don&#x27;t even get me started on the 3&#x2F;4 of a billion dollar loan that the small suburb of Mt Pleasant took out. Which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, in a non-corrupt world, Mt Pleasant would have taken out a loan, and Mt Pleasant would have to pay it back. But in Wisconsin, Scott Walker, to help out his buddies down there, made a guarantee that tax payers everywhere except Mt Pleasant would have to pay back the loan. So now people in Dalton, Fox Lake, and Eau Claire have to pay the loan that people in Mt Pleasant <i>unilaterally</i> took out.<p>We can&#x27;t even unwind that guarantee so that the people of Mt Pleasant have to pay their own bills. Because when we kicked Scott Walker out, his buddies in the legislature stripped the new governor we voted in of any power to unwind said deal before he could take office. Corruption in Wisconsin runs deep my friend.<p>So believe me, there was &quot;gain&quot; by corrupt parties all over the state. Just because Foxconn only breaks even, doesn&#x27;t mean no one made money. It only means Foxconn won&#x27;t <i>lose</i> money. The losers are all the taxpayers of Wisconsin, except for those taxpayers favored by Scott Walker.')
