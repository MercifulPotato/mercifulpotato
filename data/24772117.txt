Whether companies or teams are prepared for remote colleagues or not it&#x27;s up to them.<p>Yes, pandemic has made everyone remote but we can&#x27;t just ignore the fact that Bay area was paying premium because they wanted &quot;locals&quot; (or at least those willing to become locals). Otherwise why bother restrict hiring to a single region&#x2F;country&#x2F;continent?<p>I know that it feels anachronistic to fight remote teams right now, but the truth is, regardless of the merits of both form of working some managers&#x2F;teams&#x2F;companies have preference for one or the other, simple as that.<p>Employees also don&#x27;t automatically become ideal remote colleagues overnight. So, maybe it is a good idea to attach a cost to the change from being in office to being remote so that the decision balances both ways.')
