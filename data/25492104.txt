Before Mt Gox was shut down I was trading on a couple of tertiary small exchanges and at the time there was a lot of talk of arbitrage between different exchanges and how transaction latency and fees made it very risky at best and a losing proposition in most cases. But what I was wondering about is whether in a situation like that (one large exchange dominating the market, several smaller exchanges trading the same commodity) if it was possible to use the large exchange as a sort of oracle. Essentially my hypothesis was that Mt Gox sets the price and other exchanges follow on a delay so if I watch Mt Gox I can predict where the price on the secondary exchanges will go a few seconds to a few minutes ahead of it moving. I ran a bunch of historical data through some basic analysis scripts and noticed that indeed there was a pattern but when I actually implemented a bot to trade BTC it lost money more often than not. I am curious if (a) that idea has any validity and (b) was me losing money on this strategy due to latency and implementation errors or due to some fundamental principle of trading that I am missing.')
