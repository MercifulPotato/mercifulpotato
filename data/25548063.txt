For example, if you asked me if I&#x27;d rather meet my best possible self, or have my arm broken with a bat, it would be a no-brainer.  I&#x27;m actually pretty curious to meet my best possible self and would probably pay some amount of money to do so, whereas I&#x27;d very much prefer to never have my arm broken again.  And being hit with a bat is one of the most banal forms of suffering you could imagine.<p>I get that it is trying to say something abstract, like, you could be a lot better than what you are, but it just sounds so incredibly ignorant of how horrible things could be that it irritates me.')
