Item(by='deskamess', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609963769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25661474, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GNQRGohdW9Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GNQRGohdW9Y</a><p>Listening in to the stream it seems like a woman was shot in the neck once she went in&#x2F;broke into the capitol building. Someone who was with her looked in and saw that. Again, this is as reported in the above stream - no visual or other verification provided.<p>Edit: modified &#x27;someone who was with her outside the window&#x27; to &#x27;someone who was with her&#x27;. He did an interview on camera and stated that they did enter the building. Based on what he said I would categorize it as a &#x27;forced&#x27; entry with warnings not to proceed further when the event happened.')
