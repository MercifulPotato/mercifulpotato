Say what you want about Lewandowski, maybe he was the biggest scumbag, maybe he&#x27;s worthless as a scientist and does not know the derivative of x squared, maybe (most likely) he stole millions of lines of cutting edge code from Google. But he did not physically harm anyone. He did not even cause monetary harm like Bernie Madoff. It&#x27;s very doubtful he even caused any psychological harm to anyone. Does he deserve to be sentenced as a criminal?<p>Well, we all know IP is taken seriously in the US. We know cases as Sergey Aleynkov [1]  and  Aaron Swartz [2], cases that we consider despicable, where corporations or prosecutors pursued with an absolutely terrifying vengeance the minor transgressions of some unlucky but quite harmless members of our society.<p>I for one think Lewandowski (and other people like him) does not deserve the ordeal suffered by Aleynkov or Swarz. If I were in the jury, I would give serious consideration to jury nullification.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. In terms of civil penalties, I say let him be shirtless. Let him drive a Yugo, if the allegations against him turn out to be true. Google gave him a $100 million bonus, and he took some code and ran to the competition. Confiscate everything he&#x27;s got. He doesn&#x27;t deserve it.<p>But don&#x27;t put him in prison.<p>Trump did many, many bad things. But pardoning Lewandowski was a good thing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sergey_Aleynikov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sergey_Aleynikov</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aaron_Swartz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aaron_Swartz</a>')
