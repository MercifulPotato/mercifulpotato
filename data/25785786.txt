I&#x27;m from Spain and in my country drunk fighting is something that mostly British and German tourist do. We don&#x27;t understand why, we may get super drunk and have super heated arguments, but it&#x27;s quite uncommon we will get to a physical fight. But in the areas around the Mediterranean Sea full of tourists, fights are a daily occurrence.')
