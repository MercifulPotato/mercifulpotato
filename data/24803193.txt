You have to deal with the current, deal with the fact that wood floats, deal with a long post, have to have a means of driving it down far enough, etc. I imagine that nowadays they&#x27;d use a pile driver on a huge barge with engines that can automatically compensate for the current, but I can&#x27;t imagine what the equivalent was back then.')
