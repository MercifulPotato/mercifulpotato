Part personal account, part research summary, the book covers a lot of the world&#x27;s ancient breathing traditions (including Wim Hof and his antecedents), as well as what modern science has to say about them.<p>As with many other aspects of holistic health, it&#x27;s incredible how Western medicine has ignored verifiable scientific evidence about the wide range of health benefits one can derive from these breathing techniques.<p>A smattering of advice from the book:<p>* Breathe through your nose, NOT your mouth (except when talking).<p>* Breathe slowly, softly, not (necessarily) deeply. Optimal breath rate is roughly 5.5s inhale, 5.5s exhale, 5.5 breaths per minute, 5.5 L of air inhaled.<p>* * Many people tend to over-breathe, which has a number of detriments, including stimulating anxiety.<p>* As with most aspects of health, the body does best with most-of-the-time low stress (see above &quot;Breath slowly&quot;) punctuated by short intense intervals of high stress. Wim Hof breathing is the high stress workout that exercises your breathing system and builds breath flexibility.<p>* Chew tough stuff, exercise your jaw. This can help build wider mouths (new bone growth!) and open up your airways.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Breath-New-Science-Lost-Art&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0735213615" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Breath-New-Science-Lost-Art&#x2F;dp&#x2F;073521...</a>')
