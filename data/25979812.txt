If you are studying in Stanford and can literally walk into the office of professor X and tell him about your ideas (which worked pretty well for Elizabeth Holmes and professor Channing Robertson but that&#x27;s a different story) you have an enormous competitive advantage. And if you have a Stanford professor on your side, it&#x27;s pretty easy to open doors to other influential people.<p>On the other hand, if you tell your idea some stranger on the Internet... chances are much lower that you will find the right people.')
