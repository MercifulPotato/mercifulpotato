We frequently got complaints from customers accusing the AI of cheating by getting favorable dice rolls. This wasn&#x27;t possible, as the dice roll algorithm literally didn&#x27;t know which player it was rolling for (let alone the context of the overall game). Instead, the complainers didn&#x27;t understand that a chief strategy of backgammon is to set yourself up to be able to take advantage of as many different dice rolls as possible.')
