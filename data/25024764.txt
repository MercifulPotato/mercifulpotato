Item(by='tuatoru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604831996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023083, text='If Apple or Dell sold 36V 10A power bricks, then maybe.<p>The ones that I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t put out their claimed current, lose regulation badly at high load, and put a <i>lot</i> of hash on the DC rails. Seriously ugly.  Opening them up, the circuit design often looks like it comes from the 1980s.  Physical design usually doesn&#x27;t meet standards for HV separation and creepage.<p>Rather than a linear regulator, lots of filtering (a few 100nF ceramics and a few millifarads of smoothing) would help. And a high-powered TVS or two for when the power brick dies, as it will.')
