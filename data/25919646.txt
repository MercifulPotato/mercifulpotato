That&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re nice, but because they&#x27;re legally barred from showing &quot;real&quot; ads (only commercial, free OTA channels can do that; gov-owned public access only shows ads for their own shows, same reason). Plus those ads are just between programs and never in the middle of one. They still get very repetitive, though.')
