You cannot determine the information content of a sequence of numbers in isolation.  You can only determine information content of a system with respect to a model that tells you how to use the state of the system to distinguish between a number of <i>possible</i> states.  The information content of the system is the log of the number of possible states from which the state of the system allows you to select one.<p>Yes, algorithmic information theory is a thing.  But neither it nor your example refute what I said (because what I said is in fact true).')
