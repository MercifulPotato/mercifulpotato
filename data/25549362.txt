Those tests carry a non-negligible risk of miscarriage, so they are generally only prescribed if other tests show that a fetus is high-risk for one of various disorders. Furthermore, some women choose not to get the test even if they are high-risk, because they would never terminate. I’m not sure it’s possible to estimate the ‘true’ termination rate using these statistics.')
