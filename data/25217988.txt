It&#x27;s <i></i>very<i></i> similar to blaze, which outside of Google is a good and bad thing.<p>The good is that I find BUILD files easier to read&#x2F;reason about than Makefiles and it also is multilingual.<p>The bad is external dependency is hard, especially if you want to take advantage of all of bazel&#x27;s features like hermetic builds. Most larger C and C++ don&#x27;t use bazel to build and don&#x27;t have BUILD files, so you end up maintaining your own build system for that project OR use something like [this][1].<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bazelbuild&#x2F;rules_foreign_cc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bazelbuild&#x2F;rules_foreign_cc</a>')
