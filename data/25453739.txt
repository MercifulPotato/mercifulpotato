First, &quot;copyright industries give us [(the United States)] one of our most significant trade surpluses.&quot; Second, the recently enacted legislation in the European Union had extended copyright there for 20 years, and so EU works would be protected for 20 years longer than US works if the US did not enact similar term extensions. Howard Coble also stated that it was good for consumers since &quot;When works are protected by copyright, they attract investors who can exploit the work for profit.&quot;<p>&gt; The term extension portion was supported by Songwriters Guild of America, National Academy of Songwriters, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar Association, the Recording Industry Association of America, National Music Publishers Association, the Information Technology Association of America and others.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_Term_Extension_Act</a><p>The E.U. extension pertained to recordings of performances and was meant to harmonize  with the copyright terms of authors for whom a copyright term of 70 years already applied.<p>Moreover, copyright protection in the E.U. doesn&#x27;t take the &quot;date of publication&quot; as starting point, but the year of death of the author. It means that in the E.U., to this day, works - works of art, music, photographs, posters, postcards,... - made in the 19th century can still be protected if the author passed after 1950. It also means that clearing copyright in the E.U. is a huge obstacle for archives and libraries when when it comes to opening up their collections.<p>The main incentives for copyright protection are economic and geostrategic. Paradoxically, in a global, digitized world, copyright protections have gained even more strategic value in trade agreements.')
