In both cases I wanted to stub out the persistence tier of a Node.js application when test driving the API. I verified the real and fake implementations by running the same tests against them. The first application was quite small, and the process worked well, although it did feel somewhat onerous to implement the fake. However, the second application was more complex, calling for some PostgreSQL specific features which were difficult to implement in the fake. In the end I abandoned the approach for the second application, settling on slower, duplication heavy API tests which used the real persistence tier. I&#x27;d love to hear how others solve this problem without mocks, which I agree tend towards brittle, tightly coupled tests with a poorer signal to noise ratio.')
