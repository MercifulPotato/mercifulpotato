If I had a staoshi for each person that said it would go down!  It will probably go down. It will probably go back up. It will always go back up, as long as there is a general belief in the population that the tech is worth the cost of running it.<p>Bitcoin is valuable because it represents an immutable data store which is difficult to change - much like &quot;stocks&quot;. The value an immutable-like data stores presents to some business models is more valuable than the idea of publicly traded stock to others.<p>For example, I could hook up a Bitcoin transaction to this POST, and do it without any authentication or credit card number, yet it would still be paid and secure. That is available to everyone today in the form of Lightning. Once more business models, such as those backed by ML adopt these types of micropayments, there will be no stopping Bitcoin, whether you lick stocks or not.')
