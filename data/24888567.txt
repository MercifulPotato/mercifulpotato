We can sit here and argue and say they should have done this and they should have done that, but that doesn&#x27;t help anybody who wants support for them at this current moment.<p>And please don&#x27;t exaggerate, non-GTK applications do work in GNOME. Qt5 has native CSDs that will show up in GNOME. If the application is a game or something that doesn&#x27;t support CSD then the experience is somewhat degraded but they still work. You can resize and move any window by holding Super and Left&#x2F;Middle clicking. I won&#x27;t pretend the situation is ideal but I also don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s totally unusable or on a bad trajectory at the momentâ€”like I said the other libraries are working on getting CSD support too.')
