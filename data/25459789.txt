Here&#x27;s some relevant excerpts from the decision from the US Court of Appeals:<p>&gt; A district court may consider as part of its sentencing determination uncharged conduct proven by a preponderance of the evidence as long as that conduct does not increase either the statutory minimum or maximum available punishment.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Here, the six drug-related deaths (and more importantly, Ulbricht&#x27;s attempted murders for hire) were uncharged facts that did not increase either the statutory twenty-year minimum or the maximum life sentence applicable to the crimes of which he was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, by the jury. [1]<p>And later:<p>&gt; Thus, even without considering that enhancement, the drug convictions yielded an offense level of 48, which is higher than the maximum offense level recognized by the Guidelines, for which a sentence of life imprisonment is recommended even for someone who, like Ulbricht, has no prior criminal convictions.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Accordingly, while a life sentence for selling drugs alone would give pause, we would be hard put to find such a sentence beyond the bounds of reason for drug crimes of this magnitude.[67] But the facts of this case involve much more than simply facilitating the sale of narcotics. [2]<p>To summarize, <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey</i> says that facts not found by a jury cannot be used to raise sentence maximums.  However, sentencing guidelines for the crimes Ulbricht was convicted of give a maximum life sentence.  Therefore, using uncharged facts to inform sentencing is permissible because it doesn&#x27;t actually increase the maximum possible sentence.  Had evidence to those things not been presented at trial, it&#x27;s possible (probable?) that his sentence would have been shorter.<p>Personally, this seems problematic as while it doesn&#x27;t technically increase the sentencing maximum, it allows the judge to bypass the jury to determine guilt on certain facts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=7379835016583659897#p128" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=737983501658365...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=7379835016583659897#p130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar_case?case=737983501658365...</a>')
