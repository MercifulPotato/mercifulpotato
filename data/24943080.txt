If that&#x27;s correct, I think that&#x27;s a reasonable argument but I&#x27;m not really concerned about whether Google as a business will fail 5+ years from today. I would honestly be shocked if they failed in less than 5 years, so I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to take their compensation.<p>This is all hypothetical of course. I have no idea what their work-life balance is nor have I tried applying to them')
