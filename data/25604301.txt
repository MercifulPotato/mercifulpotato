You&#x27;re always relying on the maintainers and contributors to resolve bugs you may encounter. But because its open source, anyone can simply open a PR with the fix.<p>&gt; Using it means your code will only be as efficient as the library.<p>Certainly true, but for most people and projects speed of delivery is more important than speed of the application. We take on some tech debt now to get to market more quickly and address that tech debt later on.<p>One cannot take responsibility for an individual&#x27;s misuse of your product. If people use this library incorrectly, then its not really the author&#x27;s fault...<p>I&#x27;d hope the author added some guidelines of how to use this and wrote the library in a way that encourages proper and good use to minimize incorrect use but its on the consumer to integrate the library correctly')
