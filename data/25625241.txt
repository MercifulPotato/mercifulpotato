If someone starts telling me the &quot;how&quot; before the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; I interrupt and steer the conversation there first. If you really want to be telling someone only the &quot;how&quot; I&#x27;m not the right person to employ, and I&#x27;m clear about this early on.<p>The very few times I&#x27;ve got in trouble with this there&#x27;s been some hidden objective or constraint I wasn&#x27;t made aware of, and the discussion I have afterwards is that is not compatible with my way of working. This has always resolved successfully and I&#x27;ve never had this issue with someone more than once.')
