I saw all these comments last night about Workflowy and figured I’d give it a try today. Within 5 minutes, I’ve gotten completely lost and frustrated by what should be a simple outliner.<p>The desktop site is a disaster on mobile, which doesn’t need to be the case in 2020, but I went ahead and installed the mobile app anyway. Aside from entering text, indent, and outdent, I’m finding nothing intuitive. I’ve finally given up on trying to drag a bullet — I finally figured out that you have to hold down on one, but when I drag and release it somewhere, it just reappears where it started. There’s no help or documentation available anywhere in the app. Much of the UI consists of unlabeled icons — what does a pencil in a square do? Apparently it adds a note underneath the current bullet.. I see from the “context menu” (swipe left, click three dots) that this is called “Add note”, and shows a keyboard shortcut next to it — shift return. Press shift return.. creates a new bullet instead of adding a note.<p>I feel like I must be looking at a different app. I wouldn’t describe this as “really, really good”, I would describe it as something I am giving up on and uninstalling.')
