I already answered this, so you&#x27;ll have to go back to my earlier comment (this might be my last comment as I won&#x27;t keep repeating myself): any system (be it Google&#x27;s or anyone else&#x27;s) that penalizes you equally regardless of whether the recipient&#x27;s addressed existed 1 day vs. never existed <i>is just plain trash</i>. A sender that attempts delivery to an address that accepted their email a day ago is <i>obviously</i> unlikely to be a spammer; there&#x27;s no justification for treating them as one. It is <i>absolutely unreasonable</i> to interpret the sentence this way. Just as it&#x27;s unreasonable to interpret <i>&quot;the mailman shouldn&#x27;t knock a second time when he&#x27;s told the recipient has moved&quot;</i> as <i>&quot;I should never open the door for the mailman ever again if he does so&quot;</i>.')
