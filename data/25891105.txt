That way strings and bytearrays can continue to be different views on the same data. The great divide between byte- and string-data was completely pointless, especially in 2008 when python3 was started because by that time UTF-8 was already firmly established for at least a decade (it would be an excusable design fault only in the 1990&#x27;s).')
