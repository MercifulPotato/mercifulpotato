Is this vaccine really undergoing <i>strictly better</i> testing than all drugs recalled in the past 50 years for serious side effects, for example? Unlike those drugs, this vaccine is being proposed for a huge proportion of the population and moreover it may be proposed for portions of the population who don&#x27;t voluntarily agree to take the risks involved. It&#x27;s quite one thing if a last-resort cancer drug kills 10% of people who take it and quite another thing entirely if this vaccine has long-term deleterious effects for even 0.1% of people who take it.<p>I applaud and thank those who are willing to take these risks on a personal basis for the good of others but that is an entirely different thing than being willing to take those risks myself and a different thing again from supporting force (or even &quot;just&quot; ostracism) on those who are not willing.')
