Swap out the pair programming sessions with sales pitch meetings and this whole process would look like what the best sales people do, right down to using a CRM to note personal details like the applicant’s newborn child.<p>It also seems to stand in contrast to the author’s unusually bad interviewing experiences at other companies. I’m always shocked when people describe interviewing at companies with interviewers who act jaded or annoyed with the interview process. If your interviewers clearly hate their job or hate interacting with you, you probably don’t want to work at those companies.')
