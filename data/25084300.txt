Compared to the rest of the world, the entire left half of the political spectrum is more or less missing in the US.<p>The democrats are a center right party.

It has been a deliberate strategy of the far right to paint the center as &quot;socialism&quot; (which a lot of Americans seem to mistake for communism...), because it makes their ideology seem less extreme. A lot of Americans have fallen for that nonsense, unfortunately. Definitions and framing and perspective matters a lot.')
