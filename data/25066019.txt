It won&#x27;t photograph as well with flash etc. either. And obviously most important: if you have friends who are pretentious enough to turn up at your house wearing sunglasses, it&#x27;ll look good for them too...<p>I get it&#x27;s sort of priced as an intangible piece of art, that is worth wildly different amounts to different people, but to the people it&#x27;s worthwhile to, the difference is everything.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m also a sucker for e-ink. I just love the aesthetic.<p>Thanks for digging into the costs and info then, it&#x27;s been an interesting conversation to follow.')
