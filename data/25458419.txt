It sounds crazy and purely anecdata, but I found that processed organic stuff tend to have less calories than non organic food. I have started eating the less processed variant of food (brown calrose rice, wheat bread, and steel cut oats) and maybe that has helped(?). But one thing I cannot tolerate is whole grain pasta. That stuff taste like cardboard+sand paper to me.')
