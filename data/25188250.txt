That&#x27;s no mean feat.<p>I&#x27;m just kinda curious about some comments on Twitter and here. Ok, the guy made an open source library, with no strings attached, a big company used it for god knows what and acknowledged him. Why would the company give him anything more than acknowledgement? As far as we know they didn&#x27;t demand any updates or support from him, why are they expected to give him freebies, contribute to the code or anything else?')
