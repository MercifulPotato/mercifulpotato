I much prefer writing in backend languages (e.g. python) than in frontend languages (e.g. javascript).<p>And as someone else pointed out, you can&#x27;t enforce security on the frontend.<p>The line is getting blurrier between front and back these days with new frameworks, e.g. React. Personally, I&#x27;m not ready to move away from mature languages generating HTML on the backend, even though it means giving up some interactivity on the frontend.')
