Reality is, _zero_ countries have totally developed under democracy. Ever. Modern India is the first to attempt. You need a certain level of authoritarian &#x2F; state controlled industrial policy and violent enforcement initially to entice FDI with stability. Conditions and bargaining power naturally improves after gaining increasing leverage once investors has commited sufficient sunk cost + creating supply chain inertia. Democracy and corporate&#x2F;colonial trauma has caused India to squandered many opportunities to industrialize due to lack of infrastructure, redtape bureaucracy and grassroots organization.
