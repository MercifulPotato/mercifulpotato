This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified.<p>No, it does not. I come across this false statement again and again. It seems that a lot of developers do not understand what checksums or hashes guarantee and what they absolutely do not guarantee.<p>Let&#x27;s set this once and for all:<p>1. Differing checksums or hashes guarantee that the content is different.\n2. Identical checksums or hashes do not guarantee anything. The content could be identical or not.')
