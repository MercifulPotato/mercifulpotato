What you are really saying is, they don&#x27;t have the same bias as you. As for standards, that&#x27;s really unfair. They have high standards and are much more apt to invite opposing opinions than the NYT, or WaPo. They refused to  endorse Trump in 2016. Good people can disagree with you for real reasons, not because they have lower standards.')
