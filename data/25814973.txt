You need to be big and decently profitable to afford 2+ full time people managing the server hardware purchases, maintenance, updates - same with network.<p>These people need to be 24&#x2F;7 on-call unless you can somehow make your system so fault-tolerant, that it can handle up to 16 hours of downtime without intervention (breaks the second the engineer clocks out, needs to hold its own until they clock back in).<p>Even the two people are a stretch when you need to be 24&#x2F;7, that&#x27;s at least 3 shifts and even then you&#x27;re one flu away from being short-staffed again.<p>So now we&#x27;re at a point where you need to make enough profit to pay 4 competent server engineer&#x27;s salaries just to get out of AWS. Add to that the one-time costs of buying your own servers, setting them up and colocation costs.<p>That&#x27;s a lot.')
