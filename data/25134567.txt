Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605689858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134523, text='&quot;job&quot; is putting it a bit harsh, they&#x27;re providing a voluntary &#x2F; community service, and it&#x27;s not cheap.<p>I&#x27;d like webpages to be pretty eternal, that is, statically rendered in a html file, put on a webserver somewhere that is maintained until perpetuity - you know, like the now famous Space Jam website.<p>But in practice that doesn&#x27;t happen because Reasons. I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s the Internet Archive, and I hope there&#x27;s others, but at the same time I&#x27;m aware that an operation like that is really expensive and not profitable.<p>Edit: I just got a &#x27;thank you&#x27; mail from the IA for donating; apparently it only has 4000 sponsors. If you consider the IA an essential part of the internet, consider pushing a few dollars a month their way. If you work for an internet company, consider a corporate sponsorship. Let that dank investor money flow to something that isn&#x27;t focused on optimizing engagement and ad impressions.<p>For other archiving, I know of some people who have accumulated vast caches of data and information, for example about Playstation games. Amateur archivists. I know one guy who&#x27;s been obsessed with an old PS2 game for years now, he doesn&#x27;t even like the game and the game is objectively bad, but he&#x27;s spent a ton of time on getting all the data out of there; unused content, the content no longer accessible that used to be an online mode, and getting all the rules and things out. To the point where he taught himself coding and wrote a save file editor, I mean the code looks crude, crammed into a single file and very literal, but it works, it can be followed, and it fulfils a purpose.<p>Tl;dr don&#x27;t underestimate individuals with singular, near obsessive interests on the internets. I&#x27;m sure some of you will feel seen.')
