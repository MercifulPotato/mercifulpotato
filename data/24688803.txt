Often times the optimal strategy is to alternate storing and deploying energy on consecutive laps.  So there is a ton of skill involved in staying as close to the driver in front while on a &quot;harvest&quot; lap so that they can pass the driver on the next &quot;deploy&quot; lap.<p>This is just one of the many, many ways that skill comes into play.<p>For more detail, I suggest watching the &quot;track guide&quot; videos by former Champion Nico Rosberg.
