To allow some types of safety-critical software to be written in Rust, the GCC frontend would need to be an independent implementation of Rust, since the relevant specs require multiple independent implementations (so just attaching GCC as a new backend for rustc wouldn&#x27;t work).<p>&gt; The goal is definitely not to have a compiler written in rust that compiles rust code [edit: unless there is an acceptable bootstrap process, and the final compiler produces GNU assembly output that compiles with GNU gas]<p>&gt; The goal is <i>definitely</i> not to have a hard critical dependence on LLVM.<p>&gt; The goal is to have code added, written in c, to the GNU Compiler Collection, which may be found here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org</a> 20 such that developers who are used to gcc may compile rust programs and link them against object files using binutils ld.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;call-for-help-implementing-an-independent-rust-frontend-for-gcc&#x2F;32163&#x2F;104" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;call-for-help-implementing-an-...</a>')
