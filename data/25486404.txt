It&#x27;s also more inefficient during code reviews to have to review N changes in configuration.<p>But, is the end result fast enough for users and is the time needed to develop and maintain it sufficiently low?<p>If the answer is yes, assuming you&#x27;re a foot soldier in the dev brigade, you keep going.<p>It&#x27;s good to reduce the noise. Chuck Yeager started as a mechanic and worked on his own planes when he became a pilot. That made him a better pilot.<p>But, James Hart Wyld was the one concerned about the efficiency of the engine. Chuck just needed to break the sound barrier without dying.')
