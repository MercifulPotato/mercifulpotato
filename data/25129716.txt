I like the protections that unions have brought for workers, I just think public sector unions need a new model.<p>How about having standards for government employees and firing bad ones? - There should definitely be a process for this, and I&#x27;m pretty sure there is, so it&#x27;s more of a question of the process parameters, and then after firing, what kind of job can that person get? There&#x27;s a history of bad cops being re-hired as cops or private security in other jurisdictions. (Not just cops, but that&#x27;s the example here)<p>Maybe allow multiple police forces to compete and allow people to choose the one that polices their area and thus receive funding. - I don&#x27;t like this one at all.<p>Maybe make police carry malpractice insurance and that way bad behavior has a cost, and those harmed are compensated. - Strongly agree with this one.')
