I don&#x27;t know whether it will take off.<p>One thought that occurred to me several times in the last year or so is that roughly the level of abstraction offered by NestedText might make sense as part of a hierarchy of abstractions that could be built on.<p>We already have that with text files.  Because end-of-line character combinations are special, text files in a given encoding are already more structured than streams of characters.<p>So, assuming UTF-8 character encoding:<p><pre><code>  CharacterStream\n    Text (EOL character combinations)\n      NestedText\n        MyNestedTextFormat (domain specific semantics)\n</code></pre>\nWith non-text files, this has already happened more than once.  For example, both Zip files and Sqlite files are used as base formats for specifying other formats.')
