As a tool of exploitation and enforcement, they&#x27;re utterly inseparable. \nConcentrating the gain + spreading the cost requires both.<p>Capital and governance (CG) have been the internal organs of the body politic forever.<p>Hacker news, facebook, an elementary school, every institution is CG.<p>The theoretical framework of free markets requires the fiction that they are somehow separate and independent!<p>It&#x27;s imaginary rubbish.<p>Corporations were started by the crown and modern political empires grew because of their corporate needs.<p>They expanded together. Every. Single. Time. Always.<p>The free marketeers think they can ignore all history and merely, through zero evidence intellectual exercise, derive absolute truth that needs no  confirmation, measurement or testing because by logical deduction alone they know The Truth.<p>They use rubbish homo economicus behavioral models, rubbish ideas of clean governance and capital separation, and the rubbish assumption that companies win by playing by the rules instead of the reality where they find a new exploit.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a scam. It&#x27;s based on a classic scapegoating shell game and then uses classic cult systems to ignore evidence or question a priori assumptions.<p>It&#x27;s the same internal logic as astrology and horoscopes. Complicated models, no reality check, cherry picked evidence, projected interpretations, same thing.<p>Total nonsense. It belongs in the spirituality section')
