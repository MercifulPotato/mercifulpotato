I would guess more than half are electric. As for induction, not as much, but I always see them for sale in any appliance store. I believe they are more expensive.<p>As for not seeing them in the media, that is likely because electric cooktops don&#x27;t make for good video. The pop of a nice blue flame is much more interesting. Additionally, most high end kitchen appliances are gas since gas is preferred by most professional kitchens.')
