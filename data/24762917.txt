Assuming you mean &quot;Machine Learning&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I mean. There&#x27;s a change coming that will disrupt everything. Generative music will replace musicians and art will become dirt cheap - effectively valued the same as the memes on Reddit and Twitter. The same thing that happened to photography is coming to music, film, and games.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;r9y9&#x2F;nnsvs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;r9y9&#x2F;nnsvs</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;mellotron" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NVIDIA&#x2F;mellotron</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xushengyuan&#x2F;FastSing2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;xushengyuan&#x2F;FastSing2</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jik876&#x2F;hifi-gan-demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jik876&#x2F;hifi-gan-demo</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bshall&#x2F;VectorQuantizedCPC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bshall&#x2F;VectorQuantizedCPC</a><p>And I can keep going. It&#x27;s such a fertile field.<p>Vocalists can and will be improved upon, duplicated, and generated. Instruments played to match any style or theme desired. Entire albums generated in seconds. The latent space will yield more than any human could conceive.<p>Of course artists will still exist, but they&#x27;ll exist in a space that is much bigger and more complicated than today. The tooling will also help them make more and become more productive.<p>I think the cheapness of it all will erode copyright. \nCompanies like Spotify will simply be selling bandwidth, which doesn&#x27;t sound like a profitable venture.<p>I give it a twenty year time horizon to be safe, but it&#x27;ll probably be faster.')
