It&#x27;s a way to make electronic displays appear closer to what our eyes can see, and it looks great.<p>The whole &quot;HDR photography&quot; thing from the last 10 years that&#x27;s so overused in real estate photos is not truly high dynamic range; rather it <i>compresses</i> high dynamic range (often captured with multiple exposures) so it will fit onto ordinary (low) dynamic range displays.<p>HDR displays are the real deal. Less compression (or maybe even no compression) is needed because the display can show a much wider range of colors natively.<p>That said, HDR is pointless for the graphical elements of most GUIs. Where it shines is when you&#x27;re editing photos or movies or viewing them in a window. That window is HDR but outside that window the dynamic range is normal. I saw a link about how Apple is doing this a few weeks ago but can&#x27;t find it now. It&#x27;s quite nice as a way to make photos and video really stand out brighter on the screen while letting the GUI elements recede more into the background.')
