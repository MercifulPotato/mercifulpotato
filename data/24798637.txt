I have even experienced that myself a couple of times when I was younger. &quot;<p>That&#x27;s interesting. I have to think about that, never realized before, but makes kind of sense to me. I read that one big effect of alcohol is due to deactivating inhibitions.<p>I&#x27;m quite lefty, and one main difference with people in the right of the political spectrum (I hope I&#x27;m not offending anyone with this) is that they want things to be clear. It&#x27;s like they deeply dislike feelings of incertitude.<p>For instance: do I feel a nice feelings inside by displays of patriotism? Sure. But do I trust those feelings? Not at all. I will inhibit them because I don&#x27;t see them as an accurate description of reality. Maybe with a few more beers I would be more patriotic.')
