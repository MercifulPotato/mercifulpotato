Within 7 years, we paid down the mortgage for 100 m2 house in the capital area, while raising two children, with one above average and one below average income. And I don&#x27;t feel like we were materially deprived in any way.<p>I think the main culprit is couples settling down way too late in their lives. Instead of settling down at the age of ~25 and combining two incomes to pay off the mortgage principle, we have two adults, each paying ~$700&#x2F;month rents. When they finally move together at the age of ~30, that&#x27;s almost $100k that went down the drain. The baby-boomer generation used to move together at even earlier ages, 19-22.')
