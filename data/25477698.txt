Adding the wealth tax to individual taxes and including those taxpayers who have abandoned California, the combination of the two proposals would have 1% of the state’s population paying about 53% of individual taxes.</i><p>This is insane. That 1% will simply pick up and leave and the state will end up in a long expensive legal battle to collect from them all.<p>And then who will be left to pay for everything?<p>&gt; <i>For most taxpayers, the cost of compliance would far exceed the amount of the tax. A resident with a net worth of $31 million would be subject to a wealth tax of $4,000. The cost of an annual appraisal of each of that taxpayer’s assets could easily exceed $100,000. The state would have to hire auditors to chase people all over the world.</i>')
