I can see how that particular use-case doesn&#x27;t benefit as much from the &quot;just syncing local files&quot; paradigm, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a <i>worse</i> experience. In fact, these days Dropbox is my favored mechanism for transferring files to and from my phone. The auto-sync on the desktop side is much easier than going through a website.')
