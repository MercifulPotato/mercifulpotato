TURN is only used if the user&#x27;s network blocks the UDP traffic between the client and Galène (TURN can use TCP, and can run on an unblocked port such as 443 or 1194).<p>Before Galène, I experimented with a pure peer-to-peer system, with end-to-end encryption.  I found it to be too unreliable for group communication: with just 5 people in a group, you need to establish 10 peer-to-peer WebRTC flows, and the likelihood that all of them work well is essentially zero.')
