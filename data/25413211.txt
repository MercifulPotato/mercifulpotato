It’s fear based. It’s overbuilding the bridge to avoid problems we don’t know or understand. And that is not Engineering.<p>I find sometimes that it helps me to think of it as a fighter or martial artist might. It is only necessary to not be where the strike is, when the strike happens. Anything more might take you farther from your goal. Cut off your options.<p>Or a horticulturist: here is a list of things this plant requires, and they cannot all happen at once, so we will do these two now, and assuming plans don’t change, we will do the rest next year. But plans always change, and sometimes for the better.<p>In Chess, in Go, in Jazz, in coaching gymnastics, even in gun safety, there are things that could happen.
