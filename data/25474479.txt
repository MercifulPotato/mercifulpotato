Acuff-Rose&quot; regards the legality of 2 Live Crew&#x27;s cover of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.  The Supreme Court held that it was clearly a parody, and thus clearly fair use.  Equally clearly, seeing as the Supreme Court was reversing the earlier decision of the Appeals Court, it wasn&#x27;t actually that clear to some.    In any case, it&#x27;s also a delightful listen to a more innocent era in rap: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rMqnPVU207M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rMqnPVU207M</a>.<p>That said, I&#x27;d also be interested in an answer to heavyset_go&#x27;s question.  I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;, and that it&#x27;s only a case of &quot;parody&quot; being a positive example of transformation rather than &quot;satire&quot; being a negative.  The decision in this case, for example, doesn&#x27;t actually even mention the term &quot;satire&quot;, and instead relies on the (not particularly well defended) opinion that setting Star Trek in the world of Go! might be transformative for Captain Kirk, but it is &quot;not transformative&quot; to Go!.')
