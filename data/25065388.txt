I don&#x27;t think so, but who am I?</i><p>It seems that many people have a wrong (read: unrealistically high) expectation of security on Protonmail to begin with. If you are just using Protonmail as a plain mail service, it&#x27;s nearly as vulnerable as any other emails providers: all incoming mails can be monitored at the originator&#x27;s mail provider, or at Protonmail, all outgoing mails can be monitored at Protonmail or at the receiver&#x27;s mail provider. These security properties are natural conclusions from the architecture of SMTP. No backdoor is needed. If the government wants to subpoena your mail, they can simply require Protonmail to intercept all incoming traffic at the SMTP server before it&#x27;s encrypted locally. Also, the fact that Protonmail is subjected to subpoenas is publicly announced on their website, and they state that they&#x27;ll cooperate as far as the degree allowed by cryptography.<p>No backdoor conspiracy is even needed to begin with. End-of-end encryption is only used in-browser when you&#x27;re sending mails to another Protonmail user.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I use Protonmail and I&#x27;m a paying user. The only major advantage of Protonmail is data-at-rest encryption, once the plainmail arrives to your inbox, it&#x27;s not possible to be leaked retroactively without your passphrase. And this advantage alone is enough for me to use it, since it&#x27;s as insecure as any other mails at worst, and a bit more secure at best, I have nothing to lose. If a higher degree of security is desirable, it&#x27;s still your own responsibility to use end-to-end encryption, preferable, one should also use Protonmail&#x27;s official client (with source code) to access Protonmail locally, which ensures that malicious JavaScript can&#x27;t be injected from the server side to reveal the passphrase to your inbox.<p>Finally, if you must find a credible conspiracy from it (I&#x27;m not a fan of doing it, 90% of the time the arguments are all vague &quot;backdoor&quot; or geopolitics rather than a technical security analysis), Protonmail can be considered a PR hack supported by the NSA that misleads non-technical users to think it as a silver bullet, thus actually impeding the progress of developing better end-to-end encryption for email communication.')
