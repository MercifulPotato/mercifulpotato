It certainly isn&#x27;t gospel.  I think it&#x27;s an oversimplification.<p>Columnar stores love star schemas.  You can get away with a single table model too but you still need some kind of dimensional or at least domain-based thinking.  Your single table is going to basically be a Kimball model but already joined together.<p>No database is going to be happy with joining orders and billing.  The single table is still just going to be a single fact table, you just degenerate <i>all</i> the dimensions.<p>Personally I think you can gain a lot of benefit from doing proper stars because you get more sorting options but I&#x27;m a Redshift guy so maybe I&#x27;m stuck in that headspace.<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for someone to come along and propose something different but honestly Kimball&#x27;s dimensional mental model still resonates with me.  Are there compromises, can you relax the model more?  Of course, but you&#x27;re still going to realize huge benefits from starting with that approach.  I don&#x27;t think there is some &quot;new&quot; way of thinking that really changed the data space.  All the innovation is on the compute side.<p>I have precisely zero Vertica experience so maybe I&#x27;m totally missing something.  I&#x27;d be happy for someone to tell me I&#x27;m wrong.')
