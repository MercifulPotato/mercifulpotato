At some point I guess you just stop receiving security updates but how would a regular user know and notice this means they lost security support? All people I know use the phone as long as it works or they just want a prettier one with a better camera. I&#x27;ve never heard someone say &quot;oh shit, my phone is off support, now I have to buy a new one&quot;.<p>This being said, is someone implying having shorter support for a phone increases overall sales?')
