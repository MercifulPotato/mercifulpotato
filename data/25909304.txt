No luck about it.<p>&gt; Why are some people denied the right to emigrate?<p>As far as I know all EU countries give everyone equal rights to immigrate. Maybe you should check your facts.<p>&gt; Life is various shades of unfair and we&#x27;re more likely to make a better world if we optimize for well being rather than fairness<p>How exactly is it optimizing for well being to ignore the corruption, injustice and bad governance in Africa?<p>Europeans should open their eyes, the world is collapsing around them while they sign treaties with China which is actively destroying Africa while committing genocide in their own country - and Europe does not care. Russia is busy oppressing their own people and it&#x27;s neighbors while Germany is building a pipeline to them. This behaviour of Europe is pathetic cowardice, grow a backbone. Spending my tax money on illegal immigrants does not make the world fairer.')
