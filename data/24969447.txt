The Nazis set up their new state news agency (the “German News Bureau,” or DNB) by simply merging Wolff and Telegraph Union, promoting Nazi-sympathetic journalists through the ranks, firing its Jewish employees, and tightening the reins of censorship that Weimar officials themselves had “fitted to the horse,” so to speak. Crucially, Nazi officials preserved Weimar-era technologies and contracts with the world&#x27;s most powerful news agencies. Using the Hellschreiber—a teletypewriter that could broadcast news to multiple receivers at once, and was a capstone of Weimar attempts to counteract British cable hegemony—the Nazis could diffuse their news far and wide. In short, the Nazi Party benefitted from the very press system whose economic and bureaucratic infrastructures it rose to popularity critiquing, finding them incredibly well-suited for totalitarian ends.')
