Forced moderation by regulators would provide impetus to clear out those accounts and also curtail the frothy indignation upon which Twitter feeds.<p>The chief churner of that indignation in recent memory, for audiences on <i>both</i> sides of the aisle lest we forget, has been Trump. He has also been the glue of Twitter&#x27;s relevance, and the beginning of his presidency marked the turnaround of a decline in Twitter&#x27;s stock.')
