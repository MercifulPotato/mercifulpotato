They don’t control the media reporting.<p>That said it seems the group who received smaller doses by mistake was only 1300, not sure where they got the data on 12 weeks but presumably it’s also a small number or they’d be going with that for everyone.<p>Things should become clearer over time and I hope they can shift to the smaller doses first as it’d give us double the number of initial vaccinations when supplies are limited.')
