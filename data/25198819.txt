Even more insulting because all of AE is deterministic so could be multithreaded if it had been built correctly or if they really wanted to put the effort in, but why put the effort in when everyone already has to pay you anyway.<p>Actually surprised the M1 isn&#x27;t matching these systems (even under emulation) for the reasons I outline above. But my experience with the Adobe suite is really it spends more time choking over it&#x27;s own incompetence rather than being limited by the hardware anymore, when you fire up some software like OctaneRender on the same workstation it&#x27;s crazy seeing what your machine is actually capable of and makes you wonder what an AE or Photoshop built for modern hardware would look like.')
