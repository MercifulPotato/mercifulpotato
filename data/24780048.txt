Just because some men don&#x27;t like dancing, no men should get the opportunity to do so? And because some women like to dance, it has to be a staple of the female version of the sport?<p>If it&#x27;s actually about dancing, then make it a dancing event that men and women can compete in. Tons of men dance competitively. But not in gymnastics. Which actually makes sense, since it&#x27;s gymnastics, not dancing. But then why are the women&#x27;s events about dancing?')
