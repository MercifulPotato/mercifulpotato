An alligator started hanging around and was getting too close to the children. He consulted with one of the local game wardens who told him &quot;If there are kids threatened, go ahead and shoot it&quot; (this was outside of hunting season)<p>So the following weekend he was in an aluminum jon-boat with an AK-47 waiting for it to surface (I swear he&#x27;s not a redneck). When it did, he fired a round, hitting it in the skull. But that didn&#x27;t kill it, so he emptied the magazine into it and that did it in.<p>He found the skull at low tide several months later after the crabs had picked it clean.  The AK round had ricocheted off the bone, leaving a divot behind.  They&#x27;re tough creatures.')
