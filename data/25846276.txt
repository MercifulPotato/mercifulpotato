The school didn&#x27;t have the funds to get a commercial typing program so I wrote my own typing program.  It evolved over time with features to help me track the students&#x27; progress etc.  One day we had a school open house where all the parents could come to school.  We had a bunch of different activities set up in different classrooms and I ended up getting assigned to the 3rd grade classroom to set up my typing program so anyone coming through could test their typing speed.  It was a DOS program and I didn&#x27;t want people using anything other than my typing program, so I modified it so you couldn&#x27;t quit the typing program.  Over the course of the day the 3rd graders were hanging out in their homeroom not really doing anything productive.  Of course the computer was a novel attraction and they were just smashing keys and exploring my program&#x27;s UI.  Eventually at one point I noticed that they had somehow crashed my program with a segfault in what had otherwise become a pretty stable piece of software.  To this day I have absolutely no idea what the bug was.')
