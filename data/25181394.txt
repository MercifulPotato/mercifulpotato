Today I work 80h to catch up with capital gains of those who sell me food or own my place. The essence of capitalism is embodied in private equity today - a company is not there to make shoes or build a car - a company exists to make money.<p>Everything else is rather accidental, which is my take on the uber-exhaustion of the western world. I work hard to catch up with capital gains, which I know I cannot.<p>edit: What keeps me sane is that I basically reduced my life as much as I can. I life and work in a small room, have no car, I have clothing for a week, that&#x27;s it. The flat I life in is about 70 years old and has hardly be modernized. I buy food and cook myself. I do not fly, my phone is old, I do not stream anything, I ad-block (otherwise I could not use the internet) and I support some core sites of the (old) internet with a bit of money.<p>I do not crave any of the &quot;niceties&quot; of today&#x27;s world (I use dish washer and washing machine, do not get me wrong), let alone the tech world. No social media, except HN and a few very specific sites. Basically a modern day recluse, as it is the only way I can implement sufficient distance to this world.')
