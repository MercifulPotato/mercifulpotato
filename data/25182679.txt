I think, it&#x27;s a deliberate distraction from a bigger problem that affects much more people.<p>The problem is that if you entered the workforce after 2008, and wasn&#x27;t born into financial independence, you have no clear path to achieve a few important milestones that the previous generation had: property ownership, family (and passing your quality of life to your kids), savings and retirement.<p>These things have been taken away from the whole generation because we chose to not enforce antitrust laws, and bail out inefficient and corrupt behemoths. So the economic leverage that would normally go into the hands of new-wave founders, remained in the hands of big players. And now they want us to feel guilty for wanting all those things the previous generations had for granted.')
