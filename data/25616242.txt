He is the go to example of a rich asshole billionaire that is only looking out for himself. He is promising the moon like every other politician but it&#x27;s extremely easy to look behind his words precisely because of his economic background.<p>Democrats are just as bad when it is about the things that matter but they are not glaringly bad like Trump.<p>Fixing first world economies is not very difficult if you had a benevolent dictator whose only job was to fix the economy. I&#x27;m not advocating against democracy but every time there is a systemic issue the fundamental cause lies in power creep of the wealthy and the difficulty of telling the population to accept a tiny bit of hardship for massive future gains because they are already used to getting screwed over all the time.')
