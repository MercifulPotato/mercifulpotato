That&#x27;s completely understandable.<p>The parent poster was talking about submitting a Pull Request. In other words, contributing the work for free. I suppose expecting someone to look at it <i>might</i> be asking them to do something for free, but if that&#x27;s a problem then I agree that Github should have the option of not having the button on a project at all.<p>Or maybe you thought PR stood for Problem Report, in which case expecting it to be looked into by someone is an expectation of free labor.')
