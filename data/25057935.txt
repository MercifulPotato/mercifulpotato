I waver between full time hours and part time hours, depending on the work&#x2F;life split I&#x27;m after at the time, but it&#x27;s all contract work.<p>Contracting has it&#x27;s own set of challenges and it&#x27;s distinct from a full-time job. I take on the risk and additional challenges of contracting in order to be able to manage my own time, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about compromise too. Working for FANG has become a bit of a social institution and I think some people get into the false assumption that FANG and startups are the only logical options in tech. If you&#x27;re willing to compromise on location, salary and prestige, you can definitely find tech jobs outside of the various bubbles.')
