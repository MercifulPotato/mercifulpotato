It&#x27;s always a matter of priorities and perceived cost vs profit.<p>In any case, I never said it was going to work the same for everybody.<p>I have simply given my personal anecdote of how I used to believe that there would be a high social cost associated with closing those accounts, and in the end I found the opposite to be true.<p>I know of many other such anecdotes, but I also know of a few rare ones where the cost was too big and they decided to reopen said accounts.<p>As always, YMMV - but please don&#x27;t spread the idea that it will be costly for everybody. It might just be that people feel better and find other ways to communicate, or it may be that they decide to rejoin such services.')
