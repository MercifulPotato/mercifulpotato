The three main points seem to be verbosity (defined in terms of total number of characters for a given file, which is not nearly as important to me as readability), not having indentation be significant (which might be downside to a Python programmer but feels like a win to me), and having explicit syntax to distinguish between types (e.g. strings being quoted, which is preferable to me, since it makes them stand out as values compared to the keys). If these are the strongest arguments against TOML, I find myself fairly convinced that TOML is probably the format I&#x27;d like to use most even though I was I different towards it before clicking the link.')
