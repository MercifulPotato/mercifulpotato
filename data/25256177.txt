Mayo on salads, tenderstem broccoli roasted with olive oil, corn cobs on a BBQ, etc. - and Indian food, at least as it&#x27;s known in the West, is no exception. Curries tend to use a lot of ghee or oil, and I&#x27;m fairly sure that people skimping on the fat at home is why home recipes (usually from health-conscious&#x2F;vegetarian&#x2F;vegan recipe sites) never quite hit the mark. Vegetables can taste great! ...So long as you smother them with the junk that actually gives it the flavor and texture you like.<p>Think of a dish composed mainly of &quot;vegetables, whole grains, and beans&quot; with minimal carbs and even more minimal butter&#x2F;oil. What is the recipe? Then, consider if it tastes good - as good or better than similar recipes where more carbs and oil is used. I&#x27;ve been cooking a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes of various cuisines for years and I know of no such dish I&#x27;d want to eat with regularity. Brown rice, steamed chicken breast, and cauliflower just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my palette, and I suspect the same for the majority of people who know how good a Sunday roast or pizza tastes.')
