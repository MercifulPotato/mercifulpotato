It&#x27;s also an ID paper, not a YEC one; both are part of creationalism and the difference isn&#x27;t important enough for the point of this discussion.)<p>The key questions are: Do you think it was controversial merely because it was on ID? Or because the evidence presented didn&#x27;t actually support a ID claim?<p>It appears that paper falls solidly in my description of how such works get into print, eg, cherry-picking quotes:<p>1) added the keywords &quot;intelligent design&quot; <i>after</i> editorial review<p>2) &quot;naive to the point of being silly&quot;<p>3) &quot;I can only speculate, but inattention to the details and unfamiliarity with the references might have played a role [in how the article made it into print].&quot;')
