Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.<p>Rather than any substantive argument, it merely lists a set of wild allegations.<p>But since you asked nicely I&#x27;ll break it down sentence by sentence.<p>&gt; Blockstream bought out most of the the btc devs who had commit ability<p>Blockstream hired myself and Pieter, two of six people at the time that had commit access to the Bitcoin software project at a time when none of the many &quot;bitcoin companies&quot; of the day were willing to fund developers.  Though I was independently wealthy at that point,  supporting my own work on Bitcoin meant spending down my Bitcoin or not working on it most of the time, so being able to get funded to work on Bitcoin and well aligned technology was appealing.  Two people is not most of by any measure.<p>The Bitcoin software has no particular control over the Bitcoin system, but none the less we took measures to reduce any potential conflict of interest:  We were substantially paid denominated in Bitcoin (pre-purchased when the company was founded), so our compensation was directly tied to Bitcoin&#x27;s value.  The company took no copyright interest in our work on Bitcoin, and released all our patents for public use (both under defensive licensing and the IPA).  Pieter and I both had employment agreements that allowed us to quit at and continue to get paid for a year as additional insurance against any unethical conduct by the company.  I also dropped my commit access.<p>Neither of us continue to work for blockstream, I haven&#x27;t for three years now.<p>&gt; Their end goal is to cripple btc to where it is today.<p>Blockstream hasn&#x27;t done anything to &quot;cripple&quot; bitcoin, nor would it have made any financial sense for its employees (100% of whom were (and I believe still are) substantially compensated in Bitcoin).  Quite the opposite:  Blockstream&#x27;s purpose was to build on-ramps to Bitcoin to help the impedance mismatch with traditional finance systems, and to monetize Bitcoin unrelated applications of the same technology (e.g. private systems) and use that to fund development work in the public interest (particularly at a time when no one else was doing so).<p>&gt; The goal of this is to build an unnecessary product they can charge for on a second level. Think skimming money like charge cards do, but offering no real advantage or service beyond that. So far they have found building a new network neigh impossible.<p>I can&#x27;t even figure out what this is attempting to talk about.<p>&gt; Lightning only 18 months away, after 3 years of &quot;development.&quot;<p>Lightning is a large Bitcoin industry effort involving dozens of independent developers and a half dozen companies.  It isn&#x27;t blockstream specific.  It&#x27;s just the logical progression of the payment channel idea initially described by Satoshi and baked into Bitcoin since day one. (And for a weird on-topic tangent: It&#x27;s a secure implementation of the &quot;Ripple&quot; concept which Ripple labs bought the name of and stuck on an entirely unrelated system.)<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;18 months away&quot; it exists now, it&#x27;s widely used, and it works pretty well.<p>However, cryptocurrency for small retail payments remains a pretty uncompelling use case:  It is extremely tax disadvantaged in many jurisdiction&#x27;s, including the US: mandatory per transaction gains tax reporting. And retail transactions are extremely well addressed by existing solutions-- would you prefer to pay with the hardest money available, or would you prefer to pay with a credit card that is already accepted virtually everywhere, provides substantial anti-fraud protection, and extends you 28 days of credit with several percent <i>negative fees</i> for debt in constantly debased fiat?  It&#x27;s important that people have the option-- and they do-- but expecting widespread use in this application over night is fantasy.<p>(And not a particular problem for Blockstream, which doesn&#x27;t make any fees off transactions using lightning, contrary to the parent posters allegations)<p>&gt; You can find hilarious round table interviews with Adam Back where one asks how they can use btc for transactions like at bars with the fees dwarfing the regular transaction. Adam Back suggested using an IOU network out of paper or maybe build an IOU app for that.<p>I have no idea the context there but I can only imagine that someone asked about buying single drinks with Bitcoin and he mentioned that it&#x27;s customary for people at a bar to open a tab and settle up at the end of the night.  Kind of ironic that Adam, who&#x27;s a teetotaler, is more aware of how bars commonly work than his critics. :)<p>In any case, Bitcoin is a global broadcast network whos long term decentralized security is utterly and totally dependant on getting large amounts paid in transaction fees.  That has always been part of the trade-off: Centralized systems can offer extremely low fees.  The only arguments about avoiding market rate fees in Bitcoin have also been argument to unlimit the supply of coins and pay for security through debasement, which is an obvious non-starter.<p>To the extent that there was ever even any debate over that, it <i>long</i> pre-dated blockstream&#x27;s existence (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Scalability&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=14273&amp;oldid=14112" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;w&#x2F;index.php?title=Scalability&amp;action=h...</a> ).')
