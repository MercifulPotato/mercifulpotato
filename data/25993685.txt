Why does 140% short interest mean that all of it is done by this Melvin strawman. Why did people think all 140% of it was going to be due last Friday. Why would buying shares and holding result in Melvin going bankrupt from being unable to cover if 140% was an uncoverable amount in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how the stock market actually works. I also don&#x27;t need my Economics degree to understand that the way people over the past week have suggested it works doesn&#x27;t make a lick of sense.')
