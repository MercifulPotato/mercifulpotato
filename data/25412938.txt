Programs should not be able to force their locations, the wayland devs are correct here. The unique issue is trying to map windows apis to wayland. The wine devs are pushing to have wayland implement all of the mistakes in the windows API while the wayland devs want the best possible solution without being chained to the windows api.<p>I&#x27;m also not convinced there is _nothing_ the wine devs could do to resolve this. They already suggested some ways to deal with the lack of APIs but they refuse to implement them more on principal rather than practical issues.<p>In the end, if only Wine is using xwayland, thats not a particularly bad position to be in and Wayland seems to work well for native linux applications.')
