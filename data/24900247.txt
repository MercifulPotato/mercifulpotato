That&#x27;s right, I&#x27;m saying a vote for Trump, a vote for a third-party candidate, or simply not voting at all â€” they&#x27;re all the same.<p>I completely disagree.<p>I understand how you can characterize &quot;not voting&quot; as &quot;supporting the status quo&quot;. But, there are varying degrees of &quot;support&quot;, and this is pretty much the lowest degree of &quot;support&quot; imaginable.<p>David Barrett is trying to paint this as &quot;with us or against us&quot; when in reality there&#x27;s a spectrum of support. By not voting, you are standing just SLIGHTLY off center in one direction.<p>It&#x27;s not all the same.')
