Item(by='g_p', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610917933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814557, text='&gt; Chances are most of the people you talk to are hiring or know people who are hiring.<p>Definitely this. And if they like you, and their company isn&#x27;t hiring, they might even be able to get them to hire you. Good and enthusiastic security people are hard to come by, so you take the ones you can get, if times are good and you think you might need more soon!<p>And even if they aren&#x27;t hiring, chances are they will be able to make a personal introduction to someone who is hiring - at least in the local networks I&#x27;ve been involved in, there&#x27;s more demand than there is supply, so people are generally pretty willing to help you make connections with the right people. And at the back of their mind, they will also be thinking how they can always go to you in future to get out of their current place(!)')
