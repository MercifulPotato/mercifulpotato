I have done a few odd home plumbing jobs, and it doesn’t take a lot of skill to do something as reliably as a plumber would do. I’m not sure I would trust the similar push-on connector systems.<p>I think the search keywords is “pex fittings”, but just go to your hardware store and see what they stock.')
