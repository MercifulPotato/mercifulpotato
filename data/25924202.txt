They aren&#x27;t infallible -- For example, they don&#x27;t protect against carpenters with nailguns patching sheathing on the outside who miss the stud entirely and hit a water pipe instead (you may wonder how I know this..)<p>As for fiber cuts, one case I&#x27;m aware of involved a large diameter concrete drill&#x2F;hole saw with a diamond-tipped blade.
