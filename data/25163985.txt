Like &quot;people will pay you to add features &#x2F; support the software &#x2F; integrate your software in their system.&quot;<p>I deliberately did NOT use that model. Rather, you pay $$$ and get commercial software, which happens to be under a FOSS license.<p>In other words, I wanted to see what happens if it&#x27;s <i>not</i> &quot;free as in beer&quot;. If you are willing to pay for software, will you pay more, or less, for a FOSS license instead of a commercial one?<p>Turns out, people don&#x27;t care - they want the cheapest one. At least, my customers&#x27; willingness to pay more for a FOSS license doesn&#x27;t match my economic risk for selling under a FOSS license.')
