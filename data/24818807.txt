The strictness is built into the compiler and the entire ecosystem is subjected to same high standards. One <i>has</i> to fix the errors.<p>The same strictness in C++ can arguably be availed by using static linters.\nThis has 3 problems:<p>1. Static linter errors are inherently optional to fix. One has to have some CI rules to block check-ins if linter flags something<p>2. Your project might follow best practices but not your dependencies.<p>3. Static linters are not foolproof (last I checked back 4-5 years)')
