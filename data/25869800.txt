FOSS is Free Software and software so permissively licensed that it could be relicensed and extended as Free Software. Open Source is simply giving up your ownership of the code one wrote, and this Spirit of Open Source is when one pretends that people won&#x27;t actually take advantage of explicit grant of rights for <i>reasons.</i><p>Open Source is for getting popular, and all of the arguments that Open Source people make against Free Software are about the ability to get popular (corporate usage and corporate contributors.) The reason companies use Open Source is because when you license something that way, <i>it&#x27;s theirs now</i>. They&#x27;re investing in their own property.<p>Free Software doesn&#x27;t intend to have this problem, and if it sees a problem, it fixes the bug. You don&#x27;t own Free Software, you own the devices that you install it on. You still might end up competing with someone, but you&#x27;ll never fall behind.')
