People actually use ADSL (copper) and it can&#x27;t do more than 10 Mbps if you&#x27;re a mile away from the internet center, that&#x27;s the case for way more than 13% of the population. You could think that people have switched to fiber but they have not, I live in central London and it&#x27;s hit and miss if you can get fiber at all in an apartment block.')
