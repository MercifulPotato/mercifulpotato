Both came out of their hive, flew up 20 feet and left the yard, and even the neighborhood we think, most of the day. Stable base, near a source of water, and in the sun worked best for them not swarming on us. A lawn mower bumping into a stand meant 20 mins of angry bees, then back to business. Moving the hive on a pole would make me nervous for 20 minutes.<p>What killed two hives outright (we think) are lawn services going after mosquitoes in the neighborhood. Didnâ€™t kill them but weakened the hive. They were subsequently taken over by fire ants and small hive beetles, each time after a split.<p>Bee keeping is so easy and fun and can be done through the mail. I agree with you, duke, if we could solve for allergies, beekeeping could easily be as commonplace as growing tomatoes.')
