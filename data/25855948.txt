It also seems feasible that other species are killed as well; species which may have helped clean the pollution from the planet, which would slow the cleaning process or, if enough species die off, stopping the cleansing process almost entirely.<p>Pollution doesn&#x27;t vanish when it isn&#x27;t being made anymore.<p>So, if there is so much pollution that it both kills life on the planet, it will take a good amount of time (millions of years? How big of a planet are we talking about?) to be cleansed back to undetectable levels.')
