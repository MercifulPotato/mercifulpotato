I checked after the article, and see that where I live has at least 3 areas demarcated with an eruv. There are historical and documentary videos about them on Youtube. Apparently they&#x27;re pretty expensive to maintain, and according to one that I watched, if someone isn&#x27;t paid to monitor one, then you have to assume it is &quot;not working&quot; since they can easily be damaged by weather or utility repairs, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve surely seen them around and thought nothing of it. I have a feeling that various &quot;support wires&quot; I&#x27;ve seen are exactly these.')
