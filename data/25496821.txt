The problem is so real that there&#x27;s even a `rerere` command to take care of it.<p>- Pijul has &quot;minimal&quot; conflicts, in the sense that these are conflicts you can&#x27;t possibly make sense of without human guidance. You get the guarantee that fixed conflicts don&#x27;t come back. Unfortunately, &quot;obvious&quot; cases are never completely obvious: let&#x27;s say Alice and Bob both add a case to a C function, and both change `#define NUMBER_OF_CASES 42` to `#define NUMBER_OF_CASES 43`.')
