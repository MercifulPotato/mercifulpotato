I could just easily flame you and I&#x27;m not.<p>Your first claim so blatantly false and wrong that it&#x27;s pretty appropriate to assume that you&#x27;re trolling. I mean, systemic&#x2F;institutional racism doesn&#x27;t exist and&#x2F;or isn&#x27;t a problem in the US, what?<p>&gt; I substantiate this very easily: affirmative action means preferential treatment for job applicants who are black, and affirmative action is very common.<p>So on the one hand you deny that it exists towards black Americans, but you find affirmative action to be so significant that it however substantiate systemic racism in <i>favour</i> of black Americans?<p>Am I correct you assume that you&#x27;ve honed in on the word systemic and will only accept that it <i>solely</i> means whatever is <i>explicitly</i> written down? So that systemic&#x2F;institutional racism does <i>not</i> include implicit bias?')
