And get a real, detailed, authoritative answer? And contest that answer if it does not meet legal standards?<p>The current standard is far, far removed from that. They can block a site or surveil you without any realistic accountability. The legal system is technically a recourse, but that works only in horribly egregious cases like NSA spying revealed by Snowden, and after years of delay after the case has faded from public consciousness. Even that didn&#x27;t change anything about how the government acts today. And we would not have known about it if it hadn&#x27;t been for &quot;illegal&quot; whistleblowing.<p>When the average person can&#x27;t even get straight answers from the government about how they govern, let alone influence that policy, that is a failure of democracy. We are trying to solve problems in the democratic functioning of government using technology, but that will only ever be a cat and mouse game. These f<i></i><i></i> decided on their own that mass surveillance &amp; censorship is okay, and we are left trying to use technology to hide when we should be able to demand a national conversation about what kinds of surveillance is okay.')
