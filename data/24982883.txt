The general public just has to wear a mask, there is no requirements that it performs to any particular standard, and the retailers are not claiming they do. The masks worn by the the public contain no meltblown, they are just random cloth fabric and they perform nothing like the proper respirator does.<p>The point I was making is that you can&#x27;t point at the random  masks that appeared on the shelves as evidence that supply of respirators has been fixed - there are still not enough respirators to supply every Tom, Dick and Harry.')
