Google decided for whatever reason that my location was too different and now requires that I verify via a phone number I no longer have. I have access to the recovery email and even get ‘suspicious login prevented emails’ at the recovery address. I tried working through google support and was given a form to fill out but never heard back.<p>I should have kept that number until I updated it yes... but I thought knowing the password and having the recovery email would be enough.... guess not.<p>But yeah... fuck you google.')
