A typical business lasts in the order of 20-30 years, a couple of generations if lucky. Most famous universities have lasted centuries. And these is the western university system, starting with Bologna, Paris and Oxford after 1000 AD. If you expand the definition of a university slightly broader, you find the famous universities of Sankore, Baghdad, around 800 AD (the syllabus included Aristotle and Euclid), and even before that, Nalanda and Taxila from around 300 BC-1000 AD, and Alexandria from the Egyptian times.<p>A university is a slow moving, lumbering beast. But analyses like these are too shallow to understand why it has lasted so long, and why every place that was once a centre of human civilisation also had a great university.')
