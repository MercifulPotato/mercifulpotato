Eating the contents of a carnivore&#x27;s stomach would probably be awful, but that of an obligate herbivore is probably not as bad, comparatively, since it would mostly just be plant matter, perhaps slightly fermented.<p>You only need to take a look at the difference between the feces of carnivore and herbivores.
