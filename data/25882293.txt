Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=[25885579], score=None, time=1611410762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878360, text='&gt; I haven&#x27;t had a &#x27;relaxing&#x27; holiday without worries in over 12 months and so I&#x27;m considering a change.<p>(I work in operations&#x2F;devops engineering and not into sofware engineering so my point of view is a bit different, the underlying reasoning is applicable anyway, imho)<p>I made a point to grill the interviewers during the interview on such topics. HR bullshit like &quot;we care for work-life balance&quot; means nothing, I grill the technical interviewer when it comes to the usual &quot;do you have any question for us?&quot;<p>How do you manage on-call availability? How many people are on-call and how many at any given moment? Can on-call people escalate things further? To whom? Are developers on-call too? Do do you architect for HA? How? In your current architecture, what could be a single point of failure?<p>This kind of questions.<p>Any negative reply is a red flag. If I start seeing more than two-three red flags (or even one on an important question) then I&#x27;ll pass.<p>My reasoning when I last changed job was that my job at the time was awful but I had a permanent contract, it would not have made sense to jump into another awful job and win the additional stress and risk derived from the probation time.')
