And I know I&#x27;ll get knocked to r&#x2F;iamverysmart for this. It timed myself. It took less than 10 minutes from reading the problem to coding up a working dynamic programming solution (no peaking at the rest of the article). A big chunk of that was (unsuccessfully) trying to come up with a closed-form solution.<p>I didn&#x27;t get the log(n) solution until I found it existed at the bottom, but once the author mentioned it&#x27;s existence, that took less than 5 minutes to figure out. I didn&#x27;t code that up, though.<p>I&#x27;m probably an above-average programmer, but I&#x27;m not a 99.99% outlier. I interviewed early Google. The questions were tough for me (much more so than this one).<p>Things which jumped out at me: <i>&quot;The better the candidate, the fewer hints I tend to have to give, but I have yet to see a candidate who required no input from me at all.&quot;</i><p>I read this as &quot;We&#x27;re scraping the bottom of the barrel for candidates. Our candidates are nothing like those who applied to Google circa 2000&quot;<p>And: <i>&quot;I didn’t even know it existed until one of my colleagues came back to his desk with a shocked look on his face and announced he had just interviewed the best candidate he’d ever seen.&quot;</i><p>I read this as: &quot;Our employees are dumb. In using this interview question for years, none of us ever noticed the obvious.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s going on there? I mean I can see messing up an interview question like this under the stress of an interview (I literally confused linked lists and arrays in probably my worst interview ever). But no candidate? Ever? And no employee? Come on.<p>There&#x27;s something deeply wrong at Google. It&#x27;s been deeply wrong for a few years. I hope someone fixes it.')
