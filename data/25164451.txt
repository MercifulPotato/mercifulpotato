I agree this used to be the case.<p>- Suspend works perfectly fine for me, including hibernating (incl. disk encryption) after a predetermined amount of time, and invoking a screenlock on wait.<p>- Spotify and 1Password X work perfectly fine for me. I have not tried Netflix any time recently, and Flash is dead.<p>- I use two external monitors, with different DPIs and resolutions, and this is working perfectly fine for me.<p>- WiFi works perfectly fine for me, no issues whatsoever.<p>- Sound works perfectly fine for me, no issues whatsoever.<p>- Fonts appear perfectly fine for me, no issues whatsoever.<p>- The UI is a sore spot for Linux. Linux doesn&#x27;t tend to have consistent UI, between GTK, Qt, and other frameworks. Furthermore, adding Electron apps and things like Spotify into the mix, and things start to get funky. Some people put a lot of work into making their UI consistent, but it&#x27;s tough. Many of the big distros (e.g. Ubuntu) have pretty good success with this I believe. For me, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue.<p>As for iMessage, certainly you&#x27;re going to miss this on Linux, but that&#x27;s really Apple&#x27;s fault for not adding it to icloud.com. I use an Android phone, and messages.android.com works on all my devices.<p>I think the vertical integration used to be a stronger argument, back before messages.android.com. These days, what is it really buying you? A consistent UI? AirDrop? Actually, I believe there&#x27;s a Linux implementation of that now too.')
