The games do not work.<p>As you said some install Kernel Level drivers (I believe this is a Ring-0 but I am not an expert in such things) as a Anti-cheat mechanism.<p>These do not work with Wine&#x2F;Proton. e.g. Doom Eternal worked fine until the first patch and then didn&#x27;t once the anti-cheat was installed (for the non-existant multiplayer community). Then they removed it <i>only</i> after the fanbase heavily downvoted the game on the steam store and constantly bitched to bethesda about it.<p>However most companies bet on most players just putting up with the bullshit to play the game and they are normally right.<p>I don&#x27;t drop Â£700 on a GPU to worry about software freedoms. I buy it to play games. If I get fed up of messing about (I am the guy that runs unironically runs Arch on my desktop  when not gaming and OpenBSD on my office laptop), the vast majority of players just won&#x27;t even bother.<p>The best solution I&#x27;ve found is GPU passthrough (which a friend of mine has setup and I am going to try in the coming weeks) but that has it caveats and tbh Dual booting and just putting up with BS is just easier than trying to fight it.')
