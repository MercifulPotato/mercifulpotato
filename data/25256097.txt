DeepMind was able to produce a very solid model on their first attempt, at both protein folding and at Go (and Starcraft2 as well). Their second models, however, seemed to blow their first out of the water.<p>This bodes extremely well for the future of computational biology, I&#x27;m very excited thinking about the prospects. If we know how a protein folds, we know its shape, meaning we know which shaped&#x2F;charged molecules are needed to act as suppressors&#x2F;enhancers of those proteins.')
