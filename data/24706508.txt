But the cardinality argument is neither here nor there. The cardinality argument is based on classical logic, and has no relevance to computation.<p>In constructive mathematics it is perfectly possible that all real numbers can be represented by finite algorithms. And even that all functions defined on all the reals are continous: a finite constraint of the output can be computed from a finite constraint on the input.<p>But, starting from a definition of the reals as a Cauchy sequence we have a long way to go to get something which can be practically computed on. I think RealPCF [0] was a step in the right direction.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.bham.ac.uk&#x2F;~mhe&#x2F;papers&#x2F;realpcf.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.bham.ac.uk&#x2F;~mhe&#x2F;papers&#x2F;realpcf.pdf</a>')
