As an individual (and with an understanding of just how horribly gamed the system is <i>around</i> my vote) I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and live where the living&#x27;s attractive to me.  Wyoming does not make that cut. TX, NC, VA also fail the personal sniff test, but no judgments against those who choose to live there.  Just not my cuppa.<p>Were I to have &quot;economic incentive fund creation&quot; money, though, I would for sure consider looking at the least populated states to throw that weight against, as your per capita change in demographic would be greater.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t, and even if I did, there are far more effective ways to spend money if political influence is your game.  Hell, if I do ever have that kinda dosh (I won&#x27;t) I&#x27;ll just take a saunter down K street and buy me some influence, cause that&#x27;s the American Way(tm).')
