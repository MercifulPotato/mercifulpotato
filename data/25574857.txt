We develop impossible to understand overcomplicated systems and then we blame the users of those system, which usually are forced to use them, for not taking into account every possible detail. You can substitute &quot;you should know the law&quot; with RTFM and a similar attitude.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what is the conclusion of all this. Maybe bureaucrats are as good as developers, maybe developers are as bad as bureaucrats, maybe people should do what I did and pay specialists.')
