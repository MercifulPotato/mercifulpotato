As an aside, that road is long, but a dead end: it leads up to a beauty spot &#x2F; hiking point. The road also largely lacks dividing lines (i.e. it&#x27;s sort-of single track, though often wide enough for two vehicles), and the cattle grid comes not long after a sharp corner, so I can&#x27;t imagine many vehicles would have been able to get to flying speeds. Besides, that neck of the woods has plenty of interesting driving roads including the main A39 out of Porlock just a couple of miles away, that I imagine are of more interest to speed demons.')
