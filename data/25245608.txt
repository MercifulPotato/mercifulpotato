I started investing in the product but kept building instead of launching. By the time I had it all built and ready to run it was extremely slow, untested adequately at scale and I didn&#x27;t have a way to make money on it. Also, I didn&#x27;t have enough money to sustain it.<p>I cut bait but after a few years because I was building it for me, and just succumbed to using News360. They made something similar to what I wanted but not exactly what I wanted.<p>The next time, it will be something that makes money on its own right away. Ideally just a basic POC and a landing page to get the first customer.')
