Please salt with the knowledge that current theory can&#x27;t fully explain how high temperature superconductors work.  And that I&#x27;m not an expert in the field.<p>First concept, virtual particles vs real particles.  When we talk about &quot;an electron flowing through metal&quot; it is not actually a single electron.  As it moves, the electron will move into an atom, another gets knocked out.  But in aggregate it &quot;acts like&quot; a single particle with possibly different properties from a real electron.  For example it likely has a different mass.  A virtual photon will travel slower than a real one.  And so on.<p>Virtual particles can even correspond to things that aren&#x27;t particles at all!  For example sound is a wave, and quantum mechanically is carried by virtual particles known as phonons.  These act exactly like any other particle, even though they are actually aggregate behavior of lots of other things!<p>A Cooper pair is a pair of things (eg electrons) that are interacting enough that they have a lower energy together than they would apart.  Electrons are fermions, with half spin.  They have a variety of properties, such as the Fermi exclusion principle.  A  bound pair of electrons becomes a virtual particle with an integer spin.  Which makes it a boson, which behaves differently.<p>Superconductivity happens when charge is carried by bosons.<p>In high temperature superconductors, it looks like the electrons are at least partially bound by interaction with phonons.  The high pressures change the speed of sound, and therefore change how easily Cooper pairs form.')
