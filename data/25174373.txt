For the most part, we&#x27;ve been doing well, but recently we&#x27;ve had a small surge (~100 students in quarantine, about 4-10 cases per day, with about 4000 undergrads, only part of which are on campus at the moment).<p>We&#x27;re in a much more suburban area than Ithaca, so that probably plays a factor.')
