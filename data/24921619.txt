I&#x27;ve seen cases where photosphopped images were identified because the shadows on the ground were incorrect for the time of day of the image&#x27;s timestamp, one could imagine similarly that a pulse detector could be sensitive enough to not only detect that a pulse exists but to evaluate if the pulse is right for a person&#x27;s age and body type, or even compare it to known videos of the same person under similar circumstances. Anything that didn&#x27;t really happen will have to be inconsistent with what did, and that inconsistency, no matter how slight, will always be potentially detectable.')
