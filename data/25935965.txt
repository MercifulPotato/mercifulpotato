They&#x27;re not just that, they&#x27;re also sets of guiding principles. And, while there&#x27;s something to be said for knowing when to judiciously break rules, blithely failing to follow a paradigm&#x27;s principles is indeed doing it badly.<p>This is a particular problem for OO and procedural programming. At least as of this current renaissance that FP is enjoying, advocates seem to be doing a much better job of presenting functional programming as being an actual software design paradigm.<p>It&#x27;s also the case that, frankly, a lot of influential thought leadership in object-oriented programming popularized some awful ideas whose lack of merit is only beginning to be widely recognized. If null is a billion dollar mistake, then the Java Bean, for example, is at least a $500M one.')
