Item(by='mjayhn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601865273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683897, text='I&#x27;m adhd and bp2 and while I can tell some of my symptoms apart a bunch of them seem so similar (reading texts and comprehending nothing for weeks, executive function issues, racing thoughts, emotional outbursts) I&#x27;m constantly trying to pry them apart to know which one I&#x27;m experiencing.<p>And now adhd seems to be going more the executive function disorder route so when I read through &#x2F;r&#x2F;adhd I wonder if a lot of the people I&#x27;m reading about are bp or if I&#x27;m not even bp2 but I&#x27;m just adhd. I guess in the end it doesn&#x27;t matter if I find a way to manage the symptoms instead of focusing on labeling them.<p>I&#x27;m glad for posts like this because I had the same issue where I refused to believe my dx because my bp mom is far more serious and media&#x2F;tv portray it so far from what I have, what seems to be a fairly mild case. It wasn&#x27;t until I started reading bp-in-tech&#x2F;etc stories on here where I realized the spectrum range is so broad.')
