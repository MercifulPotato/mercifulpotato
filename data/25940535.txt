In 1926, [German physician and neurologist Oskar] Vogt was recruited by the Soviet government to help establish Lenin&#x27;s genius via histological investigation of his brain.\n\n  In 1927, Vogt gave a preliminary report on his findings in Moscow, concluding from his histological observations that Lenin must have been an athlete in associative thinking (&quot;Assoziationsathlet&quot;) - a conclusion deemed farfetched by some of his neurologist colleagues and adversaries.</code></pre>')
