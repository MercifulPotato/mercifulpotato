It works and I can recommend it, but:<p>1. There is limited adjustment potential.<p>2. The keyboard is not positioned correctly in full supination and my typing error rate goes way up. A fully split design may help this.<p>3. It&#x27;s not a good posture for focusing, although it&#x27;s great for calm viewing.<p>For focusing I&#x27;d go for floor sitting with a lap desk to hold wireless peripherals, and anything that can elevate the screen. This method allows postural adjustment with deep stretches over the course of the day.')
