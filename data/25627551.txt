Item(by='soneca', descendants=None, kids=[25627702, 25627569], score=None, time=1609729567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25627081, text='&gt; <i>” Between July and September, I worked on different things: the build system, Docker&#x2F;docker-compose, continuous integration, authentication, internationalization, etc.”</i><p>Authentication seems to be the only thing the author should be working on at all for a MVP. And even so, I would personally choose AWS Cognito or something like that.<p>From reading this, it seems to me that the issue is a mix of harmful obsession code quality  and bad priorization of what to work on.<p>Probably some feature creep too, even with the author claiming they cut all to the basics.')
