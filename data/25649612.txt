That is the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93...</a><p>The way excalidraw does it, it collects all the points from mouse-move events, then uses the algorithm to take those points and reduce the number of points. The reduction is done by a &#x27;distance&#x27; parameter in the algorithm. So instead of `n` points, you now have `m` points. m &lt; n. Then excalidraw fits a rough curve through those `m` points. This fitting is automatically done in roughjs. Fewer points and curve fitting gives the effect you mentioned.<p>(The reduction algorithm is implemented and used from this package: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pshihn&#x2F;bezier-points" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pshihn&#x2F;bezier-points</a>)\np.s. thanks for the shoutout @swyx')
