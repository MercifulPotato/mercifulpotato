This is a completely new way to hangout, connect or work, virtually.<p>Until now, if you&#x27;ve a large crowd online, only a couple of people would talk. Others listen on mute. Chat is still the preferred way to have side conversations. To fix this, you&#x27;re sent into even more video calls. \nIt&#x27;s a mess.<p>You can&#x27;t move around freely or connect with people at your own pace.<p>With Reslash, you can have up to 100 people hangout in a single space. As you move closer to someone, you can hear them. As you move away, they fade away.<p>Multiple conversations happen at the same time, within the same space. Just like in real life.<p>You can sign up at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reslash.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reslash.co</a><p>It has unlimited free usage for the entire holiday season!
