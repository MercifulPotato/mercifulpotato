Both client and server. Also not open-source, so no go for exotic platforms. What I can say for Mumble is that you can customise it. I couldn&#x27;t care less about redundant server messages spamming me with the rejoins from someone with a bad connection, for instance. Furthermore you can have different users colored differently. Emulation layers for running TS would have eliminated Mumbles rather minimal resource usage.<p>So...<i>shrug</i> ?')
