Maybe they buy £50 worth on some local exchange every month. Will the money be there in 30 years?<p>Seems more likely that they’re going to be wiped out before then by either a fraudulent&#x2F;bankrupt exchange (if they never moved the funds to a Bitcoin address) or by losing the private key (if they did).<p>This technology is absolutely not where a Sussex nurse should park their hard-earned pennies at this point.<p>The same monthly payment into globally diversified ETFs is almost guaranteed to be liquid and in gains in 2050. If it’s not, the global collapse has rendered the Bitcoin thesis untenable too.')
