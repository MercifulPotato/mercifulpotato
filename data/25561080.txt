It kicks me instantly out of my own context.<p>Had to quit my most recent job because vast majority of colleagues were talking to themselves loudly while solving their own assignments, and interrupting me from coding sessions too frequently to even enter into the flow. Even noise cancelling headphones I had at the time didn&#x27;t help.<p>Therefore to me, not taking colleagues into account while having loud monologues I consider being either ignorant, low EQ, or simply rude.')
