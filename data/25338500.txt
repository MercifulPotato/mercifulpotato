Unless these extinctions are entirely due to the 0.9 degrees of warming we&#x27;ve seen, there are other factors at play, many of which might yield more bang for our buck if we focused on them instead of net CO2e.<p>I think of measuring environmental health via CO2 like measuring economic health via GDP - it&#x27;s probably the best single indicator if we have to use a single indicator, but it ignores a lot of nuance without which a better system can&#x27;t really be designed.')
