What makes sense is to understand it and come up with ways to change it.<p>Brains have a lot to answer for.  So do social pressures inside homes.<p>Maybe your brain needs 2 x 1 hour chunks every day, staring out of a window with nothing you have to do, nobody to talk with, no pressure whatsoever, supported even by an effortless coffee and snack that magically arrive, to reset your brain between major contexts.<p>But in some homes, taking 2 hours of &quot;downtime&quot; will result in conflict on a regular basis, and it will escalate.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ll get asked to do more chores.  Fix things on the household backlog.  Talk through things on the household backlog.  Maybe you&#x27;ll find yourself in conversations that prevent you getting essential brain-rest that you were used to before WFH.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference in practice in domestic interactions between being physically unavailable because you&#x27;re on the train or in a car for 2 hours, versus looking to others like you&#x27;re doing &quot;nothing&quot; for 2 hours.<p>This is not a problem which can be solved by some little conversation.  Even when other people understand, they don&#x27;t <i>feel</i> at ease.  It&#x27;s a lingering point of conflict in many households, previously resolved by <i>leaving the house</i> and &quot;having to go&quot;.<p>If you don&#x27;t have other people at home, that are different issues at play, but a lot of people are reporting similar brain boundary issues with pandemic WFH when living alone too.')
