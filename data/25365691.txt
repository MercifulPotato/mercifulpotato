At the close my career, I chose to move to PA as they do not tax income from retirement accounts like IRA, 401k etc, nor pension accounts. It&#x27;s quite a bundle.  Retired, now in PA I pay no state tax.<p>Honestly my tax arguments with MD were furious and frustrating.  It&#x27;s difficult, once you start paying MD, to escape their claims on you.  Even while working out of country for multiple years running, MD will claim you owe them taxes, unless you have changed domicile in the manner they demand.')
