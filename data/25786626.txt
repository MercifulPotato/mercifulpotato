SF as an example says you can be without your mask if you are:<p>&gt; <i>• Sitting or standing outside alone or with people you live with (such as picnicking outside) and you are more than 6 feet from others; • When eating or drinking alone or with people you live with, and nobody else is within 6 feet; • Exercising outdoors alone or with people who live with you (walking, hiking, bicycling, or running) and no one else is within 6 feet</i><p>Realistically though, there is no enforcement anywhere outside. If you want to go walking or running around outside on the sidewalk without a mask, nobody is going to stop you. You might get a funny look. If you crowd someone&#x27;s personal space without a mask they might be uncomfortable.<p>Please wear your mask if you plan to spend extended stretches of time near other people.')
