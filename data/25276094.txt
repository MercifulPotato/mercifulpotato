E.g. to deliberately exclude some part of the population, or in some &quot;the vaccine is actually a carrier for something else&quot; movie plot. But if the limits of vaccination are just the confines of ramp-up and particularly if priority is given to the elderly, it&#x27;s just a phantom fear. Not allowed to go to work unless you are older than 75? Right...<p>At first glance forgery seems like a very real threat considering how hard it is to tell vaccine from sodium chloride (entire testing procedures are based on this), but the same difficulty is also working against a black market: why pay if the seller can&#x27;t give event the slightest indication that it&#x27;s not a fake and the fake has no intrinsic value at all? You&#x27;d have to fake the distribution structures and not the product and an elaborate fake structure isn&#x27;t something that suddenly pops up from some dark market investment, it could only evolve from simpler black market schemes. But those won&#x27;t happen, at least not in time (except maybe in places with a truly corrupt regular distribution system, where it would start with &quot;redistributed&quot; real vaccine and then slowly shift over to fakes)')
