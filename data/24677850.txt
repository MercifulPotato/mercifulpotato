There&#x27;s maybe a 50&#x2F;50 split, of pro vs. anti-college sentiment, mostly because colleges are the only place where things like medicine, real STEM, and so forth can be taught.<p>But I&#x27;m floored that college remains such an established institution. With the ridiculous cost and unhelpful nature of a college degree post-graduation (at least for most non-tech&#x2F;STEM&#x2F;medicine majors), why haven&#x27;t universities long since given way to models like Lambda School, but for every discipline?<p>The amount of people I know saddled with student debt who do nothing remotely close to their major, and who didn&#x27;t even enjoy studying to begin with, is astounding. And this pattern repeats itself in Europe, though somewhat differently. There, instead of starting companies, people get a 6-year long Masters in Entrepreneurship or Marketing or Business, and go on to work unfulfilling middle-management jobs for stagnant, uninspiring companies.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is a prevalent malaise in Asia and developed parts of Africa and LatAm as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think free college would fundamentally solve the problem, which is that college delivers very little value for most, and a lot of value for very few. For most studies, it&#x27;s no longer a good system (IMO).')
