I think we&#x27;ll have level 5 self driving for at least all purpose built roads within the next few years. I can&#x27;t reconcile what Tesla have already released with not having self driving go mainstream soon. I suspect self-driving will never have a eureka moment either and will just slowly creep into existence.')
