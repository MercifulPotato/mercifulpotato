Maybe you put the 10 similar-shaped bugfixes together into one PR because they review together easily, but each fix is its own commit, because they all logically stand on their own.<p>Your use-case is actually the cause of a common rule I&#x27;ve seen at work of requiring a ticket reference in each commit message, which allows looking up the original ticket and associated PRs, along with any commentary &amp; discussion at the time the commit was merged.<p>On a big code-archeological dig, I often follow a path like run blame -&gt; look at the diff -&gt; pull the ticket reference -&gt; find ticket in issue tracker -&gt; read its description &amp; comments -&gt; find linked PR #&#x27;s in the ticket tracker -&gt; open PRs &amp; read diffs and comments -&gt; repeat for linked issues if needed (and then as often as not still end up baffled)<p>One team actually kept an old redmine VM instance running mostly based on my personal use long after we&#x27;d migrated to JIRA, so... I think my approach may be a little unusual! At the least, doing better sized commits would a huge step for every case involving blame.')
