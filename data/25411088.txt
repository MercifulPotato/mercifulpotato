Eg here in Canada, I&#x27;ve seen estimates that vaccines reduced H1N1 deaths by about 5% at best. H1N1 still infected around 20-30% of the entire world population, and Canada was no different. A significant % of people were already immune, so natural herd immunity is the main thing that stopped it.<p>Given how fast COVID-19 appears to be spreading even in places with strict lockdown, I won&#x27;t be surprised if it turns out that vaccines don&#x27;t actually make much difference with it either.')
