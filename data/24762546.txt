I&#x27;ve heard it said &quot;Having everything feels a lot like having nothing at all.&quot;<p>The comparison of how we used to do things, to how we do them now are often just a marketing tactic, because old and new are relative regarding value. E.g., an old violin is better.<p>What&#x27;s lacking with the new internet is about this and that, or lack of options. So the entirety of the culture is flavored by an oligopoly in their respective market.And Spotify is missing loads of music.<p>Music needs to change its perspective to a this and that view. Is &quot;this&quot; what you want over &quot;that&quot;? How old or new something is, is irrelevant.<p>No musician that I know, and I know lots as a lifelong musician, is enthusiastic about Spotify. Most of us feel we just have no choice. Same with Facebook etc. Most people don&#x27;t even like it.')
