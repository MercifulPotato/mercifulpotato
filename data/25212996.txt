I don&#x27;t think an abstract understanding of the costs is enough. If the cost isn&#x27;t physically or viscerally felt, it just doesn&#x27;t factor into people&#x27;s decision making.<p>This is where the pricing system really comes into great effect. People buy and drive fewer SUVs when gas is more expensive. If we want people to buy fewer SUVs, increase the fuel tax.<p>Education is not enough, and in fact might not even be necessary at all. Just introduce real costs to capture the &quot;abstract&quot; costs (externalities) and the problem will likely correct itself.')
