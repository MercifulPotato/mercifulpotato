Item(by='mainstreem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605047370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051292, text='This article totally misses the point of what subscription fatigue is: the administrative burden of keeping track of recurring payments to various services which may no longer be wanted, needed, or can be afforded, and the fear of the renewal of one of these services causing sudden and surprising financial strain.<p>As such, subscriptions DO compete with each other, although the author contends that they do not.<p>When I buy any single good in a normal transaction, I pay and then I forget about it and my relationship with the vendor and the transaction. It&#x27;s complete. It&#x27;s over.<p>When I purchase a subscription I must remember to cancel it at which time I no longer need or want it, and I need to remember to keep an eye on the charges to make sure that they are what was agreed to at the time the subscription began and have not risen due to a rising sticker price or fees which were not advertised to me. This has a mental cost.<p>In personal practical terms, this means I&#x27;ll only subscribe to a few streaming services at a time. I can&#x27;t watch more than one or two VOD services in a given month. If if my VOD desires change, since I want to mentally track as few subscriptions as possible, I will cancel one of the existing subscriptions to make room for something new.<p>In this situation, I have e.g. Netflix competing with Amazon for a &quot;subscription slot&quot; in my mind, but Netflix doesn&#x27;t deliver toilet paper. Guess which account I cancelled six months ago, and which one I still have?')
