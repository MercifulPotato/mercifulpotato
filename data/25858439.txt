After the usual business of vanishing a few small mammals, the magician&#x27;s assistant lies in a magic box, and the magician, with a dramatic flair, begins to saw through the box.<p>The philosopher&#x27;s friend leans over and asks <i>What do you think is really going on?</i> The philosopher gives it a moment&#x27;s thought and replies <i>They&#x27;re using illusionist skills to give us the impression that he&#x27;s sawing someone in two, but really he isn&#x27;t.</i> The philosopher&#x27;s friend, unsatisfied, asks <i>Right, but how?</i> The philosopher shrugs dismissively, <i>That&#x27;s really not my department.</i>')
