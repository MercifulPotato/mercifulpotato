If a person is insisting on making that choice instead of moving out, especially in a world that is moving more and more into remote work, well, it&#x27;s their responsibility.<p>Comparing this situation with a system without private property or even ability to rent, where apartments are leased by the state through your employer and you have no choice in the matter and have to wait years in order to move is a really, really long stretch.')
