They also will restrict content that violates their community standards such as explicit instructions on slaughtering chickens on a farm, or how to field-dress a deer when hunting.<p>Even the Rob the Ranger channel has had videos taken down for inappropriately explicit content, when showing lions mating for example.<p>Youtube throws a wide net, and thus rather unfairly censors innocent content.  Bitchute, peertube, etc. provide alternative ways to get that content online while you&#x27;re waiting patiently for your appeal to go through.<p>And yeah, there&#x27;s some content that the monitors at Youtube consider objectionable and will never be allowed, and maybe should never be allowed -- snuff films, child porn, terrorism how-to training guides, stuff like that.  But I think Bitchute also takes down such content.')
