The latter version of an unfree regime still benefits from creating a form of slavery, but it&#x27;s slavery of the mind. Imagine a civilization comprised of figurative Uncle Toms of the system.</i><p>I&#x27;m a bit confused by the figurative language used here. Did you have a specific example of this, or is this a hypothetical? I think this type of thinking has its, but I think it&#x27;s important to contextualize it. For example, you can say that a gambling addict gambles against their will, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that they are enslaved to gambling institutions (unless I was purposely being hyperbolic). But I agree that many systems of slavery had a degree of self-regulation among the enslaved.<p>&gt; Forgive me if I&#x27;m misunderstanding your point.<p>My framework is this: violence is a necessary part of slavery, because to a certain extent enslavement requires the enslaved to choose between continued slavery or extreme violence&#x2F;death. If you remove state violence from the equation, slavery still usually exists, and often flourishes due to the lack of a countervailing force. In &quot;top-down&quot; situations, where a system of slavery has implicit or explicit state support, the state doesn&#x27;t have to explicitly enact the violence itself, it can simply declare a certain segment of the population &quot;extra-judicial.<p>I think authoritarian, low violence states like Singapore have numerous human rights issues, but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as saying that the entire body politic is enslaved.')
