Most communications protocols are federated, and would survive one company&#x27;s servers eating dirt, but Signal&#x27;s owner&#x2F;operator has decided this would degrade the user experience, presumably worse than the entire service shitting the bed out loud. Hackernews assumes that Signal is incapable of paying its hosting fees, and comes to the rescue by sending their money to a company that can&#x27;t spin up cloud nodes fast enough to serve text messages. Other Hackernews bemoan the fact that once again they look like idiots, since they just conned half their friends and family into signing up for this mess.')
