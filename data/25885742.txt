That&#x27;s rather obvious. You will not be able to resist any much bigger force than just police with puny handguns you can buy on the black market, but that&#x27;s the point!<p>Have that militarised special police busy! Have them expending resources, have them running armour around cities at a great material cost. Not to say disruption of everyday life, and seeing armour on the streets will contribute greatly to galvanising the population, and demoralising the ordinary police.<p>Simple math tells that 1 million men strong police force will quickly exhaust itself being either split on 100+ major cities, or being constantly relocated from one city, to another.<p>The ratio military age men, to police force in Russia is 21 to 1, and you very much expect that a bigger portion of population has to be counted, and not all mancount of police, and 3 letter services account for military like units.')
