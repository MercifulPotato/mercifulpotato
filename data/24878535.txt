In theory we live in a free society, so there&#x27;s no reason different cities and countries should have the same style, specially when the general public doesn&#x27;t seem engaged with it at all?<p>The only things that come to mind is that maybe it&#x27;s very cheap to produce, or maybe the inside culture of the architecture world &#x2F; art world really likes those things, and has a much higher influence than mainstream culture on how those things are produced.')
