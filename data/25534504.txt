It&#x27;s usually not actually helpful to signal that you are desperate and lonely and your life is in the toilet. Once in a great while, someone will be truly wonderful to you because you did that but it&#x27;s usually counterproductive.<p>&gt; 3. Signaling desperation attracts predators far more often than it attracts real friends.<p>Yep, these are excellent and hugely valuable life lessons. There is a real and common tendency among humans to react to negativity by either running away or moving in for the kill.<p>On the surface this is a depressing realization, as you get older you come to understand that nobody really gives a fuck (maybe a handful of people do if you&#x27;re lucky, but I&#x27;m convinced that many don&#x27;t even know <i>how</i> to care about someone else). Most relationships are only skin deep.<p>However it&#x27;s also a powerful revelation, it gives you a tool for understanding people and that tool can change your life. If you suspect someone may be involved with you simply to take advantage (emotionally, financially, sexually, socially, whatever), you can start asking them for things.<p>The ones that care will give you what you ask for. The ones that don&#x27;t will disappear almost immediately (which is one hell of a moment of clarity when you&#x27;ve known them for years).<p>When you feel a relationship is one-sided and you ask the other person (nicely) to do something which will even out the score, the result is always a win. If they value the relationship you get what you want and the relationship is reaffirmed. If they don&#x27;t then a toxic relationship ends and you can go focus on the healthy ones.<p>This tool is so powerful that it&#x27;s really on you to be fair and strike a balance. Once you start using it you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to overuse, there are a lot of people who have problems with saying no. There are no rules but I try to strike a 50&#x2F;50 balance of give and take even when the other person says they&#x27;re happy. Aside from your innate sense of fairness the only other real check on your ability to use other people is your reputation (that&#x27;s an enormous one over time, though).')
