I guess my point is that in general, to the extent possible, I&#x27;d like to get to know people for who they are and not the pictures I have in my head. I feel like my thinking will be more accurate and my life experience more rich that way. I oversold a little bit how &quot;embarrassing&quot; it was. I wasn&#x27;t deeply ashamed or anything, like I had done something unforgivable, it&#x27;s just a little embarrassing to lose your mind with excitement about something that actually isn&#x27;t all that rare. Rather than sharing an enthusiasm I kind of just exposed my own ignorance. I also think it created a tiny wall between me and the MMA guy because I&#x27;m sure on his side it&#x27;s like &quot;ok these guys don&#x27;t get it &#x2F; think I&#x27;m some kind of weird anomaly, maybe we should move on to something else.&quot; I still hung out with the guy a bunch of times after that so it&#x27;s not like there were bad feelings, but I still feel like it would have helped the conversation and friendship if I had been a little less credulous towards my own assumptions.')
