Nothing more. You don&#x27;t get to dictate what others can or cannot do on land that doesn&#x27;t belong to you. If someone wants to build 200 apartments, it&#x27;s likely that there is expected demand for those 200 apartments. That&#x27;s 200 families. So what if they are going to share a fence with you. Buy a bigger plot of land to create a buffer then.<p>Places change and evolve. You can try to delay things as much as you want, but it&#x27;s only that, a delay. And ultimately, not up to you.')
