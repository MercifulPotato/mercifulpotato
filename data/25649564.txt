Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609873740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648287, text='&gt;  Just because the Federal Gov of the US does this does not mean that the states have to as well.<p>Yes it does: the Federal government currently allows states to choose between permanent Standard Time and Standard&#x2F;Daylight switch at the point specified in federal law, it also dictates the timezones in the US and their boundaries. So, e.g., California has a choice between permanent PST and PST&#x2F;PDT switches (it has chosen the latter), and Arizona between permanent MST and MST&#x2F;MDT switches (they’ve chosen the former).<p>If the feds get rid of the option for DST switching <i>and</i> the option to chose permanent standard time in favor of mandating permanent daylight time with no other options, then, yes, the states have to do it.<p>Now, if they replace the daylight switch option with a permanent daylight option, that would be a different story. And if they just added a permanent daylight option, that would be an even more different story. And the text isn’t up for HR 69. But I suspect its straight “permanent DST is the only option” rule.')
