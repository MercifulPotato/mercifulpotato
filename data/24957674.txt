From the perspective of liberty, there&#x27;s no government using aggressive force against you; this is a perfectly free-market phenomenon.<p>That said, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s always <i>moral</i>. For example, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying at my place of work (software engineer) that women are biologically different than men and this probably has a large impact on why the field isn&#x27;t 50&#x2F;50 men&#x2F;women.<p>I think this is a perfectly reasonable position, yet there&#x27;s no way I could say this at work. I&#x27;d lose my job, just like James Damore.<p>So, I don&#x27;t think that what is being done is wrong in the political sense, but I do think <i>unfair</i> cancellations are unethical. I think it&#x27;s fine to &quot;cancel&quot; people&#x2F;businesses&#x2F;organizations that cause or allow unfair cancellations to take place. I already quietly decline to do business with and lobby against companies that adopt &quot;woke&quot; postures.<p>I&#x27;m part of a silent majority that votes with their wallet, I suppose.')
