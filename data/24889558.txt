So far my options are Light Phone and Punkt. MP-02.  Not everyone is so tethered to consumption that they want all that stuff on their person at all times, but quality is still worth pursuing.  I use calls, SMS, MMS, and data tethering.  Sometimes an alarm clock.  I don&#x27;t want any of that other stuff, and I&#x27;d pay a lot for a good, high quality phone that focuses on the baseline and doesn&#x27;t require me to offload everything to some megacorporation.')
