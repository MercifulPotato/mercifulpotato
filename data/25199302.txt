I consciously wrote all the het pairs as girl, boy e.g. &quot;Sarah Smith, Dave Smith&quot; not &quot;Dave Smith, Sarah Smith&quot; because on the one hand that&#x27;s how I most often think of them, and I noticed our culture usually puts the man first so why not be contrary?<p>Anyway, Facebook re-ordered them. And so I followed up with a post asking why that happens. It turns out <i>some</i> of my friends saw other orders, some got the order I intended. Intriguing.<p>Fortunately one of the scientists thought of a perfectly rational and testable explanation, she tested it, and demonstrated it&#x27;s apparently right.<p>Facebook has some internal &quot;How much you interact with this person&quot; metric and it&#x27;s using that for sorting. It has no way to know your relationship to Sarah and Dave in the real world, it&#x27;s just putting Dave first (for example) because the two of you exchanged a dozen terrible fish puns last week, a measurable Facebook interaction, whereas that walk out by the lake with Sarah when her mother died isn&#x27;t on Facebook.')
