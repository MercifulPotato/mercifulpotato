Stripe CAN work that way, but then PCI compliance is entirely on you (and you might as well get a regular merchant account at that point, since you&#x27;ve already gone to all that effort.)<p>Anything that touches cardholder data has to be PCI compliant. Stripe offloads PCI compliance for you because Stripe&#x27;s front-end library lets the card number (etc) pass from your browser directly to Stripe&#x27;s PCI-compliant backend, <i>without ever passing through your application servers</i>.<p>If you interrupt or proxy that flow, you become responsible for PCI compliance.<p>(Note that I have no idea if that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing here, but they <i>could</i> and you wouldn&#x27;t even know until your account was closed for fraud. Also, this sort of centralized architecture can easily become a target for attack.)')
