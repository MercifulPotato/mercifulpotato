While the JS doesn’t have a wire cost, it does have a parsing and execution cost. Optimizing compilers like (say) Google Closure Compiler can significantly improve runtime cost, which is definitely a benefit for extension users.<p>That said, any extension using those tools without source code available and build verification should definitely be viewed with suspicion.')
