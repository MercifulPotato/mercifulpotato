It makes me wonder if the issue was really feedback about the paper and not some other HR complaint.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s how it is supposed to work.\nThe thing that sucked about it was that it was impossible to defend myself.  I only found out details after the fact because the complaint was anonymously filed on behalf of a co-worker and it was the co-worker that later came to me to explain.')
