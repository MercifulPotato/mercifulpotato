E.g., it&#x27;s not necessarily typical for a pension to cover disability insurance, healthcare, etc. Regardless, it&#x27;s a digression from the original comment point which is about the proportion of taxes.<p>Taxes need to be viewed in the context of the entire tax structure, not just a subset of taxes known as the federal income tax. While I don&#x27;t disagree that the wealthy pay disproportionately more, it&#x27;s not nearly as much as the GP post suggests when you look at the entire tax structure. As an example, in that context, the top 1% account for 20.9% of the total income and pay 24.3% of the total taxes [1]. The point being, we need to be careful not to cherry-pick from subsets of the overall tax structure. Only reporting federal income tax statistics can be accurate and misleading at the same time.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;who-pays-taxes-in-america-in-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itep.org&#x2F;who-pays-taxes-in-america-in-2020&#x2F;</a>')
