We had searched for a system which would maintain the lifecycle of the promotion but there wasn&#x27;t any. Hence we decided to build stack.promo<p>stack.promo is an API based promotion engine which can integrate with existing websites to offer personalized promotions and pricing to customers.<p>We also have a customer acquisition strategy using waitlist with promotions <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack.promo&#x2F;acquisition.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stack.promo&#x2F;acquisition.html</a><p>Please feel free to DM us on twitter (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;stack_promo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;stack_promo</a>) or comment below for any questions.
