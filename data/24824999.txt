My house is full of IKEA furniture and so far none[1] of it has fall apart.<p>I think these tips can go a long way:<p>- use proper tools instead of the cheap tools that come with the product<p>- if you use a power tool on a screw, only use it for 95% of the task. finish the job with a hand-tool or you will do damage.<p>- do not over-tighten things which screw into wood<p>- metal into metal? LOCTITE.<p>- you&#x27;re really not going to disassemble that coffee table or small check of draws, so just use a bit of wood glue<p>The great think about most IKEA furniture (or more generally, wood furniture) is that you can modify&#x2F;fix it when it breaks. Good luck fixing those broken welds on your metal chairs!<p>(1): Okay so my Lack coffee table fell apart, but it&#x27;s also ~Â£5. I repaired it with wood-glue and masking tape, good as new, then gave it away for free on FreeCycle.')
