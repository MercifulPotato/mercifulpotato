The Bose stereo had a cap that would blow, which would cut power to the whole center stack, including climate control and defog. The radio was a $2,000 part, and they never extended the warranty. I ended up replacing the climate control panel with a non-US version of the part that bypassed the radio.<p>It’s good that Tesla extended the warranty in this case, as they should have. I think there’s one key part that’s even better, and as far as I know totally unique to Tesla;<p>&gt; <i>So the moment I qualified for an upgrade to their newer MCU, I just went ahead and scheduled that. Sure, it actually costs me money, but in exchange I get a faster UI, better software support, and hopefully fewer issues.</i><p>Tesla has actually designed a harness to allow their newest generation of MCU to be retrofitted into their older cars, and will factory support this upgrade. This gives you access to all the latest infotainment and driving visualization features that came out well after the car was made.<p>I don’t know of any other car manufacturer which supports their late model cars like this.')
