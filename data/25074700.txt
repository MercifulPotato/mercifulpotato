When we signed up for Stripe, the fees included access to Strip Subscriptions. We chose Stripe in part because of that. Now we either have to pay more for the same functionality or migrate of.<p>We&#x27;d be totally happy keeping the old functionality of Stripe subscriptions and not getting any of the new hotness. I think Stripe has done a great job supporting old versions of the API, seems like we should just be able to stay on our old pricing &#x2F; subscriptions functionality as well.<p>Saying that we can build the infra ourselves to do reoccurring kind of goes against what we purchased Stripe for initially. I know technically you can change your pricing&#x2F;billing however you want but this is more of &quot;let&#x27;s capture more revenue from old customers&quot; than it is &quot;we launched a bunch of stuff thats new so pay for the new stuff&quot;.')
