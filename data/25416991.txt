Item(by='gexla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607951027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25416074, text='Let&#x27;s say you have two programs to select from. One program has a 60% placement rate, but has horrible quality. The other has a 30% placement rate, but high quality. Let&#x27;s say that an independent 3rd party does the quality assessment from invites to participate and from student feedback. This same body also finds that the employers and starting salaries for each program is roughly equal. Would you care about quality? I would select the first option. The higher placement rate has the greater value due to the greater probability of landing a job. It&#x27;s like playing a pocket pair of Aces vs a pocket pair of Jacks in Texas Hold&#x27;em. I would consider the possibility of placing myself with a job as coming in with a pocket pair of 7&#x27;s.<p>What else matters? I guarantee that you&#x27;ll learn something through an intensive effort of pacing along with the curriculum. I&#x27;m also sure that it&#x27;s not going to be enough to feel comfortable that first day of the job.<p>What&#x27;s the placement rate? If that rate has plummeted or has always been horrible, then that&#x27;s all I need to hear.<p>Maybe what they are really teaching is the process of getting yourself into a self-learning mode of work. I have to learn new things every day. I would bet my day looks similar to those in Lambda. Maybe it&#x27;s a &quot;wax on, wax off&quot; sort of thing which looks like BS but actually works if you don&#x27;t get hung up on things outside of the end-goal. As long as the employer placement numbers are good (and maybe they aren&#x27;t,) then I&#x27;m a believer.')
