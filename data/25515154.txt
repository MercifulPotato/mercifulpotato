The bandwidth of the simultaneously reachable satellites is basically constant everywhere, except at higher latitudes where satellites on different orbital planes get closer to each. So distributed users are preferred to lots of users in a single place, since the latter would have to share the bandwidth while the same number of distributed users would access via different satellites instead and would see an increased total bandwidth available.<p>Look at the graph on &quot;population and satellite density per degree&quot; in [0] to see why SpaceX has most likely chosen the inclination that they use.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caseyhandmer.wordpress.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;starlink-is-a-very-big-deal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caseyhandmer.wordpress.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;starlink-is-a-...</a>')
