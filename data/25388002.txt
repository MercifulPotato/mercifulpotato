Item(by='prucomaclu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607706519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385990, text='&gt; You&#x27;re missing a fundamental point: anyone can make wild, nonsensical claims. it is not for the judge to &quot;refute&quot; them, it is for the plaintiff to substantiate them.<p>The affidavits were not &quot;wild, nonsensical claims&quot;.  The judge just ignored the dozens of affidavits entirely.<p>On this issue, the judge cited exactly 1 affidavit from the defense, with the defense&#x27;s testimony that they weren&#x27;t allowed to enter due to it being at capacity. (2 affiants,  1 affidavit)<p>First - even if that testimony is true, it does <i>not</i> address the plaintiff&#x27;s legitimate complaints that:\n1) Republican poll watchers were illegally being removed from their positions\n2) Republican poll watchers who were removed, were being replaced with Democrat poll watchers\n3) As a result of the above, tables were illegally having 2 Democrat observers<p>The judge <i>did not even try to address the above claims</i><p><i>At all</i>.<p>Just ignored them completely.<p>Because the defense had 1 affidavit that was barely remotely related to the claims the plaintiff was making.')
