Item(by='scythe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602293713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735742, text='&gt;studies suggest that malnutrition might confer a longer lifespan.<p>There are some data suggesting that inadequate supply of this or that nutrient reduces certain aging mechanisms and leads to longer lifespans <i>in a laboratory setting</i>. However, outside of a laboratory setting these nutrient deficiencies can affect the body&#x27;s ability to fight infections and heal injuries, which on average cancels out any benefits.<p>More generally, trying to increase lifespan by adjusting the diet seems to me like trying to fix a car by playing with the buttons and knobs on the dashboard. You might obtain a <i>small</i> improvement, but you&#x27;re not really going to get anywhere unless you open the hood.')
