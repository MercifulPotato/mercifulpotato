Item(by='h0l0cube', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608112467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440084, text='&gt; I think the unintended side effect would be more flagging of comments when its not warranted<p>Perhaps, but I think having the &gt;500 karma rule for flagging would ensure users understand the gravity of their actions, somewhat.  I find up-votes on comments to be rare, and down-votes to be a couple of orders of magnitude rarer.  Part of that will be transitive of the rarity of the down-vote privilege, but I think those people having been subjected to fairly received down-votes makes them use the power with a little more discretion once they&#x27;ve earned it.<p>&gt; I think there are marginal cases for every rule.<p>Don&#x27;t disagree with this, but the HN interface is a blunt tool.  I&#x27;m of the persuasion that a flagging privilege would likely have a positive impact vs a down-voting privilege, but it&#x27;s hard to know without an experiment, and also hard to measure.  The system as it is, is &#x27;good enough&#x27;, and most members are conservative regarding the interface, so there&#x27;s hardly a motivation to try.')
