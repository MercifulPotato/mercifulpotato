But certainly possible for a nation state to do. Not easy for random individuals.<p>3) You can&#x27;t guarantee whether or not someone will vote. Voting twice is a federal crime, and we routinely arrest people for this. If this were done on a wide scale we would see a large spike in these types of arrests as plenty of people who were identified as unlikely to vote would still vote, triggering the FBI to make an arrest. Of course those arrested would then claim they didn&#x27;t vote twice, and you would be arresting the people who&#x27;s identity was stolen rather than the perpetrator.<p>I think those two reasons both rule out the case of individuals doing this, and a large organization doing this systematically. Maybe there are still some loopholes I missed though.')
