GPT-2 is FOSS. I have a feeling that OpenAI&#x27;s next architecture (if there ever is one) would still also be FOSS.<p>I think OpenAI just chose a bad name for this for-profit initiative — &quot;GPT-3&quot; — that makes it sound like they were pivoting their company in a new direction with a new generation of tech.<p>Really, GPT-3 should have been called something more like &quot;GPT-2 Pro Plus Enterprise SaaS Edition.&quot; (Let&#x27;s say &quot;GPT-2++&quot; for short.) Then it would have been clear that:<p>1. &quot;GPT-2++&quot; is not a generational leap over &quot;GPT-2&quot;;<p>2. an actual &quot;GPT-3&quot; would come later, and that it <i>would</i> be a new generation of tech; and<p>3. there would be a commercial &quot;GPT-3++&quot; to go along with &quot;GPT-3&quot;, just like &quot;GPT-2++&quot; goes along with &quot;GPT-2&quot;.<p>(I can see why they called it GPT-3, though. Calling it &quot;GPT-2++&quot; probably wouldn&#x27;t have made for very good news copy.)')
