Yahoo has a similar service, but again you need to create the alias first, your solution of accept all, deny later is much smarter.<p>My only question about price brackets is I don&#x27;t have a great understanding of how much bandwidth I use monthly, or even how many emails I&#x27;d funnel through your service, not to mention we&#x27;re kinda at the mercy of the senders, if they send a lot&#x2F; or send large emails, we end up needing to move up a bracket. On avg do your Premium users get close to the limit?<p>Which brings me to my next question: what happens if I do indeed use up my entire bandwidth allotment for the month? do emails just get bounced? do I just get upgraded automatically?<p>I get where your coming from by charging for bandwidth, from your perspective you&#x27;re aligning your costs with the price.<p>When I tried to sign up, the username I wanted was taken, but the error message wasn&#x27;t obvious and I was left wondering what happened until I saw it above the signup button. For the record I had ublock enabled and it was blocking 15 things, so it&#x27;s possible it caught something... you might wanna look into that.')
