Given how all of our brains work, it&#x27;s not realistic to take them out of the equation.<p>But it is important to maintain some moderation and rein them in. Emotions are powerful, and if you don&#x27;t learn to exercise some degree of control them, then they will control you.<p>I think it helps to understand that emotions have a purpose. For example, fear helps you avoid threats, and anger pushes you toward taking action that is needed to change a situation. If they&#x27;re serving their purpose constructively, that&#x27;s good.<p>But if they&#x27;re not, they need to be controlled. For example, when fear makes you avoid something which is actually safe, or when anger makes you act in a rash manner or suffer mentally over things you cannot change.')
