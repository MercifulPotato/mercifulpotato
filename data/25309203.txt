If Google can&#x27;t compete people move on.<p>Maybe they meant both independently. As an example:<p>- A friend of mine just upgraded out of his iPhone 6. Until recently performance and storage seemingly just weren&#x27;t that important to them.<p>- Another friend of mine will just buy iPhones, no matter the cost.<p>Both of these friends stick with Apple because they like and care about other things about the ecosystem more so than performance or cost (independently), whereas OP was perhaps implying that Android users tend to care more about &quot;performance to cost ratio&quot; since they could as well just buy a different phone from another maker and get the same Android experience. This of course, in the context sticking with one phone maker or another.')
