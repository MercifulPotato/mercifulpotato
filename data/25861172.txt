When I saw that under the &quot;shoulders&quot; section the Overhead Press was never mentioned, I was stunned! And the deadlift form [1] is wrong. Your head shouldn&#x27;t be looking straight forward, you should be looking at a slight angle down to the floor in order to keep your spine in better form. [2]<p>For one, beginners should begin with routines revolving around the main 4 lifts (Overhead press, Bench press, Squat, Deadlift). They should <i>not</i> begin by doing a fuckarounditis (yes it&#x27;s a real term that&#x27;s used) routine they make themselves by thinking &quot;what muscle do I want to grow today?&quot;.<p>Secondly, beginners need to understand the importance of sleep, diet and protein intake. These are vital factors that aren&#x27;t immediately addressed by this website.<p>There&#x27;s already lots of good advice here about how to get into weightlifting (&#x2F;r&#x2F;fitness, &#x2F;fit&#x2F; sticky, Starting Strength, etc.). I highly recommend you buy the book Starting Strength and read it cover to cover. It goes into detail about everything.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musclewiki.com&#x2F;Exercises&#x2F;Male&#x2F;Lowerback&#x2F;#Deadlift" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musclewiki.com&#x2F;Exercises&#x2F;Male&#x2F;Lowerback&#x2F;#Deadlift</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startingstrength.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;looking-up-in-the-deadlift" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;startingstrength.com&#x2F;training&#x2F;looking-up-in-the-dead...</a>')
