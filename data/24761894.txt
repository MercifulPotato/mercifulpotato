Rewording: more purchasing power buys a nicer home in a nicer area and lower purchasing power in a less nice area with not as much amenities.<p>It&#x27;s irrelevant to the question of whether a feudal system of land ownership is the best one.<p>The outcome you are describing - variation in purchasing power of luxuries - is a normal thing in societies that more fairly distribute opportunity.  For example, Scandinavian countries do not have complete equality by any stretch of the imagination.<p>That&#x27;s not the scenario described in the article nor does it describe the magnitude and rigidity of the phenomenon in feudal societies.')
