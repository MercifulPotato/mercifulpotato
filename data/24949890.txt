I had the same issue with my screen, and now the iPhone&#x27;s camera has stopped working, only a few months past Apple&#x27;s warranty (I bought the phone recently). I go in to the &quot;Genius Bar&quot;, and they tell me it&#x27;s a $150 repair. I brought up that the issue had only started 2 months out of warranty and that I could buy a new iPhone 7 on eBay for $200. No budge, they offered me a $100 trade-in value for an iPhone 11.<p>$100 trade-in value and they want to charge me $150 for repairs??? What?<p>I am going to iFixIt as the issue seems common, it&#x27;s just a ribbon that is attached weakly that pops off of the attachment. The camera is still working.')
