Seems to be very fashionable these days to either quit social media or traditional journalism for substack but honestly I feel like it resembles self-advertisement combined with mediocre pieces more than anything of value.<p>The argumentation like in this piece is usually that there is some bad incentive that these independent platforms avoid, like virality in this case, or being beholden to someone else, but I don&#x27;t see how this isn&#x27;t true for independent publishing.<p>If you run your own platform you potentially still want it to go viral if you want to monetize it (which I assume why people post it to sites such as HN or reddit, read social media), and you&#x27;re beholden to your readers in a sort of patronage like relationship.')
