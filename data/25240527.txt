They&#x27;re their own government that has somehow snuck under the radar of the DOJ. They behave like the mafia and offer &quot;protection&quot;.<p>Google is next for the harm they&#x27;ve done to the web. I think we can agree how bad they&#x27;ve bloodied it up.<p>How can you put Facebook ahead of Apple? They&#x27;re creepy and invasive, but they&#x27;re not redefining what we can and cannot do, and they&#x27;re the easiest to remove from our daily lives and industry.<p>I want to distribute software and I still have to pay the Apple tax and jump through their hoops, and I&#x27;m left without a relationship with my customers. On the other side of the coin, as an owner I can&#x27;t repair my device or run my own software. Facebook has little impact on my life, meanwhile Apple is a gravitational distortion in our industry.')
