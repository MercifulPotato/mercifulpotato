It will be easy for Chevy to wash their hands of such a death since the car is already unsafe by modern standards.<p>To be fair I think it&#x27;s most people&#x27;s right to engage in unsafe activity if they don&#x27;t risk harm to non-consenting others. EV conversion of old vehicles is relatively harmless. They are far less dangerous than kit airplanes, experimental aircraft, testing new parachutes or even tinkering with gasoline fueled cars.')
