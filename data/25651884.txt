Good point, I did look at it some initially but because it&#x27;s now separate from the rest of the categories on the  App Store I must&#x27;ve glossed over it in the end. I&#x27;ll make sure to include it in the follow up post that I am planning.<p>EDIT: You we&#x27;re spot on. I added the Games(Free) data and it dethroned Shopping(Free) as the worst chart with a mean number of data types collect of ~13.7 vs ~11.9. There&#x27;s also only a single game(out of 169 with data) that doesn&#x27;t collect any data in Games(Free). In third party tracking Games(Free) stands out even more with a mean of ~6.1 and median of 6, the closest other chart is News(Free) with a mean of ~2.7 and median of 3. &quot;ScrabbleÂ® GO - New Word Game&quot; is the 13th worse app in the data set(in terms of data linked to the user) after Facebook&#x27;s apps and LinkedIn. There are also several games in the top 20 third party trackers')
