In other words, its an interesting philosophical question, but not one that has any relevance to reality.  Unfortunately most people, no how nominally &quot;intelligent&quot; they are, insist that the world exists as they wish it would, rather than it actually does.  In reality, mistakes happen, incompetence happens, corruption happens, and unforeseen circumstances happen - all of which render nuclear waste (and facilities that produce nuclear power) much riskier and more dangerous than they would be in an ideal world.  Unfortunately, this bit of undeniable objective reality is extremely unpopular (and offensive) to technocrats and others who worship blindly at the altar of human society and technology.')
