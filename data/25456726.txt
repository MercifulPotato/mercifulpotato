It happened like this: I know that the Kindle is a doorway into reading all the novels and non-fiction books I ever wanted, because they can be freely downloaded from LibGen. At the same time, the Kindle is an absolutely terrible format for reading poetry: often poetry relies on elaborate typesetting that EPUB&#x2F;MOBI doesn’t support, some editions of poetry tightly connect the poems and the paper and binding used, etc. As I reflected on this, I was inspired to set about building a huge home library of modern poets’ collected works; basically any name connected with the 20th-century canon, I have bought it or am planning to buy it. I probably would have never thought to do this if it weren’t for the Kindle!')
