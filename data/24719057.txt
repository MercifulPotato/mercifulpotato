That&#x27;s not really an &quot;error&quot;, so much as a rule people learn in school about how English &quot;should&quot; be spoken and may or may not pass along to their children. But consider this conversation:<p>child: &quot;My brother said me -&quot;<p>adult: &quot;My brother told me&quot;<p>child: &quot;{pause} My brother told me...&quot;<p><i>That</i> conversation just doesn&#x27;t happen. Those are the real grammatical rules of English, and the ones that native speakers of Spanish, in this example, violate. But a child doesn&#x27;t learn that from an adult interrupting them and correcting them, they just internalize it and know it on their own.')
