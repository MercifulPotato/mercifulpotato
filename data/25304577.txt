It affects subs that should have been apolitical, like r&#x2F;pics, r&#x2F;science, r&#x2F;coronavirus. I hoped things would calm down a bit after US elections- it did, but not nearly enough.<p>Truth is, I personally wouldn&#x27;t mind political content, I regularly read NYT, obsessed over every update in last US election. My problem with Reddit is that there really isn&#x27;t interesting political content, same old DT-bad-AOC-good over and over again.<p>Some niche subs are exception, but they won&#x27;t ever make front page, and will be heavily brigaded if they ever do.')
