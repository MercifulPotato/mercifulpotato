You think EU policy makers don&#x27;t understand what is needed for that? Or that there&#x27;s not enough &quot;talent&quot;? I doubt it. I think it&#x27;s a more or less conscious decision to avoid the US startup culture. It&#x27;s a cultural thing.<p>If it is indeed a cultural thing, I would argue that they have also thrown the baby out with the bathwater.<p>Example: here is a very curious thing about the GDPR - non-European countries cannot really put a &quot;counter-tariff&quot; (metaphorically speaking) because nothing that useful has actually come out of Europe to tariff in retort. We did see some comical efforts of some websites to block the entire continent of Europe, but what would have been actually interesting is if non-European countries could block, say, the Google of Europe. Europeans had no skin in this game so to speak, because they haven&#x27;t actually produced anything at that level of utility for a long time.<p>Note: I am neither American nor European, and my country has done almost nothing of note either. But I am not going to say that &quot;oh, we don&#x27;t need all that SV shit because as a culture, we think it is beneath us&quot;.')
