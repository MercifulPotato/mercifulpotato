I graduated college in 2007, and all throughout my time from 2003-2007 I had half my courses online, including the quizzes and tests.<p>Online courses and asynchronous testing isn&#x27;t something new to Covid, colleges have been doing it for well over a decade now.<p>Yes you had people try and cheat their way through asynchronous testing by having friends take them earlier, but why is that more of a big deal now than it was previously?')
