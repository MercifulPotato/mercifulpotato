I used to use Google Music which had comparable suggestion qualities at the time, but I feel like Spotify has gotten significantly better at suggestions over the past year-ish.<p>- think YouTube is the shining example of controllable recommendation systems. Looking at my front page right now, I&#x27;m interested in all 8 of the videos above the fold, and almost every video below it -- probably a direct result from actively guiding&#x2F;curating what videos get recommended to me. My &quot;to watch&quot; queue is hundreds of videos long since I almost always add more and more videos until I get the time to sit down and watch a chunk, which usually turns into a positive feedback loop of more good videos getting recommended.<p>All three of the above recommendation systems make me enjoy the related product more than I would without them, and probably also directly lead to more revenue for the company (sales on FB, keeping my Spotify sub, and seeing more YT ads).<p>On the other end of the spectrum, posts on FB and Quora are two examples where recommendation systems seem to make products significantly worse, so I guess it&#x27;s hit or miss depending on whether what you want out of each product aligns with how the recommendation systems are set up.')
