Xi Jinping is keeping all the key holders to the kingdom satisfied impeccably well.<p>They aren&#x27;t afraid of Hong Kong, the other perspective is that Hong Kong has much less relevance than it had during the handover, 20% of GDP down to 3% of GDP. Hong Kong is an example and cautionary of tale of &quot;late stage capitalism&quot; that all cities around the world experience, high rents and living costs and no consensus on how to help. Whereas mainland China gets large living spaces and welfare for all while inheriting exposure to high growth market based systems and its working extremely well right now, Beijing&#x27;s state capital system is working. They can deal with Hong Kong as is for the next 17 years no problem.<p>Taiwan is just there. They can saber-rattle about that for a long time too.<p>The status-quo in China is good enough, some people get their money out, others provide services in mainland. That status quo involves the implicit threat of party members doing anything to you if you fall out of favor.<p>Chinese unity and territorial sovereignty is the primary common denominator of everything Xi does, if you do or say anything that can be seen to harm the state or the idea of China, then you&#x27;ve done it wrong.<p>I read the transcript of Jack Ma&#x27;s speech, it wasn&#x27;t very egregious, but all he had to do was skip the thoughts about the current state of how debt is negotiated in China.')
