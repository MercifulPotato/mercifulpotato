I don&#x27;t think they released the evidence but I&#x27;ve been told some of it from someone close to it. To me it seemed weak on its own without a confession which is probably the reason why they arrested them.<p>Some evidence doesn&#x27;t mean no proof it&#x27;s just not enough to be certain.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that there was no drone too, but the cops were all working as if there was.')
