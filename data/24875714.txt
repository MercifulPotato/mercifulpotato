Theyve been doing it for 20 years, and in those 20 years the most they have managed to accomplish is building a better, more resilient mole.<p>Napster was followed by bittorrent, bittorrent by popcorntime, and youtube-dl.  in the past 20 years the industry has quietly capitulated and delivered some content users really want like streaming audio services, but in the grande cosmos of the DMCA-related war on piracy the industry itself continues to do more to smite its own face than it does to offer a more reasonable and accessible product to their audience.<p>There is nothing to keep me from writing something now that scrapes <i>puseaudio</i> for content triggered by mpv.  the only real factor thats of concern is that this new backflip would be even harder for the RIAA to prosecute.')
