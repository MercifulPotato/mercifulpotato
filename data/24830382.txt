We are talking about a third world country here. There isn&#x27;t any money to have the best chemist etc. How bolt is different is that he is tall and has the same turn over as a small guy. Chemicals don&#x27;t get you this, only genetics. It was the long held belief that tall people cannot run short distances. Now, every coach is looking for a tall runner with same turn over as a small guy. Bolt just changed the paradigm.')
