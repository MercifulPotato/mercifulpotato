(You almost always want to compute many pixels)<p>GPU &quot;cores&quot; are different because they have graphics specific instructions like texture lookups.<p>They are also different because you want to run the exact same program on many cores at once. So you have have one instruction decoder&#x2F;dispatcher that control more then one core. This leads to some weird behavior, like if you have a branch in shader code, all cores may compute both branches, but then each core may mask away the result of what ever branch the specific core shouldn&#x27;t have taken.')
