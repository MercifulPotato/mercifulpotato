Violence is not an every-day part of life for me or anyone I know. Unless you live in an extremely bad neighborhood or a third-world country, violence isn&#x27;t part of every-day life.<p>And anyway, if actual physical violence is a daily or weekly occurrence, the supposed bad influence of video games is probably the least of your worries.<p>&quot;Have you ever driven in traffic, seen someone arrested, PAID YOUR TAXES?&quot; (emphasis mine)<p>What the heck are you talking about regarding taxes? Also, traffic accidents don&#x27;t really count as &quot;violence&quot; in the context of this discussion. Arrests are something that generally happen for a reason, so again not a normal part of life for most people.')
