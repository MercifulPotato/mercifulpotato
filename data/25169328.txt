This network was back then completely open to network and all students&#x27; machines had real, public, routable IP addresses and no firewall.<p>We had to tolerate the people even though the rules stated running intensive services was not allowed and I would normally had a script that would automatically ban a user for doing something like that.<p>I remember one day we (me and my roommate) decided to take a look at the server and we noticed it is some stock install of a Linux Mandrake which was known to be totally insecure. We decided to bet who is going to be faster to the server.<p>Half an hour later we were both telnetted to the server and chatting using wall, of all possibilities.<p>For those who don&#x27;t remember, wall broadcasts messages to all terminals on the server.<p>Couple minutes later the owner of the server burst into our room scared that some hackers just invaded his precious student service.<p>You should see our faces.')
