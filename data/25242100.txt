I drive used cars and only drive small cars with small engines (1L cars).\nMy car has tailpipe emissions of 136g&#x2F;km CO2, and is 11 years old, bought used a year ago. Add to that an additional 47g&#x2F;km from fuel cycle and I have 183g&#x2F;km.<p>Meanwhile the manufacturing of the average EV releases around 10tons of C02. I am omitting the other emissions from using the car (see the study below for details, it&#x27;s from the author of the tweet). That means I have to drive 55000km until I even reach that. That&#x27;s 15 years of driving for me, going by my commute of 5km each way everyday.\nNeither car would last that long.<p>I used data from here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oliver-krischer.eu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;English_Studie.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oliver-krischer.eu&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;En...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-tackle-climate-change" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-...</a>')
