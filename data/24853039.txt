The economics are so overwhelming .. it&#x27;s not a prediction anymore, it&#x27;s just reality.  There are &gt;160 giga-factory-scale projects in the works.  Everything about batteries get cheaper and better, while ICEs get more expensive and complicated as we grapple with the reality that they&#x27;re killing us.  Not to mention future petroleum costs.<p>Even without any cell technology innovation, scale alone is getting us to initial cost parity (and obviously lower TCoO).  But the cell technology is coming.  Roadrunner alone demonstrates that.  The real question is about electric aircraft that would depend on solid state, lithium-air, etc.')
