It&#x27;s like &quot;documentation theater&quot;. If you start as a naive user coming in, it keeps teasing you that its going to teach you something but you just get abstract concept after abstract concept and you STILL don&#x27;t know the mechanics of how a build works. You have to kind of reverse engineer the info that Bruce describes out of the documentation. Even when you manage to hit actual code examples with detailed explanations - they are described in a way that fails to give you the generalisable understanding of the internals that you need to actually create new things that you haven&#x27;t seen before.<p>As a developer it generates a distinctly hostile feeling of helplessness and powerlessness.')
