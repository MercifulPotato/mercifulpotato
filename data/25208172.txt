The Nebra Sky Disk (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nebra_sky_disk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nebra_sky_disk</a>) was e.g. excavated by two &quot;tomb raiders&quot; who sold it on the black market, and only after the disk changed hands multiple times it was re-acquired by the federal government in a sting police operation (luckily).<p>It makes me sad to think about all the artifacts of e.g. the Byzantine and Babylonian cultures that were stolen during the recents wars in the middle east, most of it probably made it into the hands of wealthy collectors. At least we can hope that some of the stuff will turn up again, eventually, but since most people don&#x27;t know how to properly keep these artefacts from decaying there&#x27;s still a tremendous risk they will be permanently damaged.')
