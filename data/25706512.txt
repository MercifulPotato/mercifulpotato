Just imagine a state attorney trying to use that as a defense, to explain why the &quot;No Video Camera Repairs in Bumsworth Act&quot; does not violate the First Amendment. It would be ridiculous.<p>You&#x27;re trying to use the same defense while the leaders of the largest soon-to-be-opposition party are banned en masse in an effort to align industry with the incoming new administration, while people with significant cred [1], who happen to be on bad terms with opposition party in question [3] denounce the whole thing as an &quot;unacceptable act of censorship&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;russian-dissident-alexei-navalny-blasts-twitter-for-trump-ban&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;russian-dissident-alexei-naval...</a>   <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;navalny&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347969772177264644" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;navalny&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347969772177264644</a><p>[2] more pertinently, a book about the acts of the Catholic Church in Bumsworth, or the mafia connections of the mayor of Bumsworth<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-09-05&#x2F;donald-trump-us-has-not-seen-evidence-alexei-navalny-poisoning&#x2F;12633148" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-09-05&#x2F;donald-trump-us-has-n...</a>')
