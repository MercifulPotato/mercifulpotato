The US is the exception, where we take it to mean that we have a representative democracy a la Fed. #10.)<p>Let&#x27;s say the popular vote (i.e. the mad crowd) votes 45% party X and 55% party Y, but party X get 55% of the representative seats and party Y gets 45%. Why is this fair? \nWhy shouldn&#x27;t party Y get more seats? Why can&#x27;t the members of party Y act as a &quot;damping factor&quot; (instead of a &quot;counterweight&quot;) to the demands of their own voters?')
