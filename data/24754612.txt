If I recall correctly the devs aimed at making a more natural programming language.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll ever work, there&#x27;s the obligatory xkcd comic about the limits of sophisticated programming languages. The code will never free you from the burden of having to specific exactly what you want.<p>Maybe an ML&#x2F;AI parser for natural language would be a possible improvement and then tweak the details after the parsing. Likely just make things more complicated though.')
