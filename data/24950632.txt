Item(by='Udo', descendants=None, kids=[24950686], score=None, time=1604144409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950441, text='<i>&gt; expeting the majority of people not to expect you to be productive at 8.00 AM is anti-social<p>&gt; expecting the majority of people not to be insinctively disgusted by your sexual practices is anti-social</i><p>I strongly object to this characterization.<p>How is letting people live their life &quot;tiranny (sic) of the minority&quot;? You think instinctive disgust for other lifestyles is and should be the norm?<p>I realize that the term diversity has been poisoned in public discussion, but for lack of a better term: diverse cultures are stronger, both in biology and I would argue socially as well. On the other hand, the authoritarian monoculture you advocate is a joyless and brittle construct that has to be policed strongly and viciously all the time or it will fall apart immediately, and it also doesn&#x27;t have any immune response to radicalizing forces.<p>In this specific case, a society with nightowls can do more than one without. There are plenty of jobs that have shifts where not being a nightowl destroys people. An ex girlfriend of mine had to do regular night shifts at the hospital. It became a real health issue for her, but me being a nightowl freelance programmer at the time voluntarily keeping the same schedule, I was doing just fine.<p>Being a nightowl is also a social equalizer to an extent, because it allows people who are not rich enough to live distraction-free lives to carve out a time of the day where interuptions are virtually non-existent.')
