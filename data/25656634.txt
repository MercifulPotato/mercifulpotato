Should it be Web-APIs? Then you&#x27;re essentially rewriting the browser, maybe minus the DOM, CSS and JS. Should it be the Windows APIs? Then you&#x27;re essentially rewriting Windows above the kernel. Just POSIX? Then what about applications that need rendering and sound. Do you invent your own cross-platform APIs? It&#x27;s a massive undertaking, and without the momentum that the web had and has, it&#x27;ll be tough to make this application runner popular among devs and users.')
