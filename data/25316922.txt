Bayesian models (and in particular Bayesian networks or graphical models) and neural networks are about different things. The former try hard to capture uncertainty and causality. The later are all about non-linearity.<p>For example, Pyro implements tons of facilities to have Bayesian models augmented with neural networks.<p>It makes a lot of sense from a modeling perspective to model the big picture using a Bayesian model (generally a graphical model) and then use neural networks for some components. You capture the overall causal structure, but you are also outputting really precise predictions. For example, a deep markov model.<p>There are tons of unexplored ideas combining both, and in general I think this is the future of deep learning and one component towards AGI.')
