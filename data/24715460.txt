I live in Germany and always considered our Recycling Practices as highly valuable, until I was contracted to build a project for an industrial waste processing company, which led  me to realize that our system is 60% virtue signalling, 35% political corruption and 5% useful.<p>The problem, as they&#x27;ve described, if you were intellectually honest is really not about how much you can recycle, but more about how you can burn things cleanly by sorting stuff as best as possible.<p>Have two bins, dry waste and wet waste, everything else should be handled at the waste management plant, as they have to sort anyway, but wetting materials that could otherwise burn cleanly and efficiently raises the price and makes automated sorting much harder and more expensive.<p>If the waste management company can recycle anything for profit, they will absolutely do so, but forcing them to do so at cost for materials that nobody wants to buy because the material is in low demand just shifts the problem in the pipeline to the landfill after you&#x27;ve spent energy on trying to recycle it.')
