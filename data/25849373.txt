I actually migrated from Omnifocus 2 to Things 3 and personally think its the better app, but I get that some people might like the bells and whistles.<p>OmniGraffle is $249.99 USD compared to Sketch at $99. The subscription model cost is roughly the same as Figma (although figma also has a free-forever tier).<p>Omni Outliner is probably closest compared to OneNote which comes included with any Office 365 plan above $4.00 per month.<p>OmniPlan is cheaper than Microsoft Project to be fair, although Project for Web is catching up at $10 per month and there are alternatives like QuickPlan at $50.<p>Full disclosure: Of all these apps, I do REALLY would want to use OmniPlan. It&#x27;s definitely the best Gantt chart software for Mac but it&#x27;s useless for me without MSP support, my work aren&#x27;t going to pay $400, and QuickPlan is $50 and supports Microsoft Project, so I&#x27;m not forking out an extra $350 from my own pocket to use it.')
