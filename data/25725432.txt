The idea being, that it is not under any jurisdiction. And hence cannot be blocked. Well, not really. First the company that operates this is subject to the jurisdiction of the country it is incorporated in and does business in. Second, to access such mesh networks requires that you have hardware (essentially a satellite phone modem) that can reach it. In india, for example, the sale or posession of such hardware without a license is illegal. Finally, you piss off the big guys (US, China, Russia, India) and they can simply shoot your satellite(s) down.')
