(One of which will be in use by a power adapter if you are plugged in, so you really only have one port).<p>I was imagining upgrading to the Pro to get more USB ports, but if that&#x27;s not an option... I can&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d ever pay for a Pro.<p>I like having more than one USB port so I can copy things from one external HD to another. I guess I&#x27;d need a dock for that.')
