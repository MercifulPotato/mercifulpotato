The fact that we (people in our field; not me specifically) had to and could do stuff like this must seem crazy ancient to the younger folks here.  I did boot my first computer from a cassette tape, and I can still remember what it sounded like and it&#x27;s so, so very nostalgic.  And many of us did get our first internet access via these crazy noises as well.  I&#x27;m sure I could also listen to a modem connecting and tell you what speed it had negotiated from 1200baud all the way up to 56k, since each new sound was, at one point, the pinnacle of excitement since I&#x27;d just upgraded to something new (and then I heard it thousands of times).')
