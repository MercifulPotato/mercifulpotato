It&#x27;s a form of superficiality where people feel that they don&#x27;t need to look further into the subjects before drawing fundamental conclusions. I&#x27;ve spoken to so many people that loudly proclaim that Curtis&#x27; work is just conspiracy theory, totally oblivious of the instagram level of depth such a conclusion requires.<p>It would be great with a solid text to go along his films. For now I would urge everyone who get that uncanny feeling after watching Curtis&#x27; work to read up on the subjects covered. I promise you that feeling will go away!')
