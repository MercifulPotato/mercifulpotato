I&#x27;m glad, Discord is a fantastic service in my experience. It&#x27;s a shame they got shoe horned into a mostly gaming oriented service. I&#x27;ve never had a class or worked somewhere where Discord was a considered solution instead of Slack, but I can&#x27;t think of anything that Slack does better (in my experience). In general, I think Discord has the best audio and video service that I&#x27;ve used, especially kicking Zoom to the curb.')
