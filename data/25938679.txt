But their trust and confidence didn&#x27;t come from actual comprehension of these. Minute anything went off track a bit, they would start to question everything. They would want to change tracks and change people. Needless to say this was VERY disruptive and wasted a lot of time and energy over and over again.<p>What are some of your war stories?
