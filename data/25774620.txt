If you can fix certificate problems, any simple browser (even text mode lynx) can still do a lot these days.<p>But let&#x27;s go really &quot;modern&quot;, i.e. being able to access web applications without missing features, timeouts etc.\nSlower, maybe just one at a time, but what you do works.<p>That&#x27;s surprisingly hard. I sometimes use TenFourFox, a browser for Power Macs, which is a bit of a mashup between older versions that were still supported and back-ported newer features. And that can run on a quad core G5.\nI&#x27;d say that still misses the mark, but might come close enough. With a G4, that would bring you to maybe 2002&#x27;s tech.<p>But in the end, for a lot of modern stuff you&#x27;re basically required to have an &quot;Evergreen&quot; browser or IE11. On Windows, that means Windows 7, which IIRC won&#x27;t run on Pentium IVs and requires about 1 Ghz&#x2F;1 Gig RAM. So 2005&#x2F;2006&#x27;s tech.<p>On Linux, you can go lower. There&#x27;s still 32 bit Linux support for Firefox, so if you can get a recent enough distro on an old computer, it should work. A core solo definitely does, and I guess a souped up Pentium IV should work well enough, too.\nBeyond that, it&#x27;s going to get interesting. Pentium II&#x27;s should work and you can give them enough RAM to chug along with a recent OS. So that&#x27; about 1998&#x2F;1999.<p>Beyond that, CPU speed and max RAM will result in some breakage.')
