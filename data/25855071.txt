Before that, 2020 was on track to be an unremarkably violent year.<p>Given that this is exactly what happened in Ferguson and Baltimore after those cities’ riots, the increase was sadly predictable. Baltimore’s experience bodes especially poorly for the country; its homicide rate has stayed elevated ever since.<p>The slaughter of an extra 3000-4000 people in the span of seven months is a colossal tragedy. I hope that the cheerleaders of future racial reckonings will do all in their power to prevent similar disasters.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetrace.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;shootings-data-philadelphia-cleveland-chicago-gun-violence&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetrace.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;shootings-data-philadelphia...</a>')
