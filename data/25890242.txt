At grid scale that is a whole different story. In order to cover our energy needs we will need to build many times more solar than our peek load on the grid. That means lots of times there will be power which nobody wants. Here you donâ€™t care about efficiency (with negative prices you might even favor lower efficiencies). Only thing you care about is how you cover your electric needs then there is cloud cover for a few days and not much wind. Hydrogen seems like a great option at the moment.')
