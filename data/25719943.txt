It&#x27;s seriously disturbing. COVID is of course helping expose that we have run out of &quot;real&quot; problems and unlike any other time in history, people now have the option available to literally become fat, dumb, and lazy. I realize it&#x27;s a touchy subject, but I think it&#x27;s a mistake to not stigmatize obesity (not overweight but obese) the way we do smoking. Incentives matter...this might sound cruel, but have insurance stop covering health problems related to obesity and watch how quickly people stop eating McDonald&#x27;s four times a week. Clearly I prefer a tough love approach on this issue.')
