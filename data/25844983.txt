Item(by='simiones', descendants=None, kids=[25845271], score=None, time=1611140917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844535, text='Well, that&#x27;s usually a more complicated discussion. In French and Romanian at least, the word used for &quot;floor&quot; in this context (&quot;etage&quot;&#x2F;&quot;etaj&quot;) refers to an elevated construction. So, a building with &quot;1 floor&quot; (&quot;1 etage&quot;) has 1 elevated construction atop the ground. This is what leads to the apparent 0-based numbering. The numbering is actually 1-based, but people count the extra layers above the ground, instead of literally counting the floors. In fact, I have rarely seen elevators show a 0 - they normally have something like P, 1, 2, 3.<p>It&#x27;s more complicated anyway, since there are many structures with intermediate floors below or slightly below the ground, and those are usually nominated specifically (&quot;mezzanine&quot;, &quot;demisol&quot; , etc.).')
