With things like gradle becoming able to pull and build git commits this is less of a win.<p>- Its easier to kick off downstream builds because everything is in the monorepo and you can more easily track dependencies.<p>Cons:<p>- Its a technical challenge.  Git isn&#x27;t great at it although its getting better.<p>- If you do want to lean into linking source instead of binaries you now need to have a more consistent build system across your codebases.<p>I prefer working in them and in my opinions its approaching a personal preference choice.')
