Jabra&#x27;s can do the switching with 2 bluetooth devices. Airpods can do it between every Apple device, without doing anything. The situation you&#x27;re describing where you use the Jabra headsets&#x2F;phones with an iPad, tablet, and other Macbooks requires you to connect to the devices manually. It&#x27;s not always a pain but it&#x27;s not seamless like with Airpods. If you have to manually switch anything then you either don&#x27;t have them set up correctly or you intentionally turned something off. I don&#x27;t have to do anything to get my Airpods to switch devices.')
