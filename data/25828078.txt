It&#x27;s one of the most popular devices used to power hobbyist Tesla coils...<p>I don&#x27;t know why everyone seems to think that just because TVs were  &quot;receive-only&quot; devices, that they wouldn&#x27;t emit any sort of easily detectable signal.<p>Also, when this enforcement began, broadcast was the only source of TV content, so the presence of a TV was generally proof of watching broadcasts. There wasn&#x27;t really any need to prove the TV was tuned to any particular <i>content.</i><p>Now, whether it is a practical, effective method of enforcement that was actually used is another matter.')
