But you should also be calling that out, or you&#x27;re being misleading, as the <i>majority</i> of the 5950X numbers in the article were single-threaded results, and it did not appear in most of the multi-threaded comparisons at all.<p>But in multi-threaded workloads it also absolutely obliterates the M1. Making that comparison fairly moot (hence why Anandtech didn&#x27;t really do it). It&#x27;s pretty expected that the higher-power part is faster, that&#x27;s not particularly interesting.')
