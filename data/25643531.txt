Searching an online retailer for ECC brings me hundreds of results for &quot;non-ECC&quot; RAM. When they occasionally have 1-2 products with ECC, they aren&#x27;t as aggressively binned as the non-ECC sticks. They&#x27;ll have higher latencies and lower clock frequencies. Basically: you&#x27;ll need to accept gambling on being able to overclock your ECC RAM.')
