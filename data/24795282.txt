Twitter isn&#x27;t even in the business of providing a forum for speech.  They&#x27;re in the business of serving ads.<p>Your free speech cannot be infringed by a corporation, as the corporation does&#x27;t gatekeep anything but access to their platform that they own.  Your right to speech exists separate from their platform or their permission to use it.<p>And if you believe in the free market, you can&#x27;t complain that the largest social networks gravitate towards political ideologies that are most friendly to their profits.  You also have no obligation to participate in those networks if they don&#x27;t offer you a space that you enjoy participating in.<p>Just because the social networks that cater to you are smaller doesn&#x27;t mean your rights are being infringed upon.  It just means your ideas are less successful in a free and open marketplace of ideas.')
