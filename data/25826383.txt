It felt like they were highlighting this scenario like it was somehow weird or unusual that a pregnant mother was upset that she lost this data.<p>This &quot;fascination&quot; from the author is unhelpful IMHO.<p>I am not surprised that the pregnant mother was upset - in the UK it is now drilled into you that you need to keep track of kick data for your child and that you must - <i>must</i> - call the hospital as soon as you notice any change at all in kicking from your unborn child (1). They are deliberately very vague and unclear about what a &quot;change&quot; constitutes - just that if you feel something has changed then you need to call. From experience, these calls always end with a request that you go into hospital forward a check from a midwife. So 55 kicks today, but 58 yesterday?  Come in and a midwife will hook you up to keep track of your baby&#x27;s vitals for an hour just to be sure.<p>So no shit if you&#x27;ve entrusted this data to an app and they&#x27;ve dropped the ball, no wonder you are angry: they&#x27;ve potentially endangered the life of your unborn child because you don&#x27;t have your historical data to compare against any more, so you can&#x27;t know anymore if today&#x27;s kicks are changed from yesterday&#x27;s.<p>I am sure many people will scoff and call this an overreaction (including apparently the author of the article) but this is the current recommendation from the NHS here, and not everyone has a totally normal medical history or otherwise-textbook pregnancy where it is all skipping through meadows of wild daisys and baby ducklings quietly nuzzling at your feet followed by the perfect stress and pain free delivery in the presence of a live violin quartet welcoming your child into the world to Mozart. People have reason to need to trust that their medical data is stored safely and reliably.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhs.uk&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;keeping-well&#x2F;your-babys-movements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhs.uk&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;keeping-well&#x2F;your-babys-movemen...</a>')
