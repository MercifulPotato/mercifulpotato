It felt like they were highlighting this scenario like it was somehow weird or unusual that a pregnant mother was upset that she lost this data.<p>This &quot;fascination&quot; from the author is unhelpful IMHO.<p>I am not surprised that the pregnant mother was upset - in the UK it is now drilled into you that you need to keep track of kick data for your child and that you must - <i>must</i> - call the hospital as soon as you notice any change at all in kicking from your unborn child (1).<p>They are deliberately very vague and unclear about what a &quot;change&quot; constitutes - just that if you feel something has changed <i>at all</i> or in <i>any way</i> then you need to call. From experience, these calls always end with a request that you go into hospital for a check from a midwife. So 55 kicks today, but 60 yesterday?  Come in and a midwife will hook you up to keep track of your baby&#x27;s vitals for an hour just to be sure with lots of reassurance that you did the right thing by coming in and getting it checked.<p>So no shit if you&#x27;ve entrusted this data to an app and they&#x27;ve dropped the ball, no wonder you are angry: this is not just data for data&#x27;s sake - not having it potentially endangers the life of your unborn child because you don&#x27;t have your historical data to compare against any more, so you can&#x27;t know anymore if today&#x27;s kicks are changed from yesterday&#x27;s or the day before etc.<p>I am sure many people will scoff and call this an overreaction (including apparently the author of the article) but this is the current recommendation from the NHS here, and not everyone has a totally normal medical history or otherwise-textbook pregnancy where it is all skipping through meadows of wild daisys and baby ducklings quietly nuzzling at your feet followed by the perfect stress and pain free delivery. People can and do have medical circumstances that influence pregnancy. It ain&#x27;t all plain sailing.<p>People have reason to need to trust that their medical data is stored safely and reliably. To insinuate that is is odd is deeply unhelpful.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhs.uk&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;keeping-well&#x2F;your-babys-movements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhs.uk&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;keeping-well&#x2F;your-babys-movemen...</a>')
