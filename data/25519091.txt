I was waiting for right before the hour window.<p>Of course, 10 minutes after they sold my position, it quadrupled in value. I even already had had a limit sell order on the books! They cancelled my order, and executed their own, without any notice, outside of their own documented window.<p>When I contacted support and pointed them to the docs, their reply was that it could be “anywhere from 60-90 minutes before close.” Here is their email [1]. I asked them to provide a link to where their documentation says such - they never responded. I followed up twice.<p>Such utter bullshit. Immediately switched to ETrade and have had a great experience. There is a nice representative who’s direct phone number I can call and always reach, she always answers, and gives me any info or help I need. She called me within a week of me opening the account just to say hi and walk me through my account settings.<p>Also, sure, ETrade will auto sell your position too - within 10 minutes of market close. That sounds a lot more like protecting my investment, than a 60-90min window used to drain retail investors of their expiring options.<p>Edit: this page [2] still says &quot;about an hour&quot; to define the auto-exercise window.
