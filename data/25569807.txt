GIT is way nicer than making manual pkZIP backups, and there are nice refactoring tools in Lazarus... but it&#x27;s not THAT much better.<p>What was really surprising to me is the lack of GUI building IDEs for python, etc.   Now I know why they are scripting languages, and not application languages.')
