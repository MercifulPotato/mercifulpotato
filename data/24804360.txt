Most people just want to graduate and get on with life.<p>He is not interviewing people who want to &quot;get on with life&quot;. He&#x27;s interviewing people who are entering a Master&#x27;s program. In most areas of engineering, and <i>especially</i> in CS&#x2F;SW, one can get pretty good pay and make a living without an MS. So for MS and beyond, universities care more about academic rigor, etc, and whether what they learn is useful in industry is given a much lower weight (rightly so).<p>A lot of universities really don&#x27;t want MS&#x2F;PhD students who are using it to get a promotion or bump in pay. Some do compromise for MS students assuming they&#x27;re paying full tuition.<p>Chances are quite high that when they take a grad level course, the professor will expect you to know this. I did grad studies in a different engineering discipline, and professors generally had low tolerance for students who did not know something this basic.<p>Finally:<p>&gt; on something that is never stated that way in the real world?<p>I&#x27;m probably biased, but I often state this in the real world :-) It has not been a problem in professional settings.')
