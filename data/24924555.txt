Item(by='whack', descendants=None, kids=[24924813], score=None, time=1603922105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922268, text='<i>&gt; once someone knows the ins and outs of a system, sometimes there are very few barriers internally to check that an order&#x2F;paperwork is legit.</i><p>It sounds to me like they are using security-by-obscurity, as well as easily forgeable proofs such as &quot;signatures&quot; or drivers licenses (they&#x27;re only as secure as your ability to spot a forgery). Hence why anyone who is knowledgable and determined enough, can easily crack the system.<p>If you want to prevent such problems, you could either go really old-school. Require the person filing documents to show up in person, and be personally identified and recognized by someone in-house. Or go really new-school and only accept biometrics or digital paperwork that has been filed using a secure account accessible only by that person.<p>Using an in-between approach, like a signed paperwork that has been given to you by someone you don&#x27;t recognize, is the worst possible solution.')
