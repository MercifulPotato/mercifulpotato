In many countries, politics is just politics, it happens in the background and is about as heart felt as the weather report.<p>It can be controversial and felt by all sure, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a lifestyle or ideological platform that the general public use to divide themselves.<p>It&#x27;s backoffice stuff, for the most part, and I am too busy being friends to really mind what someone&#x27;s political views are, if they even think about it much at all themselves.<p>Now more than ever the US needs democracy, and the government needs to work harder than ever on protecting it.<p>But I argue that the people of America, the general public, need to give it a bloody rest with the politics. Be humans again and meet your neighbors as you are, part of the same cohort as citizens. Your vote is just as powerful, no matter how many flags, banners, or yard signs you have. Your vote is what decides the direction of your country, not the chest thumping and rallies and flag brigades.')
