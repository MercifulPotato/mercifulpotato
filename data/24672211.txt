A new professor joined the department the year after I took the class and he taught something else, so from then it depended who was teaching the course that year.  It was a small teaching university (we had 5 CS grads my year) that was part of the math department (it has since moved to the school of engineering).<p>I never touched any form of assembly after that course so I donâ€™t think it made a big difference one way or the other.  My memory is hazy, but I think there might have been a personal connection between my professor and Knuth - they are roughly from the same generation.')
