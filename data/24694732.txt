And if they’re not, then does the holobiont really persist over evolutionary time?&quot;<p>Genes aren&#x27;t <i>always</i> passed like heirlooms between generations either; only half of each parent. This doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me as a criticism. It sounds from this article alone like a repeatedly observed element of the process of selection.\nI would suppose a hologenome trait may only last for a few generations of <i>human</i> generations, perhaps many more. How much need we concern ourselves with the exact details of the dizzying number of bacterial generations.')
