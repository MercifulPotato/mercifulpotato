Stupid. Instead of admitting what a poor job you&#x27;re doing, you&#x27;re trying to suppress a student, unpaid student, that did a better job than you. (the you is of course the lecturer)<p>Anecdote: I was a professor of Computer Science from 2004 to 2006, for two years. I was teaching Compilers. I was 25 years old when I started, and Compilers was the worst possible course to teach. I was paid the miserable sum of 1,600 eur per year, which is why the usual &quot;university mafia&quot; wasn&#x27;t interested in putting someone else in that position (it happened at the end of my second year anyway, when the course was assigned to a full-time professor).<p>I didn&#x27;t want my students to pay $150 for the book, as this was Italy in early 2000s and students didn&#x27;t have a lot of money (probably true today), so I created a big handout book that they could download and print, free of charge, and released it with a Creative Commons license. Or you could order the printed version on Lulu (although, for some reason, this one had to have an &quot;all rights reserved&quot;) [0].<p>Anyway, at some point a professor in the Math department threatened me because students were using my handout to study regular expressions, and it was (in his mind) hurting the sales of the book they were using for his course; that book was of course authored by the professor, and he was making some money from it. How shameful.<p>Oh, yes: of course I ignored the threats.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lulu.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;ca&#x2F;shop&#x2F;simone-brunozzi&#x2F;dispense-lab-linguaggi-di-programmazione-e-compilatori-informatica-unipgit&#x2F;ebook&#x2F;product-159pjmjj.html?page=1&amp;pageSize=4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lulu.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;ca&#x2F;shop&#x2F;simone-brunozzi&#x2F;dispense-lab...</a>')
