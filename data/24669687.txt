There isn&#x27;t a single thread of consideration on the topic, only a dogpile of naysaying by anonymous commentariat of dubious credibility.  Presented with a difficult read, the comments clearly show nobody here actually tried.<p>Can a forum of programmers and techies really not fathom a computational approach to physics?
