I can&#x27;t think of any NES-PS1 platforming&#x2F;shooter&#x2F;action games that had 60 hours worth of content.<p>If you look at today&#x27;s RPGs, they&#x27;re still _really long_. It is expected that most players who play Persona 5 Royal will take over 100 hours to complete it, which is pretty wild considering it&#x27;s not a &#x27;grinding game&#x27;--players aren&#x27;t taking that long because they&#x27;re fighting the same enemies repeatedly hoping for a rare item to appear. There really is  100 hours&#x27; worth of contents.')
