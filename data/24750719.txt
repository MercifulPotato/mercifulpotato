Item(by='diogenescynic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602467099, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748481, text='&gt; Seeing the homelessness issues in SF and LA makes me wonder if they tipped the balance of those cities being uninhabitable by such a large percentage of their inhabitants that the are going to need to majorly restructured to make it back to a stable equilibrium.<p>This. I moved out of SF last October after being constantly harassed by homeless at my apartment building. I moved to the Peninsula, but now looking at moving out of the Bay Area entirely now that I can WFH permanently. Why live here? Cost of living is outrageously high, dangerous homeless all over, and now with COVID you can’t even really do anything... You’re better off in the suburbs with a backyard. Rental markets are already super tight in all the other cities that Bay Area residents normally move to.')
