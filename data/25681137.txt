Hale of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Georgia, was arrested in the rotunda in the Russell Senate Office Building<p>It was a trespassing group of chanting protestors that &quot;breached&quot; the lobby of a federal office building and refused to leave. They were arrested because their mob was only a few dozen people.<p>Technically, interfering with a federal employee&#x27;s ability to work is a felony.
