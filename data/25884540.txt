We appreciate your understanding, as this decision is final. (Facebook team)<p>Exactly this should be outlawed. Every action of this kind should be accompanied with clear and very specific (including time and date) specification of the reason.<p>&gt; What kind of %#*&amp; customer service is this that it takes over five months to even try to get ahold of a real human being to help with a problem!!!! This is horrible.<p>As well as this - not a single banning&#x2F;unbanning&#x2F;whatever decision should be automated. An automatic system can only pint to what is suspicious.<p>&gt; And the unique nature of Facebook makes this type of case impossible to mediate.<p>It is not unique. And everything has been unique at first anyway. We just need to define and regulate this kind of service.<p>Nevertheless users who are stupid enough to actually rely on Facebook without having backup communication channels and backup picture storage just have to be educated about this is stupid. Whenever somebody says they want to communicate via the Messenger I don&#x27;t even consider this because this is just insane, even to install this app is crazy. Sadly, too many people say this nowadays.')
