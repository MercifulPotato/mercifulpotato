I am pretty sure you are not qualified to assess how smart someone is via the Internet.  You just believe your opinion is more worthy or more accepted then the one you are attacking.<p>And I couldn&#x27;t agree more with the parent you are replying to.<p>Cases are popping up.  These days, we dont have to wait for the media to tell us how harsh covid really is.  I know a number of people who have got it, and everyone of these is fine again.  There was one case of a hospitalisation, but that person went to hospital with a lung problem last year as well, so they are what we call a risk patient I guess.\nWaving the triaging situation around like you are jesus doesnt help either I&#x27;m afraid.  Citizens are well aware that the triaging is due to politicians <i>NOT</i> putting extra money into the health care system.  No, instead they were busy pouring tons of money into airlines and other industries which managed to cry wolf.  I am convinced that if we instead had put only a fraction of that money into the health system, triaging would be way off in the future.  But hey, it is easier to sell the measures if you can point at the health system breaking down.')
