Access already solved most of the no-code issues. In our SME I wrote a key business application using standard Access forms and a database. There&#x27;s a few lines of VBA code but that&#x27;s it. I could of wrote a bespoke app in a modern language which would of taken days and weeks. But access allowed me to get a system working in a few days. We&#x27;re still using that system years later.<p>Developers will complain this system isn&#x27;t scalable and lacks testing, but for a small business or small team that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed.<p>Another key problem is that with simple tools you empower non-technical users to do their job faster. If you obfuscate the data behind an application you become dependent on software developers for maintenance which increases cost and reduces resiliency. For large corporates, this can mean removing an army of low-cost administrators and replacing them with an army of high-cost software developers.')
