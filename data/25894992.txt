Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25895101, 25895751, 25895675, 25895271], score=None, time=1611516722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894304, text='$75,000 isn&#x27;t what it used to be, so this is a pretty comically obvious headline.<p>The median sale price of a house in the US in the year 2000 was around $163,000. Now it&#x27;s $324,000.<p>Meanwhile $48,000 in income then is now $75,000 today inflation adjusted, according to the BLS. If you stayed in that general income bracket, you&#x27;ve been royally punched in the face economically.<p>And then we get to the cost of healthcare and education over the past 20 years. Someone in the $75,000 tier has spent the last two decades being financially tortured as their disposable income is being eroded by persistently rising costs they can&#x27;t do much about (go without healthcare, don&#x27;t buy a house, don&#x27;t send the kids to college, don&#x27;t have kids).<p>That $324,000 house today will cost you $1,500 per month. After all taxes are accounted for, in a normal tax state, you&#x27;re going to likely have ~$4,250 per month; after that house, you&#x27;re down to $2,750; and that&#x27;s before you get to any bills or saving. The only shot a person at $75,000 has today, is to live somewhere where the cost of living is quite low, or to pair up with someone and hopefully double that income (and that still won&#x27;t be enough if you&#x27;re in a more expensive location).')
