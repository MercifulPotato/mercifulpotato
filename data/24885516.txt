The data sets are published under the Open Database License (ODbL) and are available to everyone and can be used free of charge. On the service <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessibility.cloud&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessibility.cloud&#x2F;</a> , which is the technical backend of Wheelmap.org, more data is shown, provided by partners with varying licences. Sozialhelden e.V. merely incorporates this data into the map.<p>It&#x27;s really good to see a project like this open up it&#x27;s data for sharing and re-use.')
