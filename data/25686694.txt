WhatsApp finds contacts by phone number, and messages them over SMS if they are not themselves on WhatsApp. (At least, I thought it did?)<p>So I&#x27;m saying I assume the situation after deleting WhatsApp is the same as if you&#x27;d never had it, SMS.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t make sense for User B deleting WhatsApp to cause B&#x27;s phone number to disappear from User A&#x27;s contacts.')
