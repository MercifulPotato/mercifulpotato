I think HVAC has gotten too complex for a lot of the &quot;hand waving&quot; that HVAC installers have been able to get away with up until now. It actually takes a good amount of  pre-planning and research in order to install the proper system that is configured correctly.<p>Case in point, a few years ago when I was a new homeowner I converted to natural gas from oil and got three quotes from three highly rated companies. All three companies recommended the exact same boiler.  A few months ago I started to research the outdoor reset functionality that allows it to change the water temperature based on the outdoor temp. Well, I discovered that the feature is basically useless for me because both of my zones are too small to generate the minimum number of BTUs at lower temperatures. So I have a (up to) 96% efficient boiler that will never be able to reach that efficiency. I either would have needed a smaller boiler and or a buffer tank to be able to work correctly.')
