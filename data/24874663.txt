You know him. So do I. Now, does your knowledge of him justify this headline:<p>&quot;Richard Stallman resigns from FSF, MIT after defending child rape&quot; - OSNews<p>Seriously. Yes, he&#x27;s awkward around women, and has sometimes hit on women in sometimes cringeworthy ways. He&#x27;s also awkward around men, for that reason. There&#x27;s a difference like night and day between the actual issues, which are about on-par for much of the population, and what&#x27;s reported. Heck, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s about on-par for about half of the MIT student body back when it was a genuine nerd school rather than the &quot;#1 branded university in the world.&quot;<p>But he knows that no means no, he doesn&#x27;t mean harm, and he doesn&#x27;t abuse his power.<p>And compare the treatment he gets to other people in position of power. Compare that to the MANY MIT faculty who DO use power dynamics to abuse female students, and who DID fly to Epstein&#x27;s island to party. Heck, compare that to executives and politicians, or, well, many others in positions of power. You&#x27;re not going to convince me Stallman is worse than the median there, or even the 25th percentile. It&#x27;s just that one group is politically savvy, and the other, socially awkward.<p>And this is exactly how you get a plausible smear. You start with a smaller issue, and you twist and exaggerate it until you have a pedophile-rapist. And yes, it was intentional.')
