I was sitting on the fence between an Apple Watch and the Garmin 945.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with the Garmin 945 all day tracking, the ability to track activities for over 12 hours (GPS, routing, and bunch of metrics), and good battery life.  While the software ecosystem in Garmin feels a bit rough, it&#x27;s usable.  It&#x27;s the software that makes it stand apart from these lower priced offerings.  Even the Garmin VivoActive has interesting metrics when paired with software Garmin Connect.')
