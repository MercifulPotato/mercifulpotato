I agree and also humbly disagree. Let me please explain.<p>So the product and service is #1. We have various ideas how to execute this. This doesn&#x27;t mean we believe we can &quot;beat&quot; Amazon. That isn&#x27;t our goal at all, nor does it need to be. Our goal is to make it easy and convenient for the average American to shop sustainable friendly products.<p>That said, because it&#x27;s worker owned co-op vs an investor owned business there is potential to actually build &quot;a customer centric company&quot; ;) This is bc unlike Amazon we aren&#x27;t under same economic pressures as a typical VC or investor owned company.<p>Plus, there is growing concern around income inequality, job security and general democracy both in the work place and in society. Consumers are looking for alternatives. By building this as a worker owned co-op we address all these things and more.<p>Yes &quot;content&quot; or product&#x2F;service is king, but by building it as a worker owned co-op we may actually have a market advantage that consumers will be able to see.')
