That it&#x27;s proper function should only be to protect the rights of individuals via it&#x27;s monopoly on force. Of course, &#x27;what are an individual&#x27;s rights?&#x27; is a whole other conversation. The government does provide many legitimate services, but they are things that I think can, and should, be done privately. The fact that the government has the monopoly on force is one of the reasons why it&#x27;s purview should be so restrained.')
