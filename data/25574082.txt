I miss it to this day!<p>Actually that was the main reason why I stayed on OS X 10.9 for quite a while. I liked the dang glossy buttons and progress bars! Had to update when I later needed then-current Xcode for my job. I don&#x27;t regret though â€” by doing this I essentially skipped the buggy mess that 10.10 and 10.11 were. I had stable WiFi <i>and</i> nice UI while everyone around me was complaining.')
