When we started thoroughly documenting our bug-fixes publicly, they used that against us in negotiations on a large deal. Basically alluding that our software was buggy, seeing that we had something to fix every week. Luckily we thwarted that logical fallacy by asking how many bug fixes they did last year and had no real answer.<p>People suck. Glad to hear you’ve overcome the fear on this, it’s worth it and I also still maintain a public list of bug fixes.')
