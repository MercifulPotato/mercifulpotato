Item(by='cannedslime', descendants=None, kids=[25137909], score=None, time=1605692514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25133593, text='&gt; I canâ€™t believe the left are advocating censorship and the right are advocating letting people decide for themselves.<p>Why? Show me a &quot;leftist&quot; regime that is pro free speech and exchange of information. The greatest examples of communist regimes all had secret police and strictly controlled borders.<p>Modern leftism is basically just corporatism and globalism. Sure the leftists say they want healthcare and all, but do they also want to work and pay for it? Its easy to say you just want something and not regard the hard work and sacrifice it will require.<p>Edit: Its so easy to down vote, but apparently not so easy to list just ONE &quot;leftist&quot; regime that didn&#x27;t turn out to become a censored shithole :-) I love you HN!')
