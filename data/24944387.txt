It&#x27;s pretty much what our users have asked for, and we&#x27;re continuing to listen to their feedback.<p>That being said, our entire ethos is to have a functional free forever plan, where users can manage their tasks and run their sprints, without worrying about hitting a 10 user limit, limited-time trials or task limits. We&#x27;re avid supporters of open source, and we believe closed source software should have wider availability. So much of B2B software is behind paywalls, demos and short trials, hence our approach.')
