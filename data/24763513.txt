Looks &quot;badass&quot; according to a nearby 15-year-old. While technically the keys are labeled, in practice looking at them is useless, especially in anything less than bright room lighting, so they are, for me, effectively blank.<p>As a reasonably fast touch typist for many years, I found that for prose it was basically no change. But. There were enough things that were a total drag that I couldn&#x27;t keep using it.<p>There are times when the key you need to hit isn&#x27;t part of a flow, and you have to hit it perfectly: passwords, Illustrator&#x2F;Photoshop commands, punctuation-heavy inputs like URLs, postal addresses, etc. I&#x27;m not a programmer, and others will have other things they do.<p>So, I bought normal keycaps and replaced them on just the letter and number keys. Much better.')
