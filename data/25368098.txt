He also matched the voters with NCOA database, that could indicate that people from other states voted and things like that.<p>One of the people they&#x27;ve surveyed was Nahshon Garrett:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTDEIGVoWhI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTDEIGVoWhI</a><p>As much as I&#x27;d love to have the actual data myself, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s going to just post it publicly. He started the project to verify whether the lists of supposedly dead voters that were floating around the web were real. The thing is that people who were posting them were all almost immediately banned for doxxing. So unfortunately, he will only give you the actual data if you&#x27;re someone trustworthy, so a lawyer, politician, journalist or something like that. His research is included as evidence in some of the ongoing court cases.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people have said that he might just be a grifter. I personally don&#x27;t care, since I never donate to anything like that, but if you&#x27;re considered about this, he posted the expenses on twitter. I believe a lot of money went to the call centers.<p>And look, it very well might be, that it&#x27;s literally nothing. But this type of research is realistically as best as you can possibly get. What would confirm whether it&#x27;s true or not is the state or the feds doing an investigation, but they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in doing anything. But one way or another, removing his fundraiser was a complete bullshit.')
