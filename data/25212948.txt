Their findings show that this is not the reason behind the majority of people with engineering degrees doing non-engineering work. I don&#x27;t know how the results compare to those in the US or UK, but it certainly is an eye-opening data point. Some highlights:<p>- According to the 2011 NHS, only 29.7 per cent (67,045 out of 225,490) of employed individuals in Ontario with bachelor’s degrees or higher in engineering were working as engineers or engineering managers. A further 37 per cent (83,365 out of 225,490) worked in professional positions that normally require a university degree. In other words, only just over 65 per cent of employed Ontarians with engineering degrees were gainfully employed in professions that normally require or benefit from having a university degree.<p>- Those who were not working as engineers and were working in positions that don’t necessarily require a degree made up fully 33.3 per cent (75,090 out of 225,490) of the total.<p>So, as an engineering graduate, you are more likely to work in a job that does not require a degree, than in a job that requires an engineering degree.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ospe.on.ca&#x2F;public&#x2F;documents&#x2F;advocacy&#x2F;2015-crisis-in-engineering-labour-market.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ospe.on.ca&#x2F;public&#x2F;documents&#x2F;advocacy&#x2F;2015-crisis...</a>')
