Then you install the Pinterest browser button. Then, when you search the web for these things and you find them you save an image to your board. Or you can search Pinterest itself for these things and save the links to your boards.<p>Later, when you go to your board you have all these images in one place so you can easily compare them.<p>Of course some people find this cumbersome and limiting and prefer to usebrowser tabs and bookmarks and folders, and that&#x27;s fine if it works for them.')
