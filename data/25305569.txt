That&#x27;s something I found incredibly refreshing about Andrew Yang&#x27;s presidential run. Unlike every other progressive in America who has followed EU&#x27;s lead by saying &quot;we need universal healthcare because it&#x27;s a human right&quot;, his take was &quot;we should have healthcare because a safety net like that will encourage entrepreneurialism and therefore innovation.&quot;')
