Nothing about the situation has changed.<p>&gt; It cost $100k to hire someone who was willing&#x2F;able to do his work and come into the office.<p>Well, see, now you are adding a thing. That&#x27;s the entire point of this article. The company didn&#x27;t outsource the job before. Plus, with lower office space requirements and fewer commuters, companies will save money without touching salaries. If being in an office is a requirement, then sure, but the premise of the argument is that these jobs are being done just as productively without physical presence.<p>&gt; People in the Bay Area (etc) were being payed wages far, far above the national rate.<p>Says you. Bay Area pay rates were at a premium because the best talent went there for the network effects. Now there is a diaspora happening. The talent is still worth the premium rate (otherwise the employer already would have looked to lower their basis), so why should it go down just because the IP that connects to their company VPN is in Arizona instead of California? That seems backwards to me.<p>I completely understand the motives of the company, but the employees should absolutely not accept that. One day good software engineers (etc.) might be that fungible, but they aren&#x27;t today.')
