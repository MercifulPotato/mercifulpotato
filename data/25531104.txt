I honest-to-god thought I was being phished. The email had one of those titles, a typo in the body, no tracking number, was sent from a third party domain. the template email told me to click a link to an external third party via a url shortner, and when you got there you had to enter your &quot;email address and password&quot; which turns out is actuallu my work SSO login and it checks via ldap.
