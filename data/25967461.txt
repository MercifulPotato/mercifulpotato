I picked OpenCL, because I knew I was writing all my non-BLAS code myself, and there&#x27;s no way in hell I&#x27;ll voluntarily lock myself into a closed ecosystem. (PS: CLBlast, which is different from CLblas, is a joy!)<p>I was pleasantly surprised. I found OpenCL very nice to work with indeed! And my code runs on any modern GPU out there. I&#x27;ve tested it on Intel integrated GPUs, AMD GPUs, and Nvidia&#x27;s fancy datacenter devices. And even CPUs. Seamlessly, through a runtime switch fully controlled by the application itself!<p>Now, could I have gotten more performance out of CUDA? Yeah, I estimate about a factor 2. For the cost of tying myself to a proprietary, locked in technology from a hostile vendor, throwing out two major classes of devices, and losing the ability to test out code anywhere. Not worth it.<p>I hope OpenCL has life in it still. The stuff I keep reading that CUDA is far easier to approach definitely did not ring true to this beginner.')
