Like I&#x27;ve said before the history of the world is a history of conspiracy, and often the people who were calling out those things were labelled as &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as basically a form of ad hominem attack. I can&#x27;t tell you how often I was talking about the NSA et al <i>prior to Snowden</i>, but was called the same thing. Then almost all of those people now bend over backwards to say stuff like &quot;well, we all knew it, why are you surprised?&quot; etc, but it&#x27;s just dismissing the fact that many conspiracy theories have truth to them.<p>Like I said, everyone is a conspiracy theorist, they just want to get to pick and choose which ones they like. Russiagate is a conspiracy theory that the mainstream media and many people pushed for 4 years, for example. We literally just had a &quot;billionare&quot; pedophile sex-trafficker assassinated in one of the most secure prisons in the world, with connections and likely blackmail material on tons of high up businessmen and politicians. Memory holed - these are not the conspiracy theories you are looking for.')
