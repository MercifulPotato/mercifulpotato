The classic book &quot;How To Win Friends And Influence People&quot; even mentions this strategy when discussing winning people over to your ideas.<p>People are far more willing to promote an idea they played a role in creating than one which they are just a passive party to. In large organizations, getting buy-in is critical to moving anything forward, so you need to have higher-ups going to bat for your ideas.<p>One way to use this approach to your career advantage is to make sure you are a few steps ahead once the idea takes hold.
