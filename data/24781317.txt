FTP had a couple of edge cases that were very nifty (like connect to server 1; connect to server 2; tell server 2 to listen; tell server 1 to send to server 2&#x27;s port; voila, transfer from server1 to server 2 without ever transferring the data to your own host!) but I don&#x27;t know that anyone ever actually used them.<p>SFTP came along as basically a working, feature-complete replacement. Once it became production-ready, I don&#x27;t think there was anywhere for FTP to go.')
