They use the heat from the combustion engine to move heat from inside the cabin to the outside world. So you are literally using heat to move other heat.&quot;</i><p>Car air-conditioners are not powered by <i>heat</i> from the combustion engine. They are powered mechanically by a belt (&quot;serpentine belt&quot;) connected to the engine.<p>Or, in some cases such as battery electric vehicles, powered electrically with the compressor turned by an integrated electric motor. The extra heat produced is just a byproduct (thermal inefficiency) of producing and transmitting that mechanical&#x2F;electrical energy.')
