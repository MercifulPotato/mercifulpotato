I mean, I know I could use an iphone 6s or whatever other phone until it dies. But for a piece of tech I use more than any other, I&#x27;ll spend the extra dough. Part hobby, part utility. Note also the extra dough here is pretty small compared to say a car hobbyist.<p>In many other ways I&#x27;m fairly frugal. I very rarely buy new clothes for instance, and for non-tech things am pretty minimalistic.<p>It&#x27;s all about what you value.')
