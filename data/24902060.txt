They can be expressed as &quot;summation ::= factor ((PLUS | MINUS) factor) * &quot; and factor can be similarly defined as &quot;factor ::= multiplicand ((MUL | DIV) multiplicand) * &quot;.<p>Authors of PTAPG note that these regularities can be exploited for speed. And I think &quot;parsing with derivatives&quot; techniques can be used for speedy parsing too.')
