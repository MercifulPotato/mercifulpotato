Some of the most devout Christians I know are scientists, and extremely logical people too. Precisely <i>because</i> they know how the sausage of Official Science is made, and are naturally inquisitive people, they are not shy to question our supposedly-scientific understanding of the universe (i.e. our best guesses at how it all started) and eventually resolve that doubt with (what they think is) an equally-unprovable act of faith. (Note: this is not about creationism, we’re talking Big Bang etc).<p>I don’t disagree that human communication is often an oxymoron, simply because of how bodies work.
