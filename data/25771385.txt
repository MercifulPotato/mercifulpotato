It&#x27;s not like Tim Cook or Craig Federighi is running around demanding people add Apple apps to a firewall exclusion list. They have much bigger things to worry about.<p>It&#x27;s just that as an engineer you are often in a bubble and can&#x27;t foresee every implication of your decision. That&#x27;s why Apple has the Developer and Public Beta releases for iOS&#x2F;OSX so that external users can provide feedback. And on this occasion just like on many other they will take action if necessary.')
