If they tell you how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. Outdoor toilet? OMG, please!<p>It annoys me to no end that with the current environmental catastrophes, almost nobody approaches this with a quantitative engineering mindset, especially the ones who care most: Progressives (of which I consider myself one).<p>It‘s mindblowing how I can‘t buy a plastic wrapped cucumber in the organic shop even though it reduces waste from damage by 30%.<p>In a country where we recycle or cleanly incinerate 99% of plastic.<p>When 70% of the oceans‘ plastic comes from 4 rivers, none of them in Europe.<p>And they feel great about it, as if they‘re actually doing something.<p>Repeat after me: Large scale change will not come from individualized action. It just doesn‘t scale. The only working solution is to make the ecological choice economical.<p>The first way is the Elon Musk way. Just make the alternative better than the original. Best, but needs an extremely long breath with flawless vision and execution.<p>The second is large scale regulation. As much as I hate a lot about the EU bureaucracy, they did exactly the right things with incandescent lamps. Flat out banned them over a period of 10 years.<p>The same people who whined in the beginning about how mean the state is towards their free choice are now sitting in LED illuminated rooms with lower watts, better long life and almost equal CRI. All catalyzed by a removal of alternatives on the horizon.<p>I believe the just started CO2 tax can do the same.')
