The Pharisees might have thought so, for he rejected their beliefs and tenets. Was Shiva (Adiyogi) disabled? The royal court of Parvati&#x27;s father (the King) probably thought so. He showed up to his own wedding seemingly drunk and disheveled, probably had not changed his mud colored tunic in years, and did not follow their social graces. Disability is a matter of perspective from society.')
