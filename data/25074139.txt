I&#x27;m a huge Stripe fan, but this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Here&#x27;s the exact notification that went out on April 6, 2018 in the dashboard:<p>&quot;As a user of Stripe Subscriptions, you will get all the functionality of Stripe Billing&#x27;s starter plan with no change in price. You can continue using it free of charge on your existing Stripe pricing, even beyond the $1M free threshold. This will be automatically applied to your account. Contact support@stripe.come with any pricing questions&quot;<p>As far as I can see, the Billing Starter plan has not changed and still applies. Not only that, it claims we get &quot;all the functionality of Stripe Billing..&quot; when this hasn&#x27;t been the case for a few months. New features have been gated recently, ie. the new customer portal.<p>You have every right to change your pricing how you see fit. However, if this message was worded as it being a grace period, we would have taken steps two years ago to consider other tools or building something in-house.')
