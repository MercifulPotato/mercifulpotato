Essentially all enterprises become cooperatively owned by the people who WORK for the enterprise.  People have accounts with the Central Bank of their nation, etc...\nThis stuff is pretty straightforward to do since banking is almost entirely automatable now.<p>But that&#x27;s far too egalitarian to catch on with the current state of affairs. :-)')
