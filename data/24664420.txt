Some state universities offer much better quality and reputation of their programs than the ones in other states. The way that college is marketed as a social vehicle is that you choose the best one that you can get into, and it&#x27;s worth paying for because of the connections and job opportunities you&#x27;ll get there. (Scam! Holding people hostage for runaway credentialism!)<p>For instance, several state universities are listed as top-tier mechanical and aerospace engineering schools (consider Purdue vs. Mizzou aerospace engineering), so if you want to seriously compete in the field, it could be worth your money to join the &quot;better&quot; school from out-of-state, assuming you&#x27;re a competitive student. The recruiting, research, and internship opportunities at top state schools are way better than at low&#x2F;mid state schools.<p>However, from a pragmatic standpoint, you are correct- it is unwise to select these schools if you can better afford the in-state discount. You just have to deal with the limitation of your selection of available fields and prestige of chosen degree. (That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s a scam; as any honest manager will tell you, degree&#x2F;curriculum content means very little relative to job performance; the top performers come from top schools not because the top schools made them top performers, but because they were already top performers in high school and just got chosen by top schools.)')
