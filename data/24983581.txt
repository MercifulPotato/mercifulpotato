The first languages have I learned as a young child made an strong impression in my mental visualisation of programming concepts even of I haven&#x27;t used them in many years. I found notes on my iPhone using the arrow syntax with snake_case variables. And from the pictures he looks about my age so I&#x27;d say 30 is a real possibility as well.')
