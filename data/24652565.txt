Many of us have much more limited color perception due to colorblindness.  I recently purchased some 8 cable 1&#x2F;4&quot; TRS snakes, and the only thing identifying which connector on one side of the snake was connected to a connector on the other side were colored bands--many of which I couldn&#x27;t tell apart. I ended up pulling out a multimeter to test continuity, and then labeled then with unique glyphs on each end that weren&#x27;t dependent on color (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.).')
