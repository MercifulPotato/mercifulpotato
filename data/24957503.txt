There are semantic models of `F + Not(Con(F))` that accurately describe the theory. The difference is that these models contain nonstandard natural numbers (these nonstandard numbers become the Godel numberings of the proofs of `Not(Con(F))`) if `F` is &quot;truly&quot; consistent (according to the standard model of PA).<p>The fact that there must be semantic models of any consistent theory is a cornerstone of first-order logic and is e.g. not true of second-order logic. This follows from Godel&#x27;s Completeness Theorem (not Incompleteness Theorems).')
