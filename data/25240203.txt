It&#x27;s 50%.<p>I don&#x27;t see back people speaking for other poc. I see black people speaking about their own experiences, and you discounting those experiences because they may not be shared by other poc.<p>It also seems strange to me that you believe racism is always cross-cultural. The causes of anti-black, anti-middle eastern, and anti-asian discrimination by americans are all different, why do you assume they&#x27;d be the same. Things get even more complicated when you add other cultures to the mix. You presumably don&#x27;t discount caste discrimination against one caste because the others didn&#x27;t experience it, so why presume that someone who is prejudiced against black people must also be prejudiced against asians?<p>While there is racism against asian people in tech in the bay, it&#x27;s usually model minority related things, or language based (or there are other kinds but less common in a workplace context). Less about being unqualified, and more about being  <i>different</i>. It wouldn&#x27;t at all surprise me if the multiracial leadership team of coinbase set the culture such that certain forms of prejudice (that affect the leadership) were not allowed, while certain forms of prejudice (that perhaps the leadership shares, or perhaps they are simply ambivalent about) can fester.')
