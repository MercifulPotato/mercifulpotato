Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607880056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404937, text='right, but the question is whether speeding is actually that dangerous in the first place. it&#x27;s not at all clear that absolute speed is a major contributor to the rate of accidents. we do know from physics that <i>relative</i> speed is a major factor in the severity of accidents, and this is supported by the empirical data. in particular, the probability of death when a pedestrian is struck increases sharply past ~20 mph.<p>I think we could have a much better discussion (and perhaps policy) if we distinguished more clearly between driving near pedestrians and driving on limited-access roads. I&#x27;m actually a big fan of speed cameras in cities and other dense areas, since they allow me to drive at what I consider a safe speed (at or below the posted limit) without worrying about cars flying past me at a high relative speed. on US highways, the situation is kind of absurd. I can exceed the posted limit by 50% without coming close to the limit of my car&#x27;s mechanical grip. if I have a good line of sight and there&#x27;s minimal traffic, why shouldn&#x27;t I?')
