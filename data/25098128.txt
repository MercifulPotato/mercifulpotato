I still suffer from depression but I have found ways to deal with it. I am better at redirecting thoughts and containing them. I was able to finish few books in the last 2 weeks and continue with a morning walk routine. Those books really helped me understood why I was failing at modern life.<p>I cut mainstream social media from my life and reduced screen time. I am more optimistic. I am able to fight against the profitable pessimism.<p>I am reducing the urge to hoard more material belongings. I learnt that on HN. I was able to let go off fancy toys and electronics that I didn&#x27;t use anymore but kept because I bought them and grown attached to them. If I don&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s better someone else can. I don&#x27;t want to keep them on eBay for months.<p>4x faster than before? I don&#x27;t care to look more unless I need it.<p>I re-evaluate my room and budget every month in order to cut down what isn&#x27;t needed. If I don&#x27;t do that, I will keep using past as a justification for piling up more til I suffocate between Amazon boxes.<p>I bought a dustbin for my neighborhood because people were throwing wrappers outside and placed it with a note. So far, some people are using it and that makes me happy. Reciprocity is a powerful tool and I am optimistic someone will think about what I did and do the same in future.<p>I write more using a paper notebook. goals, priorities, learnings, etc. Software note taking tools suck because they limit your freedom on what you can do. At the end of my todos, I make origami pets from them as a reminder of what I able to accomplish.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid of being messy. Here&#x27;s my notes from a few days ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;yPGb4Z8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;yPGb4Z8</a><p>They aren&#x27;t coherent but just enough to remind me.')
