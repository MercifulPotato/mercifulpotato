I have about two years of experience as a Software Developer and have been programming for about ten years (since I was 15). I’ve successfully launched an app on the App Store using React Native. I have developed and debugged features of web and mobile products, so I&#x27;m familiar with both the debugging and the development phase of software development. I was previously in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp so I am familiar with both Frontend and Backend development. I&#x27;m open to both full time positions and freelance work. I really love technology and would love to contribute to a project.')
