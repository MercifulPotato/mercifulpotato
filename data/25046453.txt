You get the benefit of a small team and large impact inside the org which feels nice to a certain kind of person. The company is big and mature enough that you get decent impact on the world as well. Also great for many people<p>And most importantly, the company can afford to pay well. Not quite FAANG level, but plenty for you to reasonably plan to retire (in a FIRE way) at 50 instead of 65.<p>And heck if it does hit, you’re early enough for a nice cushy bonus.<p>edit: yes the difference in comp is easily 100k+, but making 180k+ cash to not be a small cog in a gigantic machine, to me, doesn’t sound that bad')
