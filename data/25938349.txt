I&#x27;m not aware of any way to make a donation so I decided I&#x27;d just pay the $48&#x2F;year to upgrade my account as an alternative.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a (personal, &quot;offline&quot;) project for about the last week and a half -- meaning so I&#x27;ve not been sitting at my workstation during that time -- or else I almost certainly would have <i>just</i> upgraded to the now defunct bronze&#x2F;starter plan.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy some extra CI&#x2F;CD minutes (which I don&#x27;t use) or something similar as a way to show support for the company by giving them a few dollars.')
