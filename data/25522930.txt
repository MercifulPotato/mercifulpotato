I supported them monthly for years with a small amount, then this year I wanted to direct my funds to some other cause and they asked me to send an email explaining why I wanted to cancel my monthly payment.<p>Luckily my card expired shortly after so I didn&#x27;t bother, and since then they send weekly emails telling me that updating my card info is just &quot;one click away&quot;.<p>Sorry AVAAZ.<p>Since then I am very careful to only use PayPal for recurring subscriptions or donations.')
