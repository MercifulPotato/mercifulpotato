Would love a version that went further back, to show evolution over time (which could be animated). I dislike the maps focusing on geographical area because they give the impression that the country is overwhelmingly red, when per capita, that&#x27;s clearly not true. At the end of the day though, it all depends what you&#x27;re trying to convey.')
