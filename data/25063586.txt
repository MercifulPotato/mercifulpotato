I have family photos going back to the Civil War.<p>Besides, Wordstar and Wordperfect files used to be ubiquitous. Good luck with those today.<p>I switched my mail from Outlook to Thunderbird because the former stores the email in some undocumented unreadable binary format. TB stores the mail as text, so I can recover the mail without needing TB. I have mail going back 25 years now. Some of my earlier mail is now lost because, surprise surprise, the mail program no longer works and the data is stored in a proprietary format.<p>I unzipped all my old file archives a few years back out of concern that some of the old DOS archive software would disappear.')
