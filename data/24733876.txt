But there&#x27;s a wide range between the concentration of capital we have now, and the notion of it all being somehow distributed equally. It&#x27;s not so much about <i>giving</i> capital to workers, it&#x27;s more about retarding the natural flow of capital to itself. If the economy were only made up of 100-person factories, then there might be enough competition and experimentation that more capital would find its way to innovation and labor, rather than being drawn to large concentrations of wealth. I&#x27;m not saying we need to go to that extreme, but there is much room for progress in that direction.<p>Looking farther into the future, with AI and robotic labor, it&#x27;s quite possible that everyone <i>would</i> have the capital to direct a large factory. As it stands now, it appears likely that any such robotic future would be owned almost exclusively by a tiny fraction of humanity.')
