Item(by='cosmie', descendants=None, kids=[24805554], score=None, time=1602884776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805145, text='Technically you do have column types already[1], although only available via the data model[2] (another wholly underutilized feature set).<p>Although it only helps to an extent, since it doesn&#x27;t prevent bad data from being input into a table, and supports so many implicit conversions (listed out in [1]) that undesired behavior is still possible. Plus it enters into a little known area of Excel rather than baked into the customary workflows.<p>That said, it still comes in handy. A typical pattern of mine for worksheets I have to release into the wild (i.e. no telling who will end up (ab)using it and when it&#x27;ll eventually come back to me in a bastardized form to salvage) is:<p>1. Create table(s) for raw&#x2F;user-inputted data<p>2. Use that table as a source for PowerQuery<p>3. Leverage PowerQuery for type checking, data normalization validation, and data joining.<p>4. Output to a new table on the worksheet, referencing this instead of the original table for all formulas.<p>Also optionally putting complex logic into the PowerQuery steps, that way the &quot;output&quot; table is ready for end-use and doesn&#x27;t require any complex and error-prone formulas or anything.<p>Even without leveraging the data model and DAX functions, this works out super well. More sophisticated users can easily modify the PowerQuery steps, and less sophisticated users are protected from accidental mistakes by either using it as-is or reaching out for help earlier on, <i>before</i> there&#x27;s a crisis for assistance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;create-a-data-model-in-excel-87e7a54c-87dc-488e-9410-5c75dbcb0f7b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;create-a-data-mod...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;data-types-in-data-models-e2388f62-6122-4e2b-bcad-053e3da9ba90" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;data-types-in-dat...</a>')
