I guess bridging system APIs to web apps could result in additional security and privacy holes, but game controller support seems like an eminently solvable issue, especially considering that Luna will access game controllers out of the box in Safari without any webkit extensions or bridging the native bluetooth APIs.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that apps like Scriptable also appear to bridge native APIs to webkit and JavaScript.')
