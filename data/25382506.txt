Right after a state propaganda organ, I mean news organization, went after pornhub. Given how depraved the media industry is, I bet they knew all about the illegal activities on pornhub too. Of course we have to hold our tongue because they are the protected privileged class we aren&#x27;t allowed to offend.<p>There seems to be a pattern. State propaganda targets company or person X immediately followed by physical or financial deplatforming or state&#x2F;federal&#x2F;international legislative&#x2F;regulatory action.<p>If there are illegal activities on pornhub, shouldn&#x27;t that be a legal matter? Why is visa or mastercard involved in this? What&#x27;s next? Visa and mastercard will ban certain organizations that supported illegal wars? Won&#x27;t be holding my breath on that one.<p>Edit: And of course the insta-downvote.')
