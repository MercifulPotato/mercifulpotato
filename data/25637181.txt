I&#x27;ve certainly accepted an offer late in the year and then didn&#x27;t start until the new year.<p>Probably not as big of a rush as the end of school year rush in summer though.<p>I also doubt that new people will be breaking production on day one. Even at a fast moving startup I&#x27;d expect it to take a bit to go through the onboarding paperwork, get a laptop and actually try pushing a change to production.')
