The majority of Grafana is browser-side rendered data of queries which are just passed through Grafana to the data source. It&#x27;s fairly light weight.<p>Security wise, as far as I know AWS isn&#x27;t offering anything additional here.<p>The argument of &quot;but you&#x27;re paying to not have to worry about it!&quot; that is a fair argument. But comments like this seem to purposely over-state the difficulty of running a not-super-complicated tool like Grafana in order to make &quot;only $600&#x2F;month, or $7.2k&#x2F;year&quot;, sound more appealing.')
