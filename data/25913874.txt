We had a system accepting a certain kind of applications. We would normally get about ~1500 a day, following a pattern with a steady amount during working hours, many in the evening, and almost nothing during the night. Any human could take a glance at the graph and quickly tell if something was wrong or everything ok.<p>We wanted to catch if something went wrong and people couldn&#x27;t submit applications. We set up an alarm that triggered &quot;if less than X applications last hour&quot;, but that was hard to tweak so it didn&#x27;t go off during the night and was unusable. The tool had no way to set that rule to only apply for certain time periods or any way of making more advanced rules. But even if it had, I think it would have been a game of whack-a-mole with false positives and obvious errors slipping through.<p>Instead we could set up some kind of AI &quot;anomaly detection&quot;. That was almost even worse. Firstly, because no one could tell us how it really worked, how does it know what we consider an anomaly? I mean, if there is a holiday in the middle of the week and we get fewer applications than normal that&#x27;s an anomaly, but nothing to sound an alarm for.')
