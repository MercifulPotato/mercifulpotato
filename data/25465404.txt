Item(by='drosan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608284077, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465184, text='From top of my head: GTAV, RDR2, Ghost of Tsushima, FF7 remake, Demon&#x27;s Souls Remake, nioh 2, Dragon Quest Builders 2 - all got released on console in a proper good playable state without any giant bugs (or even small ones if that matters). Played them all at launch day 1 and didn&#x27;t encounter any issues, so it is totallly possible to release a finished game in 2020 ;)<p>Sadly Cyberpunk 2077 is not that, game on consoles looks like a PoC demo at best.')
