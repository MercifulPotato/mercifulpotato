It&#x27;s not on me to prove they&#x27;re NOT doing this. It&#x27;s on YOU to show me things that definitely say they ARE.<p>Apple (and MSFT) have both taken steps to button up the OS more in line with the level of expertise of the baseline user, which is WAY closer to your 60 year old aunt Millie than to anyone who posts here. Apple does a better job here; enabling non-AppStore binaries is a single checkbox. Microsoft&#x27;s S mode is a gesture in the same direction, but it&#x27;s hilariously bad in implementation -- harder to disable, can&#x27;t be turned back on once disabled, etc.<p>Weirdly, though, nobody is yelling that MSFT is going to move to an app-store-only model.')
