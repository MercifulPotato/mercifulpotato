We don&#x27;t raise children &quot;to have fun&quot;. Some would say we raise children to have a meaningful life for the parent, and I would hope for the children as well, i.e. &quot;to do good work&quot; as you say.<p>Like others have said, effect of praise would be very specific to individuals, but some have said praise hasn&#x27;t helped them much. It definitely has not helped me, so here is my reasoning as to why you should not praise a good team. For me, stop the praise, tell me how to be better, and show me you care about me improving, and care about me on a personal level. Yes, I know that when I work hard and give you good output, it helps company, I don&#x27;t need people to tell me that I worked hard. I can see it (If your company prevents your employees from seeing the effect of their output, thats the problem, don&#x27;t say praise is necessary. The boss should not try to be the feedback loop). The reverse pavlovian effect can kick in otherwise: If it doesn&#x27;t come when I am working hard, I feel bad. Also, the boss does not control reality, so becoming my feedback loops is bad, because he can warp reality based on his perspective.<p>It looks like this is highly specific to individuals though, the above works for me.')
