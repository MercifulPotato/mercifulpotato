I think this is a better way to do it because it is clear that the person is trying to learn rather than spouting nonsense. Also, it takes a lot of effort to correct people, and when emotions are high this is a painful process. The RH post was a great example of this.<p>I&#x27;ve commented on some of the RH posts and got downvoted because people didn&#x27;t like the facts (and I think maybe took it personally too). I&#x27;ve worked in Finance long enough professionally to know that I don&#x27;t understand this fully and few people do. I do know enough to know when the comments are nonsense though.<p>I think that some of these issues comes down to respect and also arrogance. Imagine going into a new field and after 30 seconds deciding that you know everything (the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect?)! Have a little bit of respect for those in the field and listen. Feel free to comment&#x2F;ask, but don&#x27;t spout &#x27;facts&#x27; without checking and I think we&#x27;d all move forward faster.')
