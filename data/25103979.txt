Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25105333], score=None, time=1605468605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103266, text='This reminds me of the so-called <i>City of the Dead</i>[1] in Cairo.<p>It&#x27;s an ancient cemetery which has basically turned in to a giant slum, with poverty-stricken people living among the ancient tombs.<p>There are a number of interesting videos on youtube about it, such as [2], [3], and [4], but it&#x27;s the first of these that I found most fascinating, because not only did it show and talk about the <i>City of the Dead</i>, it also shows Zabbaleen.[5]<p>Zabbaleen is much like Stolipinovo, with people living among mountains of garbage.<p>The people who live there grow up there and are traditionally tasked with dealing with the garbage, which is shipped in to the neighborhood for them to live amongst.<p>It&#x27;s clearly a miserable, nightmarish life.<p>As the narrator in the video says at about 9 minutes in, <i>&quot;I don&#x27;t care how essential what they do is for Cairo.  Cairo needs to get its shit together.. it&#x27;s not ok.&quot;</i><p>I highly recommend watching this video[2].  The part on Zabaleen starts around 4&#x27;48&quot;.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;City_of_the_Dead_%28Cairo%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;City_of_the_Dead_%28Cairo%29</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p8KiBycJi9I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p8KiBycJi9I</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YeystshWL2I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YeystshWL2I</a><p>[4] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vYzKdf33AJg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vYzKdf33AJg</a><p>[5] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zabbaleen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zabbaleen</a>')
