From the wiki page:<p>&gt; an increase in CO2 results in a decrease in blood pH,[2] resulting in hemoglobin proteins releasing their load of oxygen. Conversely, a decrease in carbon dioxide provokes an increase in pH, which results in hemoglobin picking up more oxygen.<p>So lowering carbon dioxide concentration (through an activity like hyperventilation) will cause hemoglobin to pick up more oxygen molecules. And increasing carbon dioxide levels will release those molecules. Fascinating.')
