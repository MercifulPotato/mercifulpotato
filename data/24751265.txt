One of the main subplots of the novel is the description of how Boethius&#x27; widow attempts to take vengeance of the people who accused and made him executed.<p>One of the takeaways I got from the book was that Boethius&#x27; society was in a turmoil, still having deep roots in the &quot;roman&quot; culture (in the sense of the Roman Empire) yet struggling to evolve into what would become the Middle Ages.')
