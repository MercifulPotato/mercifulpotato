Item(by='dognotdog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609779056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631855, text='&gt; correction of my sloppy wrong comments (wrong numbers).<p>It was not completely wrong. Being an employee gives you those benefits (eg you can stretch parental leave to 2yrs with <i>part time</i> work, the minimum vacation is 24 days instead of 30, but there&#x27;s unlimited sick leave), and it is incomparable to the ridiculous PTO&#x2F;PSL system in the US.<p>However, companies by and large only do this due to external pressure (govt, unions, competition), not any kind of inherent cultural benevolence.<p>In tech&#x2F;engineering, this typically means that instead of direct hiring, hiring through agencies where people are regularly rotated out of projects to not have to become permanent employees, and without the regular benefits of the host company. Freelance tech work is actually becoming rare because German law has Duck Typing for determining employment status, so if you&#x27;re de facto salaried, and the govt finds out, both the employer and employee suddenly owe all the relevant employment taxes, even years back, and because this has been abused and has been cracked down on, nowadays getting freelance work is difficult.<p>Of course, that somehow didn&#x27;t stop companies from trying to pull the same scam with &quot;gig economy&quot; BS on the lowest paid workers the past few years.')
