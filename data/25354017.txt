So right off the top, the notion that Biden&#x27;s chances of winning these four states were that low, is w(a^15)y out of alignment with the roughly 50-50 split between Dems and Reps.  Given no additional information, Biden&#x27;s chances of winning four 50-50 states are 1 in 16, not 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000.<p>* Second, this idea that Trump had a lead &quot;earlier in the night&quot; is meaningless, because the vote counting was not evenly distributed.  Votes were group by county, by method of voting, etc.  Each grouping has a bias.  Some counties are heavily Rep or Dem.  Mail-in ballots obviously favored Dems because Trump spent the last few months telling his followers not to use them.<p>* Third, why is this &quot;3am&quot; cutoff meaningful?  The legitimacy of the ballots does not depend on the order in which they were counted, so wallclock-time is irrelevant.  Otherwise, if the ballots had been counted in <i>reverse</i> order I could sit here and claim that Trump cheated because Biden&#x27;s lead shrank sharply after 3am.')
