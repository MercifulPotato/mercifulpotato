Again, I don&#x27;t have the numbers, but I would be shocked if actual party members in US even reached the 1 million mark, much less 30 million people. For fairness, let&#x27;s throw in 18 million Americans that belong to unions. Let&#x27;s make it 20 millions in total. That&#x27;s still less than the required 30 million politically organized Americans to be at par with CCP.<p>[but p.s. &#x2F;g! If we throw in the 18 million American millionaires, then we have a system that is a bit more representative than the CCP]')
