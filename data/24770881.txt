There&#x27;s no arguing that Google is anything but capricious and loaded with privacy issues, but I think it&#x27;s safe to assume at this point that they&#x27;re not going to be dropping the hardware any time soon. The original Google Home is still getting feature updates and I doubt that&#x27;s going to change even with a replacement coming out.')
