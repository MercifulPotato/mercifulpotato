Dope individuals with food, water, air that have virus. bam mind reading&#x2F;bullying<p>Again the science (brain science, sensors, and em netowrks) probably need to be done to do this<p>We 10000000% need more monitoring of vectors like this. Viruses et all need to be constantly monitored for public safety. Sure we probably do it in wastewater but thats terribly imprecise and a stupid high LOD. Wonder if there are automated jigs that do this in waste water.')
