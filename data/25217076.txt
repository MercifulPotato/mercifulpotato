It might be a great catch phrase for a movement but what an absolutely stupid thing to demand a person state. Unless a person is actively KILLING people based on their race, to ask them to state that their lives matter is, again, just stupid.<p>I want you to say the lives of Japanese people matter. Say it, why won&#x27;t you say it? You must hate Japanese people apparently...')
