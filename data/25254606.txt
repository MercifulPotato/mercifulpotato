It is not the best solution to the problem (I don&#x27;t want to say eating meat exclusively is healthy  or better than vegan) but it puts you in roughly safe spot in that you can be extremely lazy with the diet.<p>With vegan diet you can quickly cause a lot of damage to your body if you are not paying attention to what you eat.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to spend your days with calculators and tables the safest bet is to just vary everything -- eat a little bit of everything every day or different things every day.<p>One tip I would give even if you don&#x27;t want to pay a lot of attention to details is to still try to manage proteins &#x2F; carbohydrates &#x2F; fat content of your food. Just add olive oil when you don&#x27;t see enough fat in your food, etc.')
