Item(by='Tagbert', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605378025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25091583, text='The M1 Mac Mini supports one external display on the Thunderbolt port and a second one on the HDMI display. There are probably limitations on simultaneous resolution and refresh rates. This iteration of the M1 was not designed to handle large amounts of I&#x2F;O.  I would expect a more advanced version (M1X&#x2F;M2) sometime in the next 6-12 months. That iteration will likely support 4 thunderbolt ports, multiple external monitors and larger RAM limits. That’s the one that Apple would use in iMacs and the other MacBook Pros.<p>I do wish that Apple would go ahead and release a 27” 5K display for the current machines. The 6K is way overkill and there are no good options for monitors &gt;4K. They are probably waiting for the new iMacs with a new design language to put out a matching monitor.')
