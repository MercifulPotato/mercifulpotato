My strategy for products was often to read 1-star reviews, and there were often two cases:<p>1) The reviews are low-quality and not indicative of much, so there are few legitimate complaints, or<p>2) The reviews showcase a significant problem with the product alongside proof, and&#x2F;or are often made by intelligent consumers<p>After enough time doing this with success, I&#x27;ve started to see many more 1-star reviews on products that get highly upvoted until they&#x27;re the &#x27;top review(s)&#x27;, which don&#x27;t really contain anything useful at all.
