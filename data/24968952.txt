The fact that deepfakes will exist will erode confidence in even those things that are true.

If you think the amount of video manipulation was bad enough this cycle in the 2020 presidential election?

I really feel like the genie is out of the bottle and this has the potential to become a very dangerous tool for people with bad intentions.')
