It&#x27;s all about self reflection and how someone else interacts with the world views your achievement. You don&#x27;t have to listen to people all the time. Also sometimes you can do everything right and still receive criticism. Someone (like myself) can always find that one thing wrong with what you did. These things don&#x27;t bother me.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve just learned to get over it. You can&#x27;t make everyone happy. Unfortunately you take up an aloof selfish nature by doing so. Criticism doesn&#x27;t affect you. You take it as input and gauge whether or not there someone worth modifying your behavior over. You just keep trying to achieve whatever object you are pursuing. In the end, why does it matter?! A quote I heard somewhere a long time ago but can&#x27;t remember where was something along the lines of &quot;Those who are remembered are worth criticizing. Those who are not, were of no issue.&quot; In a lot of ways this exact example reminds me the episode from TNG where Picard dies and relives his life. He takes the safe route and doesn&#x27;t even end up on command. Q than revives him and he got to experience what it was like if he chosen the &quot;safe lane&quot; in life. Always having a positive impression and people relying on them, but not the Captain of the ship (where he has often received criticism from all over the galaxy).<p>Criticism in a nutshell means you&#x27;re doing something. Something enough to make someone upset. It&#x27;s up to you to learn about yourself and understand why you&#x27;re possibly in the wrong. You cannot always go through life living apathetic to how you affect others. You sometimes need to learn when to humble yourself for show, and prostrate yourself for prestige.')
