Clear takes Allen&#x27;s Two-Minute Rule as the <i>first part</i> of his own Two-Minute Rule, the second part of which is something like Allen&#x27;s Next Actions. It&#x27;s a mess. The article posted here rehashes the second part of Clear&#x27;s rule, completely divorcing the name of the rule from its original context.')
