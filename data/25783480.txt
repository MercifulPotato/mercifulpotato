Testosterone levels are linked to violent behavior. This is very clear in the literature. Does it mean everyone with high testosterone levels is violent? Obviously not. And violence is not always a bad trait either. I don&#x27;t believe in toxic masculinity. Masculine and feminine traits have their place and are obviously adaptive in different situations.')
