Even though they might be high priority, different functions have different goals and measurements. The managers themselves fail every new line initiative, since they&#x27;ve no project &#x2F; PM experience too, and also no support or real budgets. When this happens, look at the environment though for answers.<p>This type of managing is running out of time, as it simply doesn&#x27;t work that well beyond managers having eachother&#x27;s backs. Managers need to involve themselves much more around projects &#x2F; Agile, than just borrowing and stealing back &quot;resources&quot;. If they can&#x27;t provide servant leadership skills and healthy repurposing of roles, they need to stay away and clear blocks, allocate funds and people, from quite a distance.')
