This could explain why it&#x27;s so commonly reported with miso soup - it&#x27;s served at the beginning of the meal. The association is known by folks who grew up eating MSG natively: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kenjilopezalt&#x2F;status&#x2F;1291882403506475008?s=19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;kenjilopezalt&#x2F;status&#x2F;1291882403506475008...</a><p>If this were true, it&#x27;d explain why other glutamate-rich foods don&#x27;t have the same reputation. It might suggest that we shouldn&#x27;t buy doritos from a vending machine when we need a snack, though.<p>Studies where respondents can&#x27;t taste the MSG don&#x27;t show an effect, so maybe it&#x27;s the taste, and not the chemical, that causes the problem. Also it seems unlikely that the MSG could actually get to the brain.<p>I&#x27;d love to see an experiment where self-identifying sensitive individuals either eat miso soup or gargle it without swallowing and see if there&#x27;s a difference in reactions.<p>I&#x27;d also like to know more about common knowledge about MSG in Japan and China.<p>(I think the racist myth could cause a psychosomatic effect for people who aren&#x27;t sensitive)')
