For example, for me the most intuitive way to represent a standard jazz ride cymbal pattern is like so:<p><pre><code>    [x--][x-x][x--][x-x]\n</code></pre>\nEach square bracket is a quarter note subdivided into 1&#x2F;8 note triplets where the x is struck and the - is not struck.<p>You can represent swing without triplets but it is way less natural and intuitive to me.')
