Samsung&#x27;s gross sales revenue, profit (and margin) in mobile has been steadily declining since.<p>The Mobile division&#x27;s 2Q 2012 profit was less than 10% ($1.95B OP on $20B revenue). Then Trump&#x27;s sanction of Huawei happened, after which Samsung&#x27;s sales grew by 50% QoQ (3Q), but we don&#x27;t expect Samsung&#x27;s luck to last forever and their margin would start declining to a mid-single digit again.')
