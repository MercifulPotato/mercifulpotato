I do wish there wasn&#x27;t a discrepancy in output between client and server. For example, when testing udp throughout, the client reports how many packets it sends, but the server usually doesn&#x27;t receive 100% of those. I&#x27;d like the server to then report back to the client the true results.<p>Maybe this has changed since I last used this, but it also seemed primarily geared towards human consumption, making it more difficult to use in your software workflows.')
