Apparently there is a Microsoft form you need to fill out to get unflagged where you explain what data your site is collecting but I just took the site offline because I was too busy to dig into it. Extremely annoying since the entire idea is to collect as little personal information as you can. It wasn’t matomo fault, its somebody’s dysfunctional web crawler bot auto generating reports')
