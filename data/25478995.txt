But the moment it became clear that it was harming the image of a console <i>they&#x27;re still selling</i>... that was that. After all, that&#x27;s the point of validation. Usually the requirements are things that would reflect badly on the console like locking up and crashing vs &quot;not being a fun game&quot; or something.')
