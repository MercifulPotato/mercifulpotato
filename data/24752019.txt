It makes explicit the reasoning that is necessary to allocate and access memory correctly without reference counting or garbage collection. Sure it is easier to start writing C but I believe it is overall faster to write and debug a Rust program because C requires additional sanitization and fuzzing to catch errors.<p>To quote Grissom from CSI: I&#x27;ve learned that sometimes you can go faster by going slow ;-)')
