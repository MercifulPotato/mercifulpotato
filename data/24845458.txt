Item(by='jotaen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603264465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844172, text='“Jamstack” is a somewhat fancy umbrella term for best practices around setting up and delivering single-page-apps or static websites. As such it doesn’t <i>fail</i> at comments, it just doesn’t provide concrete answers to the question how to store data in the backend (except for integrating against existing 3rd-party APIs).<p>If the author wants commenting functionality with notifications, they would need to implement their own API to achieve that. But I guess that is intentional as far as the Jamstack idea is concerned.')
