You can&#x27;t easily backup, otherwise it would be stored in clear in google drive, in an area that is not even accessible to you.<p>And then it is a sqlite db with proprietary format for fields, so so far nothing can display it properly offline.<p>For telegram, they have a good export&#x2F;backup feature.<p>I don&#x27;t know of anytool that would allow to browse your history nicely when loaded offline from backups, but as the format is open, that should be doable.')
