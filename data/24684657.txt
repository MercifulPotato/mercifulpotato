For now, I use md5sum to create and verify checksums of my backup .tar.gz archives and parchive to create error recovery files. I’ve written about parchive before and remain to this day a dedicated fan.</i><p>I’m very surprised you went through the trouble of building such an amazing NAS and skipped ZFS! Definitely give it a try. It’s especially useful for combatting disk rot. Not to mention how easy it is to setup and use.')
