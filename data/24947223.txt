I was afraid that it might have downshifted to Gen1.   Other threads point to your CPU being pegged, and I would tend to agree with that.<p>What direction are you running the streams in?   In general, sending is much more efficient than receiving (&quot;its better to give than to receive&quot;).  From your statement that ksoftirqd is pegged, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re receiving.<p>I&#x27;d first see what bandwidth you can send at with iperf when you run the test in reverse so this pi is sending.   Then, to eliminate memory bw as a potential bottleneck, you could use sendfile.  I don&#x27;t think iperf ever supported sendfile (but its been years since I&#x27;ve used it).  I&#x27;d suggest installing netperf on this pi, running netserver on its link partners, and running &quot;netperf -tTCP_SENDFILE -H othermachine&quot; to all 5 peers and see what happens.')
