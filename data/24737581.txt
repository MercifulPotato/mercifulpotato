My gf and I started <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;buyfunnyaprons.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;buyfunnyaprons.com&#x2F;</a> and running ads on IG and FB have been the only way to get exposure. FB&#x27;s targeting is super advanced and allows smaller guys like us to compete with the corporates (since we can&#x27;t buy traditional media like tv ads or billboards).')
