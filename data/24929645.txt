You give a talk and then someone then goes through your slides, effectively saying &quot;no you are wrong&quot; without really anything substantive at a big conference. I can see why people might see that as a bit uncomfortable.<p>It is an okay idea but it seems taken too far. People in tech often seem hopelessly socially inept. We all need to learn to do better. Yes in this case the original author of the slides was okay with it, but not everyone will be. The author seems completely unaware of this. They should have it explained to them.<p>So I do agree it was probably handled poorly. There would have been a better way to resolve this.<p>But for everyone complaining about how social media&#x2F;hate groups cancelling people etc etc, think a bit more. This person wrote a blog post which is obviously going to be taken and used as fuel. The title is definitely provocative. The lack of awareness is exactly why we need a code of conduct in the first place.')
