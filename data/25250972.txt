Order flow is purchased for the specific purpose of making a market with the wider bid-ask spread acceptable to retail investors. They tend to place market orders and don&#x27;t particularly care if their trade is off by a cent or two.<p>You can quibble with the academic arguments on whether or not this facilitates liquidity and price discovery (and therefore helps retail investors). Or you can just place a limit order and move on. Either way, nothing illegal or nefarious is happening. Just because they&#x27;re purchasing order flow and executing your trade doesn&#x27;t mean the national best bid and offer (NBBO) is being violated.')
