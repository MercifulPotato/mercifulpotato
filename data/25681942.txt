Instead, if you are a resident of the state, they&#x27;ll have staff that will meet with you in a small conference room, take notes, maybe ask a few questions. These are typically fairly young intern types, so don&#x27;t expect too much depth from them (in my experience, you&#x27;re going to get some very naive questions if you bring up anything related to science&#x2F;tech policy). They&#x27;ll then tell you that you are being heard, thank you, and send you on your way. This is occasionally a useful thing to do, e.g. to bring attention to a niche issue, cause, or special interest that their office might not be aware of at all.')
