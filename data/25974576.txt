Then one of them gets caught doing {bad thing}, and there&#x27;s focus on them. And they become the sole target of court cases and investigations and ire (rightly so, but a load of other companies are also either doing the same thing, or are directly enabling them). Then everyone forgets all the lessons that should have been learned and allows the same cycle to repeat until the next time and companies get back to setting policy&#x2F;laws via lobbying until the next big blow out.')
