I don&#x27;t eat fast food or drink soda, but I must have a jar of Jif around at all times. I have tried every type of organic peanut butter and found them all more or less vile, mostly due to the oiliness but there&#x27;s also usually something flat &amp; colorless about the flavor -- not just missing sweetness but something else. On the other hand the less adulterated alternatives do taste a lot more like actual peanuts, which makes me dread to know what it is that I&#x27;m missing.')
