However I also realize that there are things I don&#x27;t know how to make and I have no interest in (for me it&#x27;s taxes, administrivia and co). Those things I am gladly paying somebody to do that for me as I am effectively buying free time. And someone who is not into DIY is also buying free time if they hire someone for trimming their trees.')
