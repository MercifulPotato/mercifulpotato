Some of the older ones may not find old servers, but the code itself is functional.<p>I feel you. I made pretty much this argument to a fellow GNU&#x2F;Linux user (arch Linux user, if that adds anything). He started saying that syscalls are stable and that it&#x27;s a gtk&#x2F;GUI library problem and that if you were to, say, if you somehow loaded all the old libraries, it would work.<p>Which might be true and everything, but come on.
