They seemed to be content listening to others talk.<p>But in work related meetings, when it came to making crazy bets they were extremely passionate about their belief and commitment and made those decisions like a boss. (They had personality flaws (they could be perceived as rude, unpolished etc in those situations) and they made mistakes when they became insecure while making high-stakes decisions as stakes became bigger.)<p>In most other cases (in not so crazy decisions that needed to be made everyday), they showed great amount of trust in others. They also showed genuine humility - they didn&#x27;t assume expertise they didn&#x27;t have and didn&#x27;t try to assert that they are the boss.<p>I have come to believe that the founders mindset and behavior is crucial in attracting and retaining the right kind of talented next 10 employees. After that crucial bit, it is those 10 employees who determine the success probability of the company to a great extent. That founding&#x2F;forming team is a bigger determinant of success rather than just the founders or just those initial employees by themselves.')
