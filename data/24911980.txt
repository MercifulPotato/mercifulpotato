Understanding is quite different from feeling. However, if the act of ordering a bombing raid on a city involved physically murdering a child, it would definitely feel more immediate and less abstract.<p>Your point stands, of course. But the part about removing the abstractness of the act seems relevant when ordering people killed.')
