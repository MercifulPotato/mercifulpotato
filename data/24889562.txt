I have some ballpark-corrected numbers that I keep in my head but the academic literature badly lags industry. You can read a &quot;new&quot; solar EROI paper in 2020 and after dereferencing all its citation pointers find it&#x27;s still using key numbers from 2008. Thinner cells, lower kerf loss, polysilicon reactor optimization, crystal growing optimization, higher cell efficiency (PERC), bifaciality, and the increasing prevalence of single axis trackers mean that a state of the art solar farm in 2020 has significantly better EROI than the same capacity farm in the same place in 2010. But industry cares about costs, not EROI, and academics who write about EROI seem to lack the will to gather numbers from current industrial practice.<p>I also occasionally suspect that good solar EROI analysis doesn&#x27;t happen because people are anchored to previous conclusions. Whether that&#x27;s nuclear promoters or deep green&#x2F;&quot;degrowth&quot; types. Both would like to say &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to their visions of the future and a high solar EROI would demonstrate an inconvenient alternative. Or just inattentive grad students and advisors who assume current EROI numbers should be in line with older ones.')
