The right assumes that we&#x27;re all equally able to achieve if only we would apply ourselves more.<p>Of course both are equally wrong and right and lots in between.<p>Some people will get nowhere no matter how much you give them. And some will fail no matter how hard they work.<p>What amazes me somewhat is that none of these are new problems for humanity, human beings are broadly the same for 1000s of years.')
