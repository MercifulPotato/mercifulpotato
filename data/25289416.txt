Most of the wasted time is due to developing drugs for what look to be promising targets, taking them into the clinic, and finding that they don&#x27;t actually do anything to the disease even if they&#x27;re perfect at affecting the target in the desired way.<p>Protein folding will help develop candidates faster. That&#x27;s good. But it won&#x27;t seriously help find the right targets faster, so I don&#x27;t expect a substantial speedup in overall drug development times.')
