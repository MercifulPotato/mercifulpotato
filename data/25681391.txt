It does a reasonable job of enumerating the issues with naively deploying ML in a healthcare setting. However, these articles are becoming a dime a dozen and there is little actionable talk on <i>how</i> to discover or mitigate these issues at a level that practitioners can use.<p>To your point about the bar for new tech, I agree that singling out AI&#x2F;ML is a cheap shot and more speculative FUD without concrete evidence. That said, we have seen no shortage of hucksters and self-aggrandizing members of the &quot;move fast and break things crowd&quot; trying to treat medicine as a beginner-level Kaggle challenge. This has become particularly egregious and noticeable during the pandemic [1]. The respective lack of medical and technical literacy among programmers&#x2F;&quot;data scientists&quot; and healthcare providers&#x2F;admins is just more fuel for the fire.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fni5ow&#x2F;d_why_is_the_ai_hype_absolutely_bonkers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;MachineLearning&#x2F;comments&#x2F;fni5ow&#x2F;d_w...</a>')
