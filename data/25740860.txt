You can only communicate with others on the I2P network.  Some I2P users may choose to operate an &quot;outproxy&quot; and provide Internet access but it&#x27;s not built into the network or software.  What is (or was, it&#x27;s been awhile) built in is a torrent client.<p>It&#x27;s also written in Java and the router web UI was pretty snazzy from what I remember.')
