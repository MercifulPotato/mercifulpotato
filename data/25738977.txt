In some, it&#x27;s not. Obviously depends on your POV which is which. Either way, it exists and is to be respected unless someone is willing to go to war for whatever issue is at hand.<p>Americans (and their mouthpieces) do not get to be the world&#x27;s defacto authority.<p>&gt; YouTube, a Google subsidiary, has a corporate responsibility to uphold freedom of expression as guided by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, a global standard of “expected conduct for all business enterprises wherever they operate.”<p>The UN, its delegates and its employees do not get to be the decider of everything.<p>Every site should be in compliance with the local rules of whatever market they&#x27;re taking&#x2F;making money in.<p>The new found &#x27;anything goes&#x27; is an inherent limit of these SV companies and their desire to scale the planet at a fraction of the required cost.
