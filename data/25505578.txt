Item(by='Taek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608639971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504334, text='A run like 0000000 is only compressible if it appears more often than it would in a fully random output. And in a fully random output, we would expect the run &#x27;0000000&#x27; to appear about once every 16 bytes.<p>When you compress 0000000 to something smaller, you have to replace &#x27;0000000&#x27; in the plaintext with a smaller symbol in the squash text. Which means if that smaller symbol appears in the plaintext, you have to replace it with a larger symbol in the squash text. And if your smaller symbol appears more frequently than &#x27;0000000&#x27;, you are going to end up with a &quot;squash&quot; text that is larger than the plaintext.')
