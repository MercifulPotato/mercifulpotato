While we&#x27;re well on the way to driverless cars, as mentioned in the article the first 90% is the easy bit and then things get exponentially harder after that...<p>The amount of complexity still amazes me when I think about it, the weather conditions, different roads, construction&#x2F;obstacles, sign posts, traffic lights, awareness of all the cars around you as well as trying to guess the intention of the other road users correctly. So much to keep track of!<p>As well as this, in my opinion driverless cars are going to have to get much safer than humans before we roll them out fully. Humans are much more forgiving of each other (In the law at least) than we are of machines causing death&#x2F;injury.<p>I can&#x27;t wait though and the latest videos from Waymo&#x2F;Tesla are amazing when you see how every update results in them getting better and better! Bring on the future!!')
