Modern compilers don&#x27;t tend to have strictly separated lexers and parsers, but instead use a combined lexer&#x2F;parser model that feeds information back and forth between them. If your language is designed such that you aren&#x27;t often in multiple potential parse states, then it&#x27;s easy to feed into the lexer &quot;get me the next token, and by the way, expect function attributes to be keywords right now.&quot;<p>Note that the requirement to not be in multiple potential parse states also tends to boil down to &quot;build a language that&#x27;s usually LL(1) or LALR(1).&quot;')
