Then Newton came along and found a mathematical model that, for the first time, explained those observations, and even reconciled them with other observations on the ground. We then spent a lot of time testing Newton&#x27;s theories and didn&#x27;t find any holes for a few hundred years.<p>Along came electromagnetism, the study of its dynamics, and the discovery of the speed of light problem, which couldn&#x27;t be explained - requiring a new model that could actually explain everything we knew + the new data, and so on.')
