There may exist other solutions to cognition of incompleteness.<p>I think that if the problem of and solution to incompleteness in cognition did not exist then we would experience these computational inconsistencies similar to migraine blind spots. However we don&#x27;t, and we perceive the error in computation as a single entity and not as two boundaries.')
