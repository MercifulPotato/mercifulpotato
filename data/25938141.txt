Weed dealers are rarely just selling weed, and often harder drugs. To me it&#x27;s not clear if this means &quot;cannabis use leads to higher risk behaviour w.r.t drug use&quot; or &quot;exposure to drug dealers increases risk of trying other drugs&quot;. I see no clear reason to believe this over the other hypothesis.<p>Australia is not a country where cannabis is legal, so its system, and therefore impacts, are much less useful for study than a nation which takes a more modern approach to cannabis.')
