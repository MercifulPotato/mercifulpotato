But the M3 is meant for people that want performance, handling, and mechanical experience.<p>If you enjoy the Model Y more than the M3, then you prefer it to a car that has much higher cornering performance, much higher acceleration from the 0-60 all the way to 155mph, and of course the M3 is a much rawer experience.<p>If you don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s just that the M3 wasn&#x27;t made for you.')
