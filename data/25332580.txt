Are unvented gas stoves more common in some areas? Are gas stoves used as central heating systems more common in older, often smaller&#x2F;lower-income housing (it&#x27;s pretty surely &quot;yes&quot; on that last point)? Do many low-income housing units have induction cooktops? (I suspect &quot;no&quot;)<p>If gas stoves were more common in cities, I can imagine that other city factors might be causal yet show up as correlated in the study. (I did try to read for controls the study included, but that was not well-covered in the article.)')
