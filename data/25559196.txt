It all just depends on what you want or need. I’ve been on Macs and iOS devices since 2008 and it’s bee great. Excellent well supported high quality systems that have lasted many years and given me outstanding value for money overall. Yes I’ve had hardware failures, including 2 hard disk failures. One was on a 6 year old machine so par for the course, the other was a few months out of Apple Care but they replaced it for free anyway.<p>I completely believe the horror stories though.

I only use iMacs and a Mac Mini so can’t comment in detail on the laptop keyboards but I can understand why people were upset.<p>It entirely depends on your own specific needs and circumstances. For me a Mac is a powerful, well built consumer desktop and Unix workstation, with some great convenience features. For someone else they might be over priced inflexible systems lacking needed capabilities.')
