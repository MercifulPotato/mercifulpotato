While presented as &quot;spreading democracy and freedom&quot;, in the backdrop Western companies (with strong government ties) were making deals to take control of the natural resources in both Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.<p>Most importantly, those deals envisioned to take away the control (or even access) Russia (and the local population, for that matter) have&#x2F;had over these resources. If anyone annexed anything, it was rather the USA than Russia. The key on all that is to observe which side was the one taking all the initiatives, and which side was basically just responding to what the other side did.<p>This fear mongering about Russian expansion simply doesn&#x27;t match reality. If anyone has been expanding the last decade or so, it is NATO, not Russia. In reality, it probably should not surprise anyone. It&#x27;s a well proven tactic to simply accuse your victims of being the one showing aggression, while in reality that is just resistance to your own (illegal) aggression. Just ask some of the older Poles. They still remember what Germany did.')
