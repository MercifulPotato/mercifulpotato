It&#x27;s a strategy that is not controversial and would fix 99% of the problem.<p>In one way paying for giving the vaccine makes sense, on the other I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s needed or that it&#x27;d be seen in a favoritable light (there&#x27;s already a lot of controversy about how the pandemic was handled economically).<p>EDIT: to backup why I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed; I haven&#x27;t found the study from the article you linked, but according to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00451-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00451-5</a> about 70% of people need to be immune. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a hard number to get (but I may be wrong), but assuming there is some immunity when you get the virus (which seems supported), you don&#x27;t need to <i>vaccinate</i> 70%, you need 70% either vacicnated or having already gotten the virus (which is 10% of the population as of now). I understand it&#x27;s not insanely supported take, but that&#x27;s why from curosry look I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed. Not a firm belief though.')
