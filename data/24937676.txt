Yes, we are producing more right now, but this production is on a clock. Even without any change in climate we are screwed. Look at how many places in the world are currently undergoing water system collapse. California, a huge crop producing state, has areas that have sunk nearly 30 meters because of pumping too much water. Those same areas are highly dependant on bringing in water from long distances away. Now add unstable weather patterns the the propensity for longer droughts and tell me what you think will happen?<p>We are not dealing with a climate change problem. We are dealing with<p>A long term water supply problem<p>A soil salinization over vast areas problem<p>A soil decarbonization problem over vast areas<p>Increasing temperatures that are pushing our current high yield crops to their limit problem<p>A globalized transportation system that will quickly spread crop diseases problem<p>Humanity is playing russian roulette with these issues. We will get a perfect storm one of these years, for example across the midwest US being hit by a drought and crop rust and we could see a near complete failure of our corn harvest. We are talking about the potential loss of 750 million tons of calories that will rock the world to its foundations.')
