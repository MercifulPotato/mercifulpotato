Item(by='jelliclesfarm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602890322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804165, text='i started studying astrology as a covid project and got distracted. one of the texts called surya siddhantha speaks of units of time. the smallest unit of time is &#x27;truti&#x27; which is 10^-7.<p>the text divides time as &#x27;murta&#x27; and &#x27;amurta&#x27;...the first translates to &#x27;embodied&#x27; and the latter translates to &#x27;unembodied&#x27;. it means &#x27;unreal time&#x27;. in unreal time, there is no destruction. all &#x27;murta&#x27; time units are based upon &#x27;one respiration&#x27; or &#x27;one prana&#x27;. (living time or &#x27;murta&#x27; unit)<p>one truta is 1&#x2F;37500 of a second. i dont know if it goes smaller than that..but it builds up from that to a kalpa of brahma which is 4.32 billion human solar years. two kalpas make a day for brahma. 30 days make a month of brahma and he lives for 100 years. currently, we are in the 50th year of brahma, first month and in kali yuga(4 yugas of which kali is the last make one chatur yuga..1000 chatur yugas make one kalpa.)...kali yuga started ...acc to these texts started in 3102 BCE and will end after a run 432,000 years. current kali yuga began roughly 5,121 years ago and has 426,879 years remaining as of 2020 CE.<p>i wasnt paying attention to the quantum scale and was fascinated by the cosmological time. at some point, i expect to return to the lunisolar calender time that was really the original purpose of my reading, but i got carried away and went down the rabbit hole.<p>its going to be difficult to get back to astrology study because turns out there are multiverses and multiple brahmas who &#x27;bubble&#x27; in the ocean and disappear as they create and destroy their worlds and themselves. and then there is time dilations for various creatures each one perceiving time on a different scale. this with the accompanying mythology is better than any sci fi i have ever read.<p>*<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TranslationOfTheSuryaSiddhanta&#x2F;mode&#x2F;1up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TranslationOfTheSuryaSiddhanta&#x2F;m...</a>')
