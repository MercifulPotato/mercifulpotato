This is often good, as the negative formal and informal sanctions of peers is what keeps the human animals from murdering each other.<p>Birkin bags and luxury goods are a mostly harmless byproduct of this human desire for approval.<p>In writing this comment, you are signaling to your HN peers how Nobel and virtuous you are, in that you only care about things like art and writing—-hoping for internet points in return (just as we all are).<p>The problem is, the government does not have unlimited resources, and most of us lack the intrinsic motivation to do anything useful for others.<p>If given everything for free, we’d like to think we’d spend our time creating great art and inventions—-but really we’d probably spend 99% of our time on Netflix and social signaling.')
