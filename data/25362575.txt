Everything&#x27;s a mess from everybody&#x27;s point of view, and Youtube has a big share of responsibility for the way things are, so I guess they chose to do something.<p>Is this the best way forward? Probably not. But atleast it&#x27;s a firm, consistent, unambiguous stance, and not an entirely arbitrary one. Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, we&#x27;ve never had an election reach this point and then be overturned. Youtube is making a bet that this won&#x27;t be the first, rather than sit around and abide the moving goalposts that will lead us to January 20th (and possibly even further than that).<p>Again, it&#x27;s weird and awful that we&#x27;ve reached a point in society where a video hosting service feels the need to intervene on matters of &quot;what&#x27;s true&quot; on behalf of the nation. And it&#x27;s simultaneously weird and awful that our internet is such a monoculture that it&#x27;s hard to find a high-quality service that exists in competition to this one.<p>But of the weird and awful things that have happened this year, this is pretty low on my list.')
