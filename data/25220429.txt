Your <i>driving habits</i> must factor in both your safety as well as the safety of others; if someone else drives inappropriately and causes a crash and their wellbeing is impaired or concluded as a result of both their driving habits as well as their use of a less safe car, the fault shouldn&#x27;t be on you for having a car that&#x27;s safer for you to drive.
