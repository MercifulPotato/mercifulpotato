Some companies are talking about making things permanent, others are already trying to get people back in the office.<p>It costs companies a lot both monetarily and in time&#x2F;effort to advertise job postings, get applications, schedule interviews ,hire someone new to do the same job, train them and get them set up and acclimatized until they become productive. If they can still have them working that&#x27;d be a big boon for them. Of course this won&#x27;t happen for all jobs, but is likely to apply to a large fraction.<p>Someone making a conscious decision to hire in another country takes a lot of effort, but an existing productive employee who is already working 100% remotely for the past 6+ months asking if they could work in Canada or India till the uncertainty around the election is resolved will definitely have a good chance.')
