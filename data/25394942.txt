I believe what they meant to say was  4 FADDs OR 4 FMULs.<p>Then they say it has quadruple the throughput of Intel and older AMD chips, but that doesn&#x27;t follow unless this does 8 floating point operations per cycle not 4.<p>The image of the pipeline only shows 4 so I think this is 4x128 wide, which is good but not going to compete with Zen3  with its wider registers. It is also <i>not</i> quadruple the throughput of Intel or AMD for SIMD..')
