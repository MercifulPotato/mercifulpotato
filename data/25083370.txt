There will always be some further improvement you could be making, some way in which you’re still just not quite up to scratch. So, think about where you will set your boundaries.<p>This world will endlessly push you to do better, be better, always and only by its definition of better. Decide what “good enough” looks like to you, because by their lights you’ll never be good enough. It’s not an escalator, it’s a treadmill.<p>There is a quote from an old song I like: “they keep on pushing til you push back harder”.')
