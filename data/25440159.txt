If anything, a diagram would be clearer and more readable to me than the same program in plaintext. (Of course, it would be much more cumbersome to input such a diagram into a computer than plaintext.)<p>Whereas the idea of systematically translating arbitrary natural language sentences into diagrams is...nonsensical to me. I mean I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to begin.<p>I&#x27;m curious if for you, do you feel like you could easily systematically translate a natural language sentence into a diagram? Or, because you don&#x27;t think as visually as people like me, translating a program into a diagram is not &quot;obvious&quot; to you at all? Or maybe this distinction just doesn&#x27;t feel significant to you, one language being diagram-translatable and another being diagram-untranslatable doesn&#x27;t cause them to feel different, they feel equally language-y to you?')
