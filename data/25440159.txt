If anything, the diagram would be clearer and more readable to me than the plaintext program, its only downside is that it would be more cumbersome to input into the computer (and edit, and version control, and deal with merge conflicts, etc, all the stuff plaintext is nice for).<p>Whereas the idea of systematically translating arbitrary natural language sentences into diagrams is...nonsensical to me. I mean I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to begin.<p>I&#x27;m basically just agreeing with others that I think of programs in a visual way, but I&#x27;m stating it in a concrete way: it seems &quot;obvious&quot; to me how to systematically translate any program into an equivalent diagram. Whereas natural language sentences are so non-visual to me that I wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin.<p>I&#x27;m curious if for you, do you feel like you could also easily systematically translate a natural language sentence into a diagram? Or because you <i>don&#x27;t</i> think as visually as people like me, translating a program into a diagram is not &quot;obvious&quot; to you at all?<p>Or, one language being diagram-translatable and another being untranslatable into a diagram doesn&#x27;t cause them to feel any different, they still feel equally language-like to you?')
