Should I delete cookies?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='My friends, I am devastated. I have a little Youtube channel (name can be found in my “about” section) that has in the past 3 years been part of my life.<p>It started a few days ago. I was visiting a friend in another country and using his Wifi with my notebook. It worked without issues for several days until I suddenly had to confirm I was not a robot and was logged out. I was told suspicious activities had been carried out on my account (which surprises me) and that I had to answer my security question (which I did correctly). Then I received a verification code on my backup address (which I entered correctly) only to be told Google couldn’t verify I was the owner of the account.<p>Since that day, I was not able to log in any more. I tried the account recovery a dozen times, with my usual device and from my usual location. I entered all data correctly (password, security question, verification code) and still do not get access to my account.<p>It seems that this is the end of my channel. It just started to become successful with half a million views in the last month. Filmmaking has become part of my life and Youtube offered me an easy way to proof my talent. I invested three years to get to this point. I don’t know if I have the force to start from scratch again.<p>By the way, I never had any strikes or other issues with none of my videos.<p>I checked the cookies in my browser and noticed that some cookies have been added by Youtube on the day of my being locked out and the days after when I tried to recover the account. Should I delete those cookies? Might they tell Youtube that my device is suspicious? Or should I be careful with deleting cookies as not to lose the last hook I have to convince Youtube that I am still the same person that used to log in the months before?<p>I am happy about any helpful idea.')
