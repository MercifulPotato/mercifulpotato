Fedora 34 is currently being branched into RHEL 9 Alpha.  In fact I spent last week unifying the spec files of my packages so they are the same in Fedora and RHEL 9 (as far as this is possible).<p>However the problem has always been that between RHEL being branched from Fedora and the first RHEL GA being released there was a gap - a really huge gap actually of about 18 months or more.  During this time we released to the public one alpha, and one beta to partners, but essentially development was closed off to anyone outside Red Hat.  During this time we are writing documentation, QA-ing extensively, fixing bugs found by partners.  Plus partners and ISVs actually ask for a 6 month delay before GA which they spend porting their software and device drivers.<p>CentOS Stream is probably a poor name, but it fills that huge gap.  Now CentOS Stream releases between Fedora and RHEL, and in front of every RHEL minor release, will be available to everyone, and we&#x27;ll be accepting contributions from everyone too.<p>Dropping CentOS Linux (the rebuild) is kind of separate from all this.  It looks like it&#x27;s going to continue as a community project as it was before 2014 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;</a>) which may be better in the end because the community will be more aligned to the success of the rebuild.<p>Disclosure: I work at Red Hat.')
