With Lufthansa, it looks like you get some sort of cushion that presumably smooths out the seat bumps, which would make a big comfort difference, at least for me.<p>However, I won’t be trying it out. Lufthansa has been willfully lying to people about COVID-related refunds, stonewalling, and making it impossible even to request a refund. Thank heavens for American Express, who took care of it for me.<p>(Sorry for the off-topic rant, but I would seriously urge folks to think twice about Lufthansa.)')
