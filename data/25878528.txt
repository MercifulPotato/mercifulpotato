This has plagued me for over a decade. As you noted, programming interviews are a nightmare.<p>Through the autoimmune protocol diet I discovered caffeine has a negative impact on me. I&#x27;ve noticed a small, but not insignificant improvement through cutting out all caffeine. Previously, I drank several cups of coffee a day.<p>I also took genetic testing and found I have some MTHFR mutations plus some other things, including a supposed indicator that I&#x27;m sensitive to caffeine, reaffirming my earlier findings. I&#x27;ve also cut out folic acid completely. However, I take these test results with a grain of salt, since there is mixed evidence of SNPs actual being of importance.<p>I&#x27;ve also experimented with probably 30+ supplements. I&#x27;d say more than half the time, my brain fog worsens when supplementing. I&#x27;ve finally settled on just melatonin and glycine at night. With these, I actually remember my dreams, which I take as a good sign.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve done very little blood testing recently, but in the past, a standard blood panel came back normal. Again, would love to hear what testing you had in mind.')
