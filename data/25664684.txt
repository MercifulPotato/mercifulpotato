So instead it relies on us having &quot;trust&quot; in the institutions that facilitate them and the &quot;election officials&quot; with potentially ridiculous training, no audit, no recordings and no mandated certification, all topped with the real potential for bias because hey, we&#x27;re humans. And we know that trust in governmental institutions and politicians is not universal.<p>I&#x27;d go out on a limb and posit that a good chunk of the individuals here would advocate and insist on all sorts of various audit trails, cryptographic hashes, check-digits, security layers and &quot;oversight&quot; with privacy and security guarantees with certification and training and and and... if this were health data. But when it comes to something like the leadership of a nation, we suddenly revert to &quot;it&#x27;s okay, trust the election officials and pieces of paper with dubious transportation mechanisms and security&quot;, don&#x27;t worry, there were official &quot;processes&quot; to ensure no irregularity.')
