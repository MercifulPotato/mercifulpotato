However I&#x27;m still waiting for aggregate-level $elemAt.<p>Logging, you can attach anything to a property, then it&#x27;ll be queryable.<p>Draft records, it&#x27;s easy to just insert and insert the records because it&#x27;s schema-less. Validate during creation and validate again during publishing or approval. It&#x27;s queryable and you can use a generic collection for that.<p>For logging and draft records, sql JSON field may be able to handle them, though I don&#x27;t know how good it is at querying.')
