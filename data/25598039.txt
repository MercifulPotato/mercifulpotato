When we look at how officials responded they shifted the conversation to metadata to downplay the amount of information and what that information could be used for. It does seem like their responses were fairly effective since people don&#x27;t consider metadata particularly useful. But also a large amount of people don&#x27;t even know who Snowden is and opinions on him are quite divided (and there are radicals with ridiculous opinions on both sides that often take the spotlight).<p>I don&#x27;t think people seriously talking about this think the government has an all seeing power or a hand in everything (I personally don&#x27;t think even China does). So it would not be expected that the CIA&#x2F;NSA or any agency could prevent a story like that from eventually breaking. But the question is how effective are they at being able to downplay it and sway public opinion? Personally I see it as subtle and frequent nudging more than active control.')
