The end goal is to build a platform that makes it easy to get high-quality data at scale -- think of labeling 100K tweets for misinformation in order to build a fake news algorithm, or annotating 500K images to measure AI fairness -- and then instantly turning that data into AI.\nWe are looking for product engineers (entry level, team lead, or anywhere in between) to join the team and help us develop our platform. It is built on Ruby on Rails, React, and Python (for the machine learning components).<p>A few example projects you could take on:\n* We work on many complex, subjective tasks like hateful speech. Is “stfu trump” toxic content that should be downranked and hidden, or is it a valuable voice that speaks truth to power? In order to maintain quality, we need to think about systems that train workers (like interactive quizzes or videos) and monitor the quality of their work. \n* We often label hundreds of thousands of tasks each day. At this scale, efficiency becomes important. How do we automatically optimize layouts and give agents better tools to work efficiently? Can we integrate ML to help automate some of the work?\n* We want to make building AI as easy as building a spreadsheet. How do we make this a fun, understandable experience? Can we give you automatic insight into your data and AI models?<p>Email me if you are interested! andrew@surgehq.ai')
