I really appreciate you all sharing why Rust is important. I value a lot of the mentioned benefits listed below, specifically wrt speed, but I&#x27;m not finding the trade-off there yet.<p>I work with codebases and projects where the expense of time is far too high to justify its usage, especially in existing designs where there is no meaningful way to extend the codebase with Rust. Believe it or not, but there really are a lot of us out there who just do not have memory (safety, ownership, or otherwise) problems with C or C++.<p>It sort of feels like the argument people make with static typing vs dynamic typing. It&#x27;s just not a concern I have.<p>Perhaps with enough time and coercion I&#x27;ll find a reason to use it.')
