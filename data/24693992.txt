With any sort of code completion, it&#x27;s 1000x easier and more productive to figure out what goes where when the computer has some idea of the types of a given varaible, and hence what operations you can do to it.<p>It&#x27;s like duck typing with a built-in Audubon society taxonomy chart.<p>You can always do whatever you want at runtime, it&#x27;s still python.<p>IMHO, duck typing is strictly inferior to interface typing. You&#x27;d define a `Number` interface which `int`, `float`, ect all implement.')
