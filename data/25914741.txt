It was the starting point of a realisation that choking off just a handful of trade routes could starve the country.<p>Today the main reminder is that Norwegian school children still tend to learn the epic poem &quot;Terje Vigen&quot; by Ibsen, about a man who braves the blockade to feed his family and is captured - coupled with food security being a talking point in other subjects. It&#x27;s not pushed very hard, and many probably at this point don&#x27;t even make the connection.<p>The main modern justification is WW2, where the subject of food security gets reinforced with stories of bread made with bark etc., and post-war rationing.<p>Couple that with the constant fear of the Soviet Union (to the point that when growing up, we had regular air raid siren tests - today they&#x27;re so rare the newspapers write articles to explain what they are) only reducing to unease about Russia, and food security is still a political topic.')
