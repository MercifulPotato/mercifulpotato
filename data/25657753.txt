I don&#x27;t think it is a better business model: I just think it will make the next 5-10 years interesting. That said, here&#x27;s the two sides of the studio story:<p>Cup half-full: our studio reduces risk by providing shared services, resources and expertise to our startups. Our studio makes our startups stronger. We&#x27;re able to leverage the investor and business relationships we have to accelerate our studio companies. We&#x27;ve seen situation X before and are perfectly equipped to guide our startups through it.<p>Cup half-empty: Risk is being aggregated into the studio. The weaker studio companies are consuming resources that would best be used to fuel the successful studio companies. On top of that, distractions and non-essential requirements are being injected by the studio.  On top of that, if big investor gets pissed with someone at the studio, future funding is in doubt for all.<p>Reality: Both views are true and accurate and at times, the positives are in play, and in other times, the negatives.')
