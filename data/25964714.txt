There are plenty of people here who don&#x27;t agree with someone being dehumanized, no matter who they are.  If it happens here, we want it to stop.  We don&#x27;t see much of that happening.  But if it is happening and we&#x27;re just blind to it, if someone doesn&#x27;t tell us, <i>then we can&#x27;t fix it</i>.<p>Now, we can&#x27;t <i>totally</i> fix it, the way HN currently works.  If I make a point denying your humanity, that post can be downvoted to death, flagged, and I can be banned.  But the post is still there, and everyone with showdead on can still see it.  So, depending on how sensitive you are to what was said, &quot;fixing&quot; it may not actually be fixing it.<p>You have your own reasons for deciding what you do.  But I&#x27;d at least suggest that you give us some kind of hint, so that we can try to make HN better.')
