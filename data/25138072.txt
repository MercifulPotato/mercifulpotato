I&#x27;d love to know more about the author&#x27;s background where he&#x27;s just now considering airflow in a home.  Maybe it seems strange to me since I was in my late 30&#x27;s before I lived anywhere that had air conditioning, so open windows, fans, cross-drafts, and general air flow were the norm.<p>I also want to see what happens when the author discovers the whole house fan.  My very first house had one and it was amazing. Crack open a window in each room and activate the fan.  Instant breeze and air circulation in every room with somewhere around 6-8 air changes per hour.')
