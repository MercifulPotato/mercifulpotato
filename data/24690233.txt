These days, every high school has an overachiever clique. These students get great grades, but also run the various student clubs, have interesting hobbies, are into activism, are usually charismatic and good looking, etc. And they&#x27;re usually popular and envied by people.<p>That&#x27;s not a change. That clique existed in 1990s high schools. They were known as &quot;preps&quot; back then, and were the opposite of &quot;nerds&quot;. &quot;Jocks&quot; were preps who played sports.')
