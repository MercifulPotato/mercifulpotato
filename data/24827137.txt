Why is it so accurate as you claim? How does it compare to existing software emulators?<p>&gt; Zero lag.<p>Have you measured it?<p>Even the original hardware had some lag. The RetroArch developers were able to surpass hardware latency by computing future emulator states ahead of time, similar to processor branch prediction. How does this system compare?<p>&gt; Bluetooth.<p>Wireless input methods probably add to the overall latency of the system. It&#x27;s noticeable on my PS4.')
