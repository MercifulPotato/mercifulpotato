Since most non-rich consumers are maxed out on debt (induced to do so by ever-lowering rates), the Fed basically cannot raise rates. If they do, increased costs of debt servicing will crater tens of millions, and also destroy many businesses. This is why the Fed is sending messages to the market that it will allow some &quot;overheating&quot; - it has no choice.<p>So with rates low and trapped at low levels, these numbers are just going to keep rising. For those who don&#x27;t have the capital to invest, things will just get worse - they have to carry the burden of inevitable inflation the Fed cannot fight.')
