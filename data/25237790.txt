Are you referring to the disaster artist consultant mentioned in another comment? I don&#x27;t think anything can stop someone like that from wrecking things short of not hiring them.<p>Or do you mean that small incremental improvements shouldn&#x27;t be attempted because a proper review of whether they are worth it or not will be &quot;wasted effort&quot; if its decided they are not worth it?<p>Or something else? Not being sassy, genuinely unsure.<p>As for me personally, I would never hire an outside consultant to improve a codebase. The incentives are all wrong (long term maintenance to be done after they leave) and it&#x27;s unlikely they&#x27;ll be working on it for long enough to properly understand either the codebase or the domain.')
