In fact, I&#x27;d say that Brace Belden didn&#x27;t even cover some of the most terrible parts. That being said, it&#x27;s a great intro for the uninitiated.<p>Keep in mind that this is kind of a comedy podcast that&#x27;s highly irreverent and critical of society as a whole, and is often pottymouthed.<p>I suggest skipping the first 15 minutes or so, as it&#x27;s a lot of goofing around before they get to the main topic.<p>To clarify, I do not endorse this podcast overall. I don&#x27;t endorse any podcasts as I rarely listen to any of them. I had a friend suggest this particular episode because she knew about my experiences at this facility and thought I&#x27;d find it interesting. This is the only episode of this show that I&#x27;ve ever listened to.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stitcher.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;trueanon&#x2F;episode&#x2F;episode-100-brat-camp-77755445" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stitcher.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;trueanon&#x2F;episode&#x2F;episode-100-b...</a>')
