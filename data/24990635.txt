It&#x27;s the fold changes that matter when interpreting two different probabilities (e.g. making decisions under uncertainty), not the linear difference.<p>The proper interpretation of your Case 1 and Case 2 should be the ratio of heads and tails as you flip coins, not the difference in the absolute number of heads that show up in the two cases.')
