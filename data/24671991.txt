It&#x27;s therefore far-fetched to explain focus on privacy with that.<p>Also as bad as the Neo Nazi Terror is in germany, it&#x27;s actually worse in some other countries. In the US nazi militias continually existed throughout the 20th century. You rarely see it in the news because nobody seems to care and the organizations are not only legal but even get support from the US president. Please also consider acts of Nazi Terror that happened in NZ and Scandinavia.<p>Moreover right wing conservative movements like AfD are also much stronger in other countries, e.g. RN in France, PVV in NL or Fidesz in Hungary.')
