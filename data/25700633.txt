Let&#x27;s be honest, he does speak in a particular way and avoids statements with clear interpretations. And arguably he actively plays with the occult crowd&#x27;s obsession with hidden meanings and symbolism.<p>Fact is, his communications do have severe, real consequences and he fails to recognize that. It is therefore completely irrelevant how something could possibly interpreted otherwise. Human communication doesn&#x27;t work like that.
