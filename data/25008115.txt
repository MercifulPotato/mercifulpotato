The stock battery with the latest apple firmware lasts about 18 hours with 450mAh. There are better 1300mAh+ batteries that offer a lot longer time though. Like others have mentioned Rockbox firmware is also available and will increase the battery life too.<p>The iFixit site has nice repair articles for how to change the internals. An upgraded SDXC memory card with 128GB of space runs about $30. You could also buy a modded mini with this kind of storage off ebay for around $125 but it probably won&#x27;t have the nicer battery life.<p>If you really like the nano you could also swap out the nano battery to bring it back to life. It doesn&#x27;t look like the storage is replaceable though.')
