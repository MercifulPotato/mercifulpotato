Going from metal to scene graph management can be complex. I remember when I started in OpenGL back in the day - it gave me a strong appreciation for why middle ware existed.

Then there is the issue of animation — and the rest. Art pipeline ? Textures or vertex colors ? Rendering engine is a pretty big deal. The rest IMHO is pretty simple in comparison...')
