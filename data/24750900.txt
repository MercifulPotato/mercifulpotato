I&#x27;m aware of Cepheus (essentially a solution for perfect Limits Heads Up) and I see they did some further work in No Limit, but there isn&#x27;t anything since a February 2018 publication. So either this work is dormant (seems plausible) or they are <i>really</i> under wraps on something, &#x27;cos if you don&#x27;t publish for over two years in academia you&#x27;d better have something amazing to show for it.')
