That&#x27;s not a differentiator, but usually people object decentralized solutions because they fear that anybody could access the data. So it&#x27;s built into the protocol itself, and you can&#x27;t accidentally send unencrypted data to the network.<p>For most users, the real benefit is price. Also, there might be users who can&#x27;t use AWS S3 for example, because it&#x27;s not available in their country for some reason.<p>There is liability, but it&#x27;s handled through smart contracts. The hosts have to insert collateral to the system, which they lose if they can&#x27;t hold their end of the data contract. The data is also replicated to multiple hosts, and encoded with erasure correcting code (with user selected redundancy) which protects against host failures.')
