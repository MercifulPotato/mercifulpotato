I don’t think it’s a bad thing to not be able to sit in a plain room doing nothing. We have an innate desire to create, to solve problems, to interact with others. That doesn’t mean we don’t think and can’t be preoccupied or entertained by our thoughts. I think most of us just tend to be engaged in something mindless like showering, walking, or driving while we do our thinking.')
