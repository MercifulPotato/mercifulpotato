I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#x27;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.<p>As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#x27;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein.')
