I have a lot of issues which feel like they&#x27;re blood sugar related(extreme fatigue after meals, &quot;brain fog&quot;, low energy, sleepy all the time but my apnea and nighttime SpO2 is fine, bouts of feeling hypoglycemic), but every time I&#x27;ve checked my glucose levels they&#x27;re normal.  I suspect I am becoming insulin resistant but I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Things seemed to really go downhill after I tried intermittent fasting(16&#x2F;8).')
