I am simply pointing out that &quot;arithmetically most of the things they did are harmless&quot; is not a good argument. Most of the things Bin Laden did are benign, Him studying eating, partying, watching TV, taking a dump, playing a ball etc. probably accounts for %99.999 of his actions and being a horrible terrorist is just %0.001 of who he is, if we are looking for a benign&#x2F;illegal ratio.<p>IMHO social media needs to be regulated, companies should not be able to simply cut you off from the rest of the public and you shouldn&#x27;t be unaccountable for your actions and there must be ways for harm reduction. (if you tell&#x2F;share a something, them maybe people affected by it should have right to equal exposure to challenge it. i.e. their POV could be attached to your post and everyone who interacted with your post receives a notification that the post was challenged)')
