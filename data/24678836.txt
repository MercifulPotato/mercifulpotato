It&#x27;s important to understand your position as a developer.<p>Users of your code are only obliged to &quot;Release all modifications&quot; to you if they&#x27;re distributing the code or binary with you.<p>This might seem like seem like nit-picking, but I can take your GPL project, work on it and sell it to a dozen companies, and <i>you have no right to my modifications</i>. The companies I&#x27;ve sold to could give you a copy if they wanted. But your rights aren&#x27;t omnipresent.<p>They also don&#x27;t stop me using your code in otherwise proprietary SaaS, again contributing nothing back upstream. AGPL targets this.<p>GPL is good. It&#x27;s good for users in a way that few appreciate. More software should be GPL... But there are complexities, far more than I&#x27;ve covered above, that many releasing developers struggle to anticipate.')
