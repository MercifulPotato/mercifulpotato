Item(by='gfodor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607793980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399771, text='I apologize if this was misleading, my point was to emphasize that the population involved in the &quot;one third&quot; proportion was <i>not</i> Republicans. (It&#x27;s a third of Americans, not Republicans.) Thinking a third of Republicans think there was widespread election fraud would be concerning and somewhat surprising (at least to me, given &quot;widespread fraud&quot; is far from being in evidence) so it felt worth emphasizing that was not the population, but it in fact includes polled Democrats and Independents.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s much worse than that: a third of Americans believe it (which shows its appeal to centrists and&#x2F;or the depth of Republican belief), and if you dig into the crosstabs, the number of Independents who believe it (approx 1&#x2F;3rd) and Republicans who believe it (approx 3&#x2F;4ths) is <i>quite</i> concerning. For such an extreme question (&#x27;widespread fraud&#x27;) I would have expected this to be a fringe belief. The belief that would have made these numbers less surprising would have been questions such as &quot;do you believe there is some evidence of targetted fraud&quot; etc. Given that I&#x27;d suspect nearly 100% of Republicans believe some form of fraud occurred. If so, the entire losing party believes they were cheated to some degree. This isn&#x27;t a recipe for reduced conflict from here. It means that the radical end of the party is large enough to be meaningful, and it means that large parts of the population will be less likely to condemn actions they take given the widespread shared beliefs.')
