The trains are pretty cheap compared to the cost of car ownership in America.  From another comment I wrote:<p>&gt; I live pretty far from central Tokyo and for between 200-350yen one way I can get to Shinjuku &#x2F; Shibuya &#x2F; Ikebukuro &#x2F; Ueno and everywhere in between. So that&#x27;s 400-700yen round trip for a night out.<p>&gt; In Seattle or Atlanta? You&#x27;d be extremely lucky if your destination within a 15min walk of a bus stop or train station. In Atlanta good luck not getting mugged while waiting for the bus at night. Uber typically costs $10-15 one way (although to be fair you can split the cost between friends if you&#x27;re travelling together).<p>&gt; Or if you own a car in the US, you can reliably get from A to B, but you&#x27;re paying between $5-10&#x2F;day for insurance (whether you use the car that day or not) and $10-20 to park if you&#x27;re in a city.')
