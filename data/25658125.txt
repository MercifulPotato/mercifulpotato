It is an organized effort with decades of history. They also take donations and hire enough experienced contractors who ensure the work is done to code (I&#x27;ve volunteered before).<p>The volunteer aspect is there so that people who don&#x27;t have money but have time can give something. More fundamentally, there&#x27;s a religious element to the &quot;service&quot; (that&#x27;s why I put it in quotes). In Christianity, being near the poor and literally serving the poor is very much a spiritual act which is done not ONLY for the benefit of the poor but for the benefit of those who are serving them. This is decidedly NOT morally incompetent. I admit this isn&#x27;t an ROI which would be seen as valid in the project management book of knowledge, but it&#x27;s real for the people who believe it.<p>The OP essay was just a sloppy way for a founder to justify his pivot-- which never actually needed justification.<p>The actual justification for the pivot was simply the original idea, &quot;Quirk&quot;, wasn&#x27;t ever going to get vc funding and make a 100x - 1000x return. I think it&#x27;s disingenuous to invoke the concept moral competence for what is ultimately a materialistic decision.')
