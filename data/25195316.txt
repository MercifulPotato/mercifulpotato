Indeed, the life expectancy of Hispanics in America is about the same as people in Finland.<p>It would be odd to see such disparities between maternal mortality on one hand and life expectancy on the other. Likewise it would be odd for Finland to be so much better than the UK. So I suspect there is more to the story than “large parts of America are a third world country.”')
