It&#x27;s a pattern of behaviour.<p>Avoiding overly litigious companies - where other as-good or better choices exist - is not overly cautious, it&#x27;s just good sense. Where other as-good choices do not exist, it seems perfectly reasonable (depending on your risk profile) to work with others to create the better choice.<p>Of course, I say all this as someone who has worked in massive multinational corporations and now work in small startups. I&#x27;m now likely never going to use Rocky Linux for exactly the reason you&#x27;ve hinted to - in effect, it is not a usecase either of us care about. But for those people who do need this, I&#x27;m very happy that someone has championed the cause.')
