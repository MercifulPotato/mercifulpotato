We live a ways down a pretty narrow private road and despite talking to the UPS freight manager a couple of times, they kept sending full sized 18 wheelers which would have a hell of a time coming down the road and turning around, not to mention probably damaging the road.  After 3 times of them sending a full sized truck over the course of 2 weeks I just rented a UHaul and drove across the damn metro to get it.<p>B2C freight is a bit of a shit show.')
