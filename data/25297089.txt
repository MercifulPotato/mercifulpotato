She said she asked about the substance of the feedback and they refused to tell her.<p>After that meeting, she is told she can be read a private document with some, but not all of the anonymous feedback.<p>That led to Gebru sending a frustrated email to her colleagues and a separate email with conditions that she was willing to resign over.  In that email it seems like she asked to knows the identities of the people who gave the feedback that let to the demand for retraction.<p>Jeff Dean says that Timnit wanted the identity of the people who gave the feedback as a condition for staying.  Then he describes what that feedback was.  He doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that Timnit was not given the substance of the feedback in the first meeting when she asked for it.  And it sounds like the full feedback wasn&#x27;t given later during that private reading.<p>The feedback Dean cites that led to the retraction doesn&#x27;t at all sound like something that required the protection of identities, and certainly nothing that required keeping that feedback secret.  If the reviewers felt like the paper left out some relevant research, why wasn&#x27;t that communicated fully and clearly in the first meeting?<p>Jeff Dean&#x27;s email seems to leave out a lot of context about everything leading up to Timnit threatening to resign.  At the very least it doesn&#x27;t seem like the reasons the surprise retraction order came down weren&#x27;t revealed at all until some time after that first meeting.')
