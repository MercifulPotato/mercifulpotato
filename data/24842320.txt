It&#x27;s crazy that they&#x27;re all getting rejected, there is nothing wrong with them, the company is overly picky for no reason.<p>Digging down there&#x27;s probably 1 who got an offer and rejected it. Companies always forget to mention that half of their offers are rejected, hiring would be easier if they improved on that.')
