Even with the bailout, many suffered.<p>But I agree with you that the way they bailed them out did not hold them accountable, they should have &quot;invested&quot; in those banks by buying newly issued shares which would have completely wiped out the existing shareholders.<p>However, rather than the normal way to raise capital, they gave a blanket permit to the federal reserve to buy the bad debt from the banks.<p>The US government and the people by extension should have become the owners of those banks which they could resell the ownership again on the private market with a profit at a later point.')
