Right now they&#x27;re collecting a bit of dust mostly, but I hope that will change again once this whole situation is over.<p>I would have been interested in the Pyra when it was first announced (in fact, I did follow the project for a year or so when I first heard about it in 2016 or so), but at this point there are so many better (and similarly priced) alternatives out there that I have a hard time seeing who would be the target demographic. Still, I hope they will find some success with it since they seem to have their heart in the right place.')
