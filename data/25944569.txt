That is entirely different from the activity I am alleging is being done on WSB (by a subset of posters).<p>&gt; This is essentially Reddit saying &quot;This stock is going up, so buy options to exacerbate that and to profit.&quot; No misrepresentation.<p>I see threads where WSB is saying &quot;This stock is going up, and if we make it go up more, hedge funds &amp; market makers will have to buy more stock to cover their short positions, and therefore it will go up even further [and we will make more money].&quot; That&#x27;s the manipulative part â€” creating artificial prices to induce even more demand.')
