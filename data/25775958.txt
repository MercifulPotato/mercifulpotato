Overdoses are prevented because they can happen in safe places where people will notice.<p>Even if that is true, the harm that does <i>not</i> come from the fact that it&#x27;s illegal would be magnified a hundredfold if it became as widespread as alcohol (which is, please keep that in mind, the scenario I was talking about). That&#x27;s not hyperbole: Accodding to the European Drug Report 2018 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emcdda.europa.eu&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;8585&#x2F;20181816_TDAT18001ENN_PDF.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emcdda.europa.eu&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;8585&#x2F;...</a>), the prevalence of injecting drugs (chiefly heroin) is between 0 and 0.9%, which consumption of alcohol is pretty damn near 100%.<p>&gt; Considering tobacco is more addictive, and we have way less crime to buy tobacco, it seems logical to assume crime would drop if drug addicts didn&#x27;t have to spend 20-30 a day on drugs. Then you have the violence and anti-social behaviour which for most drugs is non-existent.<p>Even if that is not exaggerated (which I strongly supect it is), those are not the only kinds of harm: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;heroin&#x2F;what-are-medical-complications-chronic-heroin-use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;hero...</a>')
