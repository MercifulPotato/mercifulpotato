Usually when I explain my reasoning (which I apply to almost all new game releases), people seem to understand:<p>a) There is no way of knowing if the game is gonna be good until real copies land in the hands of people who play games to have fun, instead of reviewers who are too worried about giving an honest review with the fear that they won&#x27;t get future review copies or get sued.<p>b) Games generally get steep discounts a year or so after release. This is not universal, but if you avoid buying into the hype then you&#x27;ll save yourself a considerable amount of money.<p>The only way to hold these companies accountable is to vote with your wallet, and so I always encourage people to reconsider pre-orders.<p>I&#x27;ll be eagerly waiting to see if the game gets the love it deserves over the next year and if it turns out to be a flop, it&#x27;ll just join long line of over-hyped AAA release flops.')
