Itâ€™s not that I care personally about this particular action; in truth I have almost only ever seen meme videos on Pornhub. But it feels like it could be a precursor to another push to censor pornography and the internet.<p>I would go even farther to worry that this might begin to push the Overton window towards demonizing any content posted online that isn&#x27;t &quot;verified&quot; by a real identity. MindGeek (the company behind PornHub) was also backing the UK&#x27;s law requiring an ID to watch porn online. If users get comfortable with the idea of having even their porn tied to a real ID, wouldn&#x27;t they become comfortable with less &quot;private&quot; content also tied to their legal identity?<p>I don&#x27;t want to read this headline from the future: &quot;Pornhub requires an ID, should Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan do the same?&quot;\nAnd I also don&#x27;t want to read the future headline: &quot;Pornhub&#x27;s ID database hacked, thousands of models names and addresses exposed&quot;<p>Anonymity is important (imo) and it would be a shame to see people use porn as the excuse to curtail it. Surely it&#x27;s possible to remove illegal content without stripping away privacy and anonymity.')
