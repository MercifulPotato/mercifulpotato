Item(by='mattlondon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610226544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;byexample.xyz" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;byexample.xyz</a><p>Ran out of time to make more content, but I still add something every now and then when I learn something new. I think the plan was lots of useful copy-pasteable snippets (inspired by the gobyexample site) and then some ads.<p>For the curious, it is a Jekyll site (ported from Hugo) served from GitHub. Source on github.  Workflow is <i>super nice</i> - edit markdown and run locally (if you want to preview - you don&#x27;t need to if you dont want) and just push to GitHub and the changes are live within a minute or two - GitHub pages is an awesome service for this sort of thing.')
