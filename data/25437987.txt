If you want to not only learn regular expressions, but have them be clear upon first glance and now how to optimize them based on your regular expression engine&#x27;s implementation, then his book is gold.<p>The first half is about using them, and the second half is focused on optimizing. You can skip the second half and still get a lot out of it, but it really is some fantastic stuff.')
