Item(by='noodlenotes', descendants=None, kids=[25031854, 25030819], score=None, time=1604887362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030628, text='&quot;Democratic&quot; is confusing because it could mean either &quot;relating to democracy&quot; or &quot;relating to the Democratic party&quot; whereas &quot;Republican&quot; almost always refers to the party. I don&#x27;t blame anyone for using a less ambiguous word and this is the first I&#x27;ve heard of &quot;Democrat&quot; being an insult.')
