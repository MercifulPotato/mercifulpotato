I was mostly saying, I don&#x27;t think MWI helps us understand where the probabilities come from any more than any other interpretation--you need something more.  And if you can&#x27;t identify where the probabilities come from, then saying your theory is &quot;deterministic&quot; rings fairly hollow to me.')
