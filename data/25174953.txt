If we were to make roads equally available to all regardless of means, I should be able to travel to 100% of Australia, not the small fraction served by PT and P2P.<p>What I object to is that the tax for blind road users is several orders of magnitude higher than driver-users. And that comes with the caveat you can access maybe 5% of areas in Australia by PT and P2P.<p>At least my kids can use schools without an orders-of-magnitude higher tax. They can only use parks accessible by PT and P2P (which - in Australia - is a very small fraction).<p>So I get we all should pay for shared resources. But its less fair to ask someone who isn&#x27;t permitted to access these shared resources an orders-of-magnitude higher tax to access a tiny fraction of those resources.')
