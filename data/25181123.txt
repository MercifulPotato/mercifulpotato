That is a slippery slope. These government officials have thoroughly demonstrated their incompetence and unwillingness to admit their failures. When they have taken more power, when have they relinquished it?<p>Also consider that the US is a Republic and lets states keep larger amounts of their rights to run their own state the way they want. There federal government cannot legally prescribe solutions, only encourage and inform.<p>Another reason to avoid bluetooth all together is the immense amount of tracking going on in the physical world via Beacons. I explicitly disable bluetooth when not using it. I would not be surprised if Apple &amp; Google or the Govt use this information &#x2F; tech for other reasons.')
