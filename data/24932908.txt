Item(by='mswtk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603992672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930401, text='The report linked mentions the ACLJ being involved in several ECHR cases, and submitting an amicus brief in favor of the recent Constitutional Court decision. That&#x27;s it. You think that&#x27;s enough to push the government and judiciary of a nation of 40 million into confrontation with a large social movement, with mass ongoing protests. And it&#x27;s me who&#x27;s naive?<p>Again, it takes a serious amount of arrogance to read two paragraphs of text in a report and believe yourself to be better informed than someone who spent all of their life immersed in the historical and social context of what&#x27;s going on. So, with all due respect, I have the same advice for you as for the original post I replied to: Get over yourself. Not everything in the world is about Trump.')
