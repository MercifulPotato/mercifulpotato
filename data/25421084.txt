Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607969995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420822, text='&gt; Amazon, Google, Microsoft start building their own chips for their own clouds.<p>At least Amazon (Graviton) and Google (TPUs) already are. Google is also reportedly looking into its own ARM CPUs for its own mobile devices (Pixel line); if it does, I can’t imagine Cloud would be far behind.<p>&gt; At least Microsoft is likely to sell their chips to third parties (they used to sell their software).<p>I would expect MS would keep its chips for its hardware, rather than selling them. But, sure, either they or Google might sell to partners, to help out the ecosystem for their OS&#x27;s.<p>&gt; If you want to develop for AWS you’ll be safer to have a laptop with an Amazon chip, if you want to develop for Google Cloud a Google Chip, for Azure a Microsoft chip.<p>In either case, cloud-as-dev environment is being actively pushed by all players, and negates that issue. It doesn’t matter what chip (or OS, or much of anything else) I have on my laptop if my dev environment is in the same cloud that I’m deploying to.')
