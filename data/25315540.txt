Eventually something like Rust or D may have equivalents to all the libraries I want and I could use those for such projects instead, but for now, if I want to use those things, I need to use C++.<p>You may also want to look at this talk: &quot;What C++ got Right&quot; [3], where the guy shows some nice things that C++ does that other languages don&#x27;t. The other languages versions of the code he shows does tend to be simpler and nicer, but the C++ versions tend to give you more control. Some people value that control (rightly or wrongly) and other languages that don&#x27;t provide it will never feel right to them.<p>I do personally quite like Rust and I&#x27;m eagerly watching Zig and some of the other new contenders, so I&#x27;m all for moving to something more pleasant than C++, but modern C++ gives just enough new niceness that I don&#x27;t feel pushed to jump ship until the alternatives check more boxes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skypjack&#x2F;entt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skypjack&#x2F;entt</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arximboldi&#x2F;immer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arximboldi&#x2F;immer</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bMSrNBcir4Y&amp;t=1757s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bMSrNBcir4Y&amp;t=1757s</a>')
