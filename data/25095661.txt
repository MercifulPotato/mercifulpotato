When they teach military history in the military (and I imagine the goal of academics like this person are similar) the goal isn&#x27;t explicitly to fight <i>less</i> wars. That&#x27;s a lofty goal, and maybe attainable, but probably far off for humanity as a whole.<p>This article talks about war and militaries in general but I wanted to talk about how this can benefit Americans.<p>The reason they teach military history is so that we learn what&#x27;s worth going to war for, what&#x27;s not, and what we can do differently in the future. Ignoring what popular culture entertains around military logic for a second, the military (and governments) put a lot of factors into going to war. Those deserve some <i>honest</i> review, what often happens is outright downplaying, dismissal, etc because as they said the sentiment is that <i>war is ugly</i>. No matter the side you find yourself on this is the case.<p>This thought can be refined that <i>war is ugly, but someone has to do it</i>. Critical to any military, much less society, is the concept of a warrior class. Americans by in large, at least the ones I know, have no knowledge of the qualities, creeds, or convictions of the warrior class and thusly don&#x27;t respect it much beyond some stuff they see in movies or read in books.<p>History can help shape the warrior class through the generations but also gives us good lessons on how to be healthier, more efficient, and more effective when needed. Learning from groups like the Israelis or the French Foreign Legion who maintain strong warrior cultures can teach us things about mental health, strategy, traditions, etc...<p>Also by teaching military history you actually form trust in the institution of the military. For instance, America&#x27;s military at the time of it&#x27;s forming was quite unique. You had a military force of volunteers that sprung up and after the revolution maintained some autonomy from the government but took a solemn vow of apoliticalness. This vow is still alive and well in military institutions but it can wane. Not only could it garner the trust of the public that people like the Joint Chiefs have the American people in mind but it would also remind service members why that vow is sacrosanct in a world that increasingly pressures you to be and act politically.<p>The last thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that provides some <i>real</i> pride around the military. Not nationalistic, chauvinistic pride but pride that even the people who have to do the most seemingly in-humane jobs have some humanity about them. Additionally, there&#x27;s some confidence that if a powerful foreign nation did start World War III that we would be well equipped with citizens who can deal wit it. In my life I&#x27;ve met people who have some facade appreciation of the military or people who clearly hate the military and let those convictions infect other thoughts. Seemingly there&#x27;s pretty few inbetween and I think a lot of this comes from a lack of understanding.<p>One of the stories I found more recently is the story of The Bonus Army (further reading: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bonus_Army#:~:text=The%20Bonus%20Army%20was%20a,redemption%20of%20their%20service%20certificates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bonus_Army#:~:text=The%20Bonus...</a>.) Patton and McArthur are widely regarded as champions for the idea that no service member should be left behind, even if they were a corpse. It&#x27;s the same ideology that fuels us continuing to search for bodies to this day. These same people, of the same convictions, right before the war attacked an encampment of veterans from WWI who were seeking early cash out of their war bonds because they were already homeless and had lost everything. They drove <i>tanks</i> into DC with <i>Army Infantryman</i> to take down peaceful demonstrators of their own ilk. I don&#x27;t think McArthur and Patton are bad people, on the contrary I think they&#x27;re people of astounding convictions, but knowing this history lets us understand a bit about people and maybe a little about life.')
