Like 1000 doors. If I choose one at random I am pretty unlikely to be right on that first choice. But then he opens 998 of the unchosen doors, knowing he won&#x27;t open the door with the car, I would think oh if it was originally in any of the 999 unchosen doors it is in the one he didn&#x27;t open.')
