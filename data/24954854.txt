I think it hasn&#x27;t happened for two reasons:<p>1. School is childcare for a lot of people; secondary schools let out early so older siblings can take care of younger ones.<p>2. As COVID has shown - it&#x27;s difficult to manage multiple hybrid schedules and cohorts in an equitable way, especially if you&#x27;re not expanding the number of teachers (which most districts can&#x27;t due to budget constraints)<p>This is a little US-centric, but I suspect it applies broadly to the rest of the West at least.<p>Source: Parents worked in primary&#x2F;secondary ed.')
