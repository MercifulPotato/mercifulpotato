That&#x27;s why I think &quot;intolerance of the intolerant&quot; is good. Most law books in developed democracies agree with me. White supremacists, racists, fascists, extreme wahabists&#x2F;salafits dont. They want to incite hatred&#x2F;violence (to non-violent&#x2F;tolerant people). I&#x27;d say shut &#x27;m down and&#x2F;or dont give platform.')
