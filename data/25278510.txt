People choose not to get tested for this reason. I don&#x27;t think if people do die here, they actually are tested unless the family requests it, most don&#x27;t because of the shame of it.<p>The only difference between Japan and most other countries is that people voluntarily wear masks here for some inexplicable reason, thank god, because without that, it would be ultra ugly.')
