It is if you want to get all of your daily news that way. But if it&#x27;s an area you care about and you&#x27;re somewhat affluent, it&#x27;s well worth the money. (I&#x27;d think a good chunk of HN e.g. has a subscription to Stratechery)<p>It&#x27;s a workable strategy for a few extremely good journalists. But there are a lot of issues with it.<p>Societally, this is problematic in that it makes decent reporting a luxury good. Long-term, this is a problem because there&#x27;s no institution where junior journalists can learn the trade. In terms of information, it&#x27;s a problem because there&#x27;ll likely be no way to get a wider overview of world news in that way.')
