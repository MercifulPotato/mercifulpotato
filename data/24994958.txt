Coincidentally this is the book of the week in my book club so I&#x27;ve been re-reading it.<p>The Last Lecture book can be read as a series of short stories and often I just pick it up and read one quick section. My favorite is where he argued with his mother about his name. Yes, his name. He didn&#x27;t like Randolph and protested, especially by being burdened by an extra  &quot;olph&quot; &lt;joke about a bout a computer scientist named Rand here&gt;. Their negotiation ended with &quot;R.&quot; but when his mother would send letters addressed to him at college as &quot;Randolph&#x27; he would mail it back, unopened, marked &quot;no such person at this address&quot;. As he got older, he recognized that &quot;I&#x27;m so appreciative of my mother on so many fronts that if she wants to burden me with an unnecessary &quot;olph&quot; whenever she&#x27;s around, I&#x27;m more than happy to put up with it. Life&#x27;s too short. Somehow, with the passage of time, and the deadlines that life imposes, surrendering became the right thing to do.&quot;')
