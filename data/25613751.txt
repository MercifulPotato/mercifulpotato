I usually check the scan results every week or two to see if it finds anything new, and I know our Head of IT also keeps an eye on them. In an ideal world we&#x27;d automate this away but have a raft of more pressing priorities.<p>We also use tools like Dependabot to keep an eye out for vulnerabilities in our dependencies, and update them to patched versions.
