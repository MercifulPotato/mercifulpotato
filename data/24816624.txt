We are gradually working towards single errors being correctable, but we&#x27;re not there yet.<p>On the railways in Britain the failures were extensively documented. Years ago it was possible for a single failure to cause a loss. But over the years the systems have been patched and if you look at more recent incidents it is always a multitude of factors aligning that cause the loss. Sometimes it&#x27;s amazing how precisely these individual elements have to align, but it&#x27;s just probability.<p>As demonstrated by the article here, we are still in the stage where single failures can cause a loss. But it&#x27;s a bit different because there is no single universal body regulating every computer system.')
