It already supports MithrilJS and Svelte applications running transparently as in SciterJS as in browsers. React (PReact in particular) out of the box support is coming. The main goal of SciterJS is to provide compact (5mb runtime) <i>desktop</i> runtime environment that can use components and designs made for Web.')
