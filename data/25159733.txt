Taking stock is the activity, but the goal is to relieve you of the stress of keeping many things in your head (and fearing dropping some). The open loops, as they say. By leaving stuff in your inbox (say, a bill to pay), you never really put that loop to rest unless you actually pay the bill. With projects support, context lists and a regular review process, you can still get it out of your way and know with confidence that you won&#x27;t forget to pay that bill in time because you trust your system.')
