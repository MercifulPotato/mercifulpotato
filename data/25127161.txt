Aside from games, it&#x27;s just so much faster and ad-free compared to using a Smart TV&#x2F;Roku&#x2F;Apple TV&#x2F;etc. They&#x27;re also easier to operate with a Logitech K400r keyboard and touchpad. Add an XBox controller and a decent GPU and it&#x27;s just like using a console but with cheaper games.<p>You don&#x27;t need to build an expensive gaming PC either. My 4 year old i5&#x2F;GTX1070&#x2F;16gb&#x2F;SSD still plays all the games I want it to. I can even play at 4K. I expect this $900 machine to last me at least a couple more years.<p>If you just want to watch YouTube&#x2F;Netflix&#x2F;etc on your couch and do some very light gaming though, check out what you can get for ~$200 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07B8VX5HZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07B8VX5HZ</a>')
