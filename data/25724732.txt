Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=[25725426], score=None, time=1610341210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25724636, text='&gt; public declarations that violence was needed<p>Can you source these in the case of BLM? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m missing. Preferably equivalently specific plans, which amount to &quot;our intent is to physically harm police officers and destroy a police precinct&quot; at a minimum.<p>&gt; how long the violence took to kick off, or who made the first escalation don&#x27;t strike me as very relevant.<p>I think they&#x27;re highly relevant to discussing the goal of the protests. If a group of protestors shows up and demonstrates peacefully, but is eventually goaded into violence by the group they&#x27;re protesting[0], that&#x27;s very different from a group that essentially immediately attacks the people they&#x27;re protesting.<p>And, of course, all of this entirely assumes that both groups have equally valid concerns, which is just plainly not true and important to realize. If you&#x27;re going to take a stance that violence is absolutely <i>never</i> valid, that&#x27;s an interesting opinion that I don&#x27;t believe I share. But if you&#x27;re of the opinion that violence may be an acceptable response to injustice, well, there&#x27;s a whole lot more reason to believe that BLM protestors have justification for their claim of injustice than stop-the-steal protestors.<p>[0]: I&#x27;ll reiterate the importance of this, in general, especially with police tactics that escalate and force violence, such as kettling. While I don&#x27;t think that specific tactic was present at the 3rd precinct events, tactics that escalate violence are often used against BLM protestors, to predictable results. The fact that violence was reached quickly and without any of those tactics at the capitol speaks to, I think, a different mindset.')
