Where people say that Tesla can do no wrong, to TSLAQ, everything that Tesla has ever done is fraudulent. They set themselves up to short the stock, and then unleash endless attacks on rumors on Twitter to try and make a buck.<p>For example, there was a organized campaign and innuendo to the effect that Tesla wouldn&#x27;t sell any roadsters - then any S, then any X, then any 3s.<p>Then they started that all of the threes where going to a landfill, or left baking in the sun for months because the door handles didn&#x27;t work. Then they claimed that Tesla would never sell the model 3 in Europe, due to regulatory problems.<p>They also have apparently paid people to hack Tesla and then release the most negative information to earn money on their shorts.<p>Niedermeyer became famous for establishing a &quot;Tesla death watch&quot; column back when they were making the roadster.<p>Not saying that Tesla does everything right (they don&#x27;t) - but at the end of the day, TSLAQ is just the automotive variant of QAnon.')
