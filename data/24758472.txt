The Linux box I use as a router gets a single (i.e., &#x2F;128) address from Spectrum Cable on its upstream interface, and it has to explicitly ask for a separate &#x2F;64 prefix to advertise on the local interface (this is called prefix delegation, PD).<p>So it&#x27;s certainly <i>possible</i> for an ISP to give a customer just one IPv6 address. I&#x27;m not sure, but I think there is no rule that prefixes obtained with PD must be &#x2F;64&#x27;s. They could in principle give you a &#x2F;126 or &#x2F;127 to limit you to just a few hosts on your LAN, and charge to give you anything better. This would break stateless autoconfiguration but it would still work with DHCPv6.<p>Your best workaround is still www.tunnelbroker.com, HE&#x27;s free IPv6 tunnel service.')
