And yet...<p>Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s an election year, and the decision is going to be made just a few months before the election.  Let&#x27;s say that the lives saved by a stay-at-home order will be mostly saved after the election, but the pain of the lockdown will be before it.  (If any of that sounds familiar, it should.)
