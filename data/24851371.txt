Item(by='CydeWeys', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603309973, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850822, text='&quot;Intrinsic value&quot; is a phrase that has a specific meaning in economics, and you are not using it according to that definition.  The current ability to pay taxes with a currency is <i>not</i> intrinsic value by the standard definition of the term.  That currency could drop to worthless tomorrow and would be worth nothing.  Go ask holders of Weimar Republic marks how much intrinsic value their currency ended up having.  None!  The value was hyper-inflated out of existence and the country that accepted it as tax payment no longer even exists!  But if that currency had been made out of actual gold, then it would&#x27;ve had intrinsic value, and it would still be valuable today.<p>Guess what ... your dollars today are not made out of gold.  They have no intrinsic value.')
