The core idea is that you have pressure to deliver a product (get &quot;real&quot; work done), but also maintain or improve your ability to do the work.</i><p>This nudged a decade-old memory of how non-profits (and to an extent, the public sector) find it much easier to get funding for specific outcomes, but incredibly hard to get funding for what they usually call &quot;capacity building&quot;. The medium-term solution seems to be outsourcing to a vendor that can both deliver an outcome and amortize capacity building across many customers in your sector, but over the long term this leads to a form of organizational learned helplessness, and vendors that eventually switch to rent-extraction rather than delivering outcomes <i>or</i> building capacity (or rather, the capacity they are still building is largely the ability to secure contracts).<p>Ironically, the longer the vendor takes to switch to a rent-extraction strategy (and the more slowly they boil the frog), the more entrenched they become as a defacto standard, and the harder it becomes to eventually displace them (for a competitor) or replace them (for a customer) as a vendor.')
