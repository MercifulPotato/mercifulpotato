It&#x27;s good to know how that can go. Not the best possible outcome, but not the worst either.<p>In regards to this:<p>&gt;I would like to end the story with some action items like: “Next time, when I rent a place, I will do XXX.” Nothing reasonable comes to my mind.<p>Something you can do is carry anything with high value density, and hide other valuables out of sight. I tend to carry things I&#x27;m attached to with me, especially when in unfamiliar area. An AirBnB is not much different from a hotel room in terms of valuables safety. You don&#x27;t know who may have access to the place. It&#x27;s nice that AirBnB replaced your stuff.<p>Just want to let you know, while your site is loading, it shifts around several times, which gives it a bit of a janky feel. Looks nice otherwise, though.')
