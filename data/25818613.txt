Since the kitchen usually has neither the time or the money to have a bunch of trained chefs cook their meals, they just order frozen cake and pasta from the same retailer that everyone else uses without particularly checking the quality. They also copy the menus and prices for what to serve from the internet to save time.<p>If the customer has a bad experience with a specific plate of pasta or piece of cake, they just say “Sorry!“ and replace it with a new one automatically. Most of the times the people coming to the restaurant are not particularly discerning anyway and just want something to satiate their hunger, so they are fine with this arrangement. New packaged flavors are rolled out periodically by the frozen food company and so the restaurant can even boast a seasonal menu!')
