There’s a chance that a job takes longer than average, which would cause the queue to grow longer. You might say, “Yeah, but they could also be shorter than average.” And you’d be right. But consider: If the average job takes 5 steps, then “shorter” means 1-4. Longer means 6-infinite. A single job taking 25 steps (5x average) would require either a lull in arrivals (statistically possible but unlikely) or a series of short jobs to balance it out. And while waiting for the queue to die down, yet another job could take longer than average setting you back again. You can only improve the queue in small increments, but you can increase it arbitrarily with one bad job.')
