They replaced the screen, and when I came home it froze one time, and started beeping 3 times indicating ram problems. Because it was iMac, i had a chance to rearrange RAMs to boot up but it still was freezing up at times. I ran memcheck, found errors, and then figured out which ram planks was faulty.<p>The thing is that the issue started long before that, my Blender app would crash in tens of times a day, and same with Solidworks on windows.<p>So yeah, i recommend running memtest and replacing ram if necessary.')
