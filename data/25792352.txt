By doing that, it accomplishes two things:<p>* The loudspeaker frequency response is consistent, no matter whether you&#x27;re standing directly in front of the speaker, or to the sides. IE, the placement of the loudspeaker is less important than with older designs.<p>* Most importantly, a waveguide takes the energy radiated by the driver and it focuses it into a narrower beam than a conventional tweeter. By doing this, reflections off of the sidewalls, ceiling and floor are less of an issue.<p>To make a long story short, modern studio monitors with a waveguide are less fussy about placement.<p>Reflections off of the sidewalls, ceilings and floor can still cause issues with lower midrange and midbass response, but these issues can be fixed with EQ to a large extent.<p>The reason that EQ is less effective at high frequencies is because the wavelengths are so short. For instance, 5khz is 6.8cm long. Because it&#x27;s so short, equalizing that frequency for one point in the room can screw it up at ANOTHER point in the room.<p>Low frequencies are much longer, and because they&#x27;re longer, EQ is more effective. For instance, 500Hz is 68cm long. Because of this long length, if you EQ a speaker to flatten out a peak at 500Hz, that EQ will be effective over a broad range of positions in the room.')
