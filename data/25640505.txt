Dithering reduces the former to simulate increasing the latter.<p>Perhaps we can get a similar result by interpreting the original signal (after linearization) in a different way. It could represent (after normalization) the probability each pixel would be 1 or 0. That way, brighter areas would have more density of bright pixels, and darker areas would have more density of dark pixels.')
