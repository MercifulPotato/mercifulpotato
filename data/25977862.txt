It doesn&#x27;t matter if the technique is explicitly listed in the codec or not.  You need clients that will tolerate infinite P-frames, and they will work equally well whether you&#x27;re using intra refresh techniques on h.264 or h.262<p>The dumbest possible renderer would have full support; it takes extra logic to get in the way and break it.')
