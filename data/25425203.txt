I broke my foot about 6 years ago - badly. Lisfranc fracture, which is most common in football players (and is a career ending injury typically). I went to the ER in blinding pain, quite nearly passed out from that pain in the waiting room. They gave me a morphine injection, which helped a great deal while they did X rays. The doctor (mis-)diagnosed me with a severe sprain and tried to send me home without meds. I asked for some, and was reluctantly given a prescription for Tylenol w&#x2F;codeine. I&#x27;ve heard similar stories from other people.<p>As a contrast, any time I&#x27;ve had even the most simple dental or other procedure, the doctors give me a prescription for pain meds without me asking for them (and in many cases not really needing them). So this seems to be specific to ER docs. I suspect it&#x27;s a reaction to having to deal with people who are drug-seeking, but I don&#x27;t really know for sure.')
