Counting the number of cards a developer closes over a certain period allows us to see what actual work is getting closed off.<p>Measuring closed tickets is an excellent metric if the tasks are written well and assigned based on business priority. When more tickets get closed, more good things are happening with the project, be that bugs getting closed off or features made.')
