To this day it still detrimentally affects individuals trying to enter a work force by creating an artificial barrier.<p>Currently, there is a push to increase the minimum wage to $15. If I oppose this on my concept of what it is, a vestige of systematic racism that contributes further to that system, then what do I make of proponents of the increase who argue that voting against it is racist.<p>The entire endeavor is a waste of time, the politicos will do what they want and then tell you why we should hate Eurasia.')
