The only reason I can think of that one would do that is to see how it works, but one also has to look at e.g. the definition of a function to see how that function works, and that should almost never be important. How are macros different? Just like functions, one often has to read the documentation to know <i>how to use</i> a macro, but I&#x27;m not sure how being a macro makes (loop for i from min to max do ...) harder to read than a function would be.')
