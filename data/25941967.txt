Item(by='TheRealDunkirk', descendants=None, kids=[25946369], score=None, time=1611843193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941689, text='&gt; Why do Robinhood, Reddit, Discord, etc feel like they have to respond to this?<p>Indeed. There&#x27;s a lot of talk about Section 230 lately, and how &quot;precious&quot; it is to freedom of speech. That law protects them from culpability against hosting legally-dubious things like this market move -- and any malfeasant commenting about it -- but none of the big platforms are acting like it exists. They&#x27;re just censoring anyway, because they are either embarrassed, or are getting their strings pulled. Either stand behind Section 230, or admit you&#x27;re just censoring things for duplicitous reasons of politics, money, or the rabble.')
