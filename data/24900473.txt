The understaffed police force (meaning per-capita officer counts well below median) are unable to investigate these crimes and so perpetrators are never identified and arrested. This is because violent crimes take priority and so there simply isn&#x27;t enough staffing to devote time to other crimes.<p>Surveillance and facial recognition could help our police force effectively put this limited staff to use, so that criminals face consequences and crime is deterred. I have no problem using technology to enforce existing law effectively, just as I have no problem with cops using cell phones or vehicles to do their job. I do find the dystopian extent of how these technologies are used in China (e.g. social scores) to be unacceptable, but we can institute the right regulations around these technologies to prevent broader abuse while still retaining the benefits (a cheaper and more effective police force).')
