That&#x27;s already illegal.<p>Insecure spyware&#x2F;crapware is a distinct (commercial) market which doesn&#x27;t overlap much with the other two and doesn&#x27;t rely on &quot;0day&quot; at all.<p>Broadly I agree with your analysis re: Microsoft&#x27;s motives here.<p>However I believe the OP&#x27;s analogy holds if you don&#x27;t overextend it beyond exploit sales to government.')
