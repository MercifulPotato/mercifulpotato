As a VR game we attracted a lot of childrens and first time player players, who were overwhelmed.<p>We then added really easier game modes (and when i mean easier, i really mean &#x27;you could litteraly walk thought the game for one or two minutes ignorings ennemis until you die&#x27;.<p>One of the recurring bad review (not the only one, the game have others problems) we had was the game was too easy, and looking for player stats, we could see video reviews of clearly seasonned fps player, rolling thought the easy mode for obvious reason and quitting after some time finding the game too easy without even trying the second diffulty setting on the 5 availables.<p>I&#x27;m sincerely curious as a developper to how we could improve things for our next try. We could have started the game on an harder difficulty by default, but we did not want to force a non veteran player to check &#x27;mega-beginner-dumbed mode&#x27; on startup.<p>Another point we had and could explain hollow knight difficulty : it&#x27;s impossible for a gamedevelopper to estimate difficulty on your own game when you work on it for over 2 years. Even if you are normally not very good on the genre You get insanely good at it pretty quickly.')
