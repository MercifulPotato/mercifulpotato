It doesn&#x27;t help that they are over-represented in painful bankruptcies, like Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, or that many local government pension funds have an over-exposure to PE funds.<p>Next, you are correct that LBOs buy lots of distressed companies as well as healthy ones.  But if you look at the distressed companies that they buy, a large portion started off as healthy companies before they were first bought.  And if they do proceed to bankruptcy, very frequently their only real problem is the crushing debt that the buyout left them stuck with.  See, for example, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.<p>Moving on, why do people loan money to them?  There are a number of reasons.  But one of the biggest ones is that banks are lending money created by the Fed to prop up the economy, on the bet that the Fed will create more money later to enable them to close out their position.  This is a cycle that has been happening since QE started post-2008.  Certainly that is a prime explanation for the eye-watering trillion dollars in loans to zombie companies since COVID started.<p>And finally, the &quot;hard decisions&quot; that you&#x27;re talking about very often take the form of finding things that can be cut.  Like maintenance.  If you stop that, your costs go down, your revenue is untouched for a long time, your financials look healthy.  The reason why the original management didn&#x27;t decide that is because they were looking at what happens 20 years down the road, and recognized that failing to pay these costs would be a net loss.  Or that failing to keep a hospital up to date will cost actual lives.  But PE has a much shorter planning horizon, and figure that the next owner won&#x27;t figure it out until after the PE company has their profit locked in.<p>Now none of this is to say that the other things that you recommend aren&#x27;t good ideas.  However when I go to a local hospital, my odds of dying are increased because it likely has been taken over by PE and they prioritized profits over lives in the cuts that they made to maintenance.  I&#x27;m not OK with this, and would like to see the people running those PE companies have to face personal liability for the effects of their actions.')
