Item(by='dannyw', descendants=None, kids=[25132809], score=None, time=1605664408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25131151, text='&gt; When you look at markets like &quot;Who Will Win California&quot; or &quot;Who Will Win the Popular Vote&quot;, I&#x27;m convinced that many people making bets are delusional.<p>These are basically deep OTM options. In Feb this year, you could call a deep SPY OTM put as delusional; because the speed of the market crash has never happened previously in history and is a 6 to 7 sigma event. These options would have paid out 10,000%; at the best possible times.<p>There are various possible events in the world which could&#x27;ve caused a popular win victory for Trump. Such as:<p>* Biden getting COVID and not surviving\n* Armed warfare or terrorist attack against the United States\n* other unlikely, but possible events.<p>There is a premium to insurance paying out when SHTF. There&#x27;s also high withdrawal fees on PredictIt and betting size limits.<p>Look at Betfair if you want a better example. Quite rational markets.')
