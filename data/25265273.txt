That&#x27;s it. But it has huge implications.<p>The trust factor requirement is removed from the physical infrastructure and operators.<p>For bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, this is used for a ledger of value transactions.<p>Now we have an way to transfer ownership and value. What the internet did for information transfer, we now have for value transfer.<p>Ethereum generalizes this with a virtual machine that can run arbitrary computation and store arbitrary state.<p>A trustless global value transfer machine that requires no PII (which could be regulated, and added as a requirement in compliant applications, of course), central point of trust, or custodian of data. Where the security layer between the service&#x2F;application&#x2F;protocol and the end-user is abstracted away and taken care of by the Ethereum ecosystem.<p>In the phase we&#x27;re in right now, a lot of applications are related to finance. There is both transformation of traditional finance[0], and the new sector of &quot;defi&quot; that IMO is here to stay and grow but is in the early half of a huge bubble that will burst hard).<p>That aside, this is enabling a new way to structure ownership, applications and anything between. If blockchain-based currencies and smart contract platforms end up as Orweillan tools of control, or liberating and improving our society, is mostly lot up to developers, teams, and users.<p>I hope more people get it.<p>But not not too many too soon, because the infrastructure wouldn&#x27;t handle it. Eth2 improves on that by magnitudes, so this news is a crucial step.<p>[0]: Source: Working at a digital asset service provider with some bigger and more well-known financial institutions as clients, and friends in the industry.')
