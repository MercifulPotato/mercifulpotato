Plenty of scientists will say they &quot;believe&quot; in evolution, for example.<p>We don&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; in scientific concepts. Their being a fact has no precondition on whether (or how many) people believe in them. Evolution didn&#x27;t begin when Darwin started studying it.<p>That being said, you&#x27;re right. We have to start somewhere. For example, scientists just a hundred or so years ago believed in the existence of something called aether. I believe many (most?) scientists will change their opinion if we can provide them evidence contrary to their belief. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_exper...</a><p>On the other hand, scientists are just human as well and are subject to the same flaws and limitations as the rest of us. Facts are only facts, until they are not (that sounded weird, I am not actually against evidence based decision-making). I mean we make what we think is our best attempt at describing our world given the tools we have and the reality we live in. I wouldn&#x27;t put too much weight that scientists believe aging is optional any more than I&#x27;d put weight on scientists saying technically it is possible for us to fly in a metal tube across the Atlantic Ocean or that technically we can put a man on the moon... until it happens.')
