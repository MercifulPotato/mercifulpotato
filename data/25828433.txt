What are the specs for that? What would satisfy Amazon? Can it be delivered within that timeframe setting aside whatever else is going on?<p>What makes you think Parler is interested in complying with the terms of the contract at all?<p>The only benefit of Parler over Twitter or Facebook is the fact that you can say things which will get you banned on the bigger platforms. If Parler implements moderation which will comply with Amazon&#x27;s terms of service, why would anyone use Parler at all?<p>&gt; These are real concerns for a company going forward. I guess many do not state because of the political ramifications of this particular case, but it will be discussed in board rooms.<p>Why? If you are a startup for a recipe making app, are you going to be worried about a company who got booted from a service for allowing users to discuss kidnapping, rape, and murder openly?<p>If I&#x27;m a business, it&#x27;s a simple question. Can we operate on AWS&#x2F; Azure&#x2F; Apple&#x27;s App Store&#x2F; etc and meet their terms of service. There is a huge world of business ideas that don&#x27;t need to violate the fairly broad terms in Amazon&#x27;s TOS.')
