It also tracks heart rate, but with a caveat which is it doesn’t track while you’re moving quickly, so it’s not really an exercise tracker. (Something about how it’s tiny sensors work)<p>My combo is Apple Watch by day, Oura Ring by night. I don’t often wear them together.<p>Very happy with the setup and would recommend.')
