I had to fish around for what this UUID was actually referring to, to track down the bug. It was an integration with a partner, and some faulty branching logic.\n- We ask our customer support team to add IDs to engineering support request (customer ID, order ID, etc etc) so that we don&#x27;t lose time. Sometimes they make a mistake (or it&#x27;s not always clear what they&#x27;re supposed to do) and we get a user ID that doesn&#x27;t refer to any user. Bit of fishing around then again\n- Wild logs: &quot;could not find entity f5fac1d0-5d0f-11eb-9ab7-3e22fb071270&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could find more example but you get the gist of it')
