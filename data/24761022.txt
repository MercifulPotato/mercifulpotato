I got to know her decently. When I was emailed by my first recruiter (it was just a blanket message, but I took it seriously since I was young and dumb), I asked her for some advice since she was already in tech for longer than I was alive at the time. I asked what exactly the recruiter&#x27;s goal and point was to all of this and how to best utilize the opportunity.<p>&quot;A recruiter is your pimp and you&#x27;re a prostitute. Work with them so they get you better dates.&quot; Was all she really told me on the matter.<p>From there, I reached out to recruiters and worked with them. I ended up choosing to just take contract jobs for the 1099 pay and flexibility. Plus, the guy I ended up working with was able to pimp me out more often and made more money. I got more and better work. Plus, they&#x27;re stellar on re-writing your resume for you.<p>7+ years after leaving that, I still have a few emailing me with jobs. No one forgot me because I didn&#x27;t let them. Recruiters are only shitty bottom feeders to folks with shitty, privileged attitudes. They like working with partners, not self-centered assholes.<p>Also, I call bullshit on your pivoting&#x2F;jump ship comment. They jump ON folks that they can pad their resume and pimp them out for more money. The more roles you &quot;could&quot; fill, they can translate to a vertical and horizontal experience spectrum that crushes the competition, which they then sell you for double even though you&#x27;re still only doing one job. They&#x27;re the salesmen. Let them sell you.<p>That and my parents came with $15 bucks and a kid to the USA with the state funded sponsor disappeared with their grant the day before they landed. But hey, just like you, I didn&#x27;t mention that to podium in the Victim Olympics. One thing I learned about all of us first-gens, we&#x27;re all equally angry cunts.')
