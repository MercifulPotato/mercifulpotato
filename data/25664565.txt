Either MySQL or postgres should be fine.<p>This is old, boring tech but works fine and will scale up without issues for the workloads you mentioned. IIRC even stackoverflow.com is powered by a SQL db.<p>For a beginner, learning this will offer most value.<p>For more scalability, you have to enter nosql territory. Typically you add caches in front of your db to speed things up. These are not tables, but key-value stores. Redis and memcached are quite popular.<p>When you need even more, you can use nosql databases. Normally you would just use what your cloud provider offers, unless you have a team who can administer your own. However, it’s important to understand that they don’t offer more functionality than SQL dbs, but less: features are often sacrificed for the sake of performance, at the expense of increasing complexity as well.<p>So in my opinion, just learn SQL first, and anything else if needed.')
