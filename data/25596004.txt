We have quality and variety. It&#x27;s also very cheap to live here compared to other places.<p>And that&#x27;s pretty much it as far as pluses as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>The job market tends to be good overall, but I would say the jobs are not as good, at least as far as technology. This is mostly &quot;Line of Business&quot; land, and while there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, you&#x27;ll often find technology companies here who are still stuck in the old ways of making and delivering software.<p>Oil and gas rules here and everything tends to be centered around that. The list of companies here doing what most of us would consider to be interesting work is rare. Also, you&#x27;re going to be hard pressed to find anything that isn&#x27;t centered around Java and&#x2F;or .NET, so be aware of that.<p>And while real estate is cheap, it really depends on where you live. You MUST have a car to live in Houston. You also may find yourself commuting 45+ minutes each way if you aren&#x27;t careful and don&#x27;t have a remote job.<p>Oh, and the weather here SUCKS.<p>With that being said, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s worse places to live.')
