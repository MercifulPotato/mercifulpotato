It&#x27;s not a &#x27;top EU court&#x27;, or an EU court of any sort. It&#x27;s a body of the Council of Europe, which is an entirely different institution (with a much larger international membership than the EU). It enforces the European Convention on Human Rights.<p>(the EU does requires members to be CoE members, and so there were some people suggesting that after leaving the EU the UK might also leave the CoE - possibly including theresa may, I haven&#x27;t checked - but that doesn&#x27;t currently seem likely to happen)<p>The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is definitely a thing - basically a copy of the ECHR into EU law - but it&#x27;s only applicable (1) to actions of EU institutions, (2) as a restriction on EU legistation, and (3) as an obligation on member states _when interpreting &#x2F; implementing EU law_. It has no relevance to UK law other than that. (And what little relevance it would have had to the UK was further weakened since they had a partial opt-out to it that tried to get rid of the last of those for the UK!).<p>The cases about UK surveillance legislation (eg [0]) were all ECtHR, not CJEU.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hudoc.echr.coe.int&#x2F;app&#x2F;conversion&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;?library=ECHR&amp;id=003-6187848-8026299&amp;filename=Big%20Brother%20Watch%20and%20Others%20v.%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20%20-%20complaints%20about%20surveillance%20regimes.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hudoc.echr.coe.int&#x2F;app&#x2F;conversion&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;?library=ECHR&amp;...</a>')
