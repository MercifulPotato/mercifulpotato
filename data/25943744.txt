But then again, the subject here is not &quot;big companies&quot;, so, I&#x27;m not really sure how your story is related to the story we are discussing here.<p>As for &quot;let the experts do that&quot;, you really make it sound like running a service on a linux box is something &quot;for experts&quot; which clearly is a fallacy. Unless you mean that &quot;running nmap to check that your firewall works is something for experts&quot;, not sure where you place the bar for what you call &quot;experts&quot;, is making a systemd service or timer or starting a container better left to &quot;experts&quot; ?
