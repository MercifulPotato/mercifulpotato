Honestly, the reliability wasn&#x27;t great. The dump1090 process would randomly disconnect, generating nuisance alarms from my tablet - usually in busy airspace. It also had trouble picking up some ground stations.<p>I switched to a Garmin GDL-52 instead. Reliability has since been rock solid. Received signal strength from ground stations are an order of magnitude better.')
