She was able to get married, have three kids, go through graduate school and had a nanny, in her words she &quot;had everything&quot;. Yes her husband was borrowing them into bankruptcy but to say she was so naive and stupid to not understand what was going on and still be able to attend grad school, either means she is a liar or something even worse about graduate schools.<p>I think it is far more likely she got everything she could out if this sucker of a guy, threw him under a bus, then took the kids and moved to another state where she can find another victim or get praised for being able to overcome being a hapless single mother with an abusive ex-husband.<p>What a crock!')
