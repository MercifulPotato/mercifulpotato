It is very worth learning, but learning it takes time. Be careful not to confuse “we need to move fast” with “there is no time to learn how to properly use tools”. It’s worth understanding. You will have both initial nimbleness and something that isn’t far off from production ready. To be completely honest, I am still in the active learning phase with both Docker and Compose, but it’s helped keep me organized already.')
