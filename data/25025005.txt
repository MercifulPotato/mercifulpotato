And the tool you&#x27;re so enamoured with, postgraphie, even has a dedicated section on this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphile.org&#x2F;postgraphile&#x2F;production&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphile.org&#x2F;postgraphile&#x2F;production&#x2F;</a><p>Let me quote: &quot;Due to the nature of GraphQL it&#x27;s easy to construct a small query that could be very expensive for the server to run&quot;.<p>And lo, and behold, it doesn&#x27;t really have a solution against it.<p>So you have to either revert to basically REST with a predefined number of whitelisted queries, or pay for an experimental extension that attempts to calculate the cost of query.<p>&gt; And if you split fetching the data by multiple endpoints and pretend your job is done, basically delegating the problem to your clients, what else can I say?<p>You can say something that actually shows that you know what you&#x27;re talking about. Because you clearly have very little knowledge about REST and very sparse knowledge about GraphQL. You don&#x27;t even know that unbounded complexity and infinite recursion are inherent in GraphQL.')
