You can&#x27;t just have a casual game. Someone in your group thinks themselves a &quot;player&quot; and has to ruin the day with minimaxing or whining when they&#x27;re strategy didn&#x27;t work against novices because novices are essentially random agents. You can&#x27;t just play a game and have some fun in the moment. Everything has to be dissected. Every move you make has to be criticized. It&#x27;s disgusting. I like games, but I almost never play them because I can&#x27;t stand the fucking nerd culture around them.<p>It&#x27;s probably been the going with my wife to Mensa&#x27;s Mindgames convention every year that has pushed me here. Too many people tie up their identity into being able to best everyone else 100% of the time. Frankly, being good at card games doesn&#x27;t make you smart. Anyone could do a frequency analysis and figure out an optimal strategy. That&#x27;s just being boring and an asshole.<p>Honestly, my favorite games either have much more of a random element, or take a crowd judgement, rather than a Turing Machine-cum-card-deck. If I wanted to program, I&#x27;d write a program.')
