Perceived success or lack thereof is independent of a human being&#x27;s innate value. To me, the message is not &quot;you can do anything&quot;. Instead, it takes the element of success out of the equation.<p>However, this attitude could help someone become successful as it removes the notion that one is inherently inferior and can help one feel that bouncing back when things go wrong is possible.')
