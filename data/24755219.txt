People build cross-compilable C code that works on both. It&#x27;s just a bit of a hassle because the semantics are different in key places.<p>Leaving aside things which touch the GUI (which is a lot! You need a window to receive messages to use certain APIs!), the next big differences are the process API (no fork, starting processes is a lot more time consuming) and the advanced filesystem API (completion ports).<p>There are frankly a few pieces of the API that I would like to see go in the other direction, like WaitForMultipleObjects().')
