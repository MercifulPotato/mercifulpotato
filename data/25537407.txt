Back then it ran on a limited set if hardware, as well as on VMs, although I didn&#x27;t manage to get that working (thus QEMU). Pretty ambitious. Already has small games and applications written for it. It&#x27;s quite neat, but lacks the kind of unique selling point that would attract commercial interest. As far as I know there is no role it can fulfill better than Linux. There&#x27;s the security you get from it being written in Rust, of course, but there has always been less interest in security than you&#x27;d think it deserves. I vaguely remember there being some talk about using it for DNS servers, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m not super up to date on the project, so take everything I&#x27;m saying with a pinch of salt.')
