Item(by='zdragnar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605563035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115716, text='&gt; consider how programming (especially hacking) is portrayed in popular film&#x2F;tv. usually it looks very little like what we actually do all day<p>That&#x27;s because what we do would genuinely be <i>boring</i> to watch in a tv show or movie. I can think of exactly <i>one</i> time in my 12ish year career where a co-worker actively fought a malicious actor, and that was more entertaining than anything.<p>This is true of most jobs, present and past. Ever see a soldier or warrior with a sword strapped on their back and draw it out to do battle? Yeah, thats not a thing. It looks cool, but is physically impossible to do smoothly or single handedly with all but the shortest of swords.<p>Similar things can be said of archers, peasants, gypsies, police, journalists, etc.<p>While I am on a rant, the term &quot;bohemian&quot; when used for artistic hippy types is blatantly racist, and we have ignorant young French aristocrats to thank for it, but nobody actually cares.<p>Would a fisherman write such an article? No, because the article was about a transformative experience which defied expectations. A fisherman who has done naught else is not likely to have the same experience, but that doesnt change what the author <i>did</i> experience.<p>I don&#x27;t see what is uncomfortable about that at all. &#x2F;end long winded meandering rant that probably missed the point')
