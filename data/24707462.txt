It admittedly has been a couple years since I checked in on nanotube production, but I found they will be cheap.<p>Also, cycle endurance is paramount in a usable battery, did I miss that? High density batteries form dendrites when they discharge, gradually ruining the battery. The nanotube structure would probably help though.<p>Anyway, need cell cost, vol and mass density, cycles, temp ranges, charge&#x2F;discharge raye. Those make for a competitive battery.')
