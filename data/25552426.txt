I like flying my drone, and I do so responsibly.  I don&#x27;t want people like this ruining it for others, and I especially don&#x27;t want people like this endangering others with their irresponsible behavior.<p>I have a DJI Mavic Mini.  If you&#x27;re marginally competent, DJI makes it very clear that you are operating an aircraft and have rules to follow.  In certain circumstances, you do not need to be Part 107 certified to operate this aircraft, nor do you need to register your aircraft.  That said, you still must follow <i>all</i> related FAA regulations, like them or not.  From the linked video from @nathancahill below, I see the Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) issue, night time flying (appeared to be started before the 30 minute twilight, and I doubt he had supplemental lighting which would have brought it over the weight limit for registration), and generally reckless operation.  Height is to be 400 feet AGL (above ground level) unless near structures, which allows you to operate 400 feet above that (ยง14CFR107.51(b)).<p>The FAA warned him.  He didn&#x27;t pay attention.  Maybe a $182K fine will get his attention.')
