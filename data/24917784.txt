It&#x27;s not like say, lockpicking or DRM-cracking, in that the subject matter is super hard to begin with, even without the proprietary sabotage.<p>Having said that, there has been some promising F&#x2F;OSS work on the small Lattice devices. It allows for a decent, modern workflow, and it&#x27;s possible because the devices are approachable, but also because Lattice hasn&#x27;t been hostile.
