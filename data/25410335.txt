It is very subtle, but rather amazing if you think about it. Because C++ can return a &amp; reference, it can return a reference to a value on the  stack frame of the callee, which then becomes invalid. But the var&#x2F;out variable always exists on caller&#x27;s site, so it is always safe.<p>(at least if it a reference to the stack. a  reference to the heap could be freed indirectly through another reference.  )')
