It&#x27;s also not so much faster to run on e.g. NVIDIA GPUs, where much lower GFLOPs don&#x27;t necessarily translate into much lower milliseconds due to EfficientNet having _a ton_ more ops in the graph, and those ops being &quot;small&quot; and unable to take advantage of all the throughput. Indeed, some configs are slower than comparably accurate alternatives. TL;DR: just because Google is able to get sexy results out of this doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t better options available to you to solve practical tasks.')
