I&#x27;d go one step further and say it&#x27;s inculcating of identity in general. As well as manufactured desires to keep power systems in place.<p>People are not encouraged to find their own identity or explore inner mind. It&#x27;s all bread and circus everywhere, to stop you from paying attention to your inner self. We have ancient teachings on this topic dating way, way back (like Upanishads), yet we still haven&#x27;t found a good way to actually teach and implement them.')
