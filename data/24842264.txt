This failed due to the ministry of foreign affairs being ridiculously slow to update the risk assessments, so Italy was not high-risk when people went there on vacation.<p>Then Sweden was going to handle those imported cases easily through pure excellence in contact tracing, so there was supposedly no need to quarantine anyone in any way. That failed very quickly.<p>Then, after the complete failure of containment, it was announced we were going to prevent the virus from spreading to particularly vulnerable groups while allowing it everywhere else. The Germans meanwhile said that this couldn&#x27;t be done - and of course it couldn&#x27;t. Later, the high number of deaths was stated to be because of those groups being disproportionately affected. So this was a clear failure.<p>Every part of this absurd strategy has failed.')
