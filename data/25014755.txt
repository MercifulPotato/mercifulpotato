Rodriguez resents progressive movements that seek to upend the current social hierarchy (presumably because Rodriguez enjoys exerting social control far more than experiencing it) and has coined this new jargon to associate movements he dislikes with a reviled term (totalitarianism)\n&gt;\n&gt; Rodriguez begins with an intellectual lie, then uses it to advance the idea that anti-racist and anti-misogynist movements are the actual oppressors. And not the misogynists and racists themselves.<p>What evidence is there that progressive movements are actually seeking to upend anything? Seems to me they&#x27;ve been culturally dominant in America (i.e. they control the schools, the media, entertainment, government bureaucracy and now Big Tech) for over a century, and have this been influential in the rest of the West.<p>As far as I can tell, progressive movements like BLM and MeToo are absolutely attempting to preserve the existing order. After all, these movements and groups are well-funded by the very people you suggest they are trying to take down. These movements and groups (and you?) appear to cheer 1% of the population holding 99% of the wealth as long as that 1% is 50% female, 14% black, 5% percent LGBT or whatever, etc.<p>The intellectual lie you begin with is that progressives don&#x27;t already have a complete monopoly over the relevant cultural power.<p>EDIT:<p>&gt; <i>Insanely</i>, Rodriguez points to...<p>Also, if I were you, I might be cautious about using the I-word.
