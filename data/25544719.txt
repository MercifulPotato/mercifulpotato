Item(by='tacostakohashi', descendants=None, kids=[25546321, 25544824], score=None, time=1609002700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544538, text='I had an Amazon item that didn&#x27;t show up &#x2F; got lost by UPS. The process presented by Amazon for this was pretty silly &#x2F; tedious:<p>1) Initially, the tracking page said the item is late, maybe lost, if it doesn&#x27;t arrive by X date (2-3 days after it was due), check back here to initiate a replacement &#x2F; refund.<p>2) I went back on X date to arrange a refund. You click the button, initially it takes you to an automated chat thing that asks is this the item you are asking about (yes), do you want a refund or replacement (refund)... then it hands you over to a human and you have the same conversation again.<p>3) Finally, the human issued the refund... but as a gift card &#x2F; credit without asking me.<p>In any case, it was a 5-10 minute process hidden behind both automated and non-automated chats, which is stupid and unnecessary, especially considering that these are the people that invented (patented) 1-click. They knew from their own tracking that it was missing, so it could and should have just been a single button for replace vs refund.<p>I suspect the steps depend on the item &#x2F; amount involved, some customer risk score, etc, etc, I am sure it&#x27;s all very elaborate, but in my case it was tedious.<p>Issuing a gift card is consumer-hostile BS too, should be outlawed if you ask me. I paid for something with money, it didn&#x27;t show up, so I get the money back, simple. If I wanted to buy a gift card, I would.')
