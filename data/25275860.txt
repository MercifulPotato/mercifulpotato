We have ca. 30 servers and I can move things around without any problem. Most of them are already configured and ready for operation; reconfiguring is easy. With AWS, first of all you need to learn all their ecosystem, and then we had constant problems with cost allocation. Yes, you can book all these charges under &quot;IT&quot;, but it&#x27;s too broad, you need to assign them to projects. And then they constantly grow.<p>With bare metal it&#x27;s 100% predictable. Where to book the sudden spike in costs in April? Why did it happen? We had €3000 booked for this project in April, why do we have to pay €5000? And so on.<p>Sure, if you have too much money to burn and the financial department is lax with controlling the costs, AWS feels great, but not everybody has this luxury.')
