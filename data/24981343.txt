It was fully decked-out, very heavy and was so loud I eventually had to get rid of it. Fun times â€“ I learned assembler on it. Later I got one of the faster UltraSpac-II workstations. It was pretty cool that you could drop into the OpenFirmware and pretend to be a Forth programmer whenever you liked.')
