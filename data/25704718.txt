In the case of Trump&#x27;s Twitter ban I would agree with you - it will enrage Trump supporters and cause them to disengage from constructive debate. And Trump&#x27;s tweets aren&#x27;t really examples of &#x27;inciting violence&#x27;.<p>But in this case some Parler users are saying, &quot;They should have burnt down Nanci Pelosi&#x27;s house with her inside&quot; and &quot;That cop should have been shot and bleed out&quot;. \n This is clearly encouraging acts of violence, and the costs of giving such people a megaphone outweigh the benefits of engaged debate.  So Apple is right to insist that Parler moderate such speech.')
