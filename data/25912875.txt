Which is expensive and requires an entire new distribution infrastructure. So as an owner of a hydrogen car, I will have to bare the brunt of that.<p>Second, you have to make sure that the seal is tight? What happens if there is a leak? What are the safety standards? Do we trust the average person to do this correctly (especially since this is the first time most everyone will be doing this)?<p>And third -- There isn&#x27;t a performance benefit? So why would I buy this over the existing options?<p>With electrics, none of these are an issue - distribution happens over the grid, fueling up is dead easy (we all know how to plug into a power outlet right?) and there are huge performance gains.<p>I do not see the advantage of this at all.  If anyone else here has some insight that I am missing here - please enlighten me. This to me is just a gigantic dead end.  Toyota went down the wrong technology path.')
