The other company did not moderate their content, they were not found liable for their user content. Anecdotally one of these services was seen as the good one and the other as the crappy one because of their moderation policies.<p>While social media didn&#x27;t exist at the time in its current form, I&#x27;d argue this is still very relevant today. Without section 230 websites would only be able to moderate for illegal content, and there&#x27;s a mountain of stuff you wouldn&#x27;t want to see online that isn&#x27;t technically illegal, and a lot of people who will try to put it in front of you if given the oppurtunity.')
