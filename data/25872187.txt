If you go straight to page 3, it will be empty. Doing the latter is almost like a bug to me, because you are then on a potentially misleading page:<p>&quot;Your search - &quot;why wikipedia is free&quot; - did not match any documents.<p>Suggestions:<p><pre><code>    Make sure that all words are spelled correctly.\n    Try different keywords.\n    Try more general keywords.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhich is clearly not the case since my search has &quot;about 1,920 results&quot;.<p>Why is Google showing that page 3 in the first place? Is it related to the location and intended or is it a bug?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%22why+wikipedia+is+free%22')
