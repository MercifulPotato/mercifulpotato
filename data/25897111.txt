There&#x27;s a bad part of computer science that&#x27;s a lot like\nreligion. And in general, I think people who really believe that you design\neverything before you implement it basically are people who haven&#x27;t designed\nvery many things.<p>The real power is that you can pretend that you&#x27;ve made the decision and then\nlater on figure out which one is right, which decision you ought to have\nmade.
