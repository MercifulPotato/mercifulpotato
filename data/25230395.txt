Item(by='kmeisthax', descendants=None, kids=[25230932], score=None, time=1606496700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229297, text='The American government insists that patents, trademarks, and copyrights are respected worldwide without jurisdiction because they got everyone else in the room to agree to do that in exchange for import market access. That&#x27;s why the WTO TRIPS agreement exists. Everyone agreed to the same laws, and agreed to allow foreigners to sue domestic businesses, so it doesn&#x27;t matter who has jurisdiction over what. America doesn&#x27;t buy your cheese unless you agree to protect their movies. The only outliers are countries which have already pissed off America so much that market access without regime change is off the table. So, if you see someone say, for example, &quot;but DMCA doesn&#x27;t apply in my country&quot;, they&#x27;re either wrong, or you should start looking up the export regulations involved with knowingly talking to Iranians before you wind up in federal prison.<p>This isn&#x27;t even exclusively an American problem. The EU and Japan do it too, and more countries will start doing that as they start getting stronger domestic creative industries. The more money a country makes from owning copyrighted works, the more protection they will demand from other countries. Hell, the last major copyright term extension (the &quot;Sonny Bono&quot; one in the US) was started by the EU doing the same thing to America. The EU passed a term extension that had a reciprocality requirement: if America didn&#x27;t agree to the term extension, then American works would enter the public domain in the EU quicker than EU-origin works did. This is a <i>fiendishly clever</i> way to ratchet in term extensions, and it works because the WTO treaties only specify maximums for copyright <i>exceptions</i>, not <i>protection</i>. You&#x27;re always allowed to go stricter.')
