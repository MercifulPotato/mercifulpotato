Impose a 2% tax on all crypto transactions, which would serve two purposes:<p>1. Legitimate use would be allowed, which is a good thing.<p>2. Illicit use could be pursued by tax auditors, who are in many ways far more effective at achieving an outcome than are prosecutors.<p>A ban is just a tax anyway. A tax that you pay, in risk adjusted terms, by being forced to pay the costs of dealing out of sight of the tax authorities.')
