They&#x27;re not tools - you don&#x27;t use them to create things or to do your job. They&#x27;re more akin to movies - compiled and packaged &#x27;experiences&#x27; that are by design read-only. When you buy a DVD, you don&#x27;t expect hundreds of hours of unedited footage to come along with the film so you can cut together your own version. The same is true of games.')
