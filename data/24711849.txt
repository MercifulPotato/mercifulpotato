Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking I need to make my own dream, so to speak. I want to build something for myself maybe - just enjoy the product of what I&#x27;ve learned and the skills I&#x27;ve developed. I enjoy working with my team and having a job, but I think my next step might be taking a break to just enjoy creating something. I definitely feel that &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; question creeping up more often these days.<p>I think that was the original dream in a way too - to learn enough to be able to create the things I imagined. Maybe I&#x27;ll work part time at regular work and part time on the &#x27;dream&#x27;, who knows. Like others have mentioned though, there&#x27;s often a lot to be grateful for in the moment, dreams aside.')
