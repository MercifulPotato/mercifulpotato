Item(by='cataphract', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611170581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848076, text='&gt; A check and balance has been on great display in recent weeks. A President has stated, &quot;the election was a fraud, I should get another term&quot;. Congress has stated, &quot;the election was correct. Moreover, we may choose to prevent you from holding office ever again.&quot; The judiciary agrees.<p>It surely worked, but with the majority of the Republicans in Congress objecting. And one can&#x27;t help but wonder what would have happened if the election had been closer (you&#x27;d just need to ramp up the voter suppression a bit more). We had a taste of it in Bush v. Gore, where the judiciary decided to stop a recount with a very poor justification. Now imagine it in the much more polarized environment of today. Or with someone actually competent, who managed to solidify power over 4 years rather than doing opposition to his own government half the time.')
