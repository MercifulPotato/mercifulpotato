The model is all users can use octave for lower level &#x2F; common code components and it works finw, and then the system level guys who really require matlab for its toolboxes can also use them and that common code also. If it was not for the advanced matlab toolboxes (and some key engineers who know only matlab) we&#x27;d probably have moved to python or Julia.l to get away from this two tier use model')
