If we don&#x27;t want BS work rules, we don&#x27;t have to have them.  Instead, we could have things like:<p>1. abolition of non-compete agreements<p>2. ownership of code we write when we&#x27;re not at work<p>3. standards for privacy and security enforced by working engineers and not by management<p>Maybe your list is different than mine, but if you can think of anything we might want that goes against the profit motive of corporations, a union (or a guild, or whatever you want to call it) is a proven way to get these things.  The Writer&#x27;s Guild of America guarantees the screenwriters of a movie are credited, for example -- imagine all software had a list of the people who made it!')
