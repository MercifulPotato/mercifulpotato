Just because you reside in a HCOL area doesn&#x27;t mean you actually encounter high costs. If you happen to have family in the area and you live for free, you still get paid a high salary without the expenses. Similarly, if you choose to have 5 roommates you also don&#x27;t encounter the high costs. Why should someone be penalized if they simply choose to live somewhere else geographically? If you work remotely, where you work shouldn&#x27;t affect your compensation, compensation should be based on value added to the company.')
