I worked in a lab where participants were asked to give away their social media data for a chance to win at an ipad.  The collecting of the data and lottery selection was done by a group of women.  One time a man had one it, and they were upset at that fact and were going to re-run the lottery until a woman won it.  I stopped them, but look where we are now.<p>There were half a dozen of them and none of them even considered what they were about to do was wrong.  I wonder how often this happens in other areas.')
