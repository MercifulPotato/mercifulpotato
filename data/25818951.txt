I&#x27;ve always been a big Virgin Galactic skeptic. It seemed like a sort of a stunt from the beginning. &quot;Dangerous joyrides which briefly reach the edge of space&quot; might appeal to some people, but is otherwise a spectacularly useless and ridiculously expensive activity.<p>It mainly seems to be a sort of playground for (originally) Bert Rutan to inadvertently prove that his ideas about planes and low-tech systems don&#x27;t really translate to this sort of application.
