Unfortunately work is adding to the chaos due a decision to pull forward massive company changing plans by 3 years, meaning that we have to prepare to change everything during all of this externally generated chaos.<p>I’d probably have fallen apart if I still worked at an office. WFH has given me the ability to give up when I’m completely fried, or go and do other things to de stress rather than just break down at my desk. In an office I’d feel the pressure to stay at my desk and fake working, which would’ve probably been much too much for me.')
