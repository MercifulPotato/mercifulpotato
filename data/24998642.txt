Either your scoping of your assertion is for a different nation (in which case it isn&#x27;t pertain to this discussion thread of a US-centric news story), the scoping of the &quot;most of the money&quot; term is different than what I use, our scoping of &quot;middle&quot; is different, or there is something else I&#x27;m misunderstanding about your assertion. I don&#x27;t consider the bottom 95% of households as &quot;middle&quot;, and you&#x27;d have to get there to even approach rough parity with the remaining 5%, and by then that 95% is not much of a &quot;middle&quot; any longer, so I&#x27;m not clear what you consider &quot;middle&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States#Statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wealth_inequality_in_the_Unite...</a>')
