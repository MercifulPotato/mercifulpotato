The ML experts were present too, i would not claim something that is not feasible.<p>Been on the other side of the fence a few times as a backend developer so i avoid this.<p>Your comment supports the way i have done things after getting to the point of a requirements meeting, so this gives me some confidence.<p>Getting more referrals for more projects would be the No.1 priority then after we have closed this one :)')
