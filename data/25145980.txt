Or at least, CSS can&#x27;t do anything without the proper references in HTML anyway.<p>And you&#x27;re likely using IDs and classes already to target, so instead of typing the name in HTML and the styles in a stylesheet, why not just condense into typing the style as a class name in the HTML?<p>This carries you pretty far while you can still customize as necessary. I do skip tailwinds when I&#x27;m not working in a component framework since I can type less verbose CSS, or if there&#x27;s a complex situation that needs more control.')
