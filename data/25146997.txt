It isn’t a non profit business. What about all the money they spend on the hardware research and so many many other things. Some initiatives fund others and stock holders are very happy to see a profit.<p>I keep seeing critics, who may also be developers, arguing with developers on why they should be unhappy. The truth is, there are enough happy developers and customers to show that there is a healthy ecosystem. If there wasn’t then it would leave a gaping hole for a competitor.<p>I’m happy to pay for apps and happy to pay my cut for selling apps on the platform.<p>There are benefits to having a closed ecosystem just as there are to an open one. There are trade offs. I’m not sure why anyone complains about the Play store charging similar fees when you can distribute apps on android in other ways. If that is so much better for developers and Apple doesn’t earn their cut then I would expect to see a mass exodus to Android development.<p>I personally prefer developing for iOS and Mac. I don’t mind their fees. I find the customers to be very happy. I appreciate alternative perspectives but the tone of all of these articles complaining about Apple making money off of the ecosystem they created is so off putting to me.')
