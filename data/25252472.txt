The GA representation exists, and is called &#x27;the mother algebra&#x27;, for general 4x4 matrices the GA equivalent is R4,4. (where general linear transformations are versors).<p>For other subgroups GA reps will also exist. (like e.g. if one wants to include projective transformations as versors, that would be the projective group (which preserves the cross ratio of 4 points), and has a GA representation in R3,3).<p>These spaces quickly become so big that efficient numerical implementations (while not impossible with enough symbolic work at compilation time, see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeremyong.com&#x2F;gal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeremyong.com&#x2F;gal&#x2F;</a>) are difficult.  Other advantages of GA do of course remain.')
