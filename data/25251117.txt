Does anyone know if it is still possible to do 100% software rendering on today&#x27;s hardware? I&#x27;m really interested in doing graphics but directly talking to the video card (e.g: draw a point, line, polygon, etc) in BSD or Linux and get something like the original Quake and Quake 2 software renderers did.
