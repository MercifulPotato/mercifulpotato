Email is not encrypted (and many would say it&#x27;s not possible to secure it).<p>It&#x27;s also vulnerable to whatever the recipient uses for mail hosting. If they&#x27;re on Gmail, as many are, then my messages can be mined and read by Google.<p>With Signal, I trust the server owners not to introduce any vulnerability. Maybe there will be one, but that would be a bug and the attacker would not be Signal.<p>With email, I&#x27;m just giving up entirely and feeding my messages straight to Google or Microsoft (most likely) and I may not even realize it.')
