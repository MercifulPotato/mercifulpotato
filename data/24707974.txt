Useful physics (or math), as opposed to what appears to be an arbitrary common convention in whatever field you&#x27;re familiar with, would suggest placing the z-axis in the direction that is co-perpendicular to the defined x and y axes.<p>That a z-axis represents height and not depth is the least physics thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. Frankly, I dont think that&#x27;s a thing at all.')
