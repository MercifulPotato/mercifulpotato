The market is currently flooded with desperate PhDs who have reduced years studying their field into a flurry of buzzwords on a resume that they don&#x27;t understand.<p>The vast majority of AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;DS teams don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. Management and &quot;leadership&quot; in this industry would be laughable if it wasn&#x27;t so horrific. The vision of AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;DS has turned into a nightmare of people shoving data they don&#x27;t understand into models they don&#x27;t understand and making sure someone else is using that so they can justify their work. You could likely cut entire 100+ DS teams at most companies today and only see a positive impact on the business.<p>There are of course really interesting niches that require these skills and skilled practitioners. But if you&#x27;re reading a guide on how to be an &quot;AI Expert&quot;, they you likely aren&#x27;t one of these people. And because of the signal noise problem in this space it&#x27;s hard for even really excellent people to get matched to the hard problems that genuinely need their help.')
