Many of the people who might write software to integrate with some hardware are not the people manufacturing high-volume products based on it!</i><p>Because obscuring the use case and the customer of a cutting edge chip is a semiconductor company&#x27;s most reasonable moat these days. If you telegraph what big customers are buying by freely sharing your most cutting edge product portfolio, someone else will copy it. (Probably someone in China with a hefty dose of subsidy from the gov&#x27;t.) Classic case of &quot;Your margin is my opportunity.&quot;<p>ADI or On Semi can, and <i>will</i>, catch TI after 18-36 months of development effort. The longer TI can keep them off their tail by making it hard to see what customers are buying, the more profit they can make without a reasonable competitor on the market.<p>Software is a commodity that TI distributes as a compliment to the thing that actually makes them money, which is selling chips. For analog circuits, this is completely irrelevant, and doesn&#x27;t affect their operating procedure. For processors and peripherals that require drivers, it&#x27;s a cost of doing business for them - <i>not</i> an enabling feature.')
