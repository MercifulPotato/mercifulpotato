Each new person will be greeted with &quot;Do you mind awfully if we use Signal?&quot; Does this come off as self-important? Sure. But it helps that I don&#x27;t care too much if it does. I had the same attitude quitting FB and Twitter too, I just don&#x27;t need people that much. I don&#x27;t have a 100 friends anyway. I have like 15 that I really want to keep in touch with. Those 15 will understand.')
