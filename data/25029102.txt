Not sure how much more privacy people expect. If you explain to people how much privacy they give up just clicking a random facebook questionnaire - they nod and then still do. Privacy and integrity is important but it will never match e.g. &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;safety&quot; on the list of important issues I think.')
