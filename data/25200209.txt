But for that matter, why not have those licenses be electronic cryptographic tokens, which could be freely transferred between users as gift or sale? (Doesn&#x27;t need to be blockchain, just centrally-administered infrastructure). Here&#x27;s why: the software companies are doing just fine selling revokable, non-transferrable electronic software licenses that users can&#x27;t trade freely.<p>I&#x27;d love to see that change, maybe through legislation. But hardware dongles, while maybe more secure, aren&#x27;t needed to make it happen.')
