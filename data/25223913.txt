If we finished that, we could talk about other stuff, like how to write the world&#x27;s shittiest JSON encoder, adding additional types, testing, and maybe a little optimization.<p>I thought it was a good problem, and we got a good candidate or 2 out of it through interview loops I participated in.<p>There were lots of twists and turns to the problem,  but it wasn&#x27;t some commonly asked question like LRU cache, and it didn&#x27;t demand a lot of code.<p>I assume you wouldn&#x27;t have classified me as a &quot;hazer,&quot; right?')
