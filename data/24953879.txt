Meaning a spiral that starts on the outside, goes to the middle, makes a u-turn, and then goes out to the edge again. (For the u-turn, I assume filament has some minimum turn radius and as long as you stay above that, it&#x27;s workable to straighten it out.)<p>(2) Pause printing, put a clamp over one end of the printed filament, yank the rest off the bed and wind it on a reel.<p>(3) Resume printing, and repeat as many times as necessary.')
