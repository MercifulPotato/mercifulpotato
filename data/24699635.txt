Food irradiation in general is safe and effective, but weirds a lot of the general public out (particularly those with low scientific literacy.  Irradiated food doesn&#x27;t become radioactive!)  There may be something to be said about the hazards of handling a gamma source like Cs-137 safetly and making sure nobody drops it in the city dump or steals a truck carrying it, but X-ray and electron beam irradiation don&#x27;t have these drawbacks.  Many people today eat irradiated food without ever realizing it, though if they did realize it they might balk.')
