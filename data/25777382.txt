In languages like Elm and Ocaml all functions are single arity which means a multi-arity function is just a partially-applied single arity function thus you can treat all functions as being single arity. This also means the pipe operator can be implemented as a higher order function being, as such, first class. Languages without auto-currying have to resort to macros.<p>Clojure also doesn’t have auto currrying, but makes up for it by giving you 6 variants and creating a consistent default library for sequences and associative structures.<p>So, the pipe first operator is just a dirty hack.')
