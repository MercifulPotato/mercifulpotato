But the medium has cut you the receiver off. This is an obvious &amp; horrific &amp; disconmect.<p>Even if I did have contact info for a thousand people &amp; kept a schedule, maintained contact on a 1:1 basis, took the time to inform myself of people&#x27;s lives, isn&#x27;t it a bit rude &amp; disrespectful, an ineffective use of other people&#x27;s time, to make them recount toe personally what&#x27;s going on, what&#x27;s happened to them? Literally call them up &amp; ask them to repeat the events of their social media deed for the past month? Oh and read me peoplecs tries too. Who &quot;loved&quot; that status update? Can you send those pictures? The asks, the wastes of time, to get anything resbling the faintest hint of parity, are practically endless.<p>This is just blindingly blaringly obviously unacceptable in every way. Facebook&#x27;s monopoly on mainstream people-you-know social media has ipso facto come to be humanities warm glow, the fire we gather by. Getting dropped out of the exchanges &amp; chatter of humanity is a cruel &amp; bitter fate, a shocking act.')
