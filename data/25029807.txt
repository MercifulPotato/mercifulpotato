It’s why nearly every major brand with “status” is a western brand. This has changed in some sectors (automobiles, though real “status” is still largely given to German or Italian or high-end British variants — there is some status around Asian car brands, significantly less around almost all American brands — and in some areas of electronics, Japanese brands became the status symbols in the 1980s and beyond, Sony is a prime example here), but by and large, the brands that exhibit “status” in non-western countries (and I’ll expand this to parts of Europe that came of age in the post Soviet era), in my experience, it’s the western brands that gain the most attention.<p>Dubai, as an example, has a tremendous amount of wealth on display. It’s the height of nouveau riche, even though the money itself is very old, and as a westerner, I was floored by the near religious dedication to western culture and brands. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Cara de Lavigne or Kendall Jenner’s face on as many billboards in my life. Seeing a Red Lobster in Dubai with a line even longer than the one in Times Square, largely by non-tourists from what I could tell, in a place where many of the people there have far more money than the average Red Lobster patron in the US, was incredibly fascinating.')
