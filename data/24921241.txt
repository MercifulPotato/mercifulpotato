Say self driving systems could cut that number in half. As we all know, every complex system has bugs so imagine that bugs in the self-driving cars are responsible for 1000 deaths every year. If we don&#x27;t shield manufacturers from big legal bills for those 1000 deaths, we might not get the systems that could save 10,000 lives.')
