The best leaders I&#x27;ve worked for don&#x27;t come into an interaction feeling this pressure, but rather help coordinate the energies of the team to let the the team reach the best answer. Of course, when there isn&#x27;t a consensus, there needs to be a unambiguous &quot;decider&quot;, but hopefully this is relatively rare and ends up being just small enough of a decision to get enough feedback to get the team to an iterative consensus.')
