I mean, each CICD stage can involve building a brand new image and running a couple of them, sometimes more. 100 pulls per 6 hours corresponds to a constant rate of 3 min between pulls, which would require between 15 to 20 minutes for each commit.<p>Anyway, the primary practical implications of this sort of change is a) rate limiting suddenly becomes a requirement, b) we can no longer count on Docker Hub to provide a reliable service, thus we plan accordingly.')
