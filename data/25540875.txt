For example, you&#x27;re somehow assuming that academic papers about to be subjected to peer review are somehow milestones which write in stone the truth instead of what they actually are and always have been: a way to share data, observations, theories, hypothesis, and even assumptions on research topics.<p>This is an ivory tower view on what research papers <i>should be</i>, not what they actually are. I&#x27;ll quote you the paper in question:<p><i>&quot;Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number  R t  to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools,and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures.&quot;</i><p>This is de-facto a lockdown propaganda tool. The doomsday predictions based on naive models have greatly affected public policy, while more moderate assessments have been swept under the rug. The most dramatic piece of research tends to win over the public, even if it&#x27;s junk science.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that this paper <i>is</i> junk science, but if it was, it wouldn&#x27;t matter to the outcome, because the default right now is to be overly cautious and portray dissenting views as reckless.')
