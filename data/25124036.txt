It&#x27;d be weird and silly if your comment here had a disabled &quot;delete&quot; button like my own, or if when I order an Uber I have a disabled &quot;ban&quot; button next to the driver.<p>Out of interest do you know of any good reading on exactly when disable vs hide is better from a UX perspective? An idea that comes to mind is to disable when it&#x27;s something the user can fix (eg. by logging in or asking someone for more permission), but that falls down with HN where you&#x27;d show disabled &quot;delete&quot; buttons on everything to non logged in users because logging in might enable some of them.<p>It feels like there&#x27;s some nuance there and it&#x27;s not just common sense&#x2F;obvious or the creator of this software wouldn&#x27;t end up on the opposite side to you.')
