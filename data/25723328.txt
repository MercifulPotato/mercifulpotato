I spend a good amount of my time being pulled into production issues or debugging a particularly difficult issue with the product. In both of those cases, the &quot;code&quot; changes often take only a few minutes, the problem solving can take hours.<p>I get a lot of satisfaction from that. Of course that means that as a team lead&#x2F;manager, I have to have a lot of self discipline to allow my team members to do the same and not try to solve every problem.')
