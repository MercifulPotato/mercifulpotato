It&#x27;s narrower than any utility bike and about half than you would run on a mountain bike, and describing the difference as radical seems a bit excessive to an outsider. Those tire pressures also probably excludes anything close to a flat tire.<p>It&#x27;s not like anyone thought harder tires were always better. Otherwise they would all be running metal or wooden tires. After all, that was what everyone did before rubber tires were invented, which they were because they were more efficient than bumping around on wood. If someone had guesstimated the optimum at 23mm and 120psi and it was measured at 28mm, was it really that bad?')
