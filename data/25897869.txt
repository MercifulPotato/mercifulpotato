Regardless of what those are it&#x27;s resulted in the lowest female participation rate in the OECD and among the highest child rearing costs. On top of it, <i>being</i> a child in South Korea is no picnic, with absolutely crushing educational requirements that would probably be illegal in the U.S.<p>My prediction is that as the population shrinks, the existing physical educational infrastructure, especially in the larger cities, will help somewhat as the competition for educational resources won&#x27;t be as intense.<p>But there&#x27;s still lots of cultural challenges in terms of the approach to education and in particular college admissions (as well as college acceptance in the workforce).')
