Schuuman (who made 450MM from selling SpringSource to VMWare) is a billionaire. Stop pretending this is about &quot;OSS&quot; and not &#x27;hey, that&#x27;s my mad money Jeff!&#x27;.<p>If Elastic was a company that was fully owned only by &quot;OSS Developers&quot;, then fine, this would be an opportunity to support that sort of enlightended for profit corporation and fellow developers.<p>But the stakeholders here are Billionaires and millionaires. No doubt Elastic took very good care of software developers (lots of perks) but since this is about money (lest we forget) it would be interested to see a breakdown of just who made what from this &quot;OSS&quot; &quot;project&quot;.<p>(And yes, not even a fan of Amazon.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;steven-schuurman&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;profile&#x2F;steven-schuurman&#x2F;</a>')
