Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610053203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677246, text='&gt; The whole point of protesting is to make ppl uncomfortable.<p>This is a thinly-veiled statement in support of protesters engaging in criminal activity to get their way politically. That is the dictionary definition of terrorism (which the capitol incident also qualifies for). I agree it isn&#x27;t explicit in stating that. But Trump&#x27;s statement doesn&#x27;t explicitly call for criminal activity either.<p>His statements are not asking for violence but asking to challenge the results and fight for what you want politically. That&#x27;s what every side does in every political confrontation. You COULD also read it as a thinly-veiled statement pushing for violence. But it is entirely subjective to label one that way but not the other. And therefore, big tech companies should hold BOTH AOC and Trump to the same exact standard, or neither.<p>All that aside, I agree Pence&#x27;s statement is better and wish Trump was more forceful in condemning these acts and left the &quot;explanations&quot; out.')
