No , GDPR forbids it.<p>That&#x27;s the gist of the matter. Private information is not tradeable, therefore it&#x27;s not really property, and certainly not owned by the users since they can&#x27;t sell it for goods they readily want to acquire.<p>The clause you quote only applies if the private info is necessary for the service rendered. GDPR considers advertising optional, despite the fact that it&#x27;s crucial for the survival of websites.')
