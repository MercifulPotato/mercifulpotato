In Stargate SG-1 (spoilers):<p>The Tollan civilization were humans taken from earth millennia ago that developed science faster than us and ended up being one of the most advanced races in the galaxy. They gave a source of limitless energy to more primitive aliens on a nearby planet in their solar system (think Mars versus Earth) and those aliens weaponized it and blew up part of their own planet. It messed up the Tollan&#x27;s own planer&#x27;s orbit, so they had to find a new planet and now don&#x27;t share any technology.')
