What he&#x27;s saying is that if you do math in RGB space, it doesn&#x27;t work out as you expect.<p>So the simplest example of math is taking the average of two colors. If you plot two colors in RGB space and take the midpoint of the line connecting, the resulting color tends not to look anything like &quot;halfway&quot; between the two colors. If you instead did the process in HSL, the result makes more sense.')
