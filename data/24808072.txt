And like every tool out there it has its uses.<p>And like every tool some tools are crap and other tools are good. Not saying C++ is crap but I&#x27;m definitely saying that it is unwise to use this analogy to believe that there are no crap tools out there.<p>There&#x27;s this thing that happens among programming languages where everyone likes to think all programming languages are just apples and oranges and everything is equal.<p>The truth about the world is equality is rare... some things are good and others pure liquid shit. Programming languages are not immune from this property of the universe.<p>Now about C++... What you say about it is true. I completely agree. However, much of the good of C++ comes with a pile of crap that you have to deal with that&#x27;s often not worth it for the majority of projects. In my opinion C++ is only good because there&#x27;s no alternative unless you count Rust or D.')
