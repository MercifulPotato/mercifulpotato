There are many more shows I&#x27;d probably enjoy than I&#x27;ll ever have time to watch. I&#x27;m not going to prop up Netflix or other corporate backers that repeatedly fail to respect their viewers by not wrapping things up reasonably neatly.<p>If there was enough doubt about whether a show was popular enough to be renewed that the production team didn&#x27;t know whether to wrap up neatly in a potential final season, there is probably enough popularity left to justify making a mini-series or &quot;TV movie&quot; to finish things off with some closure for viewers. I&#x27;ve known a few shows do this over the years, and IME it almost always gets a favourable reaction from fans and reflects well on the show and those behind it.')
