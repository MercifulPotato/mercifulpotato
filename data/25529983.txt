It may be true that overall, the landscape of an art form wasn&#x27;t much different than today. However, it is obviously plausible that the &quot;highest highs&quot; would be higher in some period X than some period Y - it would be actually much more surprising if an art form were of uniform quality across many decades.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough cinema culture to comment on cinema specifically, but I believe this is pretty obvious in music. Comparing things like Beethoven&#x27;s 5th and 9th symphonies to any modern music (especially if comparing only the main themes, given today&#x27;s preference for very short form music), it&#x27;s obvious that there is nothing similar, and even modern audiences generally recognize the superiority of the older one.<p>As a more focused comparison, it&#x27;s also obvious and largely uncontroversial that the amount of good rock music being produced has plummeted since at least the 1970s-1980s. There are still a few good bands (Rammstein has been an unexpected highlight for me), but compared to a period when you had Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Black Sabbath, Queen, Deep Purple, Metallica, The Rolling Stones and a good many others, it&#x27;s obvious that something has gone down in the highest highs of music.')
