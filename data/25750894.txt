You are not the first to mention Georgism to me, so I think there is something there and I am reading more and more about it, however I think I may be a bit too old for that and that might be even further ahead of my time.<p>Another person talked to me about some type of new type of currency system, even further ahead of crypto, but again, probably too far ahead of my time. Each generation has their cause.<p>I&#x27;m actually a strong proponent of real property rights. I think a legal assignment of responsibility over atoms is a good engineering solution to the problem of scarcity. My issue is just with &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; laws, which any 10 year old can quickly figure out is a complete oxymoron (You *cannot* have property laws and copyrights&#x2F;patentsâ€”they are completely contradictory).<p>When I talk to some younger folks about bigger new economic ideas, I do recognize that those things could be much more important, but frankly I&#x27;m much better geared at this point to try and tackle the #ImaginaryProperty problem (having worked on this for ~ 2 decades), and hopefully that will make things a bit better for the next generation, and then I&#x27;m hopeful the next generation will work on fixing the biggest inequities that are facing them, as countless generations before me have done.')
