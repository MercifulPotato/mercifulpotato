It exists only in terms of a mathematical model, that describes how Python code behaves in a defined mathematical way (its semantics). The real implementations of Python should have the same behaviour as the abstract machine, but the property of Turing-completeness really only exists for the abstract version - the real versions, being bounded in memory, are limited to certain sizes of programs.')
