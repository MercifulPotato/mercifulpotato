Patrick Collison never answered my emails (not that I expected to). They disabled and re-enabled our Stripe account multiple times thinking it was a forbidden business. With another company we received 2 chargebacks out of 20 transactions and balance ($6K+) has been blocked for 90 days. Not to mention that the chargebacks arrived much later, and the reason it has not been paid out early (weeks earlier) prior to the chargebacks (weekly schedule) was because of an unknown bug or something. Basically the payout date moved to the next day every single day the payout was supposed to happen. or so it seems, who knows! no emails, no nothing. Stripe&#x27;s support that bad.<p>I emailed Stripe and the chat support 10+ times and all I received is 10(!!) days later was a copy paste &quot;sorry can&#x27;t do anything about that&quot; - referring to the fact that by then the chargeback rate was 10% because of 2....so statistically insignificant... chargebacks. which again, happened much later, after the supposed payout date.<p>Oh. And to add to it, we requested 10+ days ago for a migration of our data to Braintree &#x2F; Paypal and they never got back to us. again. it&#x27;s just a shitshow.<p>Very sketchy and nonsensical business practices, if you ask me.<p>if someone from stripe is wiling to actually fix this shitshow (aka perform the migration and payout our money or at least explain why prior to any chargeback the money hasn&#x27;t been paid out), you can email me at: arturaregnante90 at gmail')
