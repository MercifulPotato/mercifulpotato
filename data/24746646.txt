Helped me understand better what&#x27;s changed. I knew that water ways around the Bay Area had been massively transformed. But I had no mental picture for Tulare Lake and such.<p>One personal frustration that I have is the inevitable knee-jerk &quot;cite needed&quot; skeptical response whenever someone casually mentions one of these impactful historical facts. Ya, I get that we&#x27;re all ignorant of our history. But ffs it&#x27;s exhausting to always be challenged. Whereas actual disinformation is greedily consumed.<p>Increasingly, per Bartolini&#x27;s Law, IRL I just keep my observations to myself. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brandolini%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brandolini%27s_law</a><p>Thanks for the link. Sorry for the whining.')
