I have absolutely no problems with pornography and if my own daughter decided this was the industry she wanted to enter I would help jumpstart her career anyway I could just as I would any career she chose. My wife and I are very free spirits and the previous HN discussions on Pornhub &#x2F; NYT article made me feel like I was taking crazy pills and living in 1850â€™s Victorian England. The pearl clutching was so intense I was very worried the pearls would break from pressure!<p>The vast majority of those that enter the sex business are consenting adults with free agency and control over their own actions. That some people are angry later and feel shame is a result of society disapproving of their decision rather than genuine harm caused to them. We need to change attitudes towards sex work to remove the shame rather than stop entry into a massively popular and universal industry that crosses all cultures.<p>Vice - and by that I mean sex, drugs, and rock and roll - is best consumed in moderation and the human experience is improved because of it. Prohibition and outlawing massively popular industries drives them underground but does not eliminate the demand, overall harming the people who work in the business. The insane shutdown of Backpage, a website whose operators worked closely with law enforcement, just drove the prostitution industry underground and made it even harder for detectives to do their jobs. Furthermore the internet is global and shutting down western sites just moves them offshore where they are just as easily accessible but basically impossible to shut down.<p>In summation I applaud OnlyFans and wish that there was less shame and more support to employees of businesses like pornography that provide massive enjoyment and receive tons of hate for literally zero reason when analyzed rationally.')
