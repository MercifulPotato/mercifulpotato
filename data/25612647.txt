The concept of having an exporter, importer and a dealer between them and the customer is dying out and so I don’t really see other states moving away from doing this.<p>The store rightly says that doing what the UK expects for every country is basically impossible. A more realistic thing that I see happening is that this gets offloaded to the postal services in the same way passenger taxes are dealt with by an airline, who of course do have to deal with 195 slightly different requirements to operate there, as postal services (DHL, UPS etc) already do.
