Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=[25246393], score=None, time=1606664996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227089, text='&gt; Interestingly, the subdirectories are not memory0 to memory127, but memory0 to memory20 and memory32 to memory138. There must be some explanation for the 11-block hole in the numbers, but I don&#x27;t know what it is.<p>The obvious explanation is the PCI window. Looking at the memoryN&#x2F;valid_zones file, I can see on my machine that the ones below memory32 have DMA32, while the ones above have Normal; DMA32 is the zone with memory below 4G, while Normal is the zone with memory above 4G. There&#x27;s a window at the top of the 32-bit physical address space where most PCI devices are mapped; you can see these mappings by looking at &#x2F;proc&#x2F;iomem (as root, since the addresses are masked otherwise).<p>That is, the physical memory which should be at that hole was instead remapped to somewhere else (otherwise it would have been wasted); the directories above memory127 probably correspond to that remapped memory.')
