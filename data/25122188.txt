It actually allows captive.apple.com to <i>bypass</i> the captive portal, so your iPhone, iPad or Mac thinks it has internet access. So you try to navigate to a page or use an app and just hit HTTPS certificate errors! So you have to think of some other site that is only HTTP or get the information card and enter the address it tells you to log in!<p>It’s crazy, because somebody must have had to configure something to explicitly let that through (not understanding the purpose of it?) and it just completely breaks it! I’ve tried to leave feedback (there is a link from the portal page) that they’ve screwed it up but it hadn&#x27;t been fixed the last flight I went on..')
