It actually includes some pretty good video illustrating this at a microscopic level.<p>That said, there are apparently new techniques being researched and discovered that have promise to increase the quality of 3D printed parts.  One way to thing of it is that we have hundreds to thousands of years of experience in material science with forming metals in other manners, and we&#x27;ve just started with additive engineering, so there&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fzBRYsiyxjI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fzBRYsiyxjI</a>')
