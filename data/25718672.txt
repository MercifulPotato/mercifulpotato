For most HN users, reading about the M1 Mac is like peoplewatching from your office window: it&#x27;s a cool upgrade for consumers, but ARM is such a major departure from the rest of the industry that it verges on disinteresting. Hell, reviews of the Surface Pro X told much the story: the device was fast on native software, but it&#x27;s idiosyncrasies were what killed it in the end. Most reviewers gave it a 6 or 7 and then tossed it back on the shelf, where it probably still is today. The M1 had another year in development, and now a slightly larger portion of the desktop market share can use it as a daily driver. The people who amplify those voices are not doing anyone any favors, especially if we&#x27;re trying to keep an objectively interesting news site well-stocked.')
