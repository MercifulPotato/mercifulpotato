Google bans parler.com on Jan. 8th by adding it as an &quot;unsafe URL&quot; to their blacklist.<p>2. Mozilla issues statement: &quot;While we don&#x27;t believe it was prudent to use the Safe Browsing blacklist for this purpose, given recent events, we will not be unblocking parler.com, and do not currently deem it necessary to maintain a separate safe browsing list.&quot;<p>3. Something similar happens a few months from now, and this time there&#x27;s no statement from Mozilla or Microsoft. It has now become accepted that blacklisting less-moderated social media, which can cause real-world harm, is a normal use for the Safe Browsing list.<p>The problem is, if a mainstream browser goes against the flow, it becomes &quot;The Nazi Browser.&quot; Its market share was already less than Chrome&#x27;s, and now it&#x27;s getting all these new users who are outcasts. This is a Hard Problem of moderation in a small market. You can&#x27;t be the one out of three players who moderates less, lest you be overwhelmed by undesirables and less-desirables.')
