Here&#x27;s Ubiquiti&#x27;s selection for example [0], the basic one is $45-50 [1] (and less in quantity). I don&#x27;t recommend Ubiquiti stuff much anymore because the company has gone to shit overall sadly, but for specific dedicated application stuff they&#x27;re still a worthwhile data point. GPON into an SFP is interesting too.<p>&gt;<i>And how do you clone the serial number of the ONU?</i><p>Actually getting support from the ISP for your own CPE would often be the stickier wicket I suspect. My fiber comes from a nice local ISP I&#x27;ve worked with for 20+ years now, I can get right to senior techs and they&#x27;re happy to do whatever, and indeed are happy to use me as a guinea pig for trying out equipment. Getting the right OLT profile and auth info was just a matter of contacting them. Of course for that very reason it&#x27;s less important since they&#x27;re not messing with anyone&#x27;s stuff anyway. Maybe the kind of ISP you&#x27;d most want your own full stack for in most instances is also the kind that&#x27;d make it harder&#x2F;refuse? Though sometimes I&#x27;ve been surprised and with dedication&#x2F;effort one can slip through the cracks or find an SMB angle.<p>----<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.ui.com&#x2F;search?mockup=gpon&amp;q=gpon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.ui.com&#x2F;search?mockup=gpon&amp;q=gpon</a>*<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.balticnetworks.com&#x2F;ubiquiti-ufiber-loco-high-performance-gpon-cpe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.balticnetworks.com&#x2F;ubiquiti-ufiber-loco-high-per...</a>')
