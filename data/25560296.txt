SF&#x27;s black population has fallen by half in recent decades, for example.<p>Honestly, the geographic narrowness of the tech boom has always been weird. At the same time we&#x27;ve been selling the limitless power of the Internet to connect people, we&#x27;ve also been working for companies whose structures didn&#x27;t demonstrate that, and in a financing ecosystem where physical proximity to VCs was a major advantage. So San Francisco got turned into a bedroom community for South Bay companies in areas that refused to build adequate housing for their workers.<p>Thanks to the pandemic, that is evaporating. We&#x27;ll see what happens in 6-12 months, when everybody&#x27;s vaccinated. But the people I&#x27;m talking to are unable to remember why commuting every day was ever a thing, and they&#x27;re very reluctant to go back to it. In which case, we&#x27;ll write SF&#x27;s housing issues off as just another bubble.')
