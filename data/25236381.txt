So the goal of lockdowns is to make R&lt;1 and to keep it that way.<p>As soon as R&gt;1 you need the next lockdown, so when it&#x27;s working and R is going down, it kind of makes sense to wait for R&lt;0.8 and not just R&lt;0.999 before you end the lockdown, or else you&#x27;ll have to restart the next one very soon.')
