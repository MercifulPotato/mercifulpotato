Item(by='emmanueloga_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606513053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230593, text='&gt; zenoh &#x2F;zeno&#x2F; unifies data in motion, data in-use, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub&#x2F;sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.<p>I wonder what goes into the minds of developers when they use grandiose, unbacked descriptions like this. It is just missing the word &quot;modern&quot; :-)<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better to have some numbers to compare to those others &quot;mainstream stacks&quot;? It would help to show not only how &quot;fast&quot; zenoh is but also actually what is it (still not sure ...), by comparing to other established players.')
