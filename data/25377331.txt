Item(by='lwansbrough', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607627990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25374785, text='&gt; Everyone wants zoning laws, you can&#x27;t put up a gas station or an industrial facility right in the middle of xyz residential neighbourhood, nobody wants that.<p>That’s not reality. It doesn’t make economic sense for a an industrial business to set up shop in a supposedly  “residential area” - there will still be commercial clusters because that makes sense economically. And you can still define environmental regulations and build infrastructure where you want industrial commerce to happen. Zoning laws are mostly abused.<p>&gt; So you&#x27;re saying that people are making a choice, but because you&#x27;re not happy with the choice, they should change?<p>The people who are making the choice are the ones who can afford to make the choice. Everyone else is forced out. So what you end up with is a bunch of entitled rich people who forced everyone else out of the market, bleeding the city of its charm and diversity.<p>&gt; Just the opposite when in fact the citizens are adamant that their city not turn into Hong Kong.<p>You don’t reach the density of  Hong Kong without need. For HK that need is to be included in the region of (former) autonomy. Naturally things aren’t going to get that dense. You can double the density of SF and it still won’t look anything near like HK. And once again, the people who are adamantly against densifying the city are not the ones who have to commute an hour by transit to work in it. They are the stakeholders because they forced their way in. What about people who used to work in SF but got forced out by rising rent, but who still work in the city. They don’t deserve a say?<p>&gt; Suburbs are some of the most peaceful, plentiful, conscientious, and safe places in civilization<p>This is so painfully ignorant it’s hard to unpack. Do you understand the toll it takes on small business owners to not be able to buy commercial land where people live? Do you recognize the damage that daily mass commuting into and out of the city has on both the global and local environment? Do you understand that the “peace” is actually just economic segregation? Take a drive outside the gated communities and go on down to the economically segregated “suburbs” of the less fortunate. I believe they call those “ghettos” in the US. Not sure you’ll find much peace or safety there.<p>&gt; That they lack trendy cafes, and hipster fentanyl needle clinics is not a problem for some.<p>Man you are a piece of work.')
