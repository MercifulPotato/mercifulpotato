This problem is far deeper than just &quot;go make your own Facebook&quot;. It has gotten to the point that these giant corporations are able to influence elections in whatever direction they think is &quot;right&quot;, they are able to shut down speech, on what is now a de facto town square, and they are able to deplatform their own competition based on accusations of harbouring &quot;hate speech activists&quot;.<p>Note that the term hate speech is relative, poorly defined and can mean anything, based on the perspective of the individual. What is hate speech to you is not hate speech to another, and vice versa.<p>I urge you to think more deeply on the topic.')
