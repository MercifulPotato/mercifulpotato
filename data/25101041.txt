I think we&#x27;re mostly in agreement ^^<p>I&#x27;ve worked on a variety of things over the decades and it&#x27;s always been the same problems. The tools and the documentation are terrible. Middle end microcontrollers usually have a UART&#x2F;debug output but it may very well not work out of the box. This was a very strong factor for me to move way from embedded development lately.<p>EE projects are always highly specific. Article is about high-end microcontroller (ARM Cortex), that should have a debug output out of the box. However a low-end microcontroller (8 bits) might not support UART at all. I can recall one project working with a DSP that could generate all sort of analog outputs but UART was not on the list (that one had a pretty nice IDE with debugger though).')
