Cars do not explode like you see on TV.  The crash danger to be concerned about is not that the car will burst into flames, but rather that when you wrap your car around a tree the rescue crew will be unable to extract you due to electrocution risk and so you will slowly bleed out while they wait for specialists with the right EV extraction experience to arrive.  This was a major problem when the Prius hit the scene and suddenly there were high voltage cables that needed to be avoided, but if a crash could possibly electrify body panels or other more exposed pieces then things may get dangerous.')
