But after about 5 min in practice realize you have no idea how to actually help most people, let alone cure them. New drugs get advertised to you even more heavily than to your patients, and so you prescribe.<p>Systemic approaches to helping your patients are hard and those doctors that try it often don’t take insurance because most insurance companies won’t pay for their trouble. They want to fall back on the hard numbers of a limited set of narrow interventions.<p>Perhaps if there was more upstream incentive to keep patients healthy things would be different.
