That would imply that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language is designed to accommodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.<p>But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!<p>We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak. It is the language of our thoughts.&quot;<p>SICP:\n&quot;I&#x27;d like to welcome you to this course on computer science. Actually, that&#x27;s a terrible way to start. Computer science is a terrible name for this business. First of all, it&#x27;s not a science. It might be engineering or it might be art, but we&#x27;ll actually see that computer so-called science actually has a lot in common with magic, and we&#x27;ll see that in this course&quot;<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-computer-science&#x2F;6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005&#x2F;video-lectures&#x2F;1a-overview-and-introduction-to-lisp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocw.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;electrical-engineering-and-compu...</a>)')
