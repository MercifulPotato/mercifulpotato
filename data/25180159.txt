Posters like this don&#x27;t have enough detail to matter if you&#x27;re actually interested in the system. The volume of information is cool and fun to look at, but it&#x27;s not really that useful, other than as a 10,000-foot reference. And the number of times you need a 10,000-foot reference is low enough that a big poster isn&#x27;t really that helpful.<p>Giant periodic tables are actually a lot more useful, now that I think about it.')
