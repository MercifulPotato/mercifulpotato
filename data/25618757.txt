I love it. It took maybe a week or two of daily usage (an hour or so - writing code and doing the training exercises that they recommend via their online tool) for me to get back to feeling comfortable using it.<p>I feel like I could type nonstop for hours without my wrists or back getting sore. Having the ability to configure absolutely everything also really boosts productivity. I do a lot of Python development so I&#x27;ve got shortcut keys to run the linting tools, auto-formatting etc. in Pycharm.<p>However I had serious buyer&#x27;s remorse once I started using it; I felt like I had to start typing all over again and it&#x27;s a bit of an investment to get productive again. I guess like trying a new IDE.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;moonlander&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zsa.io&#x2F;moonlander&#x2F;</a>')
