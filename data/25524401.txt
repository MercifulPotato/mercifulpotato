I read through plenty of philosophy and such, and Catholicism was the best synthesis as well as claiming to be historically and empirically demonstrable.  Previously I was protestant and then maybe atheist, and I always felt an underlying sense of emptiness and despair.  Since becoming Catholic this fundamental sense of spinning through the void has disappeared, partly because Catholicism seems to be the only worldview that really takes rigorous truth seriously.  Every other perspective seems to have fundamental questions they are unwilling to entertain.  I don&#x27;t feel I sold out by accepting an answer to my questions.')
