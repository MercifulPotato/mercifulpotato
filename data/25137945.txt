More importantly, who defines it?<p>The author of this article seems confused about the term “cost of living”. It doesn’t mean all of your personal expenses including grandparents and pets, it’s a measure of the cost of a geographical location.<p>“ The cost of living is the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes, and healthcare in a certain place and time period.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;c&#x2F;cost-of-living.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;c&#x2F;cost-of-living.asp</a><p>... and since many places’ cost of living is a lot lower than the Bay Area, it’s clear why companies would like to take advantage of that fact to lower salaries for people who choose to live somewhere cheaper. It’s not clearly an unreasonable idea, but dropping employees existing salaries is questionable, something employees may need to push back on or be prepared to change jobs.
