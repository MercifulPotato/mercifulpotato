Item(by='Schweigi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602570250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762388, text='We used to install a lot of radiant cooling systems already back in the 90ies when I was still working as an HVAC engineer before switching to software development. Mostly for commercial buildings like banks, offices and museums. It might be too expensive in residential homes but also in Switzerland we usually don’t do a lot of active cooling for residential properties.<p>Radiant cooling is definitely the most comfortable way to cool. In addition, it only requires small pipes for air circulation as the air is not used for the actual cooling. Thus less issues with drafts and space requirements.<p>If I would build my own home and money isn’t tight then I would definitely go for a radiant cooling system.<p>Thought you need to find a company with experience installing those systems. Since moving to the US I mostly see split systems. I’m not sure how many contractor here have experience with radiant coling systems.')
