Given that, there really isn&#x27;t any reason he&#x27;d want to solve this problem. I&#x27;ve followed him since the &quot;vampire squid&quot; days and enjoy his writing, but he&#x27;s clearly toned down the gonzo style and largely dropped his coverage on the excesses of Wall Street, which have gotten worse if anything but which I guess don&#x27;t get a lot of traction with most of the public.<p>You have to write what sells. It&#x27;s not like there weren&#x27;t news organizations that followed the old impartial model as best they could, like McClatchy - who went bankrupt continuing to do it.
