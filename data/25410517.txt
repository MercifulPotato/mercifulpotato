When I say I cannot say this, I mean that this construct does not exist in the ordinary dialect that I speak, in the same way that I <i>can</i> say &quot;that doesn&#x27;t need washed&quot; even though speakers of many other dialects have to say &quot;washing&quot; instead. If it is in someone else&#x27;s dialect, they can feel free to say it, but my experience is that it is rare.')
