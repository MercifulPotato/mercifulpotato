Materials change. Stuff wears out. I have old gear and I have gear I&#x27;ve replaced because what I wanted wasn&#x27;t available 10 years ago.<p>As for boot. I have custom boot that I&#x27;ve had for a couple decades (and have had repaired). But they&#x27;re heavy and I don&#x27;t wear them for everything.')
