The best and cheapest way to learn is use an app: Simply Piano(android+ios), Piano Marvel(ios), etc and connect it to an el cheapo midi keyboard.<p>this allows you to spend the next 6 months learning without anyone getting disturbed..while the app gives you realtime feedback about which keys you are pressing.<p>you wont miss the lack of a teacher...especially during the lockdown.<p>dont buy an expensive piano. Dont buy books and methods. Learning this way is like playing a game...and arguably much better than Cyberpunk 2077 ;)')
