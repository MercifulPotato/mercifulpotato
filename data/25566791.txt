Some careful shopping can net you an LTO-5 (1.5TB native capacity) library unit (one that can be upgraded to newer generations) for under $500, with new tapes $10-15 each.<p>That&#x27;s still... pretty terrible. If we compare you costs for a tape drive against a 14TB easystore @ $190[1], the break-even point is around 72TB. I don&#x27;t know about you, but that&#x27;s of data you have to store for it to be worth it. Even at 150TB you&#x27;re only looking at around ~25% (~$500) in savings compared to hard drive, which I don&#x27;t think is much when you factor in how much of a hassle tape drives are to work with.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slickdeals.net&#x2F;f&#x2F;14587381-14tb-wd-easystore-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-190-free-s-h" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slickdeals.net&#x2F;f&#x2F;14587381-14tb-wd-easystore-external...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=solve+y+%3D+500+%2B+%28x%2F1.5%29*10%2C+y+%3D+x%2F14*190" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolframalpha.com&#x2F;input&#x2F;?i=solve+y+%3D+500+%2B+%2...</a>')
