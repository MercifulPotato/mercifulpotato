Personally I&#x27;d define &quot;private messaging&quot; to mean a way of talking with other people (via tech, obvs) such that nobody else knows <i>anything</i> about it - neither content nor metadata&#x2F;network. But there&#x27;s another possible definition, much looser, along the lines of &quot;Having a conversation with somebody else&quot; with no significant restrictions on eavesdropping or metadata collection - something closer to having a &quot;private&quot; conversation in an airport lounge: it&#x27;s not intended to be heard by anyone other than the participants, but who knows who&#x27;s listening in.')
