Clojure has always been a bit of a mystery to me, so this is interesting to read.<p>- REPL ergonomics, where every action I could think of makes sense as a REPL command, leading to very small incremental pieces.<p>This is the only point I would dispute. The GHC interpreter `ghci` is very powerful and offers a lot of the same upsides. Beyond this, the language server offers in-code evaluation with &quot;-- &gt;&gt;&gt; expression&quot; syntax, which is a cool new step towards fast looping UX. Clojure is certainly great at this, but I&#x27;d say Haskell is not far behind.')
