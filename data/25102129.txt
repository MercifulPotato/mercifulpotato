Parler doesn&#x27;t censor content because replies aren&#x27;t linked to &quot;Parleys&quot; by default. All replies must be &quot;approved&quot; by the author. You can troll, but nobody will ever see it except OP. It absolutely solves the abuse problem that Twitter has, but it also limits discussion. The appeal of Twitter is that you get to see what <i>everyone</i> thinks. Parler is for sycophants only.')
