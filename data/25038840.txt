Item(by='nineplay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604950516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25035724, text='I have seen hiring manager on this site say they wouldn&#x27;t hire anyone without opensource experience.  Sometimes they say something wishy-washy about how contributing to open source is such a specialized skill that they don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to train someone new.  At other times they are more willing to blatantly admit that they just want someone who&#x27;s capable of spending all their free time writing code.<p>I tend to wonder about the legality of it all.  Since when did judging candidates on what they do off-the-clock become acceptable?  To make it easier, if I don&#x27;t have time to do open source because I am heavily involved in my religion, does that start to toe the line of acceptable work qualifications.')
