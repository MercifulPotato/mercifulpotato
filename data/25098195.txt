Celeron was a strategic error. Otellini was right in foresight and wrong in hindsight on the iPhone. “Disrupt yourself” is a terrible strategy. That’s the entire point of “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.<p>Intel’s real disruptive strategy was the Pentium Pro architecture that disrupted the mainframe market, proven by ASCII Red in 1995. But you don’t hear about that because the business leaders didn’t even know it existed (same with multi core btw). The problem with this, as with all disruption, was low margins, so IA-64 was an attempt to enter the mainframe market as a peer of the high-margin encumbents, and was itself disrupted by the broadly inferior but cheaper AMD64. Low-margin ARM disruption also should have been expected as normal and unavoidable.<p>The big question is what market Intel can disrupt next. I have criticisms I’ve held back on, but one thing I will say is that Intel’s portolio of disruptive technology is greater than I had expected. Leadership has to be able to put together the pieces. NVidia, for example, probably has less core technology, but their direction is more aligned.')
