Consumers, some time legit, some times BS, and BS litigations hurt the most. You either hire a lawyer to write &quot;Do not try to operate the gas stove with your genitals,&quot; or you simply cannot survive with nonsensical body of law covering product liability.<p>Not saying that genuine screwups on your side can not be equally painful. A recall is usually the end of any non-MNC company in the industry.<p>2. Suppliers, and not in the way you usually expect. IP supplier-trolls at large. The moment somebody sells a single widget of yours in US, US judges believe they can apply American IP laws wherever you are in the world, and entitle trolls to your international revenue. It does not fly much anywhere in the world, but they have unlimited amount of tricks to lure you into US courtrooms.<p>3. Government bodies, again, some times legit, some times not. Tons of codes, and some well known vague, and contradictory regulations especially covering radio certification, and electrical safety.<p>It&#x27;s not like they are hard to follow, but it is the authorities in charge which themselves don&#x27;t know what their rules mean, and don&#x27;t want to tell even if compelled to.<p>However, the biggest regulatory hurdle in US is much more about simply running the company as such. Militant IRS, labour related litigation, securities (just don&#x27;t run a corporation in the US under any circumstance.)<p>4. Your own distributors. In what country a buyers of yours can not only owe you money, be overdue on the payment, and sue you for demanding them back? Yes, you know the answer. From my experience, it is extremely hard to exact payments from debtors in USA, and big co clients routinely exploit it every day.')
