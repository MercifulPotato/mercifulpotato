Before you have any cars crossing any lanes, youâ€™ve got a caravan of cars for one political candidate aggressively flanking and boxing in a bus for the other candidate and trying to intimidate any drivers associated with that campaign.<p>That is so deeply, deeply wrong and horrific. There is utterly no excuse for it.<p>How can you not see that by acting as if there is any semblance of a legitimate discussion to be had about the microscopic details of the white car changing lanes that could in any way mitigate the horrific election interference that the black car and others are perpetrating, you are yourself literally (not hyperbole) tacitly supporting fascist repression of fair electoral processes.<p>Your comments here are disturbing to a literally violent degree.')
