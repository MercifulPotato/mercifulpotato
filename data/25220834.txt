The salaries reported in this forum are higher than normal, because of the large membership from the west coast&#x2F;FAANG.<p>Here in the DC suburbs, I&#x27;d expect a non-FAANG developer without a TS&#x2F;poly to earn $100k-$150k (straight out of college, more like $85k-$100k).  Add a TS&#x2F;poly, working in a SCIF for a 3-letter agency or military, add $20k-$50k to the ends of that range.  Yes, many earn more, either working for a FAANG in the area, or in niche areas, or in some sort of management&#x2F;ownership&#x2F;partnership arrangement (BAH consultants, etc).')
