I&#x27;m not a biology person, so I trust the biology people when they say it&#x27;s safe, but many don&#x27;t.<p>My intuition is that many cancers can start when proteins are mis-copied, and mRNA therapy seems to rely on copying to work very reliably. Does introduced mRNA increase the risk or impacts of mis-copying?<p>Is there an ELI5 intuition for why mRNA therapy is safe and won&#x27;t lead to cells becoming cancerous?')
