If your network requires <i>anything</i> other than installing a single application via the normal, easiest software installation pathway, it has failed and will never be adopted. No matter how l337 it is, if the installation instructions start with &quot;Unzip this file, open port 999 on your router and prepare to edit the text file to start the server...&quot; then it will never and can never work.<p>Better yet if one can just open up a web browser (installing nothing!) and use it.<p>ALL other requirements are secondary.')
