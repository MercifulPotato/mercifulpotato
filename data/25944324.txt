If a project (including the language it&#x27;s written in) is simple* enough, casual users can add features they want for themselves.<p>But for complex projects those barriers will probably always be quite high.<p>* &quot;Simple&quot; is a slippery concept. I find hacking Haskell easier than hacking Python, because the type signatures and other features make it much easier to see what&#x27;s going on with a minimum of investigative work. But difficulty is a big part of Haskell&#x27;s reputation, and ease a big part of Python&#x27;s.')
