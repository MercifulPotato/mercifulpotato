This is crazy. Laws are stupid in that they can&#x27;t be custom tailored for the situation of the accusation at hand. If I come out with a 0-day that allows me to bypass encryption of say Netflix that allows me a pristine copy of a video source that I then later stream on a paid-for streaming platform, then yes, that would be stealing. Therefore, criminal.<p>However, if you&#x27;re some YT streamer, podcaster, etc that happens to receive money from ad share revenue and you have a segment with some copyrighted music in the background, then that is a far far way off from a criminal act. Civil maybe, but come on.<p>Laws need to be written so the punishment fits the crime&#x2F;offense.')
