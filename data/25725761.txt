And all that before we&#x27;re getting into <i>why</i> they did all that: a pack of lies versus many many decades of actual oppression. Stop already and re-calibrate your sense of what is normal and what isn&#x27;t, because if you don&#x27;t you are at risk of becoming part of the problem.<p>This thread is about the youtube channel of one of the instigators of this insane action against your elected officials being banned. The BLM riots - which certainly had bad aspects - are off-topic and any attempt to drag them in here is simply whataboutism.')
