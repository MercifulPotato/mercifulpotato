In fact I think there&#x27;s a resurgence in them beginning to swell due to some restrictive developments happening on big centralized social media.<p>The big friction point for forums is that to contribute or interact in one you had to sign up for a new account for every single one. This is why lots of these communities settled into reddit over time, to eliminate this friction point. Centralized platforms for multiple communities was a solution to this problem, but other problems are emerging from that that outweigh that friction.<p>Now with things like ActivityPub that friction point might be gone for good. All anyone has to do really is fork any one of a number of FOSS forum software, implement and ActivityPub API or other federation protocol, and possibly but not necessarily put in a pull request to merge the new functionality to the upstream code. Now you&#x27;ve potentially got a world of forums that you can interact with without signing up for a new account for every single one.<p>I do believe centralization is dying on the internet. The process has just begun so it is hard to see, but even at this early stage I think it is inevitable. And with this, forums have an important role to play with regard to online discourse.')
