It lets you know &quot;Hey, just so you know, they make it very hard to cancel. Here&#x27;s more info etc.&quot;<p>Sort of like an ad blocker. If enough people install it, whoever is managing its database of dark patterns&#x2F;warnings has the power to really punish companies for this kind of thing. Of course that also means they have great responsibility.')
