But I have been mindlessly browsing on PC. Last week, I started an experiment of switching off internet for 5-6 hours during work days. It&#x27;s been good so far. Somedays I couldn&#x27;t switch off, as my work required internet.<p>I did observe myself trying to reach for social media sites, refreshing pages, etc even with browser closed. I was able to change that and now take breaks more often. But yeah, like you mention, the challenge is to see if I can sustain the habit for longer period. I can already see some change in behavior around switch on&#x2F;off time to catch up as much as possible.')
