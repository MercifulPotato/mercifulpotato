Academia certainly doesn&#x27;t consider them the same; we don&#x27;t allow any random undergraduate to walk up to the podium and kick the lecturing professor off the stage so that they can have 5 minutes to explain how etheric currents are actually what makes lightning work.<p>We aren&#x27;t, practically speaking, seeing a lot of evidence that the public can tell the difference right now. This is a problem.')
