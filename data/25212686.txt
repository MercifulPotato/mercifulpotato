There is a lot more to Jira than just CRUD over a few entities. It&#x27;s trying to be issue tracking and project management rolled into one. For example:<p>- Workflows<p>- Access control over fields<p>- Custom fields<p>- Release management<p>- 3P plugins and integrations<p>- API access<p>I am far from being a fan of Jira but they do have a rather large set of features.
