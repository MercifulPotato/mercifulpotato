Facebook ads did well also, we would pay about 30c&#x2F;click and something like 10% of those turned into sales. Instagram actually didn&#x27;t do well for us - we got a higher sales capture rate but fewer clicks. We just didn&#x27;t give the insta account the attention that it deserved (before I left the business, anyway).')
