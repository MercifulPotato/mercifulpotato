If you&#x27;re hot under the collar, please cool down and wait for your curiosity to come back before commenting (and maybe even reading) further. This is a good test case to see if HN can stick to its intended spirit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Edit: There are now multiple pages of comments in this thread. If you want to see the later pages, click &#x27;More&#x27; at the bottom of the earlier pages.

That&#x27;s actually the immune system working as intended, but another component of the system is that moderators rescue the very most historic stories so HN can have a single big thread about them. We did that 4 years ago, also for Brexit, etc.<p>Since this was the first submission on the topic, it seems fairest to be the one to restore. (It&#x27;s still on our todo list to have some form of karma sharing for situations like this, to make it be less of a race and&#x2F;or lottery.)<p>I changed the URL from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;</a> since that is not the most useful link and the AP seems as close as one can get to a neutral source.')
