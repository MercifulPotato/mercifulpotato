The author thinks capitalism is evil, and as a proponent of capitalism, Paul Graham is also evil.<p>The author&#x27;s hatred is clearly born out of envy for those who are more traditionally successful.  This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean his ideas are wrong, but it increases the likelihood that his views are one-sided. Skepticism is warranted.')
