I guess that they have powerful microwave sat equipment, in there. This is a more reasonable explanation then  mysterious &quot;death ray&quot; that, anyway, should be detectable and traceable with the right equipment, in case someone want to prove its existence. Moreover, what&#x27;s the logic in creating a gratuitous diplomatic incident and possibly cause reprisals against the responsible ? IMHO , this story is the perfect click bait so nobody want to consider more logic and simple explanations.')
