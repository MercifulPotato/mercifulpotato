European unions spend a lot of time running apprenticeship programs and doing things like advocating for more productivity. Like trying to figure out how to make the shop floor more efficient. American unions spend time preventing bad employees from being fired (like the NY teacher&#x27;s rubber rooms and police unions fighting the firing of cops with 5 excessive force violations). Or spend time advocating for  extra unneeded employees or forbidding employees from doing two different job roles. You can watch the longshoreman&#x27;s season from the Wire for illustration. <i>It&#x27;s supposed to be a defense of unions</i>, but accidentally illustrates why they are utterly broken in the US.<p>There is a use for unions that advocate for increased pay and clearer benefits. But as constructed and run in the US they are poison to the company. A whole layer of weird incentives the company (and workers!) have to deal with. A lot of the sinister sounding anti-union education the companies do points this out. And there&#x27;s enough truth that it&#x27;s very effective.<p>Pro union folks are always tweeting that companies spending $1 million to avoid an extra $100,000 a year in labor costs is evidence of a widespread conspiracy by the man to keep the working class down. Really the union is like adding a whole extra layer of horrible bureaucracy that costs way more than that $1 million. From that viewpoint shutting down a store or warehouse that unionizes make perfect sense.')
