Using ML on images for everything is not going to solve your safety problems cause theres no way to gaurantee the system will not crashed when presented with a fake input. Its a darn sight harder to pretend to be farther away on a radar or lidar though. At the very least the autonomous vehicle should be able to gaurantee you don&#x27;t crash into static obstacles.')
