Your liability risk as publisher or as a host of third party content before 230 was in what appeared on your site, not what did not appear.<p>There was little to no liability risk over removing specific material. E.g., if you posted something on my site and I took it down, you had virtually no chance of winning a lawsuit to force me to put it back up or to pay any damages.<p>Section 230 did not change that, and that&#x27;s the way it will be if 230 goes away.<p>What section 230 addressed is the some courts had decided that if I removed some stuff from my site but not other stuff, then I could be liable for that other stuff even if it was posted by my users. So if I removed spam or off topic material, and someone slipped in some libel in another post I could be sued for the libel.<p>Removing 230 would just go back to that, where I have to chose between letting everything (except stuff that is illegal) on, or being responsible for everything.<p>No one is going to run a completely unmoderated site for long, which means they are going to opt for heavy moderation.')
