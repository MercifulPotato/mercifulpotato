But instead we label them as &quot;privilege&quot;</i><p>My parents&#x27; good financial decisions are definitely my privilege. They weren&#x27;t my decisions and yet I benefit. My parents&#x27; luck is definitely my privilege. The luck wasn&#x27;t mine and yet I benefit. The way that society saw me as a child because of who my parents were is definitely my privilege. I didn&#x27;t clothe myself or put food in my own mouth or take myself to school or buy myself books. I didn&#x27;t choose to be visibly the same as those in power around me. And yet in all of those ways again I benefit. And all of the ways that one does or doesn&#x27;t benefit from the entirely un-earned circumstance of being born to their parents, their parents also benefited or didn&#x27;t benefit from being born to their parents, and so on. Hard work is hard work, but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate privilege.')
