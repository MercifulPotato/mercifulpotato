The fact that humans and the occasional cockatoo&#x2F;seal are the only animals capable of entraining to a beat is quite remarkable, given that brains are basically collections of powered oscillators (which naturally synchronize and entrain). This makes me think that there must be some elaborate set of defenses against entrainment - - defenses that only humans (and the occasional cockatoo&#x2F;seal) are able to lower.')
