Most of my bad memories come from that damn CRT screen. We are <i>so</i> much better off not using those anymore. Also, it was just not fast enough for real work, and that damn puck mouse. At home (erm, dorm room), I had the latest, greatest G4 tower! which cost far too much for any 18 year old to need to own, but that thing ripped compared to whatever dull Pentium 233 I had previously had.<p>...except Apple couldn&#x27;t ship with the original clock speed because G4 Macs were their own g&#x2F;d drama.<p>That Macbook G3 - the black one with the removable bays you could put in a battery (or two!) and hot-swap a CD drive in? One of the first ones they touted as being really thin (and probably at least 2x as thick as the current rev?) <i>chef&#x27;s kiss</i>. That was the first computer that I  thought was <i>damn</i> sexy, followed by the Ti Powerbook G4 when that came out.<p>I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on an M1 to feel 1&#x2F;100th of the excitement I did 20 odd years ago, but it&#x27;ll feel much more utilitarian, which I&#x27;m quite fine with. Better things I guess to do now than pine over laptops. The keyboard better be up to snuff. Even with my humongous hands, I can hum along on those 2015 Macbook chiclet keys.')
