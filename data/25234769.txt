Sure, there is plenty of malware around, but it is all either “trojan” (distributing pre-modified binaries), or “worm” (entirely separate binaries).<p>The biggest contributing factor is likely internet - I don’t think I ever passed executables from one computer to another. The modern package management (think debsums), multi-user separation, digital signatures, open source and “cattle servers” helped a lot too.<p>It ia still interesting to read about old techniques, they were very ingenious, but it is approximately as relevent as steam train maintenance.')
