At the time I wasn&#x27;t sure if Rust was mature enough to use it for a critical application, and I needed to get started quickly so Python seemed like the right choice.<p>Now that the application has grown to be quite huge I really struggle to maintain the python code, I miss static typing. Big code changes are a pain to validate and regressions always manage to slip in the cracks. Meanwhile I&#x27;ve used Rust for some smaller, less critical components and it Just Works. C-tier perfs and zero crashes in 4 years.<p>I&#x27;m definitely optimistic for the future of the language at this point. The community is thriving and the language keeps improving, while not breaking backward compatibility and forcing me to update my code to make use of the latest features.')
