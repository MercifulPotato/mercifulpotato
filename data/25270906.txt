Our customers are energy consumers (factories, skyscrapers, warehouses, steel mills...) who will commit to curtailing their demand on a signal from us. We aggregate those &quot;curtailable&quot; buildings into virtual power plants that we sell to utilities and other buyers in wholesale energy markets, splitting the revenue with our customers. Our virtual power plants are cleaner and cheaper than the coal and oil plants they replace.<p>Along the way we have to solve some hard problems:<p><pre><code>    - trade energy in an international patchwork of wholesale power markets\n    - convince a wide variety of factory foreman and building managers to cease their operations when they would really rather not\n    - make hundreds of commercial and industrial buildings behave like a single, reliable generator in every way\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re currently hiring for a wide variety of roles--check our posts for more info. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltus.co&#x2F;join-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voltus.co&#x2F;join-us</a>')
