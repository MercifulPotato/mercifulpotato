Smaller projects won&#x27;t get this kind of attention.<p>What this whole episode should do is make it more common place to use tools like git-bug and mirror repos. Maybe someone will even write a tool to do so easily. But what I see happening is people just wanting the status quo to stay.<p>Until we learn to decentralize our code and write the tools to do so, this will keep happening. Maybe in 10 years we&#x27;ll have learned our lesson, but it seems we&#x27;re just doomed to repeat our mistakes.')
