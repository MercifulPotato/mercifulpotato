But I&#x27;m only guessing 50% of that 80% goes to the military (we can argue if that&#x27;s good or bad. I&#x27;m just guessing that most countries get to use more of their $ per person for other things?)<p>* How much does weather play a role?<p>Being homeless in Los Angeles is probably much more doable than Finland? Does this influence the number of people who are homeless?<p>* Does Oil play a role?<p>I think for Finland no? But Norway and Denmark apparently get lots of their budgets from oil. What happens to their social programs as we switch to renewables? (not sure it&#x27;s relevant to a story about Finland but also not sure if there is some similar way government gets money or not. It does seem relevant to the general stereotype of countries in that area doing well for their citizens. If they&#x27;ve got a free money supply. Of course I&#x27;m totally uninformed about any of this.')
