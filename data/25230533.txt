The full quote is:<p>&gt;&quot;Mr. Armstrong rarely spoke or made decisions in meetings, the current and former employees said, leaving them uncertain about his opinions. In a staff meeting this summer, he said he knew his style made many employees uncomfortable and attributed it to being &quot;on the spectrum,‚Äù according to a recording of the event.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong or &quot;bad&quot; about managers who don&#x27;t speak and make quick decisions at meetings. It&#x27;s just a management style, and it&#x27;s disingenuous IMHO to spin it as some kind of bad behaviour.')
