HN&#x27;s exposure to liability for libel would be rather minimal. People and companies are exposed to legal risk all the time, everywhere they go, and somehow they don&#x27;t curl up into a ball and die of starvation in their basements.<p>Big, diverse sites like Facebook and Twitter need Section 230 because they can&#x27;t effectively use human moderators to sift through the content. They have to rely on machine learning, which has false negative rates magnitudes higher than a human. Yet at the same time, they&#x27;re constantly trying to shape and edit and, basically, narrate the user content, as part of their monetization strategy. That&#x27;s their dilemma.<p>Moreover, the distinction between publisher and distributor will still exist. The alternative to strong moderation is <i>no</i> moderation--you&#x27;re just a distributor, like a Usenet node or the telephone company. But that&#x27;s more difficult to monetize. (Of course, the legal landscape would be more nuanced than that--traditional libel law wouldn&#x27;t demand a simple dichotomy between moderation and no moderation.)<p>Without Section 230 companies would have a more difficult time trading profit potential for legal liability, but it would still be done. Newspapers, write-in columns, bulletin boards, and other forums were around for centuries, all the same exposed to libel law. Even the internet was around for decades prior to Section 230.')
