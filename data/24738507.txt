That one could get really painful later on in bigger projects.<p>The Delphi compiler was really great, but it was meant primarily for GUI business apps and not any other kind of coding. Result: the compiler hardly optimised. Borland didn&#x27;t advertise new Delphi releases by referencing benchmark scores for example, but rather new productivity features.<p>Building fast compiler is not sorcery. Look at Java. JavaC starts out interpreted every time you run it, but it can still compile a large amount of source code very fast. Then at runtime HotSpot C1 can produce machine code from bytecode at a staggering speed. The resulting code even has respectable performance, with the slower (but still fast) C2 compiler only kicking in for where it&#x27;s really needed.')
