These are just text files. I add lines that begin with some keywords like &quot;topic:&quot;, &quot;source:&quot; &quot;subject:&quot;, etc.\nSemi regularly, check these into my git repo and sync then into my nvalt dir.<p>This way I can search by topic, search by date, find files with no topics, group links by domains, run stats over them, extract links for any topic, download those links into a single pdf onto my kindle, group them by year, find where I get my most interesting links, cache and index the content of the links themselves.<p>The act of moving from email to plain text to git keeps things in shape without going out of control. I don&#x27;t care if any of the services or sources are dead, things are backed up in my email + git + devices I use.<p>I also got pretty good at awk, grep, cut and sort working with this.')
