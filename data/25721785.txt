Then I&#x27;d ask you why you don&#x27;t change those things, and I would hope you&#x27;d tell me a story about how you tried to change it but got blocked, or maybe small changes you are making to make things better.<p>This would tell me that you&#x27;re really engaged, up to date on the latest methods, and motivated to make things around you better.')
