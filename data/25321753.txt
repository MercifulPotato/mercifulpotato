I&#x27;ve been plateauing since, and can definitely relate.<p>Regarding strategy to get out of the plateau, I think you really have to play to your strengths. Most high leveled people I&#x27;ve found to be lacking in certain areas, but almost all of them are exceptional in at least one area.<p>Try to think through what strengths you have and see if you can double down on them:<p>Are you really good at writing a lot of code and shipping things? Perhaps your archetype is a coding machine, and you should find ways to write even more code (without comprimising quality).<p>Are you really good at collaborating with all sorts of different personality types? Perhaps your archetype is a cross functional engineering leader that can lead complex cross team initiatives.<p>Find what you&#x27;re good at. Double down on that and promotions will happen naturally.')
