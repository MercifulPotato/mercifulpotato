I believe that it is not a productive use of mental energy (for myself, or others)<p>2. My account is rate-limited on HN, so I have to use the few posts I am allowed per day wisely (and yes, I am aware of the irony in this statement)<p>3. Due to the nature of how the mind seems to work, I believe this runs the risk of allowing minds who are looking for &quot;an escape&quot; from the above an opportunity to resume normal &quot;all is well, nothing to see here&quot; operations<p>Rather, I encourage people who are &quot;reckoning about the problems of the world&quot; to spend less time thinking (and arguing) about relatively trivial object-level matters like this (<i>instances</i> of problems), and spend more time in a more <i>abstract, systems analysis and decomposition</i> mindset (what is <i>the nature of</i> these problems), with an end goal of gaining greater understanding of how the system we&#x27;ve built for ourselves to live in <i>actually</i> works (as opposed to our <i>axiomatic beliefs</i> of how it works)...and just how and why it is that it seems to produce so many outcomes (some of them plausibly existential risks) that are counter to the true, innermost desires of most people who are living within the system.<p>This overall situation seems like a rather large paradox - my wish is that more people could find a way to become curious about it, and approach it with the same engineering mindset (but applied at the abstract level) that we use every day in our respective lines of work.')
