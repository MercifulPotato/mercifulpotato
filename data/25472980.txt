A 48TB Memcached &#x2F; Redis, which is far more useful than a 8TB Memcached &#x2F; Redis box.<p>No... dozens of terabytes of Optane would be just as good and much much cheaper. The person designing the system would have to prove that a few nanoseconds of latency difference makes any material difference to the company&#x27;s profits in order to justify the more expensive machine. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a huge waste of company money, hurting the business.<p>Also keep in mind that Redis is only going to be using a single core of that machine. A total waste of huge amounts of CPU cores just to have a lot of RAM, when there are equally good solutions that cost much less.<p>You surely must see why I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the point: spend more money on hardware and then don&#x27;t spend much engineering time thinking about optimization.<p>It&#x27;s bad business practice to buy the most expensive thing possible instead of engineering a solution that is the right price. If the more expensive solution saves money in the long term, sure... but your example doesn&#x27;t show this.')
