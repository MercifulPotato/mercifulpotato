Our systems are quite different in that mathematics becomes optional after GCSEs (15-16yo) here, but statistics is taught from a far younger age than that, to that, and beyond for those that take A level(s) in mathematics. (As I recall there are six statistics A level modules total, S1-6, I think S1-2 are compulsory for a full A2 (vs. AS) mathematics qualification (which consists of six modules total). In order to do all six statistics modules one would at least take the second A level &#x27;further mathematics&#x27;, and probably (pun intended; unless statistics was a particular passion and the school allowed it) &#x27;further additional&#x27;.<p>NB I quite liked that structure - there are 18 &#x27;modules&#x27; total (arranged in &#x27;core&#x27;, &#x27;further pure&#x27;, &#x27;decision&#x27; (algorithms), &#x27;statistics&#x27;, and &#x27;mechanics&#x27;. Three A levels total available (six modules each) or fewer and an AS (three). Which ones you want to do are almost entirely up to you if the school&#x27;s big&#x2F;lenient enough. IIRC you could even decide for yourself how to allocate the modules&#x27; grades across the number of A levels you were eligible for, e.g. if AC would be more beneficial to you than BB.')
