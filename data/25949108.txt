They&#x27;re just attempts to cool the heatedness of elections.  For example, you can&#x27;t campaign before the official election season begins, and there are limits on how much you can spend, and how much people can donate, there are limits on polling close to the election, it&#x27;s illegal to reveal early results in the eastern parts of the country (where polls close earlier) to the western parts until all polls are closed, and so on.<p>Many Western democracies have laws like this, which would be incompatible with the American First Amendment, but which are basically intended to foster democratic health, and aren&#x27;t particularly authoritarian.')
