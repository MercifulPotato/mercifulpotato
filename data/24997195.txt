For instance, (hydrogen-based) fuel cells <i>also</i> only have around 40-60% efficiencyâ€¦<p>Though, I would assume that iron-powered (steam?) vehicles would not be competitive due to the weight ? (Even despite the extra weight that hydrogen or electric batteries add.) Maybe iron-burning steam boats ? Steam rail ?<p>Nevertheless, fixed processes (far from hydropower), especially those requiring heat energy, seem to be a <i>great</i> niche for iron burning ! And I say niche, but this niche might be even bigger than transportation, which IIRC is only like 25-30% of total energy consumption ?')
