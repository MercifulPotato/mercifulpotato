Maybe if there is some specification to use something PHP specific. But any use case I can think of, Python or node is a better choice. Maybe even Java. And Rust is on the rise now, in case speed is needed. PHP isn&#x27;t dead yet. But it definitely is not growing.<p>Also arguing that choosing a language based on ugliness is a stupid idea is a stupid idea on itself. Quality of life during development is not an insignificant thing. The resulting project will suffer greatly if the chosen language makes me want to tear my hair out.')
