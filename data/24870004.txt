He figured they knew what they were doing and he just had to steer the giant ship gently in a general direction.<p>What other explanation is there for letting Sinofsky run amok with the horseshit that was Windows 8 ?  Or Office refusing to ship  WinRT apps, ever ?<p>Ballmer had Microsoft in his blood and I loved him for that. People like to make fun of his &quot;Developers, Developers, Developers&quot; video, but that man put his soul in his work. \nNadella is bent on competing on low-price Linux VMs with AWS and he will lose that bet in the long run.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I need to go into the abomination that is Windows 10.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m just a bitter Windows Phone user shaking my fist at the clouds (no pun intended).')
