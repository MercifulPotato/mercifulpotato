On point.<p>A lot of this is just bad policies, and bad economics. Concepts like carbon taxation were intended to govern inter-country problems and large corporations. Applied to consumers, they often amount to simple regional and income discrimination. Country people drive more because they need to, and &quot;pay up or consume less,&quot; applied  is both heartless and not very efficient anyway. People drive because they need to, and prices must be exorbitant before these policies can eventually drive out the less fortunate.<p>I don&#x27;t think most europeans are that fussy about &quot;how&quot; compared to americans. Car size issues, hybrids or electrics are all fine.<p>Btw, we should be having more pan-european political discourse. These policies are just bad, <i>and</i> unpopular. The fact that they&#x27;ve been &quot;the gold standard&quot; for so long is 50% lack of a decent feedback loop.')
