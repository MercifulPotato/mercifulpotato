Which isn&#x27;t suitable for all that many workloads. With transaction level pooling it&#x27;s still significant, but latency &#x2F; processing effects become significant. And even tx pooling has a lot of issues - lack of proper prepared statements support being the biggest.<p>The last issue really could be solved, but to my knowledge none of the common poolers do.<p>Imo the medium-long term solution here is so separate out connection from process &#x2F; thread. Neither deals well with many realistic and important workloads (with the overhead being smaller but significant with threads). It&#x27;s a huge project with lots of prerequisites though (aio, threading, non recursive query execution)...<p>Edit: s&#x2F;poolling&#x2F;pooling&#x2F;')
