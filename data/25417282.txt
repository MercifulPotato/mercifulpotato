But, in a broad sense, I&#x27;d argue it becomes an issue when you say, &quot;If you don&#x27;t pay me, I&#x27;m going to facilitate crime with this data (or at least make it easy for others to do so)!&quot; Because it&#x27;s contemptuous of the lawâ€”not to mention it&#x27;s a power dynamic that can really jeopardize a person&#x27;s agency and certainly leads us to a more corrupt society if it&#x27;s not acknowledged formally for being untoward.<p>But I also think a lot of these companies <i>are</i> happy to frame negotiations as extortionate if someone has the audacity to counter their offer, and that&#x27;s bullshit. But it would also be bullshit to try to drive up the price on a <i>real</i> bounty after the fact by threating to let the bountied person run free with a map to your house, so it&#x27;s complicated and I can see the precedent in thought there.')
