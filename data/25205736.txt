That doesn&#x27;t mean that abortion is a automatically immoral.<p>So you can equate terminating a pregnancy with that of murdering adults and children but unfortunately in reality it&#x27;s a grey area. The older the fetus gets, the less grey it gets but there&#x27;s no solid line to make it easy as much as conservatives would like to believe. Especially in cases of rape, or high-risk pregnancies.<p>It&#x27;s a terrible decision to have to make, so I&#x27;m all for reducing the number of abortions. But you can&#x27;t do that by outlawing abortion. And the side that wants to do that, outlaw abortion, also wants to pretend teenagers can &quot;just not have sex&quot; and that there&#x27;s no need to teach them about safe sex, contraceptives, etc.')
