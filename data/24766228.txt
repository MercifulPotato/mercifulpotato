My biggest issue is that most off the shelf open source software that has a docker container often use a complicated docker compose file so if they can be deployed, they might be waiting on each other&#x27;s cold starts (which can be very long and expensive) and&#x2F;or need more databasesish things than I want. So obvious mistakes and unrealistic expectations aside, I have several nodejs and crystal apps on cloud run which is running well and just the concept &quot;lambda for docker containers&quot; is pretty awesome. Cold starts are pretty harsh ATM, hopefully they improve.')
