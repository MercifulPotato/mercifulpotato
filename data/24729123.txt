The praise of his writing is totally deserving.<p>-In my daily life there&#x27;s rarely a topic I come across that I&#x27;m unable to understand. In an otherwise boring day full of mundane work tasks, his column gives me intellectual challenges that I really appreciate.<p>-Matt&#x27;s ability to understand and synthesize topics reflects incredibly highly on his intellect. I don&#x27;t know anyone on Wall Street... is his level of intellect common among investment bankers and such there?<p>-He was valedictorian at Harvard and became a public high school teacher after!?<p>-Apparently MoneyStuff has 150,000 subscribers, the total income+power of which is gigantic (multiple billionaire readers along with presumably many thousands of high 6-7 figure readers). But yet they don&#x27;t seem to do much at all of monetizing it (there&#x27;s an easily bypassed Bloomberg paywall and a tiny ad in the text of the email newsletter).<p>-I would really love a weekly Matt Levine podcast. But sadly I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever get that.')
