Apple doesn&#x27;t support Linux on 86 either. Third parties did the Mac Linux ports for 86, and will do them for the ARM Macs.</i><p>Because ARM SoCs are fundamentally different than 32-bit and 64-bit x86 machines. The prime difference is the lack of an enumerable bus that even some ARM servers have, but are missing in ARM SoCs.<p>I bought an x86 Mac when they were first released and I was able to boot an Ubuntu live CD when I got it. No work was needed to get a mainline kernel running on a x86 Mac, but work was needed to support things like Apple&#x27;s SMC and cameras etc.<p>&gt; <i>The only thing Apple needs to do is to not lock the ARM Macs from booting another OS, which is very easy to do -- Apple doesn&#x27;t need to invest lots of work to run Linux on ARM Macs, just needs not to prevent it.</i><p>This is not true. Given the lack of an enumerable bus, someone will need to either fork the kernel and hardcode addresses for hardware, or someone will need documents to build out the DeviceTree. If hardware doesn&#x27;t conform to existing standards, which nearly every ARM SoC follows their own, someone will need to do further work port the kernel to the machine. All the special deviations from standards that Apple baked into their hardware either needs to be documented accurately, or Apple needs to put the work in to get mainline Linux running on their SoCs.<p>This is a general problem in the ARM SoC and Linux space, and is not unique to Apple&#x27;s SoCs. There are millions of ARM SoCs that are either stuck on old kernel forks because vendors never put the work in to get mainline Linux to support their SoCs, or they will never run Linux at all, ever. I don&#x27;t even think all of the Raspberry Pi models have mainline support yet, and those that do only have it because of the work put in by the RPi Foundation, which has access to some vendor documentation, but I don&#x27;t believe all.<p>To get an idea of the scope of the problem concerning Linux support on ARM SoCs, check out this presentation[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf</a>')
