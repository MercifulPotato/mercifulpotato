Governments do currently have the ability to censor those transactions, yet they are still operating.<p>&gt; Inflation doesn&#x27;t affect people who own assets, including real estate and equities, so long as wages keep pace with inflation. They have.<p>I don&#x27;t know how valid the statement of &quot;they have&quot; is here. At least in the United States, real wages have not [0]. Besides, to my knowledge there is no rule in cryptocurrencies that says inflation does not or can not exist, so I don&#x27;t think this is a counterpoint to the benefits of cryptocurrencies.<p>&gt;  I want my currency to be subject to &quot;government coercion&quot; when the courts say so.<p>This is a personal desire of yours.<p>&gt; I for one do want the government to be able too regulate, control and trace transactions.<p>While this is also a personal desire of yours, I think I will also reference my first point of how governments are not doing a very good job of this today with fiat currencies.<p>Overall I think its obvious there are downsides to the current use and implementations of cryptocurrencies, but I think the value of them not being tied to any central agency is the key ideal and make them worthwhile.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;for-most-us...</a>')
