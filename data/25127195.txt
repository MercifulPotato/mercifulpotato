Item(by='sam0x17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605636308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25127069, text='It&#x27;s more of a battle of public opinion -- if people on the right were consistent about mask wearing, and didn&#x27;t believe that they are immune or the virus is fake or whatever, our ability to contain this would be much greater. Sure, we can&#x27;t force mask wearing at a federal level, but it sure would help if everyone on Fox and Newsmax were working to encourage the use of masks. That would have more weight than any federal or local mandate unfortunately, so it&#x27;s unproductive to raise the point you&#x27;re raising, though I agree.<p>This also comes down to enforcement. Even if a federal mandate were somehow passed, if the people&#x27;s hearts aren&#x27;t in it in red areas, cops won&#x27;t enforce it in those areas and it will be a joke. It really is 100% about public opinion.<p>To your point though, I&#x27;m pretty extreme left, and I don&#x27;t think we are going to have an easy time containing it by any means. It is going to continue to rise months and possibly years into a Biden administration, but I think we&#x27;ll still have a lot less deaths. No one on the left thinks this is magically going away, even with a vaccine. Distribution and production of a vaccine is incredibly difficult logistically, and these things need to be refrigerated. So at best we&#x27;re looking at like a year from now we all get a vaccine imo.')
