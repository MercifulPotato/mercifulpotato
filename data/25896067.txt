Aren&#x27;t poor families more likely to make stews&#x2F;soups that they&#x27;ll store in the fridge for many days and bring to a boil every day so that the whole family can consume?

And bring it to a boil again, increasing the fluoride concentration.<p>Why not distribute this incredible miracle&#x2F;poison in tablet form for free to these poor families you think this is aiming to protect or provide free dental care if you think dental care is of utmost importance?<p>We clearly think kidneys (dialysis) are special because a past president had a relative that suffered from a kidney condition.<p>None of this is being done out of good intentions. Most involved are either misinformed because they are taught science is settled and it is safe and great, or simply uninformed.')
