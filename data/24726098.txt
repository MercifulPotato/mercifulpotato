Upon physical search of the individual, it was found he was, &quot;carrying a machete, a large mortar firework and a section of galvanized pipe with endcaps and fuze assembly”<p>So by the definition already established, either this person was just a criminal who was engaging in this premeditated, violent, criminal behavior for purely antisocial reasons, or he was a domestic terrorist.<p>Maybe you could argue that the definition of domestic terrorism is overly broad, but at that point you’re basically splitting hairs to pick and choose which forms of political violence are acceptable.')
