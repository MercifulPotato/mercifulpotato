Every day of the week, and twice on Sunday. All of this is made possible by Javascript.<p>So you can tell me that Javascript is important, and I won&#x27;t argue that, but it&#x27;s like nuclear power. It can be used for good or evil. And you don&#x27;t want to get any on you. (With apologies to Dilbert.) It seems like Brendan Eich is a nice guy, but if he knew how people would use JS to make the average top-100 site today -- and make page loads take several seconds over a gigabit ethernet connection on one of the world&#x27;s fastest laptops -- would he do it all over again?')
