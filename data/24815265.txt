Item(by='deadbunny', descendants=None, kids=[24815514], score=None, time=1602990881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24815056, text='You&#x27;ve just described me, a happy Linux user &amp; gamer.<p>My 1440p 120hz ultrawide works perfectly with my 1080ti (which will be upgraded to a 3080 once there is some stock). Xorg and libinput both support disabling mouse acceleration so no issues there.<p>Thanks to Proton Glorious Eggroll I&#x27;ve been playing Doom Eternal, RdR2, H:ZD and many other non native titles for a lot more than 5 hours a week. I&#x27;ve also got my seperate VR box running on Linux with my Index which has provided hours of fun in HL: Alyx, Boneworks, and other admittedly more casual games like Beat Saber, Superhot, and Pistol Whip.<p>I do eshew all RGB though, maybe that makes me a filthy casual by some arbitrary standard, maybe you could add that to your gatekeeping list?')
