I apologize but I haven&#x27;t a chance to read through the full documentation.  My question is, a lot of data I pull are relational and hierarchical, how would I pass variables along to related connectors?  And is there a way to wait for a parent connection to finish before the child connector runs?\nI&#x27;ve build many ETL over the years and it&#x27;s not easy to keep up with the changes.  The bottleneck was always the engineering adapting to the changing schema.')
