But, when they try to do the same, it takes days, weeks or months.\nAnd this also applies to an experienced developer; the reason is depth. (How deep to the rabbit hole do we want to go).  \nThere are always hidden complexities, configuration, installations, validations, issues, known obstacles and unknown obstacles; there is time for meetings, negotiations, time for thinking, time for merely trying to come up with the best approach long before we start coding.<p>A good example from my early career was &quot;just one field in the database&quot;, a client says &quot;hey this will take you just 1 minute, why you are arguing with me about this&quot;, but that &quot;one field&quot; is so much intertwined that can affect half of the codebase.
