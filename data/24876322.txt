I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s immediately obvious how to separate the universe into &quot;meaningful&quot; computation and the sort of computation a stationary rock is &quot;performing&quot; as its atoms jiggle around, such that one can distinguish at the level of the laws of physics themselves between a rock and a car engine or other simple mechanical device.<p>It sounds like what you’re asking boils down to “is entropy a real thing, or is it subjective &#x2F; relative to our purposes and measurements.”  And that the Zones essentially work by enforcing an “entropy quota” on things according to where they are in the galaxy- things in the Slow Zones must be very high-entropy (and somehow are forced to become so if they weren’t before) and things in the Transcend can be low-entropy in ways we couldn’t currently imagine.')
