In the same way that quinoa used to be a very cheap staple food but has been gentrified into an expensive health food.<p>There is also a floor for how cheap thrift stores can sell things, because it requires labor to sort through clothing donations and figure out what is actually still in resalable condition, and stores need staff as well.')
