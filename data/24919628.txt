It isn’t about intent, as the parent disregarding this because they want a child could just be selfishness - not considering others before themselves.  Moreover, by still creating what you know will be injured and feel pain, are the parents not inherently violent?<p>Does the fact that the parents don’t, with intent and personally, inflict the pain allow them to abdicate that they are the root cause of the pain even being possible in the first place.')
