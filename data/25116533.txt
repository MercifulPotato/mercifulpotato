Google controls &gt;90% of the search engine market, globally.<p>That means you&#x27;re always doing the cargo cult dance to appease the black box that is Google. Always on the verge of success, but never quite making it. Always suspicious of Google favoring advertisers in the organic results. Whether or not that is true is beside the point. Once you lose trust and once you&#x27;re stuck in the land of abstractions and mirages, the conspiracy theory floodgates open.<p>The cure is brutal transparency. But we&#x27;ll never get that.

People complain about Twitter putting badges on Trump&#x27;s tweets and cry &quot;censorship&quot; but ignore the fact that Facebook won&#x27;t even show your posts to your friends (or vice versa) due to the engagement algorithms. Algorithms which you have zero insight into. Nudges and manipulation, everywhere.')
