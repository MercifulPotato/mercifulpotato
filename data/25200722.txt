It is obvious to me you are not making a reasoned argument, but an emotional one, but think it is reasoned.<p>I spelled out clearly a situation where someone entering my home with a gun <i>increases</i> my chance of injury or death. Your retort is to claim I have a distaste for self-preservation. You didn&#x27;t apparently think about what my claim was or counter with an argument why my logical deduction was wrong, but instead just assumed I don&#x27;t want to avoid death or injury.<p>So let me break it down. I live in a safe neighborhood. I don&#x27;t have a gun. If you, a good guy with a gun, entered my home at my invitation, did my chances of injury or death just go up or down? I&#x27;m not claiming it is a significant chance, just that it a large multiple of an already minuscule probability.')
