I&#x27;m YB blind in one eye, but I can easily tell a yellow thing isn&#x27;t blue, and vice versa. It&#x27;s the colours <i>around</i> blue and <i>around</i> yellow that I can&#x27;t differentiate with that eye. (ie: red and orange are just red, green and blue are cyan, and dark blue or purple might as well be black. Royal purple looks like rich chocolate, so that&#x27;s kinda entertaining.) So the deficient pigments seem to have very different results to colour perception.<p>Fun fact: I sometimes entertain myself by A&#x2F;B testing between both eyes with my hand. It&#x27;s especially interesting at Christmas when bright colours abound. Anyone who&#x27;s ever seen me doing that probably thinks I&#x27;m a bit off, but that&#x27;s okay. It will probably help with social distancing this year.')
