Item(by='sib301', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607565934, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25366096, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t agree that anyone is trying to &quot;steal an election&quot;. President Trump is being a sore loser, but I am certain he is leaving the White House peacefully come January 20th. His attempts to challenge the result in the courts have always been half-hearted. Back in 2000, each of Bush and Gore made sure they had the brightest legal minds of their respective parties on the case. Trump has not signed up the brightest legal minds of the GOP to challenge the result. I don&#x27;t think he was ever really serious about it, he is just putting on a show. He can&#x27;t steal an election, he doesn&#x27;t even know how to pull that one off. But I think a lot of people – his supporters and detractors alike – fall too easily for Trump&#x27;s shtick.<p>This line of reasoning doesn&#x27;t jive with me, for the same reason a person trying, and failing, to commit a crime like murder is still guilty of committing a crime. If I attempt to kill you, and fail, a defense of &quot;I was just putting on a show&quot; isn&#x27;t going to go so well for me in court. In short, his ineptitude doesn&#x27;t make him any less guilty for what he&#x27;s actually attempting.<p>Too many people - his supporters and detractors alike - give him too much credit when it comes to his abilities, and not enough credit when it comes to what he&#x27;s actually capable of trying.<p>I&#x27;ll add that, &quot;Trump has not signed up the brightest legal minds&quot; is an absurd justification for the opinion that this isn&#x27;t a legitimate attempt to steal an election. At what point during Trump&#x27;s presidency has he EVER selected the &quot;brightest minds&quot; for any post. This is Trump being Trump.<p>People pretending like this isn&#x27;t happening, frankly, should be ashamed of themselves. And if it ISN&#x27;T happening, pretending like feigning an attempt to subvert American democracy to steal an election isn&#x27;t a big deal, is also a shameful act in my opinion.')
