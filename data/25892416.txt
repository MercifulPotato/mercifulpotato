I could imagine that that lessens the pressure on any single officer. In the US, if you are overwhelmed, you might be done, while in Germany there is always another officer ready to help.\nIn case of vehicle stops, one officer can interact with the driver comparatively relaxed, which helps to deescalate, while the second officer is covering their colleague.<p>That is not to say that we don&#x27;t have problems with police brutality or cover-ups here, they are just less deadly usually.')
