A healthy organization should be able to adapt to changes in the market. The same is true for a healthy individual. And more importantly as leader(s) of an organization - because you must lead by example. E.g. if you have a healthy way to keep your ego in check or be aware of your flaws you will be able to notice issues in organizational structures; if you&#x27;re willing to change when presented with new information so will the organization; if you micromanage everything you&#x27;ve fixed the speed of adaptation to your own - can be good - can be bad; if you need validation you will surround yourself with people that validate you no matter what; if you twist your reality so that you&#x27;re always on top those lies will seep into the culture.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like Conway&#x27;s law but more like organizations design structures (communication, hierarchies, etc.) which mirror their leaders identity&#x2F;character&#x2F;personality&#x2F;soul...')
