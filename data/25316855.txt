For 1930s Germans going through hyperinflation and WW1 reparations, the Other was the Jews. For 2010s Americans going through the Great Recession and unequal recovery, the Other (who was non-white, non-Christian, and non-patriarchal) was &quot;taking our jobs.&quot;<p>Unfortunately after this pandemic, we should expect another wave of xenophobia resulting from all the economic damage, although it&#x27;s not yet clear if the Other will be different this time.<p>And I should say that while lashing out in this way is absolutely <i>wrong,</i> it also should be quite <i>understandable.</i><p>So the &quot;simplest&quot; fix is making the economy work for everyone, so people feel financially secure and can focus on pursuing their dreams.')
