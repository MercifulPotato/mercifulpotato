Torrents have checksums for every file chunk, so even if some bit corrupted because of RAM, it&#x27;s enough to re-check the files and re-download corrupted pieces if needed.<p>That said, complete re-check of 64 TB at 250 MB&#x2F;s would take at least 71 hour. So ECC RAM definitely won&#x27;t hurt.')
