However, both parties are trying to get elected so they pick a set of options that gives them a significant chance to be elected.<p>Why such unpopular options can make the cut is people donâ€™t care about issues equally.  When a significant minority care a lot about one issue they get patched together with other such groups and you can get elected even if most people disagree with the majority of what you stand for.<p>Over time identity politics eventually confuses things as people constantly supporting one party tend to adopt the stances of that party.  This gets interesting when parties swap position on some issue.')
