If those are weak, gotta fix that first and the market would depict a more equitable society without prejudice. It&#x27;s the same old rich vs poor repainted with complicated terminology and systems, really.<p>Another thing to improve would be transparency and education about what&#x27;s going on in finance like with personal accounts of people working there for instance, making it less of a stranger and showing some of its internal logic and the things it does well or not so much.')
