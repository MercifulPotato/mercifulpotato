Item(by='archi42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611761715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922799, text='I have friends (now M.Sc.s in CS) who did support people writing psychology stuff (PhD &amp; Masters thesis mostly, as well as papers) at my alma mater. The key take away was: Many of the students at that dep were either bad in statistics, or outright abused them to &quot;prove&quot; the desired effect via manipulation of the data or intentionally using the wrong method. Both faculty and students would not listen to experts telling them that their statistical method was weak. The most amusing&#x2F;saddening point was when one of them was fired because he said he couldn&#x27;t solve the Halting Problem for them (&amp; I mean that literally, it was a crucial part of an experiment).<p>Now a family member works as a data scientist, supporting students with statistical analysis (for thesis&#x2F;papers). Same thing there, a lot of students seek her help because they&#x27;re bad with statistics (well, at least they don&#x27;t fabricate data...), some want their thesis written by her (she drops that kind of job) and some expect her to hammer the data until it fits their hypothesis (which seems to be the most annoying&#x2F;exhausting, because she has to convince them their method is wrong and the result pointless).<p>Overall take away: I&#x27;m sorry, but for some fields simply have to classify a PhD as worthless unless I&#x27;ve read the work myself :(')
