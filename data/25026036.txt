(i.e. don&#x27;t trust the bff)<p>GraphQL does not have the same level of complexity as Docker; nor is it as obscure. With the libraries like apollo; especially if you have a &quot;component driven&quot; approach; being able to craft components as truly self-contained modules is quite freeing.<p>Could you do this with REST? Probably. However with GraphQL managing the complexity of it is easier. This type of an argument could also be made for SOAP; since you could probably implement something like this there too. With GraphQL somebody already did that for me though; so I can just use it. I don&#x27;t have to worry about creating multiple endpoints for my use cases; I only need to worry about specific entities and how to fetch them. I no longer need to worry about whether or not I am batching my queries etc because it is managed for me.<p>This allows me to have (to the greatest extent) plug-and-play components that I can just chuck into places.')
