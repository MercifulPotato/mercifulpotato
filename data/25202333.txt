Extremely low cost of living compared to the Bay Area. Not as tech-focused as you might like, but still a healthy amount of tech (especially in Healthcare and Health Insurance, which will likely remain perennial). What it lacks in tech-centrism, it gains in a balanced economy with a strong mix of every collared job. Certainly has its plaid&#x2F;hippy&#x2F;hipster&#x2F;Alanis Morissette sides to it as well. It&#x27;s an extremely foody city, operating as it does as a central hub of sorts for a number of regions of cuisine, and at times has been favorably compared to LA or NYC in terms of high ranking restaurants per capita, yet obviously at a substantial COL discount.<p>Kentucky could use all the help it can get to reverse its brain drain out to the coasts, and now is a great time, with so many more remote work opportunities and the overall reevaluation of COL in a time of a pandemic, to try to fix that. (It&#x27;s the only way to combat nonsense like the terrible mess of what Kentucky keeps sending to the US Senate, by adding more smart people and counteracting the brain drain.)<p>It&#x27;s not going to be on a lot of folks&#x27; radars, but Louisville, KY is a great big city that still feels like a small town in the right ways. But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it, I&#x27;m sure the chamber of commerce would love to pamphlet you to death and has better marketing copy than what I would right extemporaneously.')
