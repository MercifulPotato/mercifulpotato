The system optimizes for more papers and easier funding.<p>Plus, research&#x2F;university ties with industry means the industry (glorified telemarketers) says jump and researchers say &quot;how high&quot;. Bad results that promote a product&#x2F;supplement&#x2F;fad diet can be way more profitable than good research.')
