There are some successful products in this space, I just didn&#x27;t execute on sales.<p>User created API consuming dashboards, I drove lots of traffic to it but it was a really niche product and I just don&#x27;t think there was a path to revenue with such small numbers.<p>Static pagebuilder before Square and the like had that kind of thing dialed. Still proud of the technical achievement, had some users, but it never took off. I couldn&#x27;t afford to market it.<p>A more traditional digital agency I started with some colleagues. It went well, and then it fell apart when one member grossly mismanaged the money and then took some big clients on his way out. I regret not sticking with it, but it was really demoralising that such bad behavior was rewarded and we were left with nothing. Many lessons learned though, I would never allow it to happen again.<p>Many other small projects that just waned or never got built to completion. I do all of this on my own and with my own money outside of any tech bubble, so it is pretty easy to get derailed. I have been at it for more than 10 years.')
