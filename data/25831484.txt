After working my first job for 8 years a friend asked me to come work with him somewhere else. They were desperate for techies and preferred hiring through existing employees so it would be quicker and there would be some level of guarantee about performance.<p>Before joining I thought it was a good time to do some interviews so I would know what my value should be and if maybe there were other (better) options than working with my friend. I had about 4 interviews and 2 immediately did an offer, that felt good. It took some time before I could &quot;interview&quot; at my friends place and meanwhile one of the companies started upping their offer to sway me to them.<p>The way I entered the interview at my friend’s place was totally different than if I wouldn’t have interviewed those other places. I felt empowered and like I had nothing to lose. I asked for (to me) ridiculous amounts of money and benefits and got them without them batting an eye.<p>But now here we are, a few years later, and the feeling is coming back. &quot;What if I lose my job?&quot;, &quot;Will I ever make what I make now?&quot;, &quot;Why am I making so much more money than my way-more-educated friends?&quot;. These doubts are weird but they feel valid. I sometimes think if I lose this job there is no place for me besides a service desk or something.<p>I got another pay raise this week for my “excellent performance”. But I feel I just get this because I can talk to my manager about games we both play and he just likes me. Is this imposter syndrome?')
