Item(by='Pokepokalypse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610497084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754672, text='I&#x27;m not sure who would be to blame; but in my case, my former employer is still digging themselves out.  2 years ago, I was shown their Solarwinds console, and I thought it had neat pretty graphs. They asked me to set it up for an additional production database, and I told them how risky this was.  As usual; I&#x27;m deemed the paranoid one, and they said to do it anyway, and being the good worker I am, and NOT a security specialist, I did it.  I left there 2 months later for a different job, and TBH - this was one of the many reasons I didn&#x27;t want to work there anymore, and I stated as such in my exit interview.<p>Now at the end of the day, the IT director signed-off on our HIPAA certification. I&#x27;m not exactly sure which of the 800+ security controls Solar Winds violates off the top of my head.  But for him to sign a document that says; &quot;we comply with all of these controls&quot; - when it wasn&#x27;t true, makes him LEGALLY culpable.  And believe it or not -  penalties for negligence under HIPAA are fucking hardcore. I doubt they&#x27;ll be charged though.')
