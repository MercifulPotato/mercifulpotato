Item(by='Alupis', descendants=None, kids=[24983816], score=None, time=1604434629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983486, text='To be clear, nobody in the US is dumping plastic into the ocean.<p>The article states clearly it&#x27;s other nations dumping or losing US garbage, that they purchased with intent to do something with, that is the main culprit. That and fishing and shipping equipment that is thrown or lost overboard.<p>I&#x27;m actually unsure what these recycling centers do with the collected bottles. Maybe they sell the material to companies that will recycle it into new objects, or at least dispose of it in designated areas where it will not impact the environment. Either way, it&#x27;s the &quot;designated, government sanctioned&quot; way to recycle these bottles. Tossing them into your recycle bin doesn&#x27;t redeem the CRV for the individual.')
