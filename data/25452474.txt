Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25452489, 25452493], score=None, time=1608179400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452405, text='&gt;There is a plausible explanation for all this: the VCs shed their stock-holdings on the same day SolarWinds&#x27; long-standing CEO resigned.<p>&gt;The software house announced in August that Kevin Thompson would leave the company though it didn’t give a date. Thompson reportedly quit on Monday, December 7 – news that was not made public – and a new CEO was formally announced two days later, on December 9, the day after FireEye went public on December 8 with details of the intrusion into its own systems.<p>Why would a VC wait until the CEO resigns to dump their stock, if they already knew that he was leaving? Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to slowly dump it over several weeks&#x2F;months so you don&#x27;t move the market? The &quot;plausible explanation&quot; sounds like a convenient excuse, imo.')
