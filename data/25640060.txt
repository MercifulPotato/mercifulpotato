The views are amazing for a couple of decades. Then the bluff erodes far enough that the house is condemned.<p>Seattle has a special example called Perkins Lane. It is a beautiful, almost idyllic little street looking out over the water. It is also used in civil engineering classes as an example because it has every possible kind of landslide, and half the lots on it have ceased to exist over the past century. They&#x27;re just water. You still see new houses being built there.')
