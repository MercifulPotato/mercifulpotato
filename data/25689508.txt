By age 3 kids who practice something a lot (say, running around barefoot at the playground) are starting to get pretty fluent at it.<p>The kids have a lot more sensory input, a much more subtle and refined musculoskeletal system with a whole ton of tiny stabilizer muscles, and a pretty impressive neural architecture for learning and refining motions, compared to these robots.<p>(Which again, is not to criticize the robots, which are also amazing! It is hard to beat 600 million years of animal evolution.)')
