Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25262747], score=None, time=1606800049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262093, text='&gt; Offline+subkey PGP is about enabling a root of trust that isn&#x27;t exposed by exploits. Forward secrecy is about deliberately and frequently changing keys so that a point-in-time compromise can&#x27;t be used to rewind all your previous communications. They are not the same thing.<p>Subkeys aren&#x27;t exclusively about having your root be offline, that&#x27;s just one use case. Yes, you can have a long-lived subkey and a super-long-lived root key, but you can also have short-lived subkeys and a regular-length root key; indeed to a computer there&#x27;s very little difference between those timescales.<p>&gt; Regarding deniable messages: the ability for an unrelated Mallory to confirm a message Alice sent to Bob is a vulnerability. It leaks a piece of information to the world that only Alice and Bob needed, and that both needed only for a brief moment in time.<p>That depends entirely on what Alice and Bob were doing and what their expectations were. If Bob received an authenticated message from Alice and expects to be able to prove as much, not being able to do so is every bit as big a vulnerability as any other.')
