With the cap you can break it three times before they start charging you extra. It&#x27;s cool to hate Comcast, but it&#x27;s not an unreasonable system - people who utilize 2TB a month probably should pay more than those who utilize 200GB.<p>I think uncapped is $50&#x2F;month, but I&#x27;ve had a friend mention that they were able to get it for $25&#x2F;month if they leased their modem from Comcast, another $10 a month for a total of $35.')
