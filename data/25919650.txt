Yes. That may be the case and this may not suit everyone, especially those who lived through a pretty magical period with the birth of the world wide Web, or BBS, or open source movement, or the free software movement. Yes, god damn, that has got to make someone nostalgic. However, all that is now is not &#x27;just&#x27; ruining it. The Beatles are what they are because of all the people who&#x27;ve never been to their concerts who wish they had been, amplified by people who were there who thought Paul sucked at guitar at the time. People mostly are indifferent to shifts in the now, and only cling to the now when it becomes the good old days or when someone makes a documentary about it and we feel we belong special for belonging to something that is not anymore.<p>This says much more about us, our desire to belong, to be special, than it says about what reality is or was. We can apply this to forums people thought sucked until they disappear and the memories kick in.')
