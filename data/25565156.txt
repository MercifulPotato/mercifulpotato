It was possible to buy a PC with 2 or 4MB of RAM in the late 1980s, but you couldn&#x27;t do much with it. On Windows&#x2F;DOS, I think applications had to be written specifically with &quot;extended memory&quot; or &quot;expanded memory&quot; in mind. There were 2 incompatible &quot;standards&quot; for how to organize memory beyond 1MB.<p>On the Mac side, in 1989 you could apparently buy a Mac IIci for $6200 with 1MB or 4MB, &quot;expandable to 128MB&quot;.')
