Excellent review.<p>Associative memory is at the core of cognition machinery, I wish there was more attention to it, but it seems like memory modeling gathered quite a bit of dust since the 90s. All the resources went to learning algorithms and ANNs, optimizing for object recognition via brute force learning and various hacks and permutations. Just looking at LSTM make me shudder in horror.<p>The trick with the human brain is that learning is just memory encoding, and that encoding is not an iterative trial and error process as ANN model forces you to believe. Our memory is content addressable.<p>We have made a bit of progress since Mccullough &amp; Pitts, and Rosenblatt work. But the field is mostly stuck there in the 1940s-60s, from neurophysiology and cognitive modelling perspective.<p>I&#x27;ve added most of the content on SDM page [1] over the years, you can find many related developments there. Also see [2] for some ancient and newer memory models, that page needs more work.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sparse_distributed_memory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sparse_distributed_memory</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognitive_architecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cognitive_architecture</a>')
