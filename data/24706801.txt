My partner is starting a 2 year postdoc at Stanford and I can get a J2 visa to go with her, but then need to apply for a work visa which can take several months to process. I currently work remotely for UK-based companies earning around ~$100k including overtime&#x2F;freelancing work yet I&#x27;ll have to quit these roles rather than just take them with me. Because I don&#x27;t have an undergrad degree I&#x27;m unable to get a normal work visa or have my employer relocate me.<p>I wish there was some globally accepted visa like what Barbados has recently rolled out where if you earn over a certain salary remotely you&#x27;re allowed to move there for a finite time period as you&#x27;ll be able to contribute more than if you were unemployed and waiting for a work visa for a few months.<p>If anyone has any advice on how they did something similar I&#x27;d really appreciate it (I&#x27;m from the UK).')
