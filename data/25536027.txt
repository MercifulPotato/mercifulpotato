It&#x27;s best to maintain a strict work&#x2F;private split. All company files, screenshots of company work, and the like go back to the company when I leave. If I want to re-create, from scratch, some of that work (and put enough of a spin on it to not run afoul of any patents or copyrights the company holds), and show it off, that&#x27;s acceptable of course.')
