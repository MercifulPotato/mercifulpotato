No. You don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> read the terms in order to agree to them - it&#x27;s your choice whether you want to read the contract or not, but if you do sign it you are bound by it if the contract or license was otherwise valid.<p>But hey, we&#x27;re entering a golden age of nanny-state collectivism so there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that: if the masses decide common sense doesn&#x27;t apply to their situation, then it doesn&#x27;t. If any business has a problem with that, they can ask the government to print money or issue debt and find a way make them whole. Or just sit back, relax and let the Fed-backed hedge funds buy their stocks. Everyone&#x27;s happy.<p>Now I&#x27;ll call my bank to check if I still have to pay back my house loan.')
