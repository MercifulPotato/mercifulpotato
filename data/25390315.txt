I think it depends on the quality of life ahead. If the earth was a utopia, I&#x27;d be more interested in having a child.<p>A good personal reason to have a child, I think, is having an intense desire to have a child, and an intense desire to nurture and help your child grow into a good human being.<p>I give at least 10% of my income to cost-effective charities (see GiveWell.org for recommendations; see GivingWhatWeCan.org for a community of others doing the same). I think that&#x27;s a better use of my money than taking care of one human being. I get more time for myself (no need to take care of my own children). I help in cost-effective ways to help the next generation live a better life; it&#x27;s a good balance for me. Needless to say, having a child wouldn&#x27;t conflict with giving to charity, but it&#x27;s easier.')
