You need to have some central database of user IDs, or can you just never have a user ID and will you need to add people by full public key. As soon as you try to map big public keys to a phone number, username, or some other short ID, you need some registration system, probably on a FCFS basis. How does that work in this &quot;you can run but not manage your own server&quot; type decentralized system? And who prevents message spam &#x2F; abuse handling?<p>It sounds like these must be centralized systems presented as decentralization, similar to how Keybase marketed themselves as end to end encrypted and nobody noticed that you can&#x27;t actually verify peer&#x27;s keys thus making it TOFU (similar to blindly accepting ssh keys). (And when you asked people about their claims about Keybase, they&#x27;d tell you to RTFM regardless of whether you already said you did that... A marketing department can be very powerful even on HN.)')
