The government has mandated these businesses shut their doors it should also mandate that they get the assistance needed (which I&#x27;m hoping will come next year).<p>Small businesses can&#x27;t afford a lot of the overhead of shuttering their doors and still paying mortgages etc.  The employees there can&#x27;t afford it either.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad&#x2F;good call by leaders.  I&#x27;m just saying if you are mandated to shut your business, you should be able to &quot;turn off&quot; the economic issues associated with that.  Mortgage gets extended, taxes get deferred, etc.<p>This is definitely a weakness of pure capitalism in a regulation environment like today.  We cant shut down a businesses income and expect their expenses to remain the same.')
