I use very dumb generalizations in hopes of keeping them easy to follow. I’ve burned myself and team members with cleverness many times with good intentions. These days I’ve calmed down a little but still find generalizations handy on a regular basis. You’re absolutely right though and I see why they were left out. For a lot of people (including myself at a times) it’s probably best to prevent cleverness.')
