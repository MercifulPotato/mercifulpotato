What are the large open source projects that have the gold standard for this that I can learn about?<p>My initial reaction is that if a company contributes considerably more to a project, shouldn&#x27;t they have considerable more say? For example if they have 20 full time engineers working on it and have contributed 95% of the code, then if I come along and make a few changes should I have equal say and control over the project?')
