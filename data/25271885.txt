Everyone basically expects that Marcan will need to reverse engineer everything on his own, and my gut tells me they&#x27;re right.<p>But, if you actually stop and think about it for a moment... isn&#x27;t this situation <i>completely bizarre?</i> Apple Silicon Macs <i>explicitly</i> support booting alternate OSs, because Apple went out of their way to add a `permissive-security` option to the boot-loader. They know Linux is important—the initial Apple Silicon reveal included a Linux VM demonstration—and now a well-known and talented developer is planning to do a native Linux port, at no cost to Apple, and we all fully expect that Apple won&#x27;t make any documentation available or answer any questions? And, we&#x27;re probably right?<p>The more I consider it, the more crazy it all seems. <i>Why</i> is Apple so private about the internals of their products? It won&#x27;t affect marketing—normal consumers don&#x27;t care—and I can&#x27;t think of a plausible scenario where this type of information could help a competitor.<p>Is Apple using source code stolen from Oracle? Are they scared someone will discover an internal library written in COBOL and make fun of them? Are they worried their documentation could revive Steve Jobs as a vengeful ghost? I just don&#x27;t get it.')
