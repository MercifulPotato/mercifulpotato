Item(by='kbelder', descendants=None, kids=[25872614], score=None, time=1611296927, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866161, text='My house, several of my friends&#x27; houses, my insurance agent&#x27;s office, my vet, all burned down in the same wildfire a few months ago.  Local banks were destroyed along with everything stored in them, and we nearly lost our kids&#x27; school.  Standing at the remains of my house, looking around at the destroyed community, it looks like we were firebombed.  Not modern precision strikes... WWII scale, wrath of god, miles of destruction firebombed.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m just saying that things you think are safe, really aren&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s inconceivable that two houses across town from each other would burn down on the same day, until they do.  Probably not going to happen, but sometimes it does.<p>Thankfully, my wife grabbed the binder with accounts and passwords, along with the kids and pets, when she evacuated, while I was stuck on a backed-up freeway an hour away.<p>I&#x27;ve been very conscientious since then about keeping both a physical and digital copy of everything important.  I would never trust digital alone, but a physical copy just isn&#x27;t reliable enough.')
