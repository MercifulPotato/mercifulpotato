I was somewhat qurious to see how much of it there ended up being.<p>In high-school I did the almost opposite of this - I taped down the play button on my hi-fi CD remote, and wired the battery through the switch for the alarm of an old alarm clock (and cut the wires to the actual alarm). Allowed me to wake up to whichever CD was in the player, rather than an alarm.<p>Most cd players would wake up from power off playing, but mine didn&#x27;t - so I couldn&#x27;t just make do with a timer on the mains. Plus, the analog alarm clock was easier to set for a time, than my timer-plug.')
