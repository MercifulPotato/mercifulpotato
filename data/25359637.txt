For example, we will <i>remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors.</i><p>These same claims are being made in ongoing court cases.  It&#x27;s far out of Google&#x27;s ambit to claim to resolve &quot;the truth&quot; at this juncture.<p>Its also deeply hypocritical to claim that this is &quot;in line with [Google&#x27;s] approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. It took me 2 seconds to find videos claiming that the &quot;GOP hacked&#x2F;stole  the 2004 election.&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=batAXTWBjMo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=batAXTWBjMo</a>')
