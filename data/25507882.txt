Item(by='inickt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608654249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506973, text='Camo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reincubate.com&#x2F;camo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reincubate.com&#x2F;camo&#x2F;</a>) has been absolutely fantastic. I wanted to use my iPhone Xs when on calls and not have to fiddle with with plugging it in every time I needed a video, so I ended up using an old iPhone 6 and it still destroys every webcam. $40&#x2F;year isn&#x27;t the cheapest but it works so much better than EpocCam (which I had been using before).')
