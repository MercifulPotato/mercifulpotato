(So in the two slit experiment with one particle it goes through both slits until its position is pinned down by hitting the screen.)<p>In the entanglement experiment described the particles have angular momentum every which way until the angular momentum of one is pinned down by measurement whereupon the other one is also pinned down to the opposite by conservation of momentum. There is still a sort of spooky action at a distance when that happens or perhaps a splitting of the multiverse &#x27;at a distance&#x27; into many worlds where the spins point different ways.')
