But most non-governmental fund-raising campaigns will <i>also</i> claim they are non-controversial and non-political, so why can&#x27;t <i>they</i> get a uniform-code exception supported by provincial and federal prime minister?<p>&gt;&gt;Did Whole Foods make a political statement when they enacted the poppy ban?<p>I think Whole Foods have a uniform policy that says &quot;wear no insignia other than these things&quot;, and as such it&#x27;s as a-political as things can get these days.<p>In principle, making an exception for this one cause is formally the political statement.<p>As I said, I think it&#x27;s a case of damned if you do damned if you don&#x27;t. I happen to agree with this particular cause and am glad it&#x27;s receiving support, but I don&#x27;t necessarily know what objective differentiator we can write down, agree and use that would fit the poppy campaign but not million others.')
