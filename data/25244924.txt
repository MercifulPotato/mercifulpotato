I said it was about minimum wages.  ie. What is the lowest you can pay a specific worker.  For example, the actor&#x27;s labor union has set the minimum pay at $750 a day.  That&#x27;s far more than the legal minimum wage, but it is the lowest a movie studio is allowed to pay an actor.<p>Therefore they have now negotiated the minimum wage for an actor.  It&#x27;s still higher than the legal minimum wage, but it&#x27;s still a minimum wage.  The studio would pay less if they could.<p>That&#x27;s what unions are all about.  Setting the minimum compensation for a particular worker.')
