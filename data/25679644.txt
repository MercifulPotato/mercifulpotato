I&#x27;d divide my &quot;everything else&quot; budget by 30 and tell monzo to move everyday that amount into the credit card account.<p>So basically... A daily budget. It was something like 20-30 pounds per day. \nI wanted something more expensive than usual? I&#x27;d &quot;save&quot; for a few days.<p>It&#x27;s not the most efficient budgeting, but it was so much fun.')
