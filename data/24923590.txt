You can search comments here or elsewhere, you really won&#x27;t find anyone calling anyone else paranoid for suggesting the government is watching everyone, intercepting communications, listening in on conversations, whatever.  Find me a single example of anyone doing so in the past 2 years without an immediate reply from someone else (i.e. somene other than the OP) saying &quot;No. Sorry.  Since snowden you don&#x27;t get to call anyone paranoid for thinking the government is listening.&quot;<p>In fact, quite the opposite I bet if you asked anyone with an Amazon Echo, &quot;Do you think the government can listen to private conversations using an Amazon Echo&quot; my guess is most people would say, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. If they really needed to, I guess?&quot;<p>Nobody would say, &quot;Of course not.  Don&#x27;t be paranoid.&quot;')
