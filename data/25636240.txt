It takes the OBS stream, via the FTL protocol, &amp; converts it into something for WebRTC to use, yes? What drove you to use FTL protocol for ingestion? Did you consider alternatives like RTMP, which I believe OBS also supports?<p>I hand&#x27;t heard of FTL before. Apparently it was a protocol used in Microsoft&#x27;s now-defunct game-streaming service, Mixer. I found some discussion of the various streaming protocols here[1], which included some description of FTL.<p>I guess it comes down to latency. That would still have left SRT on the table, yes?<p>Great project. Such a key area of connectivity for us all. So glad you did this. Thanks.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;restream.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;streaming-protocols&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;restream.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;streaming-protocols&#x2F;</a>')
