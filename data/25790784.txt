The headlines themselves had value. People would scan over a newspaper&#x27;s headlines, flipping the pages, being exposed to the ads. Now people just scroll through Google News reading the headlines and the first sentence or two, which is enough in most cases to get the idea that there was a murder or something. \nSo the newspapers don&#x27;t get visitors just browsing through headlines anymore on their front page. That&#x27;s the problem I believe that is real and partly killing the publishers.')
