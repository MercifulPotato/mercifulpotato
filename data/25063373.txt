None of these can satisfy the energy needs.<p>Of course they can, and already do in some countries.<p>&gt; We have data[1].<p>Or at least a TED talk. Checking it out...<p>1:26 &quot;From 36% to 31%&quot;: Well, it certainly dropped, but it doesn&#x27;t look from a quick scan as if that trend is continuing after 2010. Looks like it goes up after 2013. And, indeed if I check the source he used, the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, it has figures now up to 2019, which show we&#x27;re at 37% so the trend has reversed in the right direction. Also, that talk was given in 2016, so why are the figures only up to 2013? I was able to get last year...<p>Moving on...no, wait, that graph looked a bit weird. That &quot;arrow&quot; was meant to look like a trend line, but it&#x27;s actually just hovering above two points. What&#x27;re the rest of the data for, decoration? That&#x27;s just two cherry picked points! That isn&#x27;t statistics, it&#x27;s join-the-dots.<p>We&#x27;re less than 2 minutes in and it&#x27;s not looking good for the &quot;we have data&quot; video.<p>2:07: &quot;There&#x27;s just a lot of poor countries that are still using wood and dung and charcoal as their main source of energy&quot;: ironically, these are carbon neutral, but at any rate, these are not the countries that have the highest CO2 emissions, so why are we trying to suggest it&#x27;s their fault?<p>2:44: &quot;Barely makes up half&quot;: not true anymore; renewables have overtaken nuclear and as mentioned, have reduced the usage of fossil fuels already.<p>2:50: &quot;Let&#x27;s take a closer look in the United States.&quot; - This seems a bit like talking about how to get to the Superbowl and suggesting we take a closer look at the Cleveland Browns. Would it not be a good idea to look at countries who&#x27;re actually <i>good</i> at renewables?<p>3:15: &quot;People think of California as a clean energy and climate leader&quot;: Heh, no, I think of countries and states with &gt;80% electricity from renewables as leaders. California doesn&#x27;t qualify.<p>3:21: &quot;What about Germany?&quot;: Ah, lets move on from Cleveland and talk about the Detroit Lions...Why is it that the nuclear fanboys always want to talk about Germany, rather than the <i>other countries in Europe who have far more renewable energy</i>.<p>3:21: &quot;and there&#x27;s really not anybody who&#x27;s going to tell you that they&#x27;re going to meet their climate commitments in 2020.&quot;:<p>Narrator: &quot;They met their targets.&quot;<p>3:36: &quot;Solar and wind provide power about 10 to 20 percent of the time&quot;: Genuinely baffled by this one. This guy thinks there&#x27;s only daylight 20% of the time? He thinks that wind turbines are built in areas that only have wind 20% of the time? Is he a complete idiot?<p>I think I&#x27;ll stop here. I&#x27;ve just one more point to add: this guy says he&#x27;s been travelling and researching this himself, yet his actual graphs came from the BP report I mentioned earlier. Why did the data come from an oil company if they compiled it themselves? I get the feeling that the real push for nuclear is simply a stalling tactic being pushed by fossil fuel interests, because they know that if countries simply rolled out wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal etc <i>today</i>, they couldn&#x27;t possibly compete and they&#x27;d be finished.<p>What do you reckon?')
