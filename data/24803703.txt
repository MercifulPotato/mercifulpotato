Patients that had died.<p>So it was essentially a P-hack to sell us a worthless but expensive product. So I stopped believing that Big Pharma would save us, and that their science-journals were giving honest reports.<p>In the mean time I see reports of different very cheap medicines that give a 10x reduction in death-rates. From 500 to 50 and such. That is extremely hard to hack because these death numbers would show up elsewhere. From the reports it appears that the virus is very vulnerable to some cheap anti-viral medicine.<p>But there is no money in that, so it will not be promoted that heavily.<p>Here are some videos where the science papers are explained by an expert.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=98RQ3QK-yCc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=98RQ3QK-yCc</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;bbGG79WGmu4?t=800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;bbGG79WGmu4?t=800</a>')
