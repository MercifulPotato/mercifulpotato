Item(by='Animats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605468879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100152, text='There&#x27;s a setup often seen on older UK and European city building - full height doors above the ground floor with a hook or pulley at roof level, so heavy objects can be lifted to upper floors with a rope or chain fall. Haylofts for barns worked that way, and the concept was copied into urban design. These are sometimes retrofitted with a railing, so people don&#x27;t fall out.<p>Faux balconies are an imitation of this. Sometimes, on gentrified industrial brick buildings, builders actually add the hook at the cornice line. It may not be rated for actual lifting. I&#x27;ve seen this in Southwark, in London.<p>It&#x27;s one of those things where the original purpose has been forgotten, but imitation continues.')
