The issue the therapist wants to deal with is your relationship with the in-laws, not whether she agrees on a moral basis with the in-laws.<p>Therapists need to have a very hard line between personal and professional for their own reasons as well. It is not a business where you want to be mixing different parts of your life.<p>For these reasons it is a reasonable effort to try and remove as much of yourself as possible from the counselling relationship.<p>It&#x27;s not that the therapist doesn&#x27;t exist in context, its that who the therapist is shouldn&#x27;t influence the way you present to the therapist.')
