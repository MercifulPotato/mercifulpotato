Once you&#x27;re up in orbit, high ISP is king to get you anywhere. Other comments already highlighted that NTRs are a middle ground between superefficient, ultra-high ISP electric drives, and very high TWR chemical rockets. So that&#x27;s where this sits: high enough TWR to be practical, but way better ISP than chemical (though still far from electrical).')
