Think about how many throwaway articles get shared here (many of them, like this, hosted on wired, medium, substack, etc), articles that posit a problem or an ill-defined solution, intending less to lift hearts and change minds than to encourage ad-revenue generating clicks, wasting the time of people who are looking for inspiration or something bigger than themselves they could be a part of. We need a place to relegate the blatantly pollutional content to, a way to dispose of internet trash.<p>Imagine it: you come across an article arguing in favor of the flat earth hypothesis. As a responsible internet citizen, you place it in the trash so it doesn&#x27;t bother any other internet citizens.')
