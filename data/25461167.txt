You can think they are in their own right to taker her up on it, but its not a threat.<p>Also, as far as I know for a &quot;einseitige Freistellung&quot; (one sided decision to no longer want her to work there) Google would have to show that she destroyed the relationship of trust with Google, by e.g. criminal acts or <i>maybe</i> using her position as a manager to undermine the companies overall direction, e.g. by her going to the public mailing list afterwards.<p>Announcing that she wants to leave if this can&#x27;t be resolved would NOT  qualify as this.')
