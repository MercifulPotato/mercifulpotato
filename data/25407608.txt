They may understand that what they are being asked to do has longer term negative consequences, but they don&#x27;t want to invest the effort in trying to change any minds. They just do what they are asked, and when things get complicated they can say &quot;I did what you asked for; you didn&#x27;t ask me to simplify anything&quot;<p>This is seen more in rigidly hierarchical organizations where debate and ideas from the lower ranks tend to be quashed. Think of the boss who says some variant of &quot;you&#x27;re paid to do what I ask, not to talk about it&quot;')
