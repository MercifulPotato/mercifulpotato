And if those are popular contentious issues, then it may be for good reason, given so much effort taken to convince everybody that one opinion is dominant.<p>And of course there are different types: the theorist, and the skeptic. Skeptics generally have an extremely good hit rate on the truth. There are many beliefs held by the vast majority of educated people, that require fantastic improbabilities and incongruences with normal experience, whereas the extremely uncommon disbelief requires only storytellers.

You wouldnâ€™t think them tiresome at all if the story was catering to your emotional needs. Or perhaps not, because you may be a tiresome skeptic yourself.')
