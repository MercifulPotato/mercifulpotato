I love Spotify&#x27;s recommendations for the most part, but sometimes I want to dive out of my music bubble and explore new genres or new anything really. Basically what I&#x27;m looking for is a tool that can give me recommendations of the music that is the opposite of what I usually listen to, or something like that. Anyone know of any?')
