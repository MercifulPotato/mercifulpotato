I ordered bright LED bulbs (I forget the purported lumens figure), but they where clearly nowhere near as bright as advertised. I gave a balanced 3-star review and was contacted the seller saying they&#x27;d refund me and let me keep the bulbs if I removed my review. I obviously declined, as I had no use for the bulbs in any case!')
