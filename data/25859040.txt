They may have more or less bare-bones agreement with the airport, for example. Nice airlines have more planes in reserve, in case one breaks. Budget airlines often arrange their schedules so that they are more efficient, but also more fragile; for example, instead of flying A-&gt;B-&gt;A-&gt;B during the day (and possibly wasting time waiting for the right time to fly), the plane might fly A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;A, squeezing more flying hours into the day, but also making potential knock-on effects of a delay worse. And so on.<p>I don&#x27;t know about antifreeze etc. specifically, but I suspect it is similar.')
