My account has had this issue for ~6 years now (I&#x27;ve used steam for 15 years). It happens on any browser or device. No cookie clearing, doesn&#x27;t happen to any other account, etc. Every time I bring it up, the majority of people say they don&#x27;t have an issue, while a small handful of others chime in about experiencing it too.<p>It has to be a bug, or maybe a security feature for accounts of a certain size?')
