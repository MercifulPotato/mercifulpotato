First, no opening &quot;(&quot;. What kind of Lisp hacker does this? Second, both in C and in C++ functions can (of course) take variable-sized arrays. (And, there is no such language as &quot;C&#x2F;C++&quot;).<p>In c, an <i>array</i> has fixed size and dimensionality.  You can, of course, create your own data structure using a pointer which allows you to access an unbounded number of objects; but that, in c parlance, is not an array.<p>And in c89, all variables must be declared at the beginning of a lexical scope (though not necessarily the beginning of a function).')
