Not Facebook. This simple comic.<p>If we removed this comic and kept Facebook and Twitter, our problems w&#x2F; understanding Free Speech are largely solved? Hardly. Not to mention social media has become the beast we as a group don&#x27;t know how to handle yet it ravages our landscape.<p>&gt; It’s wrong because it contains a profound misunderstanding— that America’s founding documents are nothing more than legal tools.<p>Also vehemently disagree - it is exactly because it is a set of &quot;legal tools&quot; that it boils up into society. Through the interpretation of the Supreme Court and other judges.<p>The author is basically stating this is a belief system and that belief system is so much more than a legal document. But lest we forget, legal documents - especially the <i>legal</i> founding of our country - is rooted in beliefs.<p>I&#x27;ll admit, Hamilton the musical helped me connect to the founding fathers like I never had as a highschool student studying the material. That the beliefs of a bunch of 20-40 year olds (who are insanely smarter than me), wrote essays based on beliefs and philosophy, to form our country - legally.<p>By legally, I mean an agreement which we start from and enforce. The enforcement is key and XKCD rightly touches on where that line is drawn.<p>There is a reason why, legally, the Bill of Rights for Freedom of Speech does not reach further into society. You run the danger of telling people how to live which is extremely against the founding ideals.<p>Please, go live in a country where the legal precedence of free speech does not allow you to speak against its leaders.')
