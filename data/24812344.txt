The fact something can happen due to your actions can&#x27;t be used as an ethical argument to limit your freedom of action.<p>From the perspective of individual freedoms the ban of guns is unacceptable under the pretense they might end up harming others by chance; if that&#x27;s the case, the police and the military themselves shouldn&#x27;t have guns. Besides, populations that live under strict gun control surprisingly have more people being harmed by guns than populations that don&#x27;t have strict gun controls (case in point: criminals don&#x27;t care about laws, by definition).<p>Also under the perspective of individual freedoms, the enforcement of masks is not justifiable. If you feel unsafe due to a potential virus outbreak, take your precautions but don&#x27;t force others to do whatever they want to do. Otherwise, we&#x27;d fall into authoritarianism.')
