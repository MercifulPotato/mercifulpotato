URL-based imports are a security risk, availability nightmare, and fragile system built with the assumption that things are never renamed, taken down or significantly changed, or that the developer always has an internet connection.<p>Depends cannot be resolved offline, and time becomes a factor for the correctness of code (i.e. you fetch a dependency, code against it, dependency changes public API, coworker fetches your code, fetches the dependency, build is now inexplicably broken).<p>Not to mention DNS hijacking, BGP, caching, locality, etc. can all affect how dependencies are fetched. Further, not using a registry makes in-house mirrors a nightmare due to having to re-route DNS requests all the time.<p>It&#x27;s an all around _terrible_ feature in my opinion and I am very careful to distance myself from any project claiming otherwise.')
