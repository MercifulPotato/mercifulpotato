Item(by='drdec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604002877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931713, text='&gt; The real situation is this: you have $200 of illegal money. Now you have the choice between using that $200 to buy a widget that&#x27;s worth $100, or a widget that&#x27;s worth $200.<p>&gt; Obviously you&#x27;ll buy the widget that&#x27;s worth $200.<p>Sure, but what if we are talking about $200M instead?  Now you want to go for the most expensive assets because you want to reduce the number of transactions (each transaction has a time overhead that is probably more significant than the dollar cost overhead).  You know you aren&#x27;t getting it done in one transaction because that $200M widget isn&#x27;t out there.<p>Now assume you know that there are plenty of other money launderers operating in the same market.  And you know logic behind the article.  Now you aren&#x27;t so worried about overvaluing an asset by 5 or 10%.<p>Just a thought experiment, I don&#x27;t have any evidence or even anecdata to back it up.')
