You meet your household, if you have to work non-remotely, then you meet some coworkers (preferably a limited amount and always the same, separating a company in teams&#x2F;&quot;bubbles&quot;) and ideally that&#x27;s it - it makes all sense that places where you&#x27;d be eating together with random strangers should be restricted much more than work lunches where outsiders are excluded.')
