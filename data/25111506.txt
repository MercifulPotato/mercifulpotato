No when I press buttons and not when it finishes cooking. I feel like every microwave I have has the most shrill, grating, ear splitting beep ever and it doesn&#x27;t stop for 10+ minutes when something finishes cooking. I flinch every single time and often I can&#x27;t immediately get up to turn it off because I&#x27;m in a meeting or something<p>Edit: I just found the setting on my microwave to mute it and I could cry')
