Most, in my anecdotal experience.<p>- I&#x27;ve seen numerous condos in north america and Europe that do not have effectively openable windows, certainly not in quantity to properly vent the entire unit. So you couldn&#x27;t if you wanted to.<p>- Some cultures have very differing perspectives; where I&#x27;m from, interior &quot;Cross-winds&quot; are deemed to be deadly. You will NOT open two windows at the same time anywhere in the house, ever, period. If any window happens to be open and a kid opens the front door, they&#x27;ll be yelled at to close it ASAP lest... I dunno, something about their lower back?<p>- But most people I&#x27;ve spoken to &#x2F; lived with, across countries and continents just don&#x27;t bother &#x2F; it doesn&#x27;t occur to them.
