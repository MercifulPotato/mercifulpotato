I checked Wikipedia and MathWorld and nobody makes a distinction between e^x and exp(x).<p>Even if it&#x27;s a &quot;white lie&quot; for didactic reasons, I don&#x27;t buy it, it will be much more confusing down the line for students.<p>Math is about finding structures governed by some rules and then generalizing them. To me the e^x defined as repeated multiplication conceptually <i>is</i> the same thing as the exponential function, just over broader domain. Why? You can interpolate between integer-valued X&#x27;s using geometric mean. e^3 = sqrt(e^2 * e^4). What stops you from interpolating this recursively to achieve in the limit the exponential function over real numbers?')
