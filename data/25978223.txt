With the caveat that I can render fewer buttons on my screen.<p>On macOS I just need to pick a lower resolution, and then after al UI elements are rendered, scale it up to 1920x1080. This results in a scaled up and thus not pixel perfect and thus blurry picture.<p>So Windows renders bigger UI elements at native resolution. macOS always renders a button 100px wide, you can just pick a lower resolution on a high res screen so those 100px seem bigger.<p>See also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resolution_independence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resolution_independence</a>')
