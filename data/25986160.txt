Apple apparently thinks it&#x27;s eccentric for users to clone their internal storage. I think they have the numbers to support it as well. Making Time Machine backups is very convenient.<p>What I&#x27;ve done personally, is started making backups to an SSD. In the event of a problem, I buy a new Mac and restore it to that, in a very fast manner. This means that, including shopping, roughly half a day of work will be lost. This is acceptable to me.<p>If you really can&#x27;t wait, then don&#x27;t sell your old Mac and keep it around for as long as it&#x27;s supported.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d rather Apple didn&#x27;t drop this function. But I do understand that cloning is a feature that&#x27;s not used much, and that temporarily falls by the wayside in the development process.')
