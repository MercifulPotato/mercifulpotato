And we&#x27;re talking about endpoints, not the carriers represented by ISPs and phone companies.<p>It&#x27;s funny to me when conservatives talk about the sanctity of private property, and then want to force the owners and publishers of certain sites to have zero control over their own property. You can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>Also funny to me that conservatives censor like mad in their own properties. Parler, &#x2F;r&#x2F;conservative, RedState, and too many others to count, would delete posts from people like me on sight. Do you consider that censorship too, or is that acceptable?')
