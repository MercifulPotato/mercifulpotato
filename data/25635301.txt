These are just groups of people Facebook is actively trying to keep off their site. His point is that his companies aren&#x27;t part of those groups. Based on quick (not even remotely thorough) look at shared.com, I tend to agree. It&#x27;s just a bunch of buzzfeed-level listicles, but I didn&#x27;t find anything scammy or harmful.<p>Perhaps Facebook is trying to raise the &quot;quality&quot; of what is shared on their platform (not just the ethics), but if that is the case I haven&#x27;t heard anything about it. Facebook is absolutely stuffed to the gills with this kind of commodity-grade filler content.<p>Based on what he posted, my guess is that the author delegated too much editorial control in his mini media empire and one of the sites in his network published some pretty objectionable content. If I were a betting man, I&#x27;d say it was COVID&#x2F;vaccine related.')
