This, to me, doesn&#x27;t function as a desk because of the incline.  It has the potential to be a remarkably comfortable means to use a desktop (or perhaps laptop if you built in a way to mount it), but without a way for me to sit my coffee on it, or to put a notepad somewhere and not have to worry about it sliding off.<p>I know you can build in mounts for that stuff, but I think there&#x27;s a lot of value in how dynamic desk surface is.  Need 2 notepads so you can see things side by side? Cool, put it on the desk.  Working on 2 laptops today, because you got a new one?  Cool, put it on the desk.<p>I wonder if you could find a way to to make things stay put.  Anything sticky would get all over your arms.  Velcro seems usable if you put the soft side on the desk, but it&#x27;s ugly.  You could maybe use magnets that you embed into your stuff to increase the friction enough that they don&#x27;t slide.  Won&#x27;t help with tea, but it should work for most other things.  Modern monitors and computers without magnetic hard drive are okay with magnets, right? (I can&#x27;t say for sure)')
