But when they then argue &quot;Taking on debt is actually a good thing, don&#x27;t blame me for doing it I had to do it! Everyone does it! Paying off debt is actually a bad thing to do for governments!&quot; they crossed the line and I can no longer consider them as good people. So I used those words since that is what they are, shitty people deserve shitty treatment.')
