However, this is unlikely to explain our findings because we found that patients who underwent surgery on the surgeon’s birthday were similar in all observable characteristics to patients who underwent surgery on other days. Furthermore, severity of illness as measured by predicted mortality, and the number of procedures performed per surgeon, also did not differ based on whether a surgery occurred on a surgeon’s birthday compared with other days.<p>&gt; we found that patients who underwent surgery on the surgeon’s birthday were __similar in all observable characteristics__ to patients who underwent surgery on other days')
