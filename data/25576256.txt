It releases all kinds of feel-good chemicals in your body, and it just feels good to be, if not full, satiated. It&#x27;s an activity chock-full of positive reinforcements.<p>Exercise, in contrast, is filled with various forms of pain (short and long term) and lots of tedium. If you&#x27;re lucky, you get an endorphin rush to help offset these, but not everybody (and not every exercise regimen) provides these. It&#x27;s an activity with lots of built-in negative reinforcements.<p>And dieting? Dieting is constantly saying &quot;No&quot; to the positive feelings associated with eating. A piece of Christmas fudge? No. A side of fries with your hamburger? No. A full rack of sauced BBQ ribs? No. Creamy dressing for your salad? No. Seconds? A whole lot of No.<p>It takes a lot of willpower and a long term goal to maintain a certain body shape to consistently - over the course of your entire lifetime - exercise more and eat less. And any mistake, any injury or illness which pushes you into obesity, and you&#x27;re having to go even further into the &quot;this doesn&#x27;t make me feel good&quot; category.<p>Throw in a continuing shift towards jobs which donâ€™t burn thousands of calories every day (e.g. forced exercise, overhead for increased caloric intake), and the availability of cheap meals with lots of calories, and boom.
