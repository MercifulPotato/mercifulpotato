Also, we are technically agnostic, you can just as easily run Python&#x2F;Julia&#x2F;C++ or Unity engine to generate synthetic datasets (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QxMuWuk_W10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QxMuWuk_W10</a>)<p>not self-service or free though; our technical support team handles all the setup and maintenance<p>let me know if you have questions about Valohai or MLOps (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valohai.com&#x2F;mlops&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valohai.com&#x2F;mlops&#x2F;</a>) in general, I&#x27;ve seen quite a lot of projects and pipelines as I work at Valohai as an ML engineer helping our customers to setup end-to-end ML pipelines')
