And then comes along some spiffy &quot;throw hammer at the problem&quot; person that can&#x27;t stand spending too much time on a problem, who then proceeds to solve it in some crappy way that &quot;kinda works&quot;. Then goes ahead and convinces everyone to go with it because &quot;hey it&#x27;s already done and kinda works and why throw away work&quot;, nevermind the &quot;work&quot; you did figuring it out and them not even bothering to ask you for your info (or downright ignoring it because it wasn&#x27;t quick enough for their way of operating).<p>And then when you raise it with management, you get told to &quot;call a meeting&quot; to discuss the issue with the team in such a way that precludes the need for management to get directly involved and tell that other person to sit down and listen - because hey &quot;they&#x27;re a code ninja that gets shit done&quot; and look at all these things they&#x27;ve done.<p>Oh and we generally have to spend weeks afterwards fixing all the corner cases they never bothered to think about or investigate. And more meetings get called to discuss it instead of them just listening to you <i>telling</i> them what the solutions are. Because hey, the whole team has to have a say right? We wouldn&#x27;t want them to think their opinion doesn&#x27;t matter. 50&#x2F;50 chance of that, or we end up rewriting it after we come to the realization that the solution sucks, but that code-ninja has already moved along to the next team where &quot;they urgently need help of someone that can just get things done&quot;.<p>&#x2F;rant')
