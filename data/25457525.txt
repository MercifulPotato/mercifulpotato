The local government has the power to force a company to comply via a variety of enforcement tactics. There&#x27;s no practical way for a company, on its own, to refuse orders from a government, unless they are willing to do as Google did in China so long ago and exit the country.<p>One question that I do think bears inspection is whether governments should offer assistance to companies mostly owned domestically that do business abroad. The US government could enter the fight on Facebook&#x27;s behalf and force a better result. But that would require the USG to spend international political capital on behalf of the oppressed citizens of arbitrary foreign countries. It might be a better world if we did, but historically this has not been something we spend many resources on unless there is a geopolitical end that benefits us.')
