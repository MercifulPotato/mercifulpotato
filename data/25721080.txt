If someone can fulfill your request in your footprint, you&#x27;ll have low-latency bandwidth for a few minutes. Otherwise, someone else in the shell will send it up later once the satellite is in your footprint and get it down to you later once you&#x27;re back in the footprint.<p>All you need to do is send a request to someone else in your shell and they&#x27;ll upload it the next time the satellite passes.<p>Probably some centralized or decentralized crypto payment to make it all happen. Still need cheaper phased-beam arrays though.')
