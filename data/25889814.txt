But when authorities are to be invoked, economists are generally just sideline-experts with no skin in the game, who are unable to translate their understanding of markets into alpha. This is in response to you stating in your first post that economists are the true experts (intuitive, but I think incorrect. It&#x27;s like interviewing a sports commentator (who wasn&#x27;t formerly a coach or player) instead of an actual coach).<p>While I don&#x27;t know Dalio&#x27;s full position or rationale, I have another comment on this post that explains when and why I personally expect inflation. I am curious though -- can you expand on what you believe Krugman&#x27;s position to be here, and why it makes sense? He doesn&#x27;t seem to worry about inflation from open market operations because it works until it doesn&#x27;t. There has been inflation since 2008, but most of it went to wealthy people who hold the majority of their net worth in equities and real estate. These asset classes are severely under-represented in the CPI. Because these are mostly unrealized gains enjoyed by so few, there aren&#x27;t that many more people competing to buy milk and eggs, which would actually affect CPI.<p>Many progressive economists don&#x27;t seem to realize their policies contribute to massive wealth inequality just as much as America&#x27;s poor attempt at graduated tax brackets. Granted, Krugman has his moments, and for all his faults his recommendations don&#x27;t seem to be purely ideologically motivated.')
