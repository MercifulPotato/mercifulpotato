Item(by='sirn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605781711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142531, text='FWIW, the thing about HiDPI being blurry is partly design difference between X11 and Wayland, and partly design decision on sway part (to not support this scenario). Having X11 and Wayland applications in HiDPI means having to handle two DPI in a single screen (e.g. sway have to render Xwayland window at 1x, while other windows at 2x).<p>This can be quite tricky since Xwayland&#x27;s DPI may not always equal to `display DPI * Wayland scale` and while DPI settings in X is global, scale settings in Wayland is per-output. GNOME for instance has HiDPI working for both Xwayland and Wayland windows but with lots of magic going on with the framebuffer. HiDPI for X window in Plasma is still in the works AFAIK.<p>(This is a blocker for me as well.)')
