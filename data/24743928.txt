If the aim of writing a grant becomes to not be in the bottom 25%, than the average quality of grants will go down.<p>I think it has not been proven to be impossible to determine the difference between a top 5% and a top 10% grant, it has just been proven that the current system does not do that. In trainings for grant applications it is often mentioned that members of grant committees spend extremely little time per grant proposal, which I imagine is just sufficient to weed out the bottom 25% proposals (those that contain obvious flaws)')
