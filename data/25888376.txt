They&#x27;re allowed to say pretty much anything they want.<p>One basic interrogation technique involves lying to you about what you&#x27;re suspected of. The interrogator might accuse you of something they KNOW you didn&#x27;t do. He then notes your reaction.... typically you will be outraged and confused.<p>Later when he accuses you of other crimes, he studies your reaction and compares it to the earlier reaction. He already knows what you look like when you truthfully deny a crime. Is your denial different this time? Yes? Then that gives him a hint that his current accusation might be accurate.')
