Maybe some rather specific people got their panties in a twist.<p>Either way, what you said is something Bertrand Russel (certainly not best known for being a dumb man) once worded like this:<p>&quot;The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.&quot;<p>.. and just for good measure, here is another one of his quotes, which is hardly well know to those who would probably be better off if they did:<p>&quot;Our great democracies still tend to think that a stupid man is more likely to be honest than a clever man, and our politicians take advantage of this prejudice by pretending to be even more stupid than nature made them.&quot;<p>In summary: ignorant people do appear to often be more confident than they deserve to be. Whether that is actually because they are truly unaware of their ignorance, that could certainly be a good question to ask oneself. For there are plenty who deliberately abuse both faked ignorance and confidence just to bamboozle and deceive others.')
