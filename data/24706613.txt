Ironically it seems that it would have been just fine for him to continue so long as he stuck to religiously eating grapefruit every day. He would have needed a substantially lower dose of the drug, but Warfarin is one where you adjust the dose a lot for each patient anyway: the manufacturer recommends starting with 6mg and ending up anywhere from 0.5 to 10mg depending on the patient&#x27;s response [0].<p>He was also hospitalised several times, both for his heart problems and stomach cancer. I wonder if hospitals keep grapefruit on hand for patients like this, or if they ban it altogether.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.org.au&#x2F;australian-prescriber&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-to-manage-warfarin-therapy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nps.org.au&#x2F;australian-prescriber&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-to...</a>')
