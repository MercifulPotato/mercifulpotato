In fact, a good nonfiction book proposal is going to spend most of its length explaining to the publisher how you will sell the book for them through your connections and credibility - not the other way around. It&#x27;s all on you.<p>- Don&#x27;t do it for the money. You&#x27;re going to make 10-15% of a pretty small pie. If you want to write info products as a moneymaking side gig and you have any following at all, self publish!<p>So why go with a traditional publisher? I don&#x27;t feel this is fully articulated in the OP, but here was my reasoning:<p>- The publisher probably will get your book in the hands of a larger absolute number of people, so if you care about maximizing readership and you don&#x27;t have a stupid-large online following, their network effects through bookstores, library sales, etc will help you sell more copies than you could on your own (though again, you&#x27;ll see very little of the money!)<p>- There&#x27;s still some social proof involved with traditional publishing, and it&#x27;s a nice thing to do once - just so you know in the back of your head that you &quot;can&quot;<p>- In my case, I was producing a highly graphic book that really doesn&#x27;t work except in print and in full color, and I needed the resources of a traditional publishing house to make it not look terrible.<p>The Wiley experience was overall positive for me and I don&#x27;t regret it, but if I ever produce a text-based info product in future it&#x27;s hard to look away from the ROI advantages of self-publishing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Read-Aloud-Cloud-Innocents-Inside&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1119677629&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Read-Aloud-Cloud-Innocents-Inside&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a>')
