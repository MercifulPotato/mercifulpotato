If they made a future version as an equitorial mount it would be even better for radioastronamy, and if it&#x27;s strong enough astrophotography too. They&#x27;re a lot more complicated though so it&#x27;s understandable why they didn&#x27;t go that route.<p>Especially if this is meant more for geostationary satellites and I&#x27;m guessing most satellites like NOAA aren&#x27;t too bothered by the slightly rougher tracking. Plus I guess the passes are fairly short anyway...')
