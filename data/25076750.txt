You&#x27;re deeply integrated through nobody&#x27;s fault but your own.<p>Exactly this.  We started being Stripe customers after they bought some third party several years ago. While Stripe maintained the deal it was good for our business but recently they decided to end the deal we had (I don&#x27;t blame them, it was a very sweet deal for us). Fortunately my startup always have had more than one provider and now we can calculate a &quot;least cost routing&quot; process, which will definitely move a lot of our volume outside of Stripe.<p>But it is just that, business. You should not trust any one provider with your business, not even AWS (i.e. not even at that level).')
