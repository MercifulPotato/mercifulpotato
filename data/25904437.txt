The world reduced the rate of emissions by 10% last year. That&#x27;s better than nothing, but the overall level of greenhouse gases still rose by a lot last year,  so it makes sense that ice would continue to melt faster. This trend will continue until we have net negative emissions, which is pretty much only possible if we first have close to zero emissions from power generation, transportation, and agriculture, as well as cash subsidies for carbon removal and sequestration.<p>The fix to climate change has never been reduced emissions, it has been negative emissions or zero emissions if you&#x27;re willing to accept a slower, inferior solution. Reducing emissions just buys a little bit of time (but not much, based on what most of the world considers &quot;reduced&quot;).')
