The new SAM9X60 I mentioned is still on 40nm, but it&#x27;s a tiny chip and all new Cortex-A7 SoCs and things like the Ingenic X2000 are on 28nm because of overall cost for that design point.<p>The sweet spot for power efficiency has apparently moved from 28nm to 22nm, which uses less energy than either 28nm HKMG or 14nm FinFET and is also closing in on 28nm on cost.<p>There no mainstream 32-bit cores on 22nm or below (yet), so there is a good chance that the coming generation of low-cost 64-bit SoCs on 22nm will beat all 32-bit chips on performance, power consumption and cost.')
