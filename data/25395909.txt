I think there’s a pretty clear distinction between having a spell-checker bundled into word, and reproducing the product of a competitor after the fact and bundling it into your office suite as an accessory.<p>Also, that’s the whole point of the legal system (and part of what Stoller is arguing). If a spell-checker company feels the behavior was anti-competitive, they should be able to go through the legal system and fight it. I think Stoller is saying that this exact legal system is currently flawed.')
