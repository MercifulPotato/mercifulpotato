The net result was about 6 hours of the desktop group wondering &quot;why the hell are all of the PCs not logging in right after this patch&quot; followed by about a month of rolling tickets from seldom used computers that had just been powered off.<p>His excuse was it only showed a file hash in the main screen and you had to view details to see the name plus he had a 3 day change open to roll out the system. Never understood how he got away with that one but such things did catch up to him about 2 years later.')
