They are two heroes of my youth, so this is really an absolute dream come true for me.<p>The player’s main weapon is Mjölnir – a magic hammer – that bounces off enemies and walls. So the player has to carefully aim and use the environment to do bouncy trick shots to defeat enemies or solve physic-based puzzles. This leads to all kinds of crazy and funny situations.<p>Some WIP Video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TWTpi3D4IFA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TWTpi3D4IFA</a><p>Infos: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asylumsquare.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;tiny-thor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asylumsquare.com&#x2F;games&#x2F;tiny-thor</a>')
