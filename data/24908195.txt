LeCunn&#x27;s post is very sparse on detail, but the point is that humans can easily reason about a vast number of things that any form of sequential language model cannot. That alone is evidence that humans are doing something qualitatively different.<p>It isn&#x27;t conclusive evidence however, and larger models may produce significantly more human like results. But from what we know about how gpt-3 works, all the evidence is on the side of it not resembling human intelligence.')
