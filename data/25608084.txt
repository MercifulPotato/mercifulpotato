I’ve been using Amphetamine for years and it’s quite literally one of a handful of utility apps on the App Store that isn’t a scam or neutered by the policies of the store. Apple was right to recognize it it in the past, and they are wrong today in their reinterpretation of the guidelines.<p>FWIW, I do app review policy for iSH, which went though a similar situation recently (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25028252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25028252</a>) where we managed to convince Apple that they had misinterpreted their review guidelines. If you’re looking for help to get Amphetamine approved as it should, feel free to contact me at saagar@saagarjha.com. I’d be really disappointed to see Amphetamine lose its years of brand value over such a petty review decision.')
