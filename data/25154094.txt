It&#x27;s a tough community to get into. I hadn&#x27;t heard of Tildes before, but it looks cool, too.<p>Reddit reached Eternal September a while ago, so the key is to find small (yet active) communities whose content doesn&#x27;t make it to r&#x2F;all. I moderate a cycling community there, but we&#x27;re really strict about what type of content gets posted. It sucks that we as a mod team have to do that, but if we don&#x27;t our community gets overrun with memes, image macros, and rage comics.')
