I&#x27;m moderately intelligent and have felt this way for a couple decades, and I still haven&#x27;t done anything about it because I still don&#x27;t know how to make it not suck, and I&#x27;ve yet to see anyone else working on a good solution either.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of very smart, capable, and talented people have trouble finding a decent job, and eventually settle for underemployment for a good while. A system that could properly utilize their productivity would be vastly superior to our current system. There&#x27;s a lot of money on the table for anyone who implements that system.<p>I don&#x27;t know what that system looks like. I just know with certainty that there&#x27;s a massive amount of wasted productivity under our current system.<p>What I can tell you is that when I graduated college, the way you found a job was to use Monster.com--a big job search engine--apply to various openings in a tedious process, and interview. Today, you use Indeed.com--a big job search engine--apply to various openings in approximately the same tedious process, and then interview in approximately the same way.<p>There&#x27;s money on the table for anyone who can improve the system, and no one has. This tells me it&#x27;s hard. (The fact that I don&#x27;t know how to improve it a bonus.)')
