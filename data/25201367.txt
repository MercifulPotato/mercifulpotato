Therefore the typical lifecycle of trees&#x2F;phytoplankton doesn&#x27;t add more O2 to the atmosphere than the current level.<p>2) In the rare instance that the decay&#x2F;death of phytoplankton is quickly buried underground (ex: deep-sea mud), there is a net gain in atmospheric O2. Over the course of millions years, this process has led to ~21% atmospheric O2.<p>So, everyday decay&#x2F;death of life doesn&#x27;t &quot;produce&quot; O2 in the way photosynthesis does, but it does when photosynthesizing organisms get buried underground.')
