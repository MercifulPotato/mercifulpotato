Any extension of that idea into the private sector is completely ungrounded in what the law actually does.<p>The idea that we can’t criticize companies in a thread full of criticism of Google is just plain silly. Of course you can criticize companies. But if you’re criticizing your <i>employer</i>, you do have to accept the risk of there being private consequences. This has <i>always</i> been the case.<p>Heck, it’s not just limited to employers. If I was to walk into my local Starbucks and make a nuisance of myself by screaming, I’ll be banned. That’s not a violation of my free speech rights, nobody is prosecuting me, but it’s an obvious consequence of my speech.')
