It&#x27;s not clear whether all the existing spammers will get the message.<p>I think the biggest problem DO will have to address somehow is that Hacktoberfest now has become such a big event that they are getting attendees which they strictly speaking <i>do not want to have</i>, and the liberal “everything is open for everyone”-approach is now too open for the “game” to work.<p>Finding a way to encourage (new) people to contribute to open-source projects while at the same time keeping the bad people out (opportunists, spammers, etc) is not going to be easy. Locking things down (like only opt-in repos count) will severely limit genuine contributions way beyond just spam.<p>Whatever they end up doing, I suspect we will see Hacktoberfest 2019 as peak Hacktoberfest and from now on the event will be a mere shadow of what it used to be.')
