Item(by='elliekelly', descendants=None, kids=[25932723], score=None, time=1611775108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932276, text='&gt; Saying &quot;We should all buy GameStop to engineer the short squeeze of the century and fuck over greedy hedge funds&quot; is completely transparent, truthful, and legal.<p>To be clear I’m not saying it’s definitely illegal because I’m really not sure and I think you could make the argument either way. But I absolutely would <i>not</i> characterize it as “completely transparent, truthful, and legal”.<p>I think the SEC could at least make the argument that WSB redditors collectively were essentially activist investors acting in concert and failed to make the relevant disclosures to put the market on notice. And, in the eyes of federal securities laws, failing to disclose material information is akin to deceit.<p>I‘m not saying the SEC will (or even should) make that argument but I am saying that this is absolutely not nearly as cut and dry as you think. Not by a long shot.')
