Should the system just continue to give this individual another slap on the wrist? The system should work to make the necessary adjusts to protect society from these individuals. For some, putting on a breathealyser is enough, while sometimes people start to have their friends breathe into it instead. If there is no other measure that can be taken to prevent an individual from becoming intoxicated and conducting heavy machinery, then I don&#x27;t see another alternative.<p>&gt; You could execute drunk drivers and the rate of new drunk drivers wouldn&#x27;t change.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how feasible it is to make this statement because I&#x27;m not aware of anyway we could test the accuracy of this statement.<p>One field I&#x27;m interested in being developed is detecting cars whose drivers seem to be intoxicated with machine vision software. Some cities &#x2F; countries have enough state-owned cameras in public for this, and you could combine this with IoT spikes in the road or state-controlled kill-switches to completely eradicate drunk driving.')
