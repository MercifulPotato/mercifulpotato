The ability to have domain-specific dialects was one of the best things about Rebol and would be great to see in a modern language.<p>And speaking of functions, could you make the &quot;Function Reference&quot; that&#x27;s on the homepage, be available on a standalone page too? It&#x27;s a very useful reference and would be great to access it easily. Thanks!')
