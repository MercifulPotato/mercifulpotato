Item(by='tangoalpha', descendants=None, kids=[25582831, 25587969, 25583516], score=None, time=1609343634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581727, text='This is how the seller can do it, atleast on Amazon India.<p>Swapping the details completely triggers AI based flags and often causes the change to be manually reviewed.<p>But the seller can add a variant of the product (like size or color). But the seller instead adds a completely different product he intends to swap the original product with. Now the listing will show two completely different products as variants on a single product listing. Then the seller removes the old variant. Nothing gets flagged. No manual review.<p>This has been around for long and a very popular trick with shady sellers on Amazon in India. I don&#x27;t think Amazon never figured it out. For whatever reason, Amazon turns a blind eye to this practice.')
