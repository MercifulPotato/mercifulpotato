Your comment sounds very dismissive, and if you meant to be, then I think you’re unaware of their impact and reach.<p>That said I don’t fully buy the author’s exact argument:<p>- node.js local install IS for a traditional programming environment on the CLI\n- you don’t need node built in when you have the browser\n- plenty of web IDEs exist that do as the author wishes… run node code in the browser while also editing it.')
