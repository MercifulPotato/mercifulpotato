It makes no sense for COVID, where there are very simple things you can do to greatly reduce the risk of spread: Namely not going to large gatherings, and wearing a little piece of cloth on your face. It&#x27;s just like wearing a seatbelt. People don&#x27;t wear seatbelts because they live their lives in constant fear--they wear them because they are simple, low-effort ways to greatly reduce risk of death.')
