If there are negative side effects or even death, nobody has the means to go after BigPharma. Sad to see reservation towards experimental vaccine being labelled as &quot;anti-vaxx&quot; much like we&#x27;ve seen various points of view being discredited by pushing &quot;racist&quot; and &quot;fake news&quot; narrative.')
