Basically what yoruba said. That this is a cyclic, almost ritual yearly dying that wouldn&#x27;t be out of place in a horror movie, with the villagers resignedly going up the mountain to a cave to lie down and die, but that somehow there are enough survivors when winter ends. I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary to spell everything out, but the whole story seems like a horror story.<p>Needless to say, there&#x27;s nothing unusual or unbelievable about people dying of starvation.')
