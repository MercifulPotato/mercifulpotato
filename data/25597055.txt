We&#x27;ve known that for decades. It became the first resort anyway†. The RFC this author is complaining about (which is a decade old at this point) is just yet another way to use passwords. Stop it.<p>If you actually wanted to build one of these today you would not build one of those toy digest systems, you&#x27;d use a PAKE such as OPAQUE <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-01" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque-01</a><p>But arguably instead of dedicating effort to trying to &quot;fix&quot; password authentication it&#x27;s better to just do much less of it. On the web that means <i>much more</i> WebAuthn.<p>† This mistaken inversion happens a lot. When working on the British railways there is supposed to be an assessment of the safest practical method of performing the work. What used to be known as &quot;red zone&quot; working, where there are still trains using the railway while you work on it, is inherently dangerous and to be avoided. Red zone should be a last resort. But in practice what you will routinely find after a red zone accident is that they picked red zone not out of necessity but simply their planners had fallen into a habit of always justifying this unsafe practice rather than choose methods that might delay things, inconvenience workers or require purchasing equipment. It had become their first resort instead.')
