Do you plan on paying US taxes but not live there? Do you plan on not paying Canadian taxes?<p>If you are getting a TN to prevent your employer from having to follow appropriate processes for employing people in Canada it feels like you are putting yourself personally at risk for this employer.<p>Again, I am not an attorney, but you should probably talk to one about options here because something just _feels_ incorrect about this set up.')
