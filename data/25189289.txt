My views are biased.<p>This is an insightful article. A learning for me was how the author managed to switch multiple cloud providers even while being a one man SAAS.<p>Kubernetes is overwhelming because of 2 things: Overload of terminology, and Distributed systems day 2 operations.<p>Author succeeds so well because he has a starter stack (install, CI pipeline, secure, monitor, scale) maintained as code, and it works every time.<p>For someone starting new, the learning curve is high. Bootstrapping is easy, but day 2 on kubernetes is hard. Benefits outweigh is learning curve imho.<p>Specific to DigitalOcean kubernetes API server issues, we have rolled out some resource provisioning improvements for newly created clusters very recently. Also making ongoing improvements to backend monitoring.')
