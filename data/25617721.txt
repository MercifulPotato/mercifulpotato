They&#x27;ve also eliminated the `reduced_window` method of weighting-by-distance that&#x27;s present in `word2vec.c`, Gensim, and FastText.<p>What if that&#x27;s the real reason for their sometimes slightly-better, sometimes slightly-worse performance on some benchmarks? Perhaps there are other changes, too.<p>This is why I continue to think Gensim&#x27;s policy of matching the reference implementations from the original authors, at least by default, is usually the best policy â€“ rather than using an alternate interpretation of the often-underspecified papers.')
