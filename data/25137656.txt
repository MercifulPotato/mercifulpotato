I get 2-3 interview invites every day on my LikedIn account just for listed keywords (nothing special, really, generic devops stuff). And the account is explicitly marked as &quot;not looking for a job&quot;. I leave in Eastern Europe with a lot of huge outsource outlets though, maybe that drives the demand up.')
