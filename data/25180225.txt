He did not come from an area or a family who knew how to function gracefully in the eight-figure net worth NE corridor crowd.<p>He parlayed his varsity status (I call it a totally-not-a-club club) into a random low level back room finance job in NYC. He made himself useful, socialized, networked, learned from those around him, and after two decades or so (leaving out a lot of the story) he was a partner of a hedge fund that ended up netting him a mid-eight-figure net worth.<p>Granted, that is not the same as jumping from the bottom quintile, but knowing his personal story, he had plenty of social challenges to overcome.')
