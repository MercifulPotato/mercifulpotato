Then, I realized that I am looking at this issue backwards.<p>My cobbled together system is as good as Apples custom SoC. As long as all players have access to TSMC we are going to continue to see amazing produces from AMD (and others) that are competitive with Apple. I don&#x27;t think there is any hope of beat Apple for performance based on form factor, but there is a hope that there will be equally good hardware without the restriction imposed by Apple and others.')
