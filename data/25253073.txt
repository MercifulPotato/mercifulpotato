There are heretic \n  movements that try to make indentations 4 (or \n  even 2!) characters deep, and that is akin to \n  trying to define the value of PI to be 3.\n\n  Rationale: [snip]\n\n  Now, some people will claim that having 8-\n  character indentations makes the code move \n  too far to the right, and makes it hard to \n  read on a 80-character terminal screen.\n\n  The answer to that is that if you need more \n  than 3 levels of indentation, youâ€™re screwed \n  anyway, and should fix your program.\n</code></pre>\nHaving used 8-char tabs for a very long time, I now find looking at smaller tab&#x27;ed code a somewhat unpleasant experience. It feels like the code lacks enunciation.
