And it sounds like something existing OSI-approved licenses could do?<p>And yet, SSPL is not OSI-approved, and they did not choose an existing OSI-approved license, instead the SSPL which they say &quot;embodies the principles of open source&quot;, but isn&#x27;t actually an open source license by accepted standards.<p>So... why? What&#x27;s going on? What is this really about?<p>The press release of course doesn&#x27;t answer the question &quot;why  not use an actual OSI-approved license&quot;?<p>What they describe seems pretty similar to AGPL, which is a pretty inconvenient license for use in commercial products, but is OSI approved. What does SSPL do that AGPL doesn&#x27;t, and what about it makes OSI approval challenging?')
