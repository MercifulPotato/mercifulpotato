There is no point forcing car companies to use a certain algorithm, for example, but it&#x27;s not unreasonable to build a standard basket of problematic road signs which the car must pass - e.g. a cattle grid isn&#x27;t too bad, but if a driverless car doesn&#x27;t stop for a speed limit outside a school the company should have some liability.')
