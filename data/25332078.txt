Even talking to musicians, they couldn&#x27;t explain it to me with the rigor I wanted.<p>For me, the real insight came when I understood why the 12 note chromatic scale was chosen, why chords &quot;sound good&quot; and that a lot of the confusing terminology hides pretty simple concepts.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like I could make any music, generative or otherwise, that sounds passable but here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned so far:<p>* As a good approximation of the human auditory system, frequencies are perceived on a logarithmic scale<p>* Rhythm is tied heavily with language and the tempo of speech, word length and frequency [0]<p>* Note combinations sound more &quot;pleasing&quot; when the ration of their frequencies are small as reduced fractions [1]<p>* The 12 note chromatic scale is a good compromise of number of notes and enough pleasantly sounding note combinations<p>* The 12 note chromatic scale is generated from a base frequency of 440Hz multiplied by the twelfth roots of 2<p>* The 12 note chromatic scale can be further restricted to the diatonic scales to help further restrict the note\n  set to allow for ease of composition<p>As far as I can tell, a lot of music theory centers around the different diatonic scales (&quot;Ionian&quot;, &quot;Aeolian&quot;, etc.), which are just restrictions of the chromatic 12 note scale to some notes that sound reasonable together. I have some very rough notes on it [2], though I&#x27;m not sure how readable it is.<p>I&#x27;m also in the same boat in terms of &quot;instrument choice&quot;, though I would much rather invest in some live coding environment, like Gibber or Sonic Pi, or some software DAW system like LMMS. I still haven&#x27;t found something that gets at the right level of functionality and abstraction that I want.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;Music&#x2F;patel2003.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;Music&#x2F;patel20...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;Music&#x2F;measures-consonances_honingh.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;papers&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;Music&#x2F;measure...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;dev&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;notes&#x2F;MusicNotes.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abetusk&#x2F;dev&#x2F;blob&#x2F;release&#x2F;notes&#x2F;MusicNotes...</a>')
