For that purpose, the CAPTCHA doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, just better than what some other sites have (i.e. no CAPTCHA at all) so that it&#x27;s not worth it to spend time breaking into your input fields specifically when there&#x27;s easier targets.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any CAPTCHA solution that would protect you from actual targeted attacks where the attacker is determined to spend time on breaking your protection specifically.')
