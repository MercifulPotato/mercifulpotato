I&#x27;ve been using online ordering since Foodler days, and they seem to all be getting worse.<p>Grubhub almost always sticks to a $5 credit even if the problem with the other is much more than $5.<p>I routinely place an order on Postmates thinking everything&#x27;s fine, and then they cancel due to not having someone go pick it up. Why list the restaurant at all?<p>Just last week, my Uber Eats order was missing a sandwich. This was probably the third order in a row where the restaurant didn&#x27;t include an item as part of the order, with a fourth order containing a pubic hair in the food. For the missing sandwich, Uber refused to refund the one item, citing my account was flagged. After multiple levels of customer service, yeah, they just refused to refund me for a sandwich I never received. It&#x27;s only $6 and frankly I just disputed it with my credit card, but the principle just sucks. I was halfway to creating a Twitter account to message Dara to ask if this is the new Uber he promised.')
