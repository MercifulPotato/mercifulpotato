Even the pedantic original version of smalltalk OOP has this problem.<p>map-reduce and functions do not require coordination until reduction.  map doesn&#x27;t require a serialized mailbox (like actors), or worrying about ordering in time.  Smalltalk requires a consistent <i>state</i> and the <i>location</i> of where to send messages is important.  Distributed map is stateless.  All versions of OOP concern themselves with state encapsulation, whereas map is state elimination.  map is functional.')
