That&#x27;s quite a different trade off than handwashing, masks, and social distance.<p>The requirement to stop all contact is already effectively there for those at risk, and the demands aren&#x27;t stopping at handwashing, masks, and social distance as those don&#x27;t appear to be working; instead indefinite lockdowns, blanket bans on household mixing and abolition of major sections of peoples lives and livelihoods are being demanded.')
