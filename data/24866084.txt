CS3 Production Premium Collection was my first, long-desired Creative Suite product, bought in high school with my summer&#x27;s earnings to support my burgeoning filmmaking projects. Cut a bigger film that next winter using Premiere &amp; After Effects and won some smalltime awards. Good times, so long ago.<p>I have Creative Cloud now, and have had for years, but still, that little bit of my history is now just memories. I still have my CS6 environment, so they&#x27;d better not kill those activation servers anytime soon!')
