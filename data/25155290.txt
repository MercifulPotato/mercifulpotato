What are you building, why does it matter and how does it make things better.  And tailor it some to audience members, e.g. engineers will be curious on the technical how, marketing or execs will likely want to know more about what it will look like to clients and how it improves the product and they don&#x27;t care about the framework you used.  If you are in a startup founders can blur those lines when they are involved in engineering but always start with the What, why and how it makes things better.  You can even tell a compelling story about why changing a 3rd party library matters if you follow this process.  Don&#x27;t skimp on details, but don&#x27;t go overboard, try to find a balance again based on the audience.')
