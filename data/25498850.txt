Facebook wants everyone to see &quot;Cambridge Analytica did something bad and Facebook stopped it&quot;, when the real story was &quot;Cambridge Analytica did something bad, convinced us it made money, and Facebook stopped it <i>by platforming it</i> and charging Cambridge Analytica for it&quot;. The Cambridge Analytica models led directly to Facebook&#x27;s personalized ads system, with almost everything Cambridge Analytica asked for being added to the ads platform itself. Almost everything that was shady and questionably ethical about what Cambridge Analytica was doing didn&#x27;t stop being shady and questionably ethical when Facebook simply in housed all of that tracking for &quot;ad personalization&quot; and started selling it as a service to any advertiser willing to pay for it.')
