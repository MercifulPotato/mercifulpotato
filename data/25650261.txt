It&#x27;s been hugely frustrating. When you dig into the data, most of Safari traffic is from iOS so most devs just can&#x27;t be bothered to port to Safari. The $99 is just another kick in the face. You might think it&#x27;s quick and easy to convert, but Safari has all sort of annoying inconsistencies that make it a huge amount of work. For any small software company it&#x27;s just not worth the effort. Safari should incentivize people not disincentivize them.')
