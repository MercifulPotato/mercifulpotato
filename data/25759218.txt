That goes right on your curriculum as Skill.\nHad an Excel course in school? &quot;Office suite knowledge&quot;\nCreated one endpoint in a C# .Net Core API? API programming check.<p>So our company hired some of these full stack freelancers. While the code &quot;works&quot;, it is not anywhere in a acceptable performance range and full of bugs. A SQL server job that runs two hours to create some 1000 simple new datarows is just not okay.<p>But for the business end, server job performance is not a value they can &quot;feel&quot; unless there is some UI connected to it.<p>The point I want to make that it&#x27;s a potentially harmful game in the long term for any company that reads the skillsets of a developer without ever asking 1 or two questions.')
