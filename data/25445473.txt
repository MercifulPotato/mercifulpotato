For instance I have this in my i3 config:<p>bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id amixer sset &#x27;Master&#x27; 2%+\nbindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec --no-startup-id amixer sset &#x27;Master&#x27; 2%-<p>but there&#x27;s no guarantee that this would work everywhere depending on what&#x27;s installed, I just know that it works in my case. It&#x27;s easy enough to look up anyway (&#x27;linux change volume from terminal&#x27;), so users would just save 5 minutes if the default worked for them. I think the message is that i3 is not targeting the same people as Gnome, and it&#x27;s fine. Different software for different needs and trade-offs.')
