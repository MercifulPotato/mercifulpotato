You simply need a LOT of food with decent macros, and you need to be eating all the time. I was once a fairly competitive 100mpw runner. It&#x27;s eating before you go to bed, so you can wake up at 5 and eat before going back to bed to wake up at 6 so you can do a long run and eat 150+ calories an hour during that, then immediately hit a protein shake and some rice&#x2F;pasta after the run, then lunch, so you can be prepped to go out again at like 6pm for an evening shakeout run, then you do dinner, then snack before bed, and repeat. 4k+ calories a day is a grind unless you&#x27;re hammering a lot of really empty calories.')
