Therapy helps some - I don&#x27;t get much benefit from the group stuff, but one-on-ones, knowing someone actually understands and believes you is a huge boon.<p>I personally find no reason to not share my experience and I&#x27;m honest when I&#x27;m having a bad pain day and someone asks me how I&#x27;m doing - there&#x27;s a reality that pain colors moods and decisions, so it&#x27;s worth others knowing. If you can&#x27;t trust your coworkers or employer not to discriminate against you for that, then you&#x27;re probably working in the wrong place.<p>But, one day at a time is the only way you really can take it.')
