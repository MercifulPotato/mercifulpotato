I think a better question would be not how vivid the imagined shape is, but how connected and contextual it is.<p>Someone might imagine a 6 red star and stop at that, someone might imagine a 3 star, but with the whole Kremlin tower attached on a snowy night with distant car sounds.<p>Testable things i found are looking for reactions. Imagine yourself at the beach, standing half immersed in the sea, enjoying the view, then something grabs your leg underwater.<p>-Did you flinch, or was these just words? Some people would, since they are contextually immersed in the scene.<p>-Can you answer side questions, like how calm the sea was, were you looking towards the land or the horizon, were there any birds in the sky, and so on? Some people can, because they were visualizing the scene, some people won&#x27;t unless prompted, since they were constructing the scene.<p>In the similar vein, do you project your imagination over the world around you? People who do tend to not comprehend how you can lose things, like forgetting where you parked your car.')
