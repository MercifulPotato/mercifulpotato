Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=[25501574], score=None, time=1608595384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500773, text='&gt; Yes it is.<p>No it isn&#x27;t. Speaking of dodging the point. The US didn&#x27;t remain in the private system, it half-socialized it. And you must know Canada&#x27;s system has been increasing in cost like everyone else&#x27;s.<p>And speaking of magic single-payer economics for the good of all, what&#x27;s up with that &quot;socialized&quot; army you mentioned? Most expensive in the world also. I expect the very same wanton mishandling of other people&#x27;s money when it comes to the eventual govt takeover of healthcare. Hell they are already doing it as that 40 percent govt part is outpacing world spending all its own.<p>Venezuela is just a difference of degree. The same effect is seen in everyone&#x27;s lack of R&amp;D spending outside the US.<p>The way a market works is people find ways to serve people at a price they can afford. When you always force others to pay for the cadillac service for them, no one bothers to find cheap ways to provide healthcare.')
