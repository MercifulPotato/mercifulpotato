Some variation between work and free time I guess :) However, with being at the office at most a couple of hours a week under current circumstances I notice that my muscle memory doesn&#x27;t fully work any more. Reminds me of the steep learning curve in the beginning. No plans to give up though, maybe I should switch to i3 at home, too.<p>From reading the IceWM FAQ I see nothing that it would displace my i3.')
