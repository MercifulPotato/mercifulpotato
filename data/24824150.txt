I&#x27;d send them US software, and they&#x27;d send me European software. Most Americans had C64, 1541 drives, 2400 baud modems, etc. The Europeans typically had datasettes and 300-1200 baud modems, because the cost of equipment was higher, phone calls were more expensive, and there was even a modem tax in Germany apparently.<p>So the protocol we used was that Americans would send them a 2400 baud modem, and make international calls to them, in exchange for hot new European game releases, because the extra speed would reduce the expense.<p>There&#x27;s simply no way Europeans were going to buy overpriced, underpowered Apple hardware at that point in time. There was nothing an Apple 2 could do that a C64 couldn&#x27;t, and a C64 could do substantially more than an Apple 2.<p>The results of the demoscene, which still exists for C64s, Amigas, Atari STs, and Spectrums, but is almost non-existent for the Apple 2, shows how under capable and uninteresting the platform was.')
