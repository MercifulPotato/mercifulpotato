Sometimes that was me, sometimes it was someone else. This is only the cases I&#x27;ve noticed, there were probably times where I did something stupid and didn&#x27;t realize it, and the other person took evasive action anyway, or even cases where I took the evasive action without noting the other person did something stupid.<p>We need to look out for each other.
