The greatest prize of all this is how much accurate and useful information we all get out of this. I&#x27;ve become a veritable encyclopedia, a proficient and effective software engineer, a resource on many topics for friends and family, and continue to be an enthusiast of computing software and hardware advances.<p>There&#x27;s no denying the part of our brain that gets a kick out of the internet points which reflect peer approval and respect. However, I will continue to hope to value the greater good that this community creates for all of us over the individual recognition that gives me a much shorter term buzz.')
