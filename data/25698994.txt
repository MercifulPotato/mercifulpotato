But the fact is, that extra step significantly decreases engagement. Especially for current events. Also it&#x27;s just a fact of psychology that the order in which you are presented information matters a lot.<p>&gt; Secondly, of the news orgs, several are legally bound to report neutrally (BBC), several just will because that’s their business model (AP, Reuters)<p>I&#x27;ve personally worked with both BBC and AP&#x2F;Reuters reporters on multiple occasions as both the subject of a story, and for background research. Based on my experience, I do not believe they consistently portrayed the facts neutrally. Not to mention, it&#x27;s hard to even define what &quot;neutral&quot; is in a lot of cases.<p>&gt; and then there’s enough there with polar opposite agendas that you’ll be able to determine an accurate picture pretty quickly.<p>...which goes back to my point re: effort: you&#x27;re asking _much_ more of the audience than just letting them receive an email. Not to mention, reporters of all political persuasion <i>consistently</i> neglect to cover certain types of stories. For example, getting reporters to report on &quot;feel good&quot; stories is quite hard - especially feel good stories relevant to smaller audiences - as it just doesn&#x27;t fit their narrative&#x2F;business models.')
