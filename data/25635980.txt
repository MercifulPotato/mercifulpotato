When I see many people who fit into bucket 2), it makes me not want to spend any more time around the Bitcoin community. Maybe that&#x27;s a shame. I&#x27;d probably be more willing to put up with 2) if I thought 1) was super interesting, but I&#x27;m not that excited about it, for whatever reason.<p>Alternatively, if you subscribe to the &quot;geeks, mops, and sociopaths&quot; theory of subcultures [1], Bitcoin seems to me to be well into the &quot;mops and sociopaths&quot; part.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meaningness.com&#x2F;geeks-mops-sociopaths" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meaningness.com&#x2F;geeks-mops-sociopaths</a>')
