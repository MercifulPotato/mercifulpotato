It is interesting as a cache in front of S3, but if you want a cache in front of S3...just use Cloudfront?<p>Honestly if I was AWS I would be ecstatic if people used this, AWS probably breaks even or maybe loses a little bit on optimal usage of this, and makes an absolute killing if someone using this has a traffic spike and ends up hitting their lambda millions of times.')
