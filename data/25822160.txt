It&#x27;s better to not have the problem in the first place.<p>It would be better to just burn the money then to give it to the victims.<p>Victim separately could prove what actual harm was done and request support, but this should be completely separate process ideally financed separately, that disregards how rich is the perpetrator or how severele he violeted the law.<p>Same way money from fines shouldn&#x27;t land anywhere near the cops that give the fines because this creates perverse incentive.')
