However, as parent said: There&#x27;s another picture. Mandated 20 days&#x2F;year holidays (in big companies it&#x27;s often 30 days), overtime has to be paid (these are things that came to pass due to pressure from unions!), healthcare for everyone, rent prices that are not horrendous (and a lot of social housing), a taxation system that is friendly to people with low income, unemployment benefits, minimum wage (9â‚¬&#x2F;h) etc. There&#x27;s a reason so many people look up to Germany, even in Europe.
