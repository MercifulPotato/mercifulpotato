The memory at location #6000 is NOT at where the program thinks is at memory location #6000.<p>In fact, the program might be reading &#x2F; writing to memory location 0x08004000 (or close to that, whatever the magic start address was on various OS like Linux &#x2F; Windows). And then your CPU virtually-translates that address to memory-stick #0 column#4000 or whatever.<p>Because of virtual memory: all memory operations must be translated by the CPU before you actually go to RAM (and that translation may require a page-table walk in the worst case)')
