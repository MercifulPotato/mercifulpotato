You have CAD drafters in Pakistan billing at $5&#x2F;hr. Easily a 75% discount on a skilled American. Pop-wisdom is that &lt;$15&#x2F;hr “isn’t a living wage”.<p>These economies are efficient in the sense that much of their population lives in poverty, the likes of which is almost entirely absent from the US. We basically won’t let anyone starve if they don’t refuse help, and we subsidize even the most stupid and violent members of our population out of compassion (and sometimes for votes). Personally, I would not welcome depressing US wages to a global mean while political apparatchiks and the idle class pocket the difference. I don’t think you really want that either.')
