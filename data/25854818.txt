In America, policymakers tend to prioritize real estate value over the ability of housing to actually house people. Homebuyers expect and demand that the values of their properties, including the rents that they generate, be constantly increasing. Supply and demand doesn&#x27;t push prices down, because housing is inelastic: when you hike prices outside of people&#x27;s means, they don&#x27;t stop buying, they find more means, either by taking on more roommates, more jobs, or by making big cuts elsewhere in their budgets.<p>Before the housing market was commodified and public housing looted by private interests in the 70s and 80s, spending 20% of your income on housing was considered absurdly high. Now 50% is the norm, because landlords and speculators keep raising prices and you can&#x27;t not live in a house.')
