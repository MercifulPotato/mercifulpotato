Everyone knows you use the money for other stuff not specific to the grant regardless. The opportunity cost of writing all the rejected proposals would be saved and could be spent on actual science, even if some of it isn&#x27;t top notch that otherwise would have been funded (and thats assuming that the grant proposal system actually selects the stuff mostly likely to be ground breaking).')
