NATO can easily do its role without that. In fact you can argue that NATO states like US&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Turkey which have disappeared people are very unlikely to do it against peer adversaries like Russia, China etc because of the risk of blow back. It&#x27;s far more common to it to groups deemed as terrorist, Latin American countries etc.<p>Similarly countries like Sweden and Japan are well armed and not in the business of disappearing people.')
