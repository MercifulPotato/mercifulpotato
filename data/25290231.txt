Other languages have withstood the test of time better than C++&lt;11 and C++&gt;=11 has dramatically improved the language by copying features from those other languages. C++&#x27;s issues were poor design choices, not simply some &quot;maturity&quot; force that causes a language to accumulate incoherent features.')
