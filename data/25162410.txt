Their price is comparable to a custom build but you must choose from one of 14 plans.<p>Note that pre-fab does not mean crappy, in fact pre-fabs are usually better built as cuts are measured and squared in a shop not by someone at the job site.<p>I wish them well, but $825k for just the build portion on a 3200 square foot prefab, (not a custom) is certainly no bargain no matter what housing market you are in.')
