Item(by='BoorishBears', descendants=None, kids=[25262848], score=None, time=1606801898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262656, text='I fucking hate AMP pages AS A USER (not sure why we&#x27;re yelling)<p>A lot of them a broken mappings of the actual page, so the layout is broken, or an important image will be missing...<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole annoying behavior when you want to visit the actual page, remember when they disabled the quick copy when you hit info so you had to manually copy the URL and paste it into your browser?<p>And I&#x27;d tend to do that a lot, especially on my phone where selecting text is a pain in the ass because AMP pages fail to load in the most aggravating way on my phone!<p>Instead of actually failing to load, it&#x27;s like AMP just pretends that the page is still loading? So I&#x27;ll be on a weak mobile connection for example, and the page will just get stuck in some broken state. It&#x27;s given up and instead of the browser saying &quot;Page Load failed&quot; it shows me that stupid AMP header and a broken page until I question if it&#x27;s still loading on my slow connection or stuck.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that some (really <i>many</i>) pages use AMP to show you the least useful version of the content, so literally the first thing you have to do is go to the actual page! Like Reddit, it won&#x27;t even show comments 2 comments deep, and it&#x27;s like half the post types are broken, so you need to go back and load the actual page 5 seconds later anyways!<p>So instead of just getting to go to Reddit, I get to go to that stupid AMP page, <i>then</i> start the wait for the &quot;slow terrible main site&quot;.<p>Which leads to my next point... AMP&#x27;s edge caching nonsense is not why the pages are &quot;fast&quot;, it&#x27;s because the AMP page is barren. The websites that do AMP the best tend to already have great websites! I have literally <i>never</i> clicked to go to the &quot;real&quot; site from an actual useful AMP page and had it load appreciably slower than the AMP page did.<p>Probably because the websites that have bloated crappy sites riddled by ads usually have half-assed AMP versions that are meant to funnel you into the real site anyways while taking advantage of the SEO bonus of an AMP page! So it&#x27;s literally the worst of both worlds where you&#x27;re waiting for AMP, then realizing the content is fucked, then waiting for their crap website!<p>AMP fucking SUCKS as a user, I fucking hate it.<p>When you say AMP sucks people act like you&#x27;re opposed for monopolistic reasons or something, I don&#x27;t give a damn about that! Google owns search; the ship has sailed. But that stupid AMP bullshit? It&#x27;s not monopolistic, <i>it&#x27;s just garbage.</i>')
