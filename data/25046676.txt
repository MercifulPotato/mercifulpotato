What animals do isn&#x27;t a good moral compass. Animals rape each other,<p>Neither what humans do is a compass for animals&#x27;s behaviour. You know that cows are not humans, right? There is not much consent in their social life.<p>We can work to offer them a &quot;good&quot; peaceful life before a quick innevitable slaughter. Not all the farmers cage their animals. Some of them live a pretty good life eating good grass and breathing fresher air than most humans do.<p>As long as the lifespan of a cow is concerned what difference does it make if it lives 5 years or 20 years? Eventually you have to accept that death is innevitable for animals, insects, plants and humans alike.<p>Eventuall you will end up death too, get eaten by &quot;disgusting&quot; worms.<p>You also seem to favor no life at all than a short span? Would you prefer not to be born if you were to know your life will end up tragic (i.e in car crash, or eaten by a lion)?')
