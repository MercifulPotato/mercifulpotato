Quoting from their literature:<p>&gt; If you are interested in opening an account where you do not receive recommendations or advice about whether to buy or sell investments or investment strategies or account monitoring, and you make all of your own investment decisions, then a self-directed brokerage like ours could be the right fit for you. Robinhood Financial does not have account minimums for any brokerage accounts.  Robinhood Financial does not provide recommendations. We are not subject to a fiduciary duty to you and do not monitor or manage your account, including the monitoring of brokerage account investments, unless we state otherwise in writing. Since we do not provide recommendations and you must make all of your own investment decisions, the licenses, education and other qualifications of our financial professionals will not be relevant to your investment decisions. Robinhood Financial professionals are available only to provide account support through an online email system. If you choose our services, you must be comfortable with investing your assets on your own.')
