And technically, central governments can be representative of everyone and therefor enable that same shared decision making but that&#x27;s kind of a bigger discussion.<p>The point is, changing the network to &quot;add more&quot; BTC is probably much more likely than breakthrough replicator technology that can turn hydrogen atoms into gold atoms.')
