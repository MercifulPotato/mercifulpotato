I worked at several different startups, both full time and as side gigs, and they all had Suns. I remember Enterprise 3500&#x27;s and later 250 and 450&#x27;s being popular around that time.<p>After the crash, you had to basically give that stuff away. I knew a guy who had 10 Sun boxes (all less than 5 years old) at home because a local company wrote them off. I had a couple of low end Ultras (an Ultra 2 and Ultra 10) but sold one of them off. The Ultra 2 I got used for pennies on the dollar at an auction. I think it was like $200 for what was a $15K machine years earlier.<p>Sun was so far ahead of it time. Solaris was a solid OS, but once Linux became &quot;good enough&quot;, somewhere in the &#x27;99 to &#x27;03 timeframe, depending on industry, it was over for them.')
