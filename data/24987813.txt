It just works as soon as you start the Atlantis.<p>I believe that Atlantis would be a big pleasure for mobile developers during app debugging.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProxymanApp&#x2F;atlantis#how-to-use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ProxymanApp&#x2F;atlantis#how-to-use</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;bonjour&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;bonjour&#x2F;</a>')
