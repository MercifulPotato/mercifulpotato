I don&#x27;t think anyone is claiming it&#x27;s not hard to get to. Business is tough, yes. But if you&#x27;re not making more than working part time at McDonald&#x27;s after a year or two, then you really need to reconsider your plans. Between $1k MRR and making Facebook or Google money, there is a massive gulf of businesses out there making a respectable profit even outside the tech bubble.<p>The nail salon down the street is making way more than $1k MRR. I shouldn&#x27;t need to say this, but if you&#x27;re a tech company making less than the nail salon or corner liquor store then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Or your business model is wrong. I mean, that corner liquor store definitely is paying more than $1,000 USD in rent a month.')
