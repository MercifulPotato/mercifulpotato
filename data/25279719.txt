It&#x27;s totally possible for me to go to work in a subway that has Google ads, waste time on my Pixel, work at the Google office for eight hours, waste time on my Pixel, walk past the same ads on the way home, watch YouTube videos and do Google searches about random topics, and ask Google to set an alarm before I go to sleep. It&#x27;s too much. :)')
