Nor is using bullets that are less likely to pass through the intended target or the surroundings.<p>Military personnel are not actually held to a very low standard -- much lower than police -- when they are fighting unlawful combatants like citizens, because people who are not fighting as military personnel enjoy no or almost no protections under the laws of war.<p>Trying to draw a parallel here with the laws of war is silly.')
