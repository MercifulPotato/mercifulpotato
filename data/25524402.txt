The dark matter fails to stay within the galaxy because it&#x27;s not slowed down by regular interactions.<p>Also, dark matter is able to pull regular matter to be closer to it. If a galaxy&#x27;s dark matter is moving too far away from a galaxy, it might pull the galaxy with it. (Or it might separate entirely, as happened with the Bullet Cluster.)')
