My road bike and mountain bike are both 12 years old, which means I&#x27;ve learned the ins and outs. SRAM likes to abandon old derailleur tech, but SRAM and shimano chain spacing are MOSTLY similar. On road bikes, the Shimano 9&#x2F;10spd are the same, if I remember correctly. I think the 11 and 12 speed stuff use narrower chains, BUT conveniently front chainring spacing seems to not matter a whole lot. 10 speed ultegra chains and cassettes work fine with an &quot;11 speed&quot; generation front crank, thankfully.')
