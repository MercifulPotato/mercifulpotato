People didn&#x27;t wait until concealed carry was passed to start holding. Concealed carry in Texas legalized something people were already doing<p>In the streets of most big Texas cities, you can just go ahead and assume about half of the people are holding.<p>Further, concealed carry doesn&#x27;t cover bars&#x2F;night clubs. If a place derives more than 51% of its revenue from the sale of on-site consumption of alcohol, you can&#x27;t carry no matter what license you have.<p>That&#x27;s ignoring the fact that a not insignificant amount of people (especially Black young men) in South Dallas are formerly incarcerated or in some form of the justice system. Especially during the late 80&#x27;s during the height of the crack epidemic. So they&#x27;re not legally allowed to carry anyway.')
