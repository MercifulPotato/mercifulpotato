Merely being polite, positive and listening and not screwing the other over, sure makes sense to be generous about that to many people.<p>But in many cases compassion may mean self sacrifice: time, money, effort etc. It&#x27;s fine to expect something back, at least not being mean or more demanding to you or sour about why you didn&#x27;t do more. There are toxic people like that that you better not help. You can learn it the hard way. Maybe it can be communicated better, but in many cases people are predisposed to see you as a threat. If you offer to help, they think you do it as a scheme to help yourself and screw them. And they will fume even years afterwards that you somehow screwed them over when you genuinely helped them. That you didn&#x27;t help enough, that you were selfish etc.<p>You need to choose who you spend your finite energy on. Not every person in a bad place is some idealized angel who is thirsty for your help and will be grateful.')
