Or, Rust could still very possibly fizzle. That would be the normal course of events for a new language, barring a miracle as was dispensed to Javascript, Java, C++, and vanishingly few others.<p>Will Dart survive and thrive? Kotlin? Scala? Clojure? Go? All doubtful, based on prior experience. Having a lot of code and a lot of users does not seem to suffice. Many other languages had those, and faded. Ada even had $billions in backing, and faded.<p>What we can say confidently about Rust&#x27;s future is that it is not certain to fade. The miracle has come in less deserving cases.')
