And because the foam is mostly air you can get rid of quite a lot of it before the solution becomes completely saturated.  This solution can be used as a sealant, or to fill molds and produce plastic parts, although it&#x27;s advisable to use a vacuum chamber to recycle your solvent and help with the degassing.')
