In practice, however, there&#x27;s a lot of subsidization from other sources: one RA is on work-study, maybe another one working for course credit (only), and some of the grad students and postdocs have individual fellowships.<p>This really sucks: it makes it very hard to hire&#x2F;keep experienced people who aren&#x27;t bringing in their own money and there are fewer and fewer opportunities for those people (a lot of fellowships now cut off at &lt;5 years post-PhD).<p>In the grand scheme of things, this churn can&#x27;t actually be that cost-efficient and if I ran the NIH, this is one of the first things I would change: you&#x27;d get better research while taking some of the strain off the job market.')
