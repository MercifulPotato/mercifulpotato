Your argument is akin to saying &quot;freedom from hearing uncomfortable opinions&quot; benefits more people than &quot;freedom of expression&quot; does.<p>On the broader level, I got to experience healthcare in the US both as a broke-ass immigrant child and as a working adult. It ranged from good to amazing in terms of availability of appointments, treatments, quality and comfort. Night and day beyond what I experienced in the USSR as a kid. So while people are shitting on the system we have, many people find it excellent and amazing and we like the freedom to continue enjoying it.')
