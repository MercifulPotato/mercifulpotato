After some point, it started to seem to us that maybe academics just found this topic and our results too threatening. Maybe this paper simply was not politically correct.<p>It looks like the only reason to believe the reasons for rejecting the paper were political is that it was rejected by many venues. Note that having different reviewers give different feedback is par for the course.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t think this is serious. Having one&#x27;s paper rejected, stings, but it happens to everyone and all the time. There&#x27;s no reason to see hidden motives behind it. The paper not being very good is sufficient explanation.<p>Not that it doesn&#x27;t happen for papers to be rejected because they threaten <i>a reviewer&#x27;s</i> work. But to claim that the entire <i>academic establishment</i> is threatened by a paper and <i>that&#x27;s</i> why it was rejected? Sounds a bit far-fetched.')
