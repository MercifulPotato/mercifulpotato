It is interesting to me that you called out these three things specifically having encountered them all myself.<p>I agree also that it is a result of having poor DI support from the language.<p>I also like your point about PHP users using Golang. The approach Golang uses towards serving web content is very similar to me to how initial PHP frameworks did it.<p>Go tends to make it easy to setup concurrent things occurring, and so I&#x27;ve found myself spending a fair amount of time speculating on what is thread safe and what isn&#x27;t.<p>No matter how much I see it I still do a double take when I see globals in Go modules. Seems like a bad practice to me.')
