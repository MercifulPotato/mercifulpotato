We’re talking, maybe, 100 different “Celsius” values.<p>If there’s no memory for that, do multiplication by 9&#x2F;5 the way it’s done in Bresenham’s line algorithm  (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bresenham&#x27;s_line_algorithm)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bresenham&#x27;s_line_algorithm)</a>. If you start at zero Celsius = 32 Fahrenheit, that’s 50 steps, at most. Might not be (much) smaller than a lookup table, though.<p>Precomputing the steps for each degree Celsius difference and storing each in a single bit (a one degree change in Celsius will increase degrees Fahrenheit by either 1 or 2) might be the most memory-efficient approach. For a 100 degree Celsius range that’s a 50 bits table (starting at the center of the range). Edit: even that may be too large. That table will repeat every 9 bits, so one byte almost is enough. It might be a struggle to make that a net gain, given the more complex conversion code, though.')
