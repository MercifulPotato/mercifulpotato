If traffic adjacent to Google ads dried up, so would the value proposition of Google&#x27;s products to its advertising customers. In this way, users collectively could exercise leverage on Google and its advertising clients by boycotting sites&#x2F;services that serve Google ads (though good luck organizing that).')
