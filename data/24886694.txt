Blocking Iranian IPs, as opposed to accounts, is almost certainly over-compliance. Note that the vast majority of websites do not do this. Even big ones, such as Gmail, do not do this.<p>I can tell you for certain that at least AWS and Atlassian do that.<p>I learned that while surfing from an IP address which was mistakenly associated with being located in Iran. I only discovered that, because said websites weren&#x27;t available. As I got that fixed quite fast afterwards I haven&#x27;t done more browsing, that&#x27;s why I can only name these two companies, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there are much more big companies doing such blocking based on IP address geolocation.')
