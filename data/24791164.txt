There&#x27;s a Chomsky quote that fits here:<p>&gt;&gt; The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrumâ€”even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there&#x27;s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.<p>That <i>sounds</i> bad, but I wonder how Chomsky would feel if that wasn&#x27;t the case and the &quot;spectrum of acceptable opinion&quot; included stuff like literal Nazism.')
