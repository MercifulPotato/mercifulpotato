You have GHz signals running reliably on circuit boards with multiple layers. Getting those to work is another very specialised skill.<p>So it would quite something to find someone who had a professional-level understanding of all the levels: from silicon chemistry and quantum physics at one extreme, to electromagnetic design, to all the different levels of electronic design, to binary machine language and processor architectures, to OS design and application software, to all the various data structures and encodings that make all of the above useful.')
