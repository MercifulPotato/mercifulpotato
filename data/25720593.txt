They&#x27;re simpler to design but require more expensive and stronger materials.<p>A 3 phase motor can be simple and cheap if it&#x27;s the induction motor used in something like a forklift but EVs need more power and efficiency and have a much greater duty cycle.  The Tesla Model 3 uses a switched reluctance partial permanent magnet motor and an induction motor in the dual motor, the Nissan Leaf uses a synchronous electric motor, the BMW i3 uses a synchronous permanent magnet motor, the VW ID.3 uses a permanent magnet brushless motor.')
