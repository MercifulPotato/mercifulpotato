An alkaline solution (often lye or sodium hydroxide) induces saponification [...]<p>i.e. that&#x27;s the <i>usual</i> process, and it <i>often</i> involves lye. (It elsewhere mentions potassium hydroxide too.)<p>Anyway my point really wasn&#x27;t too disagree about how to make soap, I&#x27;ve never done it, it just seemed weird to me to tell someone how they made something and that it&#x27;s a problem, vs. &#x27;Did you use lye? If so...&#x27; or even &#x27;Assuming you used lye, ...&#x27;<p>For example, I think what you call &#x27;commercial dish soap&#x27; I would call &#x27;washing up liquid&#x27; (never soap, not would it cross my mind if someone else said &#x27;soap&#x27;) so a slightly different conversation could easily have been based on a wrong assumption about what the created thing was or was used for.')
