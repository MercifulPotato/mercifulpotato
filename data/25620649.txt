If I just need Street names, fine. If I need to search for any business address, it sucks. I still need Google Maps on my device.<p>You say &quot;contributors need to add addresses...&quot; but this is so unintuitive that it&#x27;s simply not going to happen in over 99% of cases. I say this as someone who really believes in the cause and who therefore makes up the 1% that <i>would</i> be willing to spend the time improving the data. (I still buy digital music and manually add my own mood&#x2F;instrument tags, if you want a &#x27;for instance&#x27;)<p>So why don&#x27;t I? Case in point: I wanted directions to a restaurant that opened near me about 2 years ago. Couldn&#x27;t find it. So I walked there, ordered my food and while waiting for it to be served, manually navigated to the map position and found the previous restaurant was still listed. As far as I could see, there was no way for me to edit the map entry within OsmAnd. As an interested party, willing to invest some initial setup and learning time, and ongoing edit time of a minute or two, I completely failed. There&#x27;s nothing in the UI to even hint at how to edit the address. A &#x27;regular user&#x27; isn&#x27;t even going to bother trying.<p>At this rate, the world will change much faster than the OSM data.')
