Maybe we could create timers that automatically break a deadlock after a certain number of seconds, and&#x2F;or put the lock explicitly under program control (like the FD&#x27;s for pipes), etc., etc.<p>Anyway, some fascinating stuff!<p>&gt;&quot;Although I think richer pipelines make sense, structured data will probably come first:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structured-Data-in-Oil" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Structured-Data-in-Oil</a>&quot;<p>Looks like you&#x27;ve been doing your homework! &lt;g&gt;')
