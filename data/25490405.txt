Vinoth Kumar (mentioned in the article) uploaded a PoC text file which could then be downloaded over HTTP.<p>His screenshot has the repo name redacted, but if SolarWinds accidentally included their code-publishing credentials, maybe the signing key for their code was also in that repo at some point? I&#x27;ve seen that kind of thing before, even if I had to grep through old commits to find it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;vinodsparrow&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338431183588188160" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;vinodsparrow&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338431183588188160</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Andrew___Morris&#x2F;status&#x2F;1338614208905302021&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Andrew___Morris&#x2F;status&#x2F;13386142089053020...</a>')
