But I doubt that any government willing to abuse this &quot;opportunity&quot; will give a fuck about that. Don&#x27;t underestimate the power (and disruptive) effects of being able to practically disable a whole brand of popular computer hardware. Heck, even the ability to threaten with it (privately, through diplomatic channels) can (and probably should) be considered a serious weapon. So yeah .. &quot;thank you&quot; Apple.')
