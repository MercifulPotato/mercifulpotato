Why are some places better off than others? Why can&#x27;t that success be replicated?<p>Even if dethroning the current power structure does not happen, the ordinary people can still live increasingly comfortable lives as to make the differences practically irrelevant.<p>Look at the comforts we have access to now. Unprecedented in the history of humankind. Sure, not everyone has a private jet, but everyone can fly. Not everyone can eavesdrop on any conversation in the world, but everyone can have conversations all over the world. We may not have access to military satellites that can peer through buildings, but we do have Google Earth.<p>You speak of factories and production lines. What if they&#x27;re all run by robots? Or better, everyone has a 3D printer in their kitchen that can just build an iPhone 42 right there?<p>How about matter replicators? Cloning pods? Medical immortality? Terraforming and colonizing multiple planets? With everything powered by an endless supply of fusion energy.<p>Nevermind if all that will be possible any time soon. Cyberpunk gets carried away with pessimistic predictions. I just think there&#x27;s room for a genre of fiction that runs with optimistic prediction.')
