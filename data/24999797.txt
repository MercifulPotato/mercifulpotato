I would guess that most individuals would agree it&#x27;s immoral regardless of where you are on the political spectrum albeit for possibly different reasons.<p>This is like making a movie about why dog fighting is bad and having a movie poster depicting dog fighting in a glamorous light but then having to watch the movie to show that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a problem.

I know the whole &#x27;save the children&#x27; is overused now but this is actually a situation where children really should be protected, and I as parent shouldn&#x27;t have them assaulted by this.')
