Sky is blue.\n2. Previous statement is True.\n3. Previous statement is True.<p>And ask you &#x27;Is Statement 3 is True or False?&#x27;. You would say &#x27;First I need to know what &#x27;previous&#x27; refers to&#x27;, so you would do pronoun substitution for the word &#x27;Previous&#x27; in Statement 3:<p>3. &#x27;Previous statement is True&#x27; is True.<p>Since this statement has an unresolved pronoun, you would do pronoun substitution for the word &#x27;Previous&#x27; in Statement 2:<p>3. &#x27;&#x27;Sky is blue&#x27; statement is True&#x27; is True.<p>Since there are no more unresolved pronouns, you would evaluate the statement &#x27;Sky is blue&#x27;, and then the next Statement 2, and finally Statement 3, and say &#x27;Yes, Statement 3 is True&#x27;. So far, so good ?<p>Now, suppose I say:<p>1. This statement is False.<p>And ask you &#x27;Is Statement 1 True or False?&#x27;. You would say &#x27;First I need to know what &#x27;This&#x27; refers to&#x27;, so you would do pronoun substitution for the word &#x27;This&#x27; in Statement 1:<p>1. &#x27;This statement is False&#x27; statement is False.<p>Since this statement has an unresolved pronoun (&#x27;This&#x27;), you would do pronoun substitution again.<p>- &#x27;&#x27;This statement is False&#x27; statement is False&#x27; statement is False.<p>Since this statement has an unresolved pronoun (&#x27;This&#x27;), you would do pronoun substitution once more.<p>- &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;This statement is False&#x27; statement is False&#x27; statement is False&#x27; statement is False&#x27;<p>And you will keep doing pronoun substitutions forever since statements with unresolved pronouns cannot have a True&#x2F;False property.<p>I find this teenage-girl-at-a-rock-concert-feigned-fascination with self-referential &#x27;paradoxes&#x27; silly.')
