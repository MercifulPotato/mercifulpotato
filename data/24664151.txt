Think about how long the GFC was brewing before the stock market took a hit.  You could see the problems for years, but it wasn&#x27;t until the fall of Lehman, AIG, etc that people really began to panic sell.<p>Bankruptcy is the one situation where buy-and-hold doesn&#x27;t work.  So until we start seeing large bankruptcies, I doubt the stock market will really panic.  And let&#x27;s be honest, the likelihood of any of the top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 going bankrupt right now is nil.  And that&#x27;s &gt;25% of the total value of the index right now.')
