It would, obviously, be good for AMD; I don&#x27;t see that it would make it competitive in perf per watt terms, though.<p>&gt; e.g. they seem to have speeded up handling of reference counting through architectural changes<p>They have, but that wouldn&#x27;t be relevant to (most) synthetic benchmarks, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought. SpecInt2017 won&#x27;t be doing much if any reference counting, for instance :) The M1&#x27;s advantage in ObjC and Swift should be expected to be even greater than its advantage in &#x27;normal&#x27; (ie C) code, but beyond refcounting microbenchmarks I don&#x27;t think there are many tools to demonstrate that (and the vast bulk of performance-sensitive code running on MacOS is C&#x2F;C++ anyway).')
