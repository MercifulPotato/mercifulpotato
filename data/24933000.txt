Why attack Wayland? X.Org works, it would probably work for another 10 years, XWayland maybe 20 years. If X.Org is such a marvel surely someone would maintain it.<p>Because most people are dependent on distributions to provide them with a standardised setup, packages and security updates, and few distros have proven willing to support more than one option for a component as central and dominant as the display server. Sysvinit also works, und unlike Xorg doesn&#x27;t even have the problem that graphics hardware will eventually leave it behind; and yet, it is now basically impossible to avoid systemd and its many tentacles if you want a mainstream-compatible Linux experience with timely security patches, because its proponents have successfully persuaded every major distro to adopt it <i>and drop everything it replaced</i>. Wayland, unfortunately, is not willing to exist as just another option until it has reached feature parity with X11; rather, it is competing with it for a limited resource (distro support) <i>now</i>, and poised to go in for the killing choke.')
