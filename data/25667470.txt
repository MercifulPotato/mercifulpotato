Can you elaborate on this Michigan county?<p>Isn&#x27;t it the case that when votes are hand counted they match pretty darn close the &quot;machine without auditable source code&quot; results?  As someone from outside the US the entire US election process seems like a sad joke but I guess those machines were bought under some sort of commercial contract from some sort of private company and presumably as part of that deal the source code isn&#x27;t available to the public.  But it seems that when the machine says X won and you like X then it&#x27;s great and when it says Y won and you don&#x27;t like Y then it&#x27;s a faulty&#x2F;irregular process?  Is &quot;someone questioned it&quot; really a bar?  Isn&#x27;t there always someone who will question everything?<p>I&#x27;m sure the tech behind the machines that count the votes is actually quite boring.  Next time you vote for someone I guess make sure you vote for someone who is going to stipulate in the contract that the source code is available to the public?  Is that gonna shut up the people yelling conspiracy?')
