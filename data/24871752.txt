I&#x27;m one.  I do not have time in my life for every opinion poll that calls me to take 5 or 10 or 20 minutes of my time.  Even more so when some of them are push polls.  No.  Just go away.  You&#x27;ll find out what I think when I vote.<p>Now, do people like me lean one way?  &quot;Get out of my face and leave me alone&quot; people might plausibly lean toward Trump, but I wouldn&#x27;t be dogmatic about it.  Even more, I wouldn&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s statistically significant.<p>Second, you said:<p>&gt;  It is completely unreasonable to postulate that the effect would be drastically bigger this year, after four years of Trump actually being in power and normalizing his status.<p>Um, what?  We&#x27;ve had four years of the media relentlessly telling us how stupid, evil, and wrong Trump is, and how stupid and racist all his supporters are.  We&#x27;ve seen the media twist the facts to support this narrative.  (Yes, Trump does so also.  That&#x27;s not the point.)  I would be astonished if there aren&#x27;t a bunch of Trump supporters who aren&#x27;t going to tell pollsters what they think.  (No, I can&#x27;t prove it.  Even if it&#x27;s true, I can&#x27;t quantify it.  But I bet that they&#x27;re out there, and that there are a lot of them.)')
