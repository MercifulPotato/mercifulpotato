Predicting the future is complicated and I think GMO understands the fundamentals and macroeconomics very well. They are directionally correct most of the time and for the right reasons, so I&#x27;ll listen to what they have to say.<p>But I also don&#x27;t think their predictions have sufficiently precise timing to beat the market.
