According to the benchmarks and real-world tests, I&#x27;d gain quite a bit in performance over my Ryzen build, with a fraction of the power consumption which is currently 120W idle, 310W maxed out as measured by my UPS. Per real world tests, the M1 mini never goes above ~35W and stays cool and quiet even when maxed out on stress tests. Given the fact I no longer play games much at all beyond WoW and a few indie titles, and my non-gaming workflow is 100% doable on macOS, I&#x27;m sorely tempted to switch even with my reservations about Apple as a company.<p>&gt; <i>...especially one which can&#x27;t even play most games.</i><p>No one buys a Mac for AAA games, that&#x27;s a fact and probably won&#x27;t change immediately. With that said, Blizzard has day one native Apple Silicon support for WoW, and the benchmarks indicate the performance (depending on the game engine) sits somewhere between the GeForce 1650 and 1660 for most of the games tested so far. That covers pretty much all non-AAA titles on the performance side, leaving portability as the only real issue. I&#x27;ve seen tests done with Steam games and most macOS native x86_64 games make the transition via Rosetta2 quite nicely.<p>Not to mention, M1 Macs can now run most iOS apps natively which opens up a horde of games to the platform immediately, including popular titles like Minecraft, Fortnite, and CoD.')
