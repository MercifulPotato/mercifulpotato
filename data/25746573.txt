And that explicit decision is what is jarring to people who value privacy.<p>Of course they both <i>have</i> microphones hooked to data centers, but the Alexas&#x2F;Echos are almost worthless without the microphone enabled. Many people I know have turned off listening for trigger words on their phone.<p>That being said, I have a HomePod that I have to manually press the touch button on top for it to listen. I use it for music, an occasional family conference call and occasional for generic assistant stuff like weather.<p>I tried a Google Home but couldn&#x27;t get it configured in that mode -- listen on physical touch only (that was 3-4 years ago). And doubly couldn&#x27;t get it setup without deep integration into a google account. The HomePod complains occasionally that it can&#x27;t answer because it hasn&#x27;t been personalized to an account, but is otherwise totally fine operating without access to my every inner thought (web&#x2F;location history, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m just as concerned about every modern car essentially being a microphone hooked to a datacenter on wheels. And new TVs. And a few refrigerators and kids toys. And light switches. At least phones (well iPhones -- haven&#x27;t used the last few Android versions) are easy to setup without listening enabled. And on iPhones it&#x27;s opt-in during the setup process (the Siri checkbox is default on, but you are prompted to decide with no other confusing decisions on the screen at the same time).')
