They had a French teacher invigilating a biology test, and he didn&#x27;t care at all. In the end, &quot;every one&quot; was working together, the solutions were written on the blackboard, and every one passed with flying colour, most of them with the same copy since they basically straight copied the blackboard. Of course, the test was redone (with a different invigilator) since the cheating was so obvious.<p>I am not sure how the Australian professor managed to get students to fail in these conditions. Either most of the students were inept and couldn&#x27;t even cheat properly or the good students didn&#x27;t want to share their answers.<p>After reading the linked list, that seems to be the case, the chat was monitored and the best students didn&#x27;t want to share their answers. I think it works fine until someone cross the invisible line, and then widespread cheating ensues. In my case it was also high school vs university.')
