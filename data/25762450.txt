I think the piling-on is a short term thing, between a violent event and the expectation of violence two weeks later. Nobody wants to be the channel on which a serious event happens on inauguration day.<p>I expect that following the 20th, Parler or its sequel will open on Amazon or Azure or whatever, and nobody will really think much about it. The immediate threat of violence will subside, and people will go back to the ordinary sniping at one another. Mostly on Facebook and Twitter, who will go back to being very lenient in their moderation policies. (And people will complain about oppression every time they&#x27;re moderated against, but not enough to stoke a mass exodus.)<p>Mind you, it&#x27;s cheap to simply predict &quot;people will forget&quot; and be right 99% of the time. But there&#x27;s a similar countervailing trend to go &quot;this time, it&#x27;s different&quot; with every significant event. I&#x27;ve watched enough of them come and go to want to remind everybody, &quot;Maybe, but probably not&quot;.')
