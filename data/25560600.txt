Follow orders or be destroyed. They will kill a billion people without a second thought and then kill each other. Tyranny and authoritarianism is extremely brutal way of life. It sees people as a commodity, something to be ground up and made money out of as you saw in covid. Make a big list of your own people you want dead. Equip them with sticks, and death march them into starvation outside an enemy village. Then massacre that village. That&#x27;s how tyrants fight.<p>Our fight concerns morals. Things like:<p>- Power is subject to the same law.<p>- Orders that demand perfection are not laws because power is imperfect.<p>- Instead of command economy, you must convince people and create the consumer demand first.<p>- Wealth does not concentrate and instead tends to accelerate bad habits.<p>- It&#x27;s better to just walk away. Bad things are going to happen no matter what you do. Trying to control everything just makes it worse.')
