It supports immediate mode graphics for example and use of native UI components including existing HWND, GtkWidget, NSView, etc. based ones.<p>As of other non UI parts of Qt... Sciter does not provide all that beauty, yes. Host application (C&#x2F;C++, Go, Rust, etc) that uses Sciter UI layer is free to use whatever libraries&#x2F;runtime they prefer, and usually each runtime is superior to what Qt provides.<p>That&#x27;s the cornerstone idea of its design - it is <i>embeddable</i> UI layer. While Qt is a foundation (a.k.a. framework) similar to MFC, Gtk and other frameworks.<p>At early stages of C++ having things like CList &amp; Co did make sense. But not in recent 10 years. Yet I am silent about Go, Rust, Python and other languages &#x2F; runtimes that use Sciter.')
