Charging all movies the same is ridiculous and just totally counter to all reality about their audience. We have fast food and gourmet, why wouldn&#x27;t we have that with cinema too?<p>I suppose I could be reluctantly convinced to part with $5 or $10 for the latest predictable comic book CGI-fest. I&#x27;ll pay much more for Fincher, or anyone else I actually respect. Trying to charge the same for mass-market lowest-common-denominator marvel or transformers nonsense as something aimed for the <i>sniff</i> art crowd <i>sniff</i> just sounds unsustainable. There needs to be a free-floating price, just like any other product with different markets.')
