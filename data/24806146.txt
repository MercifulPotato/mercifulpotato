I grew up with a Christian background but at young age (I remember questioning it at the age of 5-6) decided I wouldn&#x27;t devote my life to it. Nowadays, I recognize many of the lessons shared&#x2F;taught through these stories, and I wonder if my children are going to be better off with or without them. At the very least, they&#x27;ll still get similar lessons from Disney.')
