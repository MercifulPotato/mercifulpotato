But the context is what you are comparing it to. I think boxed wines (Bota Box mostly) easily beats most 10-20 dollar bottles (reds) at &lt;1&#x2F;5 the cost. If you are comparing it to a 20-50 dollar bottle, yah, you are right.<p>Also, your comment is US centric. I lived in Italy for several years and the boxed wine was fantastic. Same quality as bottled, fixes the issues presented, and viewed as better for the environment.')
