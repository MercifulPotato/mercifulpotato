What the Germans and Japanese did was of a scale and brutality that had not been inflicted in &#x27;civilized&#x27; warfare for centuries.  And neo-nazis are a thing now, and they&#x27;re not nice.  When I last donned a lorica and hefted a scutum the most political thing we debated was whether Keens looked enough like caligae to be allowed on the field.<p>Time also plays a factor in these things- I&#x27;ve never known anyone who fought the Romans.  If I had a great-uncle Camulos telling me what bastards they were, maybe I&#x27;d write an article lambasting Great Battles of Caesar.<p>I graduated 10 years before you, so no idea how history is taught now.')
