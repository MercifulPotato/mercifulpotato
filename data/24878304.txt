A relatively small number of oil company executives with a profit motive are going to make this decision for everyone, directly and indirectly.<p>&#x27;Doing stuff&#x27;, as you say, involves governments of the people heavily regulating the most powerful corporations on the planet to ensure they can&#x27;t make this decision in the wrong direction.<p>Government action in this direction hasn&#x27;t happened for the last 30 years, and doesn&#x27;t look close to happening in the present.<p>As such, it&#x27;s reasonable for climate change activists to make plans to meet the market where it&#x27;s at and prioritise competitive renewable products above nuclear.')
