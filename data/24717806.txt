For example, you have many libraries adding measurement units for Haskell, and many libraries doing linear algebra. But you won&#x27;t find too many people doing linear algebra with measurement units, because the types of intermediate results explode too much (e.g. a type-safe unit-of-measurement matrix multiplication of 3x3 matrices has 18 type parameters, with complicated restrictions between them).')
