On a (primarily) Linux PC, I was having trouble with a game via Wine&#x2F;Proton and thought I&#x27;d give Win10 a shot.<p>Installed Win10 to a separate HDD, activated it, and (completely) disconnected it from the Net.  Worked fine for a few days (weeks?) but then one day it announced it was installing a BIOS update. Without asking.  And no way to Cancel that or somehow tell it to &quot;DO NOT DO THIS&quot;.<p>Note - At no point had it had an internet connection after it was activated.  So the BIOS update must have been downloaded and scheduled at that time.<p>This totally trashed my main Linux install, which uses full disk encryption and custom MOK certificates for booting.<p><i>Not Happy</i>.<p>That being said, I have reasonable backups.  So it was more of an incredulous PITA and reminder that &quot;MS can go fuck themselves&quot;, than a data loss event.')
