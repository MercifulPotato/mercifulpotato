No challenges in court? No protests and riots? After the year we&#x27;ve had?<p>And if, on January 6, as Congress was meeting to confirm the Electoral College vote for Trump, a riotous mob had stormed the Capitol and disrupted proceedings for a few hours, would it have been reported the same way? Would left-wing activist social media accounts be getting deplatformed?<p>It didn&#x27;t happen. Might not have. But if it did, would you be calling it a coup? Would you be so disturbed about the attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power?<p>I&#x27;m not defending what happened. I&#x27;m asking, if it were reversed, how would you feel. Be honest.')
