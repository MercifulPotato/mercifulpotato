How many channels does your respective computers support?  Do you have enough RAM installed so all channels are in use?  Are you able to do a RAM bandwidth test by some other means to verify?<p>Another possibility is that for some reason the base latency is just different between your machines.   A commenter added a pointer-chasing variation of Daniel&#x27;s test on his blog.  Maybe run this to find the full latency and see how the times differ?<p>Finally, there was one more commenter on the blog who reported anomalously fast times on a Windows laptop.  It&#x27;s possible there is a bug with Daniel&#x27;s time measurements on windows.')
