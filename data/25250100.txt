I would have liked to have a reason to use something more classy, but that’s how it goes.<p>I appreciate your reply, and I apologize for being an asshole. I’ll take this with me as I try to be less of an asshole going forward, if you search my history it may look like I never learn, but I’m always trying :)<p>At work someone got annoyed with the phrase assume good intentions, and proposed an alternative: ask compassionate questions. I’ve been thinking a lot about this and I will try to do that next time I start making assumptions or before I blow my lid on a stranger, and it shouldn’t matter that you’re obviously a decent person, but I still appreciate it.')
