To me that&#x27;s a sign of insecurity and&#x2F;or a trauma reaction to some past person who was overbearing.</i><p>I can&#x27;t recall ever meeting even one person who didn&#x27;t get somewhat scarred over the fact that he&#x2F;she disagreed with the majority of the people around them [at least once in their lives]. That insecurity, as you call it, is IMO present in most people these days. Whether it&#x27;s a trauma or not though, I can&#x27;t argue in an informed manner.<p>But I do believe it&#x27;s a very normal trait of all social animals. There always comes one point where the collective shows you, usually through the medium of violence (physical or emotional), that they don&#x27;t appreciate you thinking or acting differently.<p>&gt; <i>For me, true independent thinking comes from listening to others without judgment and choosing for myself. Positive attachment and negative attachment are both attachment.</i><p>I only knew two such people who were able to be genuinely completely detached and they indeed didn&#x27;t care who thought what. But they were almost dead inside, to me watching on the side at least. They also had almost no desires of their own. I didn&#x27;t envy them at all, I actually thought they were sick.<p>Your statement reminds me of a Buddhist teaching but if memory serves, one of their proverbial wise men said that this is an ideal to strive towards knowing that you will <i>never</i> truly reach it. And that&#x27;s a good thing. Complete lack of attachment would make me think something is seriously wrong with you. So I interpreted that advice -- &quot;don&#x27;t get attached&quot; -- more along the lines of &quot;don&#x27;t burden yourself with things you can&#x27;t change or which would take too much energy or time to change; just let go and give yourself in to the things you genuinely care about&quot; -- something along those lines.<p>All of this is obviously my opinion based on life experience and observations, of course. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of presenting myself as a psychologist or a psychiatrist.<p>---<p>Outside of this small paragraph of yours I found myself nodding my head at the entirety of your comment and I agree completely with it.')
