They found your work interesting and complemented on your visualizations.<p>If I could suggest something, it might be useful to reach out to professors at your local university whose research interests coincides with your software&#x27;s application (you can shop around as well).<p>They can probably help you with the following:<p>1. Provide cutting-edge technology and ideas related to transportation engineering<p>2. Offer a method&#x2F;connection to the local DOT or other agencies who may be interested in this as a decision support system (DSS).<p>3. Maybe even find a partner or... (and I think this might be a better option) help you establish a steering committee or a group of advisors who can then make recommendations to supplement your skillsets.<p>You might even be able to temporarily support your open source model through grant funding and application to different &quot;cutting-edge&quot; applied projects and, if you can, develop those technology in a generalizable way (a framework) to be used as a shiny feature for your application.  Grow it up to be a one-stop-shop with the latest and greatest.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to discuss a bit more to help you navigate these waters.<p>Cheers,<p>Don<p>P.S. regarding finding a partner for the business side, what might be useful is to reach out to the local universities in your area and see if their business college&#x2F;program has a &quot;founders meet-and-greet&quot; program.  At our current institution we have programs in place to connect founders with a business counterpart which has resulted in establishing some growing companies.  In addition, you can probably take this opportunity to network with a few professors and (as an advisor) be willing to put their name to the product for technical knowledge&#x2F;support.')
