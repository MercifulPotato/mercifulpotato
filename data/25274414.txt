If laws oblige you to pay taxes you are obliged to pay wether they have been collected or not. Not much different from a crime being a crime wether you are caught or not. Unless of course there&#x27;s also a law that states an equivalent of &quot;taxes not collected within the first $n $timeunit are waived&quot;.')
