I guess I didn&#x27;t make that leap because I find that embedded ML isn&#x27;t what I imagined in this type of scenario. I would assume you&#x27;d invest more heavily in power usage to make the mesh sensor network fast&#x2F;resilient.<p>A &quot;base station&quot; with connectivity for alerting and utility power at the edge of the sensor network is where I imagine any ML to run, and that could power your typical CUDA-capable GPU if necessary.<p>I guess that&#x27;s still edge ML if the point is to not backhaul everything to a datacenter somewhere, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it embedded.<p>That brought mind low powered devices with many sensors or sensors that capture more local data (i.e. microphones, cameras) vs. just an anemometer, GPS, and chemical ppm.')
