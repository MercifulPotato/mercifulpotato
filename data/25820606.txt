But that&#x27;s a lot like looking for the One True Car. Motor vehicles have to perform in many different conditions, and these conditions greatly affect how different kinds of cars will perform. You wouldn&#x27;t send a sedan over a logging road in Winter. You wouldn&#x27;t race a Jeep in the F1. You wouldn&#x27;t drive a Cobra in Vancouver 9 months of the year (when it&#x27;s raining). You wouldn&#x27;t haul a ton of gravel in a Civic.<p>The cowboys, the wizards, the preachers, the boffins... They all have valid points covering different aspects of the problems we have to solve in the real world. They all have their place, and the pragmatic engineer evaluates them without prejudice in order to find a reasonably good solution to the problem at hand while keeping things decently clean (or cleanable) for the future.<p>Like in everything else, there are best practices, and these best practices evolve over time because it&#x27;s a complicated subject that none of the competing schools of thought have mastered completely within their domain.<p>I for one celebrate the cross-pollination.')
