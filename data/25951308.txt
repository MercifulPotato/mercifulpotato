Item(by='JumpCrisscross', descendants=None, kids=[25951426], score=None, time=1611878184, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25951086, text='&gt; <i>why are we operating near-real-time settlement systems for securities if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate such risks?</i><p>The firms that provided instantaneous-seeming settlement got the orders. And settlement failures were rare and correlated enough that avoiding them wasn&#x27;t a differentiator. Then we got centralized clearinghouses and deposit insurance and the risk fell so far into the background that it&#x27;s entirely novel to many market participants today.<p>&gt; <i>why these transactions aren&#x27;t being netted and conducted as close to real-time as possible</i><p>It is technically difficult. It provides less room for correcting errors. And because real-time payment rails are fundamentally more expensive than batched rails, and if your payments aren&#x27;t in sync with your settlement you&#x27;ve got a credit component somewhere.<p>&gt; <i>seems like a significant vulnerability</i><p>It does, but I don&#x27;t think it is. Clearinghouses spread risk across a lot of people. They also help early identify daisy-chains, <i>e.g.</i> a single broker sold ten shares to ten brokers who then sold it to ten more fifty times and that single broker hasn&#x27;t settled yet, and loops, <i>e.g.</i> I owe you and you owe Larry and Larry owes Bob and Bob owes me, of settlement risk. That&#x27;s why Dodd-Frank moved many derivatives onto centralized clearinghouses.<p>That said, we&#x27;ve only had these since the 1970s. Counterfactual: we didn&#x27;t have the technology to do this until the 1970s.')
