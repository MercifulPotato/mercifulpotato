The primitives it has compose very poorly. There are too many ways to do the same thing, each with their own weird quirks. Sometimes it&#x27;s really hard to get it to render something simple. I mean... Just centering something on the screen is needlessly complicated. I wish CSS was more like a programming language, with a minimal set of primitives that are nicely composable, instead of 1000 bells and whistles that go in every direction.')
