Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603908704, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917443, text='<i>&gt; Oh, I&#x27;ve never experienced it, because I&#x27;m one of those new-tab spammers. That&#x27;s baffling, but I shield myself from this already. I think I open even more stuff in a new tab, because for years now, one can&#x27;t count on a correct behavior of the back button. I would like a browser to just restore fully the state of the page as it was, without firing any events whatsoever.</i><p>Hmm. I wonder if it is possible to create an extension that accomplished that with a brute force approach, by doing the following:<p>+ If a link is going to another domain, open it in a new tab, and <i>hide</i> the current tab without closing it.<p>+ Clicking the back button closes the new tab and unhides the original tab.<p>That ought to sidestep the effort needed to preserve and restore the state of the original page (which I&#x27;ve found unreliable), by only manipulating it&#x27;s visibility.<p>Of course, hiding&#x2F;revealing a single tab with an extension may not be possible, a cursory search doesn&#x27;t give much encouragement (I suppose there are too many ways to abuse such an API). A workaround might be moving the tab to a hidden window (which is, now that I think of it, a common pattern for intrusive advertising) and back, instead.')
