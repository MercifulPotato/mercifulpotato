There&#x27;s multiple access levels, permissions, etc. exactly geared for that. When you&#x27;re dealing with a trusted, invite-only group, you don&#x27;t need many (if any) moderation features. Then, Slack shines for its ability to have organized, opt-in discussion. I really hate that you can&#x27;t leave text channels on Discord.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to move friend groups more towards Slack and it&#x27;s been a huge improvement over group texts &#x2F; Facebook chat &#x2F; etc.<p>(of course, for our gaming group, discord voice chat is still superb. But, we only use it once a week and all the rest of our chatter&#x2F;discussion happens in our new Slack team)')
