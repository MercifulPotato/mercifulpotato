The issue is with you.  Not every company out there is bad, some are bad, some are good.  They will of course have their challenges, and you can find one to be a member and figure out how to make them better or you can dip out and be on the sideline complaining about how everything sucks.  Go see a therapist, if you can afford to take some time off to decompress and find yourself, so so do.  Best of luck.<p>I&#x27;ve been in tech for far longer, I love it.  We really live in the future, when I see the advances that have been made and stop and really contrast with 20yrs or even 10yrs ago, I&#x27;m very humbled.   We can definitely get better, but things ain&#x27;t as bad as you make it out to be.')
