For example, I have a very small black&#x2F;white&#x2F;red display which takes about six flashes and 15 seconds to complete a display update, but if I put it into black&#x2F;white mode (i.e.: disabling support for red), then the update takes less than a second and only one flash.<p>That might be an option for you if you don’t mind giving up the third color!')
