We finally figured out a quirk with our VPN terminal we sent home with people that was throttling connections, but the experience post-that fix is actually really good. There are a few things that can cause lag (such as moving apps like Chrome&#x2F;Firefox), but for the most part unless your ISP is introducing problems it&#x27;s pretty stable. And everyone with a terminal setup has two monitors, either 2*1920x1200 or 1920x1200+2560x1440.<p>I have a 300Mbps&#x2F;35Mbps plan (turns into a ~250&#x2F;35 on VPN) and it&#x27;s great. We see bandwidth usage ranging from 1Mbps to ~80 on average. The vast majority being sub-20. There are some outliers that end up in mid-100s, but we still need to investigate those.<p>We did some cross country tests with our sister studio ILM over the summer and was hitting ~70-90ms latency which although not fantastic, was still plenty workable.')
