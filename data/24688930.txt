This reminds me of my ideal dream setup.<p>You can spend a down payment of a house on a brand new Mac Book Pro, and the second you plugin a second monitor or &quot;Sidecar&quot; to an iPad screen the fan will go insane with all your Electron apps open. Basically unusable for day-to-day use or annoying.<p>What I really want is in the territory of this demo. Let me just &quot;Maincar&quot; from my iPad (or even iPhone) into a decked out MBP &#x2F; Mac Mini sitting somewhere in my house in a cool spot where it can be as loud as it needs to be.<p>The speed of Sidecar is incredible - so I imagine this will work. This way people can stop dealing with MBP hardware and have a slim quiet quasi-touch setup with the beautiful iPad Pro&#x2F;iPad Magic Keyboard.')
