(On a computer, anti-virus updates too.) How would it know the temperature or stocks as soon as it&#x27;s brought up, even when there&#x27;s no cell service? It&#x27;s pretty common sense.<p>And on iOS and Mac you prominently choose to enroll in analytics when you set up your phone, so the idea of analytics isn&#x27;t a shocker either.
