So, if one gets infected, the others aren&#x27;t. It is similar to the trend of using Virtual Machines to separate areas of concern to try to limit the damage of a rogue process.<p>Genode takes a different approach entirely. Instead of dividing your computer into a few boxes, each of which is subject to any rogue process, it gives each and every process NO access to anything else, except for those things explicitly provided.<p>The analogy I like to use is that of a wallet.<p>The Windows, MacOS, Unix, Linux, etc.. approach is to hand over the users wallet to any program that is running, and hope the program doesn&#x27;t misuse it.  Anything in the wallet (your system) is at risk.<p>The Qubes-OS approach is to do the above, but to have the ability to have more than one wallet, to divide up the risk a tiny bit.<p>The Genode approach is much like a human uses a wallet, you decide what resources are required, and ONLY those resources are at risk.<p>The ease of use is that it is effectively impossible to limit the resources a process can access in other systems, whereas in Genode, it is almost drag and drop.')
