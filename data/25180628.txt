But even cookiecutter based templates on Github do not share a common structure. Even two Python templates may strongly differ in their architecture and design. Most templates are very basic and unfinished. They rarely ship with documentation setups, makefiles, issue templates, extensive continuous integration pipelines and many more best practices No one ensures that these templates adhere to best practices and nothing ensures that any templates updates are applied to already existing projects. It is annoying to bump the version across several configuration files.<p>cookietemple offers powerful project templates for several domains (e.g. command line tools or libraries) for several languages (Python, C++, Java, [...]), which can be created interactively with user choices (cookietemple create). Although, these templates do of course differ due to the different ecosystems, they share common structures and quality. The created project can automatically be pushed to a fresh Github repository. Whenever cookietemple updates a project template, a pull request is automatically submitted against the repository with the latest changes (cookietemple sync) and a custom linter ensures that the project always adheres to cookietemple’s high standards (cookietemple lint). cookietemple bump-version bumps the version across several configurable files and inserts new changelog sections allowing for regular releases.
