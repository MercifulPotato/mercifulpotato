A lot of people don’t really understand the point of testing, but this behavior is pretty far down on the spectrum.<p>The mock is hard to write by hand, so they get sunk cost fallacy and share it between tests. Now the tests are coupled to each other, which makes it hard to change features. But wait, there’s more.<p>They made space for some delegation&#x2F;composition that never arrived or disappeared, and so they’re sharing the same mock across two different test suites, in two different directories. And made very coarse grained commits, so even if I wanted to know how tf they got here, which I really don’t, I’d have trouble doing it.<p>Writing complex scaffolding for your tests <i>is supposed to hurt</i>. Pain is your body telling you something is wrong. If you can’t set the preconditions in a few lines then you don’t understand the problem, or you don’t understand your own code. Both are bad for your coworkers.<p>Big decisions are the culmination of a bunch of little decisions. They are not the little decisions themselves. Don’t write your code like they are, and all of this shit gets ten times easier.')
