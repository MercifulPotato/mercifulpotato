It&#x27;s as if we were biologically wired to trust family more (we might actually be). On paper, Covid precautions are supposed to be as much to protect the other as to protect the self, but much of the relevant behaviour is so little controlled by rational though that we can only control it by tapping into self preservation instincts. And those simply don&#x27;t fire as reliable with family as they do with strangers. I claim that if they have the same risk of being infected, n hours with m strangers is less dangerous than n hours with m family members.<p>It sure looks a bit weird to ask this of people who don&#x27;t work in isolation, but on the other hand it&#x27;s not worse for them than for the WFH crowd. It could even be argued that it&#x27;s worse for the WFH because the customer facing at least still get to interact with humans on a regular basis.')
