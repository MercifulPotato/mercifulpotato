I&#x27;m glad they are staying safe even if it has affected our income substantially. It isn&#x27;t the islander&#x27;s fault the U.S. has been unable to contain the virus for so long. I&#x27;m not sure about the other islands, but for Maui person over 5 years old coming to the island needs a negative test within 72 hours or they will need to quarantine for 14 days. They tried to implement this the past couple months, but changed back to the 14 day requirement.<p>Yes, the quarantine orders were very strict. You could not even go pick up a rental car. You needed a private driver hired. You could not go get groceries. We know of people staying at a hotel that opened the door when a service person knocked to change something. The guest told them they were in quarantine and shut the door. The front desk called within a couple minutes to ask why the door had opened.<p>The locals we&#x27;ve been in contact with have been making the most of it. They have very much enjoyed having the island to themselves. It is (hopefully) a once in a life time opportunity for them.')
