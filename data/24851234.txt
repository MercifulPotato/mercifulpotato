It can  hurt business if you start threatening nunneries and schools, and persistent threats could be considered harassment; get you in trouble.<p>As much as I hate agents, they&#x27;re good for taking flack. You can publicly fire them if they make children cry, etc. You&#x27;ll still want to keep an eye on them but might be worth the disengagement just for general mental-load purposes. Let you focus on direct customers rather than even worrying about infringement.')
