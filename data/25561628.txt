This is the first pet I&#x27;ve ever owned. I thought that I would be able to &quot;love&quot; it the way other people seem to. But I can&#x27;t, and until seeing this article I almost felt like that meant I was sociopathic or something. Sure it&#x27;s cute, but I would also have no hesitation whatsoever in killing it to save the life of a random stranger I&#x27;ve never met. How are you supposed to love something when you feel that way about it? I think the way our relationship toward pets is portrayed, in western society at least, must be extremely unhealthy and immature because of this.')
