Item(by='hnracer', descendants=None, kids=[24696170], score=None, time=1601975881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695590, text='I agree with you that it&#x27;s not a great idea to obsess about genetic differences between races, but what is true is not necessarily the same as what is socially beneficial.<p>It&#x27;s simply a fact that there are important genetic differences between racial groups that manifest as important phenotype differences, and understanding these can help to make sense of the world around us. It&#x27;s no coincidence that people with African genetics dominate sprints and marathons in the Olympics. This happens because they are <i>genetically superior</i>, on average (and this manifests as large differences in extreme performance), at this particular activity compared to other racial groups. Without recognising this, and other, genetic differences, we are left with a thoroughly incomplete understanding of our social reality.')
