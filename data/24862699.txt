By using tools of linear algebra on the adjacency matrices of a graph, you can tell a lot about the structure of the graph.<p>For instance, if A is the adjacency matrix of a graph G, with n vertices (we say &#x27;vertices&#x27; in the math department almost exclusively -- <i>rarely</i> do we say &#x27;nodes&#x27;), and k edges, denoting the trace of A by Tr(A), we can find the number of triangles in A by computing Tr(A^3)&#x2F;6. We can also tell if G is connected by computing A^n. [0]<p>OTOH, the spectrum doesn&#x27;t tell you <i>nearly</i> everything you&#x27;d want to know about a graph.  There are many examples of non-isomorphic graphs that are nonetheless cospectral. For instance, one of my professors from grad school wrote a landmark paper in spectral graph theory in 1973, showing that almost all trees are cospectral. [1]<p>---<p>[0]: Of course, you&#x27;d probably never actually do this, because it&#x27;s horribly inefficient, but here&#x27;s how it goes.<p>First, you prove easily by induction that A^c_{i,j} is the number of paths of length c starting at vertex i and ending at vertex j.  With that in mind, we see that if there is a row of all nonzero numbers in any matrix A^c for c &lt;= n, then G is connected.  With a little more work, you can even extract all the connected components of G, by looking at submatrices of A^c.<p>[1]: Unsurprisingly, the paper is titled &quot;Almost all trees are cospectral&quot;.
