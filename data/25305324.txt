How can you afford to pay 120,000 folks who seem to be focused on being outraged, striking and walking out all the time.<p>I participated in a walkout ONCE when I was much younger, over an issue that was pretty clean cut (this was before me too, things had to go WAY WAY over the line - we&#x27;d call it a crime now - to get a walkout going). It was still a bit cheesy, but ...<p>Do I have this right - a google employee doing public attacks against other google staff &#x2F; how to apologize etc? And googlers want this kind of culture, where having a discussion get&#x27;s you social media blasted? It just seems these cultures are getting very unhealthy. Why do this all working for google?<p>Google must just have boatloads of cash to be able to afford this all. Do customers for GCP ever worry that some staff will protest what they are doing and take some kind of direct action?')
