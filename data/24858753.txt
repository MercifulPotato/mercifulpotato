It does confirm how I suspected things to work.<p>I have trouble understanding the need for the &quot;signing&quot; part of client-side certificates. Currently if I create an account at a website with a username&#x2F;password, there&#x27;s no need to get my account signed by a trusted third party. So why not let me create the account with a username&#x2F;publickey instead? Why does a third party CA need to be involved?<p>And actually (as I mentioned in another post just now), one thought is to have keypairs supplement passwords rather than replace them. Basically when I move to a new device, I can still log in to the website with a password, and then the site will give me the option to add the device&#x27;s public key so I can seamlessly log in automatically next time.')
