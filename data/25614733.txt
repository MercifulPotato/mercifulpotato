There can also be JS cycles spent doing color math like lighten, darken, hue shifting on base colors, etc. With runtime CSS-in-JS, all of that style JS code must be parsed and executed by the JS runtime <i>on every page load</i> by <i>every user</i>. That’s a lot of CPU time and user wait time multiplied out.<p>Zero-runtime improves page load performance by moving this extra code from the JS vm to static CSS files. The majority of style computation happens at build time.  The CSS can then be downloaded and parsed <i>in parallel</i> with the JS (woo threads?). The separation  <i>may</i> improve caching compared to all-JS solution as well, depending on how granular the CSS and JS output files are.')
