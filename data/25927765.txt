SwiftUI is also very pleasant to use and it is getting there.<p>3) No hoops to jump for integrating API that makes an App do things that WebApp cannot do.<p>4) Work environment setup is very easy, no scripts to run no tooling that breaks down. It&#x27;s as simple as creating an new Word document and start doing actual work, not janitorial tasks.<p>5) Despite its bugs, Xcode is a good IDE that natively understand all the tooling I use. Autocomplete might break down sometimes but it can handle project creation, asset management,  project configurations and the distribution.<p>6) The only vendor that I rely on is Apple, as soon as they make something interesting it is available to me. The latest API is there right away.<p>7) The apps look in place by default, you actually have to work to make UI unconventional and weird.<p>I would imagine that on the Android side of things are also not that different.<p>Edit: I see that you don&#x27;t like the question being asked and other perspectives being presented but I think it&#x27;s a fair question and I would like to know if I am missing out on something.')
