I&#x27;m not sure why you replied to my comment with this but I totally believe that Facebook doesn&#x27;t have any legal or moral requirement to host anything they don&#x27;t want to.  They could literally just punt me tomorrow because they don&#x27;t like my name and that&#x27;s their right.  <i>Especially</i> because there is no commercial or contractual relationship between us.  I am not a customer of Facebook.<p>If you pay for hosting then you have a contract and then you and the company you&#x27;re buying from are beholden to those terms.')
