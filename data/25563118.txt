But I just want to echo that recruiters as such aren&#x27;t the problem.<p>I&#x27;d divide the job search into two parts. \n1) Send out &quot;pings&quot; of different sorts, get back expressions of interest of \n2) Each side expresses interest, each side invests a little more in learning about the other, until things work-out or they don&#x27;t.<p>An explicit or implied &quot;no&quot; can happen at any point here and whether that happens by ghosting or by form-letter-level no really shouldn&#x27;t matter to you. That&#x27;s part you should legitimately just toughen up to even though it&#x27;s challenging. A formulaic &quot;sorry but it was great to meet and you have great skills but they aren&#x27;t the skills we want&quot; can be just as infuriating as ghosting imo. Get used to the &quot;frenemy&quot; relationship with your employer. Professionalism is only gloss on that, though it&#x27;s a useful gloss. Lack of professionalism isn&#x27;t good sign but it&#x27;s just a sign.<p>The one thing that I think people often are angry about and <i>should</i> be angry about, is situations where an employer sets up a situation that requires the job seeker to invest far more energy in the job-search than the employer. For example, suppose an employer sends each of a thousand applicants a quiz that takes a day to complete and then filters the best 10 results by whether some underling likes them, maybe hires someone, maybe not. That employer has wasted a lot of time of a lot of people. And that&#x27;s different from a detailed onsite quiz from the people you might work with in a situation where they might indeed hire you. The company still might not hire you based on purely subjective criteria but then you&#x27;ve invested your time knowing there&#x27;s a legitimate possibility of being hired, since they&#x27;re investing their time and money so demonstrating sincerity.')
