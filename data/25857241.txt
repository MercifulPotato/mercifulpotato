They are not very original in their music and lyrics. Or simply not very good. Or very good for a small niche.<p>I&#x27;m not a music buff by a long shot but on one of our first dates my partner and I went to Brighton during the Brighton festival. During a rain shower we heard some live music coming from a pub and went in. We&#x27;ve since followed that band whenever we get a chance.<p>At first I was full of optimism that they were on the cusp of hitting it big. Their music is as good as anything we hear played on the radio. Live their performance is exceptional.<p>For reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand they don&#x27;t seem to have moved on from where they where when we first encountered them, a small indie band with a niche but loyal following.<p>I guess my point is that skill isn&#x27;t the only factor. I suspect a big part of it is luck and connections.')
