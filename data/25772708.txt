And the project is really just a few months old.<p>It&#x27;s focused on comparing 1000s of experiments really effectively in minutes. MLFlow, Tensorboard don&#x27;t have these capabilities which has motivated us to work on Aim. \nEspecially valuable when running hyperparam sensitive tasks such as RL.')
