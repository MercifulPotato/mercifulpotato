But it boggles the mind to try to understand how a computer works from the transistor level to the point of where your mouse icon traverses across the screen. Trying to understand it at all levels will really give you a headache. Or at least, it does for me.<p>I tend to think that if more people understood how to program at this level, the weight of software and websites would be a lot less. I can&#x27;t log in to my bank website without download 1 MB of crap. It&#x27;s super easy to program using by importing * but if you can write in assembly you can really optimize. It&#x27;s just not worth the effort these days. So the improvement of Moore&#x27;s law (RIP) ends up going to programmers&#x27; salaries instead of to performance improvements. Kind of an interesting way to think about it.')
