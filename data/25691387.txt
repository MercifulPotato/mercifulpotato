Not necessarily way back in the past, but way back in the <i>causal chain</i>. Basically, you keep on asking &quot;what caused that?&quot; until you get to an answer that looks like a reasonable stopping point. Saying &quot;the engineers failed&quot; isn&#x27;t a reasonable stopping point because the engineers weren&#x27;t acting in isolation or on their own; they were acting as part of a larger organization that was not just an organization of engineers. So if they failed, it means the larger organization failed, and you have to look at why <i>that</i> happened to find the ultimate cause.<p><i>&gt; The theory conveniently exonerates Boeing engineers</i><p>It does no such thing. It is perfectly possible for the engineers to be at fault <i>and</i> for the larger organization of the Boeing corporation to <i>also</i> be at fault. The reason for looking beyond the engineers is not to &quot;exonerate&quot; the engineers, but to make sure that &quot;blame the engineers&quot; does not get used as an excuse to exonerate others who <i>also</i> contributed to the failure and who should be held accountable.')
