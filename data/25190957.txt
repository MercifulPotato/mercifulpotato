This is because in countries with universal healthcare, patients within the country go to their GP&#x2F;Primary Care Doctor far many more times on average than the typical American. So, in many countries, this practice is non-existent, basically because people just go to the doctor whenever they feel it is necessary—and far more often than the typical American does.<p>The average American sees a doctor 3 times per year. In France it is 6-7 times per year. In Japan, it’s 13 times per year. This statistic is directly linked to the cost of care.')
