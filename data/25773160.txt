If 90% of people are installing some third party modification, the developers notice and incorporate it into the ordinary installation, and then they don&#x27;t need to anymore.<p>But without the <i>ability</i> to do that, that doesn&#x27;t happen, and then everything is worse because you not only can&#x27;t install it as a mod, it also then can&#x27;t become popular enough as a mod to be incorporated into the standard distribution.')
