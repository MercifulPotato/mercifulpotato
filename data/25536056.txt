I for one don&#x27;t like Rust but I am relentlessly investing in mastering it because I do need low-level statically typed and compiled language and I still have PTSD from C&#x2F;C++.<p>F.ex. I loved Racket. It is an <i>amazing</i> language and extremely well-crafted and thought out. But, call me when they have Erlang&#x2F;Elixir&#x27;s processes (actors) and preemptive scheduling.')
