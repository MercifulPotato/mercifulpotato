Nothing more.<p>In all of my time at Google AI, I never heard of pubapproval being used for peer review or to critique the scientific rigor of the work. It was never used as a journal, it was an afterthought that folks on my team would usually clear only hours before important deadlines. We like to leave peer review to the conferences&#x2F;journals&#x27; existing process to weed out bad papers; why duplicate that work internally?<p>I&#x27;m disappointed that Jeff has chosen to imply that pubapproval is used to enforce rigour. That is a new use case and not how it has been traditionally used. Pubapproval hasn&#x27;t been used to silence uncomfortable minority viewpoints until now. If this has changed, it&#x27;s a very, very new change.')
