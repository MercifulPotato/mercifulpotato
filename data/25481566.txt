Our &quot;call room&quot; in one hospital during residency was a utility closet. There are mandates of what to do, but hospitals routinely ignore them. Who will report problems? No resident wants to have their program lose accreditation.<p>Our program director (in psychiatry) always pointed out that psychiatry had one of the highest rates of people going over the 80 hour-per-week limit in the health system. It was much more uncommon for us than for most of our colleagues, but we tended to report it on the rare occasion it happened. My surgical colleagues who went over the limit were asked to meet with their program director when it happened, and it was much easier just to &quot;round down.&quot;<p>Glad I did a residency, but mine was relatively easy. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have made it through some programs.')
