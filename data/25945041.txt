People use all three substances to cope. The (small-ish) relationship association found is also interesting and <i>could</i> be viewed as a negative, but this too is just a correlation.<p>Relating to the other negative outcomes like depression and anxiety, the authors find:<p>&quot;The distribution of having a paid job, anxiety, depression and financial hardship were similar to the percentage of each class in the population.&quot;<p>Cool.<p>It would be nice if in 2021 we could start being a bit more objective about how we approach studying substance use.<p>There are real risks and harms associated with cannabis use, some of which we understand, and others we likely don&#x27;t fully appreciate due to a lack of studies.<p>Overstating things to further some agenda or to support one&#x27;s subjective preconceptions helps no one and only serves to further dilute our actual understanding of the science, and is ultimately going to do more harm than good.')
