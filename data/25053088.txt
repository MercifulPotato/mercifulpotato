Webster&#x27;s dictionary defines peaceful as &quot;untroubled by conflict, agitation, or commotion&quot;. Certainly, if almost 10% of my coworkers were violent, I would not call my workplace peaceful. If one in ten of our servers were disrupted due to commotion, clients would quickly start leaving for alternatives.<p>In my own country we also saw protests after the death of George Floyd. These were dispersed forcefully by police, indirectly because of Corona restrictions. I do not think the police officers, who put their health and safety at risk, felt particularly peaceful when engaging huge crowds with batons and riot shields.<p>There were peaceful protests, and there were violent ones. There were orderly citizens as well as looters and rioters. The trend is what matters, the frequency. Imagine if 10% of a rock band&#x27;s concerts resulted in venues being burnt down, people seriously hurt and even killed, would that band&#x27;s concerts be considered peaceful?<p>I&#x27;ve seen videos from the affected cities and neighbourhoods, if that&#x27;s what a peaceful America looks like then I hope they never experience commotion or unrest.')
