Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610326585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721825, text='<i>I don’t know why anyone pretends that these stats suggest that companies are being racist about hiring.</i><p>That isn&#x27;t anything I said.<p><i>I don’t know why you insist on being so adamant about how hiring works.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m doing. You latched onto that as a thing to argue with me about in a way that ignores everything else I say and is a tactic that looks very bad faith. It looks like it is hand waving off known widespread racial bias in the name of &quot;this one detail you said is inaccurate.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like attacking someone over a misplaced comma to imply they are stupid without bothering to engage anything they have said.<p>What I originally said is just that <i>this is not shocking</i> and talked about generally known statistics and you are latching onto &quot;This woman knows nothing about hiring and I am going to dog her to the ends of the earth about that while pretending it is a good faith argument and overlook how shitty and racist it looks to deal with her in this fashion.&quot;<p>This is a routine thing that whenever racism, sexism and similar come up, someone wants to go to town and nitpick something in a way that looks extremely dismissive of the very existence of the problem because they want to argue they aren&#x27;t guilty of something. Some people have an expression for that along the lines of &quot;moves to innocence&quot; -- in other words, it is vastly more important to most White people to insist &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist and I don&#x27;t do that and that&#x27;s not how hiring works&quot; than to actually talk about how racism does work and how to remedy it. Defending their own claimed innocence is their highest priority rather than working on understanding how racism persists and what needs to be done to remedy it.<p>&quot;Last hired and first fired&quot; was very much a known and standard thing for a lot of years and you have not provided any citations and I haven&#x27;t gone looking because this style of arguing is so bad faith I don&#x27;t want to engage it by agreeing that I need to &quot;prove&quot; that long-known practice remains true.<p>There can be lots of ways that still happens without any hiring managers intentionally discriminating against Blacks. There are lots of ways that someone can be effectively removed from the pipeline before it gets to the point of applying for a particular job which is one of the things that contributes to people <i>fighting</i> over the few qualified candidates who do apply and have certain traits.')
