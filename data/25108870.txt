Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605509412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108592, text='I&#x27;ve worked in the industry for years and I&#x27;m just now starting to see accessibility become mainstream for difficulty. Developers are coming around to the idea that games should be &quot;difficult for you&quot; to the degree you are interested and capable of engaging in difficulty. Celeste, for instance, added some great difficulty adjustments. (Also, it&#x27;s a fantastic platformer with a great soundtrack and trans main character.)<p>I hope we continue to see further normalization of sliders for settings for players to tone down (or up) experiences to have the game meet them where they are.')
