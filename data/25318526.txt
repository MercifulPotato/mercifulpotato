HDR monitors are both quite expensive and unimpressive compared to the HDR OLED TVs..<p>For the 5-6k that this display from Apple costs, I would certainly expect it to be an OLED display at LEAST. But it&#x27;s not.<p>How is this the best we can get and it&#x27;s NOT OLED? Dimming zones for 6k? I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on, I just want a nice OLED monitor that will fit on my monitor arm. I&#x27;ll even pay the same price that you can get an AMAZING 55&quot; OLED TV from LG for; 1500-2k.')
