It&#x27;s just locked down in some areas and lacks some higher level builtin programs of Windows and has a different launcher&#x2F;DE. It&#x27;s a half-lie at most.<p>Also, the parts of Windows that Xbox does ship with are the most important ones for Microsoft shareholders. Nobody would want to edit their documents from their Xbox. That would in fact be harmful because some people might not buy a proper PC then (as is observable years later with the advent of smartphones). But the Xbox uses the DirectX API as well as builds on all the Windows-isms. So if you built a game for Windows, it&#x27;s not hard to port it to Xbox, and vice versa.')
