As anyone who has programmed in NScripter will attest – it&#x27;s not the easiest language to work with. Although it has a lot of useful built-in commands for creating visual novels, it&#x27;s essentially a low-level language (especially inspired by assembly language). You have to handle program flow manually – no for loops, while loops, and no proper if statements. There are very primitive forms of variables, but no complex data structures. You can extend functionality using Lua, however.<p>I&#x27;m always amazed by what people have managed to do with NScripter, given its limitations and relative obscurity.')
