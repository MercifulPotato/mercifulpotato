A wider rocket has more generous margins when it comes to wind, sure, but thunderstorms, heavy rain, storm with strong gusts (doesn&#x27;t have to be extreme either), sudden ice, heavy snow, etc. etc. will still prevent launches and especially landings.<p>&gt; Of course, a tornado or cyclone might be disruptive, but that&#x27;s also true for normal airplanes.<p>Normal aeroplanes fly around unfavourable regularly and flying holding patterns is normal procedure anyway. None of that is possible with rockets, no matter how wide.<p>The situation is worsened by the fact that pilots have the luxury of time when planning their route, e.g. bad weather at the destination during launch isn&#x27;t a big deal for long-haul flights, since there&#x27;s often 10 hours or more until it even becomes relevant.<p>With a rocket, weather at the launch and target site have to be favourable at pretty much the same time, since you&#x27;d get there in well under an hour.<p>We&#x27;ll see later today how well the aerodynamics might work and how the rocket behaves. I remain very sceptical about the point-to-point idea.')
