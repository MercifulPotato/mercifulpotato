Are the UK government under any obligation to disclose that to EU?<p>I don&#x27;t think I get the question... is a country obliged to say they won&#x27;t export something to other country? I guess so, how the hell is the other country supposed to know?<p>Because that&#x27;s literally what Europe is saying: get the missing stock somewhere else, because there are nothing stopping AZ from doing it.<p>&gt;Let just say AZ demand a price increase for moving stock from UK, then what? When the contract for that price was signed, even though it did not explicitly state from which plant, the price are considered as a factor for production location. Hence the best effort. Morale issues aside this is no different to literally all supply chain in other industry.<p>Well AZ is the one that told 2 days ago that it won&#x27;t fulfill a order of 100 million doses due to March, 30-60 days away, by 70 million, so I guess they are the ones that should figure out that fuck up, if they have to do it at loss or if they have to ask more for it.<p>They only figured out 2 days ago they will slip a order by 70%, and hide behind their &quot;best effort&quot;? They had be preparing this shipment since at October 2020, at best November 2020 - and only now they figure out they will miss out on it?<p>Again, something doesn&#x27;t add up. The EU could have done a lot more if they knew they couldn&#x27;t have fulfilled this order.')
