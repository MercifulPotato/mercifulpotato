But the ban wouldn&#x27;t hold if slavery made economic sense. It isn&#x27;t as though the the people were suddenly imbued with a moral spirit - we&#x27;ve had human history for literal millennia. Slavery being bad for slaves is not a complicated concept, people knew about that forever.<p>Making slavery unprofitable is more impressive than actually banning it. Both are good, but enabling freedom is still a substantially more powerful change than the simply banning of slavery. Much like how banning heroin doesn&#x27;t actually cause heroin to die out if there is a demand for it; we may yet see heroin legalised in my lifetime much like marijuana. It is entirely possible. Slavery ain&#x27;t coming back, it benefits pretty much nobody. There isn&#x27;t a billion dollar industry in slaves waiting to be discovered.')
