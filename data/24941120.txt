For me it&#x27;s a combination of two: Urgency and having had enough sleep. If I have a flight, I almost always wake up 30 minutes before my timer go off; even if I didn&#x27;t get enough sleep. If I have nothing important to do the next day, my brain will usually ignore the waking up part and carries on.<p>One thing I noticed is that in the last year I have been waking up just a few minutes before my alarm goes off. My postulation is the iPhone alarm sound. It&#x27;s bizarrely painful that I think I&#x27;m waking up just before it to avoid hearing it.')
