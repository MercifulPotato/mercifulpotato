I know I would personally pay a premuim for this service for a high risk family member.<p>Use cases:\n- drive at risk people to testing sites or medical appointments\n- work in high risk positions like delivering supplies to nursing homes and homes of high risk people<p>It would require very good tracking of both the positive and negative tests and you&#x27;d have to have a way of certifying people.<p>However, it seems like something people could try on a small scale in their local communities via NextDoor or Facebook.<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statnews.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;the-certified-recovered-from-covid-19-could-lead-the-economic-recovery&#x2F;')
