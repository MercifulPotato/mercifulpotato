I would write my Lisp assignments with pencil and paper, and (procrastinating) a few hours before the assignment was due make it to the computer lab and enter my program, just as I imagined my predecessors worked in the 60s and 70s.<p>The odd thing about Lisp was that my programs almost invariably worked (modulo a mismatched paren) the first time.  I&#x27;ve rarely had that happen in other environments.<p>There was the one time where the set of library functions I thought were present weren&#x27;t available in the Lisp variant available.  I simply implemented the functions I needed in a few minutes.<p>I only wish I&#x27;d have had an opportunity to explore the Lisp world more.  It seemed like it was from the past and the future at the same time.')
