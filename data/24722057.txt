Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24723370], score=None, time=1602181128, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721565, text='&gt; thus the overall function of voting is actually to make winning voters think<p>More generally, the specific implementation of &quot;democracy&quot; in America was probably done with the best of intentions, but the rise of various forms of communication have now <i>enabled and created the need&#x2F;desire</i>  for more sophisticated forms.  I would propose some <i>reasonable</i> form of more direct democracy, or at least comprehensive direct polling (non-binding) on individual issues - this way we&#x27;d at least have a half decent model about what people&#x27;s beliefs are.  Unfortunately, this may be unpalatable to certain parties who enjoy the ability to project <i>what they want people to think</i> other people&#x27;s beliefs are.<p>That people have not been provided this improved (over one vote every 4 years, and then some other low-resolution voting here and there at other levels, all of which rarely results in changing much, or pleasing a large portion of the public) seems to have resulted in a situation where people have decided to take influence into their own hands, with the tools they have available:  <i>meme wars</i>.<p>&gt; This does not represent my perspective at all.<p>I may have estimated you erroneously.<p>&gt;&gt; Do you automatically presume any conservative group is white supremacists by default?<p>&gt; Given the way Trump has captured the following of the conservative community, despite being a radical populist and having few policy accomplishments besides inflaming racial tensions, yes. It&#x27;s reasonable starting assumption about any group that continues to express support for Trump.<p>Upon reconsideration, my interpretation has not changed.  Can you possibly explain where you think I may have gone wrong in interpreting the above exchange?  My sense of what you are saying is that <i>because</i> I have awareness of racist tendencies in Trump&#x27;s model, <i>then therefore</i> I should reject him (as opposed to considering his racism as just one dimension among millions of others).<p>&gt; And lastly no, my decision to support Biden does not come from modus ponens on policies. Rather, I&#x27;ve been <i>trying to find any reason why it would make sense to support Trump, to give his supporters the benefit of the doubt</i>.<p>I interpret this to mean that you are unable to see how someone could possibly evaluate the multidimensional nature of Donald Trump and (all things considered) decide to vote for him, without ~being similarly racist, or at least to some noteworthy degree?  This is <i>literally</i> how I interpret your words, did you mean something completely different and I missed it?<p>&gt; He&#x27;s continued to reject expert advice regarding Covid, leading to 210,000 American deaths.<p>I don&#x27;t like the manner in which he&#x27;s done this, but I am very displeased with the way this pandemic has been marketed (for <i>many</i> reasons), so I am &quot;ok&quot; with his buffoon-like performance.<p>&gt; He&#x27;s setup tariffs that could only have worked twenty years ago, and has chosen to compete with China by adopting China&#x27;s app censorship totalitarianism.<p>Here we disagree, significantly.<p>&gt; He&#x27;s withdrawn from foreign diplomacy to let China and Russia conquer unhindered.<p>Also here.<p>Other than these points, and then also our final decision on who to vote for, I believe you and I are largely in agreement on everything else you&#x27;ve written.')
