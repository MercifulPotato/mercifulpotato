There&#x27;s probably some business opportunity lurking in simplifying VAT for small businesses. Hell, there are probably regularity opportunities as well, if lawmakers are interested in small businesses.<p>I run a small business on the side, did a small project for a customer in another EU country, and got fined by the tax service for not having handled VAT properly. Now this is obviously my fault (and the fine wasn&#x27;t too steep). It doesn&#x27;t make financial sense for me to pay for an accountant (very small side business), but it&#x27;s not easy enough to do it myself without the risk of errors. End result? People are discouraged from running small businesses.')
