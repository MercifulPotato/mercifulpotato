A practical example of why this could matter is that instead of spreading an idea through viral mechanisms, this would provide an illustration of how an idea could be spread by replicating conditions and causing the idea to essentially regenerate among disconnected individuals, while from each individual’s perspective they are having a novel idea that they “figured out.” I guess that’s what we do with user interfaces and design, though.')
