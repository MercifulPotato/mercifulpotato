Instead, you have to be able to capture the difference between the value of someone else’s work and what you pay them to do it. And you have to do that at scale. So Jeff Bezos has figured out how to pay people $X and make $X   $Y off their labor, pocket a significant portion of that $Y and do it for the hundreds of thousands of people that work for Amazon. Nowhere in this argument is anyone saying that this practice should not be allowed or that he’s done something wrong. But what people are saying is that the narrative that billionaires built their wealth themselves is false and that they should be taxed heavily in recognition of the fact that they built their wealth off of the work of others.<p>The billionaires Paul identifies and helps create are no different, other than the possible exception that they rely on market’s expectation of future exploitation of workers’ value rather than having actually done it already. Paul would never fund a founder who wanted to divide all profits among employees. Therefore, based on that single fact alone, he is identifying future billionaires based on their willingness to exploit their workers...to pay them less than the value of their work.')
