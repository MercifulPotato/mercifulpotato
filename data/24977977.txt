Many people use iMacs as office computers, for them there would be little reason to buy a machine for thousands of Dollars just to write text documents, read e-mails and browse the Internet if you can get a MacOS device for a few hundred Dollars. Apple already has the Mac Mini which starts at 800 USD, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much pricing room below that for Apple. But then again, who knows, as they&#x27;re building their own chips now it would be feasible to design a slightly underpowered Mac Mini and sell it for 300-400 USD. If it works well enough it could be a great success, I think.')
