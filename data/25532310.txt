Item(by='adrianb', descendants=None, kids=[25532610, 25532660], score=None, time=1608850590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25532173, text='The old software development model where users are buying the license for a specific version of a program and then use it and only come back to spend more when they need an upgrade is pretty much dead now. Most software moved to either free downloads with paid support (even Windows these days?) or to membership-based model (Adobe, Office365).<p>The reason is that as you add features and fix bugs in a software, fewer users need the upgrade (why spend another 150$ on this year&#x27;s release for some features I never use?). But the development team still needs to be paid and the advanced features they add each year tend to be harder to implement, so over time the costs are increasing while sales go down.<p>Adobe might be successful with this business model because they have a strong market in professionals but they definitely lost the amateurs and hobbyists.<p>EDIT to add: also it didn&#x27;t help that CPUs and OS APIs haven&#x27;t had major changes in more than a decade. There was no major reason for a large majority of users to upgrade (such as the move to 64 bit CPUs).')
