When a vehicle is accelerating, the driver is intending to make it move both faster, and farther. It takes the driver time to shift their intent, then time to shift their feet, then time for the vehicle to stop. This is exacerbated by fast acceleration, is that the vehicle will gain both more speed and more distance by the time the driver shifts their intent, and their feet, than slow acceleration vehicles.<p>Also, wide vehicles have a much harder time dealing with pedestrians on bike lines and shoulders. I&#x27;ve been forced off the road so many times by Hummers and their ilk, and almost never by a sedan.')
