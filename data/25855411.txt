Just play along&quot;.<p>&quot;There are very strict laws on how I can serve drinks. I couldn&#x27;t serve you half a beer even if I wanted to.&quot;<p>&quot;But that&#x27;s not a problem&quot; mathematician #3 chimes in &quot;at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. You see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-&quot;<p>&quot;I know how limits work&quot; interjects the bartender.<p>&quot;Oh, alright then. I didn&#x27;t want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics&quot;.<p>&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; The bartender replies, &quot;you learn limits in like, 9th grade! What kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?&quot;<p>&quot;HE&#x27;S ON TO US&quot; mathematician #1 screeches<p>Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.<p>The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. &quot;FOOLS&quot; it booms in unison, &quot;I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA&quot;<p>The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. &quot;But wait&quot; he inturrupts, thinking fast, &quot;if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!&quot;<p>The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. &quot;My God, you&#x27;re right. We didn&#x27;t think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!&quot; and with that, they vanish.<p>A nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. &quot;How did you know that that would work?&quot;<p>&quot;It&#x27;s simple really&quot; the bartender says. &quot;I saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.&quot;')
