When shaken well, it creates a foamy layer on top of the drink that is quite stable and offers a pleasant texture (IMO), somewhat similar to the foam you get on top of a freshly poured beer. On top of that, there is some sort of chemical reaction that happens with the egg and alcohol, especially oak-aged spiritsâ€”apparently the egg white &quot;softens&quot; the booze, which is nice for higher-proof whiskeys and such.[0]<p>You can take this even further, too: I make a variation of the Mai Tai that&#x27;s topped with a foam made by blending egg white with passion fruit puree. The foam is the first thing you taste, so you immediately get hit with the sharp, sweet-tart flavor of the passion fruit, before the rest of the (more subtle) flavors kick in. It&#x27;s delicious.<p>(I&#x27;ve done it with aquafaba and it works almost as well, although I&#x27;ve only used canned, which generally contains salt. I don&#x27;t mind it, but it doesn&#x27;t work in every cocktail.)<p>[0]: If you&#x27;re interested in this stuff, I <i>highly</i> recommend the book Liquid Intelligence by Dave Arnold.')
