Item(by='naikrovek', descendants=None, kids=[25641068], score=None, time=1609799672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639076, text='&gt; This thing of countries blaming other countries for attacks is getting boring. In cyber, there are no borders.<p>Technically correct, and very wrong in all other ways.<p>Who performs the attack is a very real concern, because unlike some of us, the attackers likely have lofty goals in the real world which are aided greatly by their successes in &quot;cyber.&quot;<p>(I maintain that anyone who uses the word &quot;cyber&quot; seriously today doesn&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re talking about, in virtually all cases. It&#x27;s fine to not understand stuff, by the way. Just be open to learning more.)<p>If Russia is able to find holes in Windows, the OS used by nearly every business on the planet, they will use those vulnerabilities to their advantage in whatever ways they require.  They will obtain personal information about people, blackmail them, maybe.  Who knows.  Russia and others WANT to take down those who disapprove of them quite strongly.  They potentially want to bring low anyone who has spoken bad about them publicly (if so, I&#x27;m screwed) or anyone who could have helped them in some way and chose not to.  North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia (perhaps to a lesser extent) have real beefs with the US.<p>Information gained via incredibly catastrophic breaches like this one give real countries with real weapons real leverage against others, potentially.  <i>Especially</i> if the vulnerability opens more doorways that would otherwise not have been accessible.<p>I&#x27;ve been divorced twice.  DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the lengths that people will go for revenge for even the smallest slights.  Some people get absolutely drunk on the slightest bit of power they have over others, and they know that, so they accumulate leverage against their enemies, real or imagined, continually in anticipation of a time when it will be useful.<p>In short: this is a big deal.  It matters who is behind it.')
