I never login to any site on Safari and regularly clear the site data. I can&#x27;t use incognito mode because I want to keep the history which is useful to me, but I suppose at some point I&#x27;ll just make an extension to log my own history.<p>Regarding auth session duration, I noticed that Google seems to have a much shorter session lifetime if you don&#x27;t use 2FA. Not sure if other sites do that. I rarely look at FB&#x2F;Twitter so it never surprises me if they ask for the password.')
