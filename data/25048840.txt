Item(by='centimeter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605030996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25042753, text='&gt; It’s much easier to go over something and declare “this makes sense” than it is to come up with that something in the first place.<p>Obviously, but that’s not what we were talking about. We were comparing memorization to understanding, not inventing to learning.<p>If you’re good at math, you should be able to re-derive any formula or procedure quickly (up to, say, constant factors) without having to memorize it (after the derivation has been explained to you).<p>If you run into a problem that you can’t solve because you didn’t drill the steps hard enough, you don’t actually understand the problem. This isn’t necessarily your fault - many math courses teach by symbolic manipulation without the conceptual grounding required to actually re-derive the symbolic procedures yourself. Few students will seek that understanding on their own outside of class, in which case they’re stuck with memorization.<p>&gt; the reason for Russian&#x2F;Chinese dominance in certain areas of math was due to how those areas benefitted very much from rote practice.<p>I think this supports my point - these “certain areas” are small. There is a relative paucity of mathematical&#x2F;physical innovation from China (especially per capita!). The west still dominates mathematical invention.')
