Well, yes and no; as Einstein famously once noted, &quot;it&#x27;s the theory that decides what can be observed.&quot;. Obviously the reverse is also partly true and the whole thing is an iterative process, but in a sense Luke&#x27;s article seems to be about the same thing as Einstein&#x27;s quote: that it is fruitful to challenge the framework every now and then, rather than accept it as religion.<p>Specifics aside, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an unreasonable mindset to have in science.  (or other fields for that matter - a similar mantra exists in medicine: &quot;always dare to challenge the existing diagnosis&quot; -- exactly because people rarely think to do it)')
