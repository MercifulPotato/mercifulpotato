There is no solution for one that is owned by a corporation.  An offshoot of the above is the government could make a social media site that is covered under &quot;free speech that the government cannot take away&quot; and anything not blatantly illegal can be posted&#x2F;said.  I would not advocate for this though.. I think we have plenty of options.<p>But the one for politicians only is something that should be seriously considered.')
