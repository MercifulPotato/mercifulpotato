When I walk into a building I don&#x27;t get to tell their IT guys what protocols to use and which to avoid. I don&#x27;t get to tell them my own preferences and make them conform to them. I don&#x27;t get to start a job and demand they change everything about everything on day 1.<p>I adapt. And if they&#x27;re using NFS, I want to make sure I can use NFS too. That&#x27;s why fixing this bug was important.')
