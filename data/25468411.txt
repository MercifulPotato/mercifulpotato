I think most Guix hackers are so used to working directly with a git branch that we forget to cater for &quot;power users&quot; who just want some small edits here and there.<p>Guix is very hackable as you mention, but with a very different design from e.g. Gentoo, where you can easily override anything in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;portage.<p>I like your &#x27;guix edit&#x27; idea; the command already exists, but it opens a read-only copy of the Guix source code by default...  It would be really nice to add a tutorial of sorts to it and make it interactive.<p>Note there is an Emacs &#x27;yasnippet&#x27; that fills out part of the commit message: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;devel&#x2F;en&#x2F;guix.html#The-Perfect-Setup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;devel&#x2F;en&#x2F;guix.html#The-Perfect-S...</a><p>I agree that the onboarding story could be better.  If emacs-guix could guide a user all the way from &#x27;guix edit&#x27; to &#x27;git send-email&#x27; that would be nothing short of incredible.<p>Thanks for your thoughts.  :-)')
