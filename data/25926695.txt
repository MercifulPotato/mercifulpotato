Item(by='maccard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611745144, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926609, text='&gt; Making things out of cheap and low-impact particle boards, cardboard cores, etc, is probably the most realistic way of reducing the environmental impact.<p>Not only that, it being made out of particleboard doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it disposable. My parents have a set of Pax wardrobes that they&#x27;ve had for 20 years (give or take?), and they&#x27;re perfectly functional, and with some small amount of TLC (a small tin of paint) could even be classed as pretty!')
