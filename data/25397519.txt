The data is entirely user generated - it&#x27;s the result of collecting the metrics over some period of time. The trained model is the result of feeding the collected data into the chosen algorithm.<p>The point is that the algorithm is, for all practical purposes, tuning itself. The developer has essentially selected a black box to feed the data into, told it what to optimize for, and given it the ability to wiggle a bunch of unlabeled knobs. Which knobs it should tweak and in precisely what way is never specified by the developer. Instead of &quot;show the following things to the following users&quot;, the developer just says &quot;maximize number of videos viewed per visit&quot; and the algorithm tweaks whatever parameters have been made available to it until it finds something that works.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;something that works&quot; is often not what we might have liked. ML is a bit like a Djinn, fulfilling wishes in an unpredictable and borderline malicious manner.')
