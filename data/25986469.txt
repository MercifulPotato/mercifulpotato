For the last 4 to 5 months or so, Nvidia&#x27;s drivers have been horrendous. I&#x27;ve experienced numerous crashes with my GTX 2080 Super card. About once every two days I experience a kernel panic and the only solution is to reboot. There are multiple threads on this issue on Nvidia&#x27;s official Linux forum and Nvidia&#x27;s driver developers have stated they don&#x27;t know what the cause is and cannot reproduce it. [1]<p>My HDMI also doesn&#x27;t work well after the computer wakes-up from sleep. Sometimes the monitor does work, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s also a known issue.<p>I&#x27;ll be looking at AMD and their graphics cards a lot more closely when I build my next computer later this year. I just can&#x27;t deal with Nvidia&#x27;s driver issues. It&#x27;s extremely annoying and it has wasted a ton of my time.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Nvidia&#x27;s HW with GNU&#x2F;Linux for about a decade and have never had any major issues and have always been happy with the performance and reliability. However, this is not the case anymore.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure all this mess started when Kernel devs started blocking Nvidia&#x27;s &quot;GPL condom&quot; effort [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;gpu-unix-graphics&#x2F;linux&#x2F;148" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;gpu-unix-graphics&#x2F;linu...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kernel-Blocking-NV-NetGPU\\\\\\" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Ke...</a>*')
