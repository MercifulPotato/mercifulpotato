I think one was that I couldn&#x27;t have two containers on the same network listen to the same port, another one was related to Podman not playing nice with nftables, but the specifics elude me.<p>EDIT: Upon further reflection, I think Docker doesn&#x27;t really work with nftables either, so that one isn&#x27;t on Podman. It just so happened we made that switch at the same time. Regardless, there were other problems. I&#x27;ll check to see if I can find any records of the problems later.')
