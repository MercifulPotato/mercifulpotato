Emerging challengers don&#x27;t have nearly as much free organic distribution, so they need to buy ads to build momentum and expand their reach.<p>Even in the current US presidential election, Biden has 3.2 million Facebook followers while Trump 31.7mm on his personal page and 6.3mm on his presidential page.<p>Without paying for ads that extend your audience beyond your pre-existing followers, the incumbents will always have more reach for their messages.<p>Completely agree that we should be able to see the people responsible for running each of these ads though, with personal liability for the content that they&#x27;re sharing.')
