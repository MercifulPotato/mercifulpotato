There are older router models that cannot run linux. A few years back I unsuccessfully tried to flash a very minimal &lt;1 MiB linux on an old TP link router. I was able to flash the rom but I couldn&#x27;t boot, because there was not enough memory available, it wasn&#x27;t 512KB but only a few MiB IIRC, still not enough.<p>&gt; We are just pointing out that you massively misunderstand how micro kernels work<p>If someone points out, that linux kernel can be reduced in size and that there are some big microkernels, then I do agree and there is no misunderstanding, as far as I can see. Same holds true for the performance argument.<p>&gt; As the GP said, micro kernels have a performance overhead swapping data between rings.<p>I agree that performance will be problematic, but this does not render microkernels useless in general for constrained devices.
