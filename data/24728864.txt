We&#x27;ve had relations with the UAE for decades, they were never hostile to Israel. It was nothing more than a photo op for Netanyahu. The UAE and Bahrein didn&#x27;t even send same level representatives. The sent foreign ministers for meeting our prime minister. Seems silly, but it tells how serious this accord is.<p>So a peace deal that changed nothing. And will only let some arms dealers pocket extra bucks. The Palestinians will still be under Israeli military rule. Israel citizens are still targeted by missiles and rockets. Violence is still  prospering here. Peace is no closer.')
