Item(by='paxys', descendants=None, kids=[25913851], score=None, time=1611649617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913310, text='I have been using Firefox as my daily driver for years and have yet to come across a single one of these &quot;only works on Chrome&quot; web sites that the author mentions.<p>This entire paragraph is complete bullshit:<p>&gt;  The larger problem, though, is that it&#x27;s not at all clear that Firefox will remain a viable alternative to Chrome. Its market share has been falling for years, and not everybody is pleased with the directions that the Mozilla Foundation has taken. The creators of web sites have responded by not caring about Firefox; having to retry broken web sites in Chrome is a ritual that many Firefox users have had to get used to. It&#x27;s not surprising that users give up and just run Chrome from the outset.<p>Firefox is a great browser, and is getting better with every new version. Differences in standards compliance, JS implementation and even rendering is negligible between modern Chrome and Firefox. Mozilla is probably the only major entity challenging Google&#x27;s dominance over web standards today, with even Microsoft having folded. I don&#x27;t know where the author is coming from, but to me there is zero reason to use Chrome or Chromium over Firefox.')
