Item(by='aliljet', descendants=None, kids=[25084228, 25084748], score=None, time=1605284024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25082703, text='I&#x27;ll bite. I tried to order a Taco Bell bean burrito. Small item, so you can throw stones about that, but here&#x27;s the price:<p><pre><code>  - $2.03 for the burrito (vs 1.29 in store)\n  - $2.99 for fees and taxes\n  - $3.99 for the delivery fee\n  - $2 for the dash tip??? Is 20% customary? It&#x27;s the lowest dash suggests.\n  - $11.01 for your burrito\n</code></pre>\nSo, for your $1.29 burrito, the price of the item is jacked up by nearly 60% to start. And slam fees, taxes, tips, and you&#x27;re talking about a total that&#x27;s 800% higher than the actual item.<p>It&#x27;s ludicrous. They&#x27;re catching you at every point to extract cash. Yes, a human delivered something to you, but for the cash conscious, this is an absurdly expensive tilt.')
