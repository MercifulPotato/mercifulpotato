But from talks to older people in the &quot;scene&quot; it&#x27;s become a lot of mishmash and the same old story over and over that it&#x27;s really rare to be intrigued by it.<p>Just saying that, because there still are some art houses here (although not sure if that&#x27;s still the case post-corona), but most of their films don&#x27;t intrigue me.
