In fact, Python has a compiler run in the course of normal execution.<p>And Python also has static type checkers available (and good editor integrations for them), they are just separate from the compiler.<p>&gt; Obviously Linters do exist but a sufficiently advanced Linter is not only repeating work a compiler would&#x27;ve done, but also probably requires some kind of help e.g. annotation)<p>Yes, static type checkers whether incorporated in a compiler or separately tend to need type annotations to do their best work, especially if the type system isn&#x27;t specifically crafted to maximize inferrability (Haskell can get away with fewer annotations than Java, often.)')
