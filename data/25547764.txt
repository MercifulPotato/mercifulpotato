Worst case is you start exhibiting learned helplessness and go into depression for a year or several.<p>I always try to refocus and think about what I can do for the people who were there for me during bad times, and how I can learn from my misfortune. (Sometimes, there&#x27;s nothing to learn and it&#x27;s just a bad stroke of luck. Even then - it&#x27;s not going to help playing the what-if game)<p>Ultimately we are the people we are both because of good and bad things that happened to us.')
