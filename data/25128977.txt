If you wouldn&#x27;t buy an iPad to play your games, don&#x27;t buy a Mac to play those games either. Unless by &quot;games&quot; you literally just mean WoW, which seems to be one of the only major cross platform games that seriously cares about Mac support.<p>Personally, I would lean towards suggesting the purchase of a console. The new generation has some really nice consoles, and the Nintendo Switch is still really fun in other ways.')
