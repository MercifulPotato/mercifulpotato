But that&#x27;s an interesting point of how it can be difficult to give away fast enough, so perhaps you might as well start now, since e.g. if someone had to give away billions very quickly, it would probably not be allocated well compared to if they had a few decades to do it.<p>I don&#x27;t think I will end up wealthy enough to worry about this myself of course, but it&#x27;s another factor to take note of.')
