It switches into night mode when it gets dark out (or they pushed an update), and the performance is much better.  My subjective impression was that it was usually getting a decent framerate when panning, but with some stuttering.  I took a profile of it in Chrome, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on.  A lot of the time, it will run at 120-130Hz, but drop down to 50Hz for no real reason.  (They sleep a bit between frames, they aren&#x27;t just maxing out the CPU.  Probably tested on a 60Hz monitor, and they don&#x27;t play enough games to be able to pick out the drops to 50Hz.  And I guess they didn&#x27;t use the profiler, or look at the fps profile that&#x27;s provided.)<p>They are doing some weird things.  The Javascript console is littered with CORS warnings -- for making a cross-origin request to example.com every time a map tile needs to be loaded.  That is probably an accident.  They also seem to make HTTP requests for the map tiles whenever they enter the screen; they appears to be no caching whatsoever.  (Maybe that&#x27;s the right approach.  The tiles do end up being served from the browser&#x27;s cache.  The network inspector claims they take about 1ms to load, which is probably slower than a lookup in a data structure in the Javascript program... but I didn&#x27;t test it and I don&#x27;t really trust that a &quot;1ms&quot; in there means &quot;we timed it and it was exactly 1ms&quot;.  It probably means &quot;0 &lt; time &lt; 1&quot;, which could be anything.)  Finally, they are serving this all out of what appears to be Azure blob storage; it&#x27;s HTTP&#x2F;1.1 so I guess we are opening a new TCP connection each time a tile needs to be loaded.<p>My TL;DR is I don&#x27;t really do frontend stuff or performance stuff, but the site seemed especially slow.  I bet they could clean it up in a few hours, so probably will.')
