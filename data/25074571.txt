If you ever find yourself at the bottom of an awful function with multiple screenfuls of code, matching braces makes it trivial to jump to the top if that function even when your editor has no special knowledge of that language.  No LSP&#x2F;etc needed.  Barebones vanilla Vi is actually a viable editor for Lisp because of this, relative to Vi with languages like Python.')
