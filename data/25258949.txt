The huge latency disparity is the problem: the SSD would prefer you request 4kB pages dozens at a time, but a software thread can only fault on one page access at a time. Using a larger page size than 4kB will get you much better throughput out of a SSD. On the OS side, swapping out a large number of pages when the active application changes can make good use of SSD bandwidth, but when a single application starts spilling into swap space, you&#x27;re still fundamentally screwed on the performance front.')
