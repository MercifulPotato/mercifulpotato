If closed-down markets degrade and become awful over time, the market will eventually reflect and account for that in the future. Long-term consequences eventually materialize into immediate consequences after all. In fact, the market exists to validate lofty claims like yours because history is filled with failed attempts to dictate what people should produce, by minorities like you who believe they know better than the people who buy them.<p>&gt; I do think it&#x27;s slightly problematic to assume that users are conscious enough of security to make an educated decision to opt into a locked-down platform, but are not educated enough to avoid flipping a switch in the settings that turns that environment off and on.<p>This seems pretty obviously true to me. It&#x27;s quite easy to realize you suck at security, all you need to do is suffer a security breach or know of one. For example, the Windows era taught many users just how insecure they could be, the lessons were pretty simple. Knowing when to disable security guardrails, however, requires actual security knowledge that most users don&#x27;t have. We know users usually don&#x27;t have them because Windows tested this with UAC, which users happily and quickly disabled to allow malicious programs that they didn&#x27;t really evaluate at all; A long and painful case study in &quot;how to let your users choose to fuck themselves&quot;.<p>Of course users don&#x27;t think about a tradeoff between open access and security, the choice is obvious to them. Security matters and open access doesn&#x27;t. On the one hand you have the tangible risk of getting your stuff or info stolen, and on the other you have danShumway&#x27;s nebulous &amp; unproven prophecies of a day that will soon(tm) come where the lack of open access causes stuff to degrade and become awful.<p>I don&#x27;t personally make the same tradeoff because open access matters more to me personally, but I think the majority of consumers have made legitimate choices for themselves. They know what they want and have made choices to support their desires, same as you or I, and frankly no one should be able to violate their choices.')
