If you believe they are unnecessary, it&#x27;s your responsibility to explain why, and to provide a work-around to your other team-members so they can get what they need.<p>Second, your question about production ready vs hackathon is a classic tradeoff with startups. There was missmanaged expectations around creating a Minimum Viable Product, vs a production ready system. Somewhere your team and yourself did not have aligned understanding of what was being delivered.<p>Third, did you speak to your team about their perceived value of things like meticulous ticket tracking, well maintained rep, monitoring etc?
