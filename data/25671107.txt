The prevailing voices there are antagonistic to my beliefs, to <i>put it mildly</i>. They say out loud <i>way, way worse</i> things about me than simply implying that I am an &quot;idiot&quot;. And yet I don&#x27;t lament that their platform is politically biased and run away and call myself deplatformed. They are calling normal reactions to the things they say a persecution. It&#x27;s a victim complex, and a deeply hypocritical one rooted in purest hatred for liberals.')
