If Twilio wasn&#x27;t already public with a higher mkt cap than Stripe&#x27;s most recent valuation, I&#x27;d guess Stripe acquires Twilio, but as it is not sure. Anyway here&#x27;s my thinking:<p>1. Complimentary businesses: Stripe is a developer interface for collecting payments from customers, Twilio is a developer interface for communicating with (and now understanding &#x2F; &quot;segmenting&quot;) your customers.<p>2. Similar culture: very high emphasis on great DX and developer evangelism. Shoutout to Stripe&#x27;s docs for being the best in the biz, and Twilio&#x27;s are not too shabby either.<p>3. Unique opportunities: Stripe collects payment for their customers, Twilio collects payment from their customers. If everything was under one roof, you could have a situation where Stripe becomes a de-facto bank account. Revenue comes in to your Stripe account and many of your consumables (paying for Twilio&#x27;s services) could come directly out of that account, removing the need to egress funds to your bank at all, thus reducing financial transaction overhead (which at scale could be a sizeable gain in efficiency).')
