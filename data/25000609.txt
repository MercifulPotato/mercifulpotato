Could we have a .net&#x2F;JVM like language-agnostic wasm standard lib bundled with all browsers, and target it like we do with .net standard?<p>There&#x27;s already a plan to give WebAssembly direct access to DOM, and to any other API JavaScript would have access to, without needing a JavaScript shim. (This requires integration between WebAssembly and the JavaScript garbage collector, which is part of why it&#x27;s taking time to develop.)')
