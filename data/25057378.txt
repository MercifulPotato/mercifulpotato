I.e. a set of apps produce opaque messages and send them to Kafka queues, while another set of apps consume these messages from Kafka queues.<p>Time series databases are used for storing and querying time series data. There are no Kafka-like queues in time series databases. Every time series has a key, which uniquely identifies this time series, and a set of (timestamp, value) tuples usually ordered by timestamp. Time series key is usually composed of a name plus a set of (&quot;key&quot;=&gt;&quot;value&quot;) labels. These labels are used for filtering and grouping of time series data during queries. There are various time series databases optimized for various workloads. For example, VictoriaMetrics [1] is optimized for monitoring and observability of IT infrastructure, app-level metrics, industrial telemetry and other IoT cases.<p>As you can see, there is little sense in comparing Kafka with time series databases :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;victoriametrics.com&#x2F;</a>')
