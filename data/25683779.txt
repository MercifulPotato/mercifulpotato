And as others have said, given static overhead you&#x27;re more likely to earn <i>less</i> per hour. You&#x27;re likely better off going contract and having a higher hourly rate and just billing less, but that has its own set of difficulties.<p>The real benefit I&#x27;ve seen very few places implement is a 36-38 hour week, over 4 days, with no decrease in salary. Productivity is the same or slightly higher (quite a bit higher if it&#x27;s a set schedule, e.g. everyone has the same day off so there&#x27;s no communication latency). Satisfaction is through the roof because not only are people getting paid more per hour, but it&#x27;s a benefit that they&#x27;re extremely unlikely to find anywhere else, so retention goes up as well.')
