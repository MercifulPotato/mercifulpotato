Calls and desktop sharing work well, the channels do what they do, integration with OneDrive and the wiki thing is nice etc.<p>But then I got a member of a different Team, for one of our customers, as part of some integration work. And boy is that a CF.<p>Unlike Discord you either have this team or that team active. Notifications from the other are horribly unreliable, and there&#x27;s no way to chat with someone in one team while you&#x27;re in a call with someone from the other team besides running a separate client.<p>So as such, &quot;Teams&quot; really should have been named &quot;Team&quot;.')
