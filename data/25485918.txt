I can&#x27;t think of a process I&#x27;ve ever worked on that took more than a few seconds to start. As you say, if you have any sort of rolling deployment mechanism the start time of your application is somewhat irrelevant. Unless your application takes a massive time to start, it seems like the wrong thing to optimise for. Surely you only deploy things a few times a day, if that, and hopefully most deployments don&#x27;t require rollbacks.<p>Also, with the current network speeds and memory availability, it&#x27;s hard to imagine the war size to be a bottleneck in web development.<p>Depending on other services via a well defined network interface is good for decoupling teams. So it depends on the number of employees you have coding for the same platform, rather than on clients or anything like that.')
