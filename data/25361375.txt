A rock-hard provably secure capabilities-oriented kernel, combined with reproducible declarative package management that can handle any combination of dependencies that you want.<p>Essentially this means that the idea of different distributions for LTS, stable, beta, alpha, bleeding edge, etc., goes away completely. You are never forced to update an old package, nor prevented from updating a new package. You get the best of all worlds.<p>And since the kernel is about as secure and performant as you can get, you essentially always have the latest kernel. Drivers get updated as necessary (defined by <i>your</i> policy, not the distribution&#x27;s) in userspace, potentially as quickly as the moment they are released, with no downtime whatsoever.')
