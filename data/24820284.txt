My buildings elevator started acting weird to the point that I didn’t feel comfortable bringing my son on it. Building was completely unresponsive to complaints. I called the state elevator inspection board and the guy was there TWO HOURS later, the elevator was immediately closed off, repairmen were there for a whole week and when they were done it worked perfectly. Nothing like a credible threat from The State to light a fire under a capitalist’s bottom.')
