I&#x27;ve been using catch-all on @mydomain for at least 15 years, and I went through a phase where I&#x27;d get a lot of random strings @mydomain. I set up dummy honeypot@mydomain accounts and added a lot of crap as aliases so they&#x27;d get tucked away in a disabled account. (I also do that with any &quot;valid&quot; email addresses that start to get spam.) It was a pain in the butt, but it also stopped quite a while ago. With newer domains, I tend to see stupid common ones like &quot;info&quot;, &quot;postmaster&quot;, etc. getting spam, but haven&#x27;t seen the random gibberish ones.')
