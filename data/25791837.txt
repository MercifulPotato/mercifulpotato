In laptops, the thermals of the 14nm generation were horrible, essentially you have to deal with a whining fan or cpu throttling, or both.\nAMD&#x27;s 4000 series has much improved upon this, and I assume that the latest 10nm Intel will be much better.\nPerformance-wise I agree with you. Minor changes, probably more noticeable changes come from the massive adoption of fast SSDs (1-2GB&#x2F;s).')
