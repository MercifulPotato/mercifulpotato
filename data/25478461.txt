Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608395406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25476474, text='Clearly for algebra you want to use algebraic notation because the conventions of algebraic grammar are suited for those tokens. You&#x27;re right context does matter.<p>I&#x27;m more referring to naming as a means of communication. If your function is not intended for use as an algebraic operator and it does some complex operations like extracting the x y coordinates of the locations of dogs cats and baboons from a picture it doesn&#x27;t hurt to place that entire description into the function name. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to make the function name grammatically correct either as it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt when you try to communicate the same point in English.<p>&gt;As with all of these types of things, there is a balance, I am arguing _for_ balance, not suggesting all names should be single letter or single word - but that they have their place. However in my experience very long names are far more commonly due to thoughtlessness, they include excessive redundant context and at worst even grammatical words.<p>I agree with balance. What I&#x27;m arguing here is that our general intuitive sense of what is &quot;balanced&quot; is actually off. People think &quot;find_xy_coordinate_of_dogs_cats_and_baboons_in_picture&quot; is an ugly function name and needs to be shortened but there is actually nothing logically wrong with it.')
