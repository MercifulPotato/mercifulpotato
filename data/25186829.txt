I did some spot checking of a bunch of vaccines I&#x27;d heard of and most seem to be between 90% and 99% effective so Covid-19 vaccines seem to be in line with expectations.  The flu is worse but that&#x27;s always a guessing game of which strain will be prevalent when they&#x27;re making the vaccine.  I think that&#x27;s because more doses tend to be more effective and if a single dose doesn&#x27;t get you there they just give you more doses, like the two doses for the mRNA covid vaccines.  Effectiveness here is how many people get sick.  You don&#x27;t know in this circumstance that they&#x27;re going to get sick until it happens, though maybe you could keep track of everybody&#x27;s antibody levels compared to what they should be and guess.  That would be way more expensive than just giving everybody the same schedule of doses though.')
