Not that we had need to coordinate more, but the fact that the company was no longer constrained by the number of meeting rooms available. Now you could schedule any number of meetings at any time.<p>Before Covid, you had to look in the schedule to find an available room. If there was none, you had to postpone the meeting or try to do it informally.<p>If I was developing Teams or a similar software, I&#x27;d allow companies to institute virtual meeting rooms that would function like the real deal. You can do impromptu 1:1 calls, but anything more than that requires a virtual room with a schedule. Another thing that could be useful is productivity metrics of hours spent in meetings (it&#x27;s possible it exists).')
