Item(by='random_upvoter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611746706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926315, text='The thing with IKEA is that most of their furniture looks good at first sight, but when it&#x27;s been in your living room for a couple of years you tend to become very aware of the somewhat generic blandness of the design, the cheapness of the material and that micro-tuned &quot;just good enough&quot; build quality to the point that it begins to irk. You don&#x27;t love a piece of IKEA and it is not something you&#x27;re going to hand to your children when that time comes. I&#x27;m quite sure almost all IKEA furniture ends up in landfill within 30 years, so all pretense at durability seems misguided to me.<p>Also people say IKEA is cheap but IMO it&#x27;s actually rather expensive for what you&#x27;re getting. Walk into an auction room and see what you can get for that 200 euro.')
