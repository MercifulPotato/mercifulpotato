I rarely drink alcohol, and never for the purpose of writing easier.<p>What does work for me is putting myself in an environment where there&#x27;s nothing much else to do but write, or conducive to writing, or around others doing the same thing (like for National Novel Writing Month).<p>Also in my local writing group of 40-ish people I&#x27;m not aware of anyone that drinks to write. Even when we have social events with alcohol I haven&#x27;t noticed anyone drinking a whole lot.')
