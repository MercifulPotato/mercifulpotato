We do this by providing spaces for your work. It solves multiple pain points with &quot;too many tabs&quot;, &quot;getting distracted&quot;, and &quot;information everywhere&quot;, with a slight workflow change.<p>People have been using Amna to manage their Jira tickets, finding gifts, or even leaving review on PRs. If you already use a personal to-do list, it&#x27;s really easy to move over.  The primary way we navigate the digital world today is with links. And links are hard to keep up with. In Amna, you navigate the world through tasks. Links that you access are captured as part of a task. And it only takes one-click to get back into the flow. We have a few ideas for better ways to share things in the future.<p>Our app is built on Electron. It keeps data on your machine. For the browser, we make use of your installed version of Chrome (or Chromium browser). Kind of cool. There is a feedback button in our tool. It&#x27;s far from perfect, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts. Please try it out and provide feedback on our landing page.')
