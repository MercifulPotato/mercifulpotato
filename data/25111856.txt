This is <i>far</i> outside my field of expertise, but here is an analogy: the fact I released 9 games in 9 months a decade ago does not imply that all games can be coded, foley-ed, and art-ed, in one month by a junior developer with Eclipse, Photoshop Elements, Bryce, and Audacity.<p>I assume there are many diseases where the treatment is the equivalent of an indie platformer while others are the equivalent of a AAA-headliner and yet more are the equivalent of currently fictional games like The Oasis.')
