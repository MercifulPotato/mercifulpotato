And a good data scientist, even if they don&#x27;t have quite the engineering chops necessary to build a production-quality ETL, should know enough about the process to help guide it. If they aren&#x27;t a part of that process, they&#x27;re not being a good DS. They can&#x27;t expect someone not involved with their problem to know what tradeoffs to make, and if they don&#x27;t know <i>exactly</i> how their data went from raw form to the ETL-ed form, they&#x27;re probably going to make bad assumptions, and those assumptions may very well make their architected solution a complete pile of garbage. Not to mention, how can a DS offer suggestions for solutions if they aren&#x27;t deeply familiar with the raw data that&#x27;s available?<p>To me, a good data scientist should, at bare minimum, have several skills.<p>* They should first and foremost (but <i>not solely</i>) be an in house expert in statistics and machine learning to know what can be done with data, and what <i>can&#x27;t</i> be done with data. They should arrive with that knowledge. Engineers I think have a tendency to trivialize this, but true expertise in this domain comes only with years of experience.<p>* They should strive to find modeling solutions that are <i>right</i> for a <i>particular business problem</i>. If they seem to be only applying the hottest research regardless of the tradeoffs for the particular business problem, that&#x27;s a red flag.<p>* Their focus should be on integrating themselves with the product&#x2F;business as much as possible, and with the engineering team as much as possible. If they&#x27;re expecting to be handed directives, that&#x27;s a recipe for a ton of wasted time.<p>DS should never, ever be siloed into their own little DS world. They will be useless without a deeply intimate knowledge of the business goals, the needs of product, and the capabilities of the engineering team.<p>As they progress, they should become more and more &quot;full-stack&quot;, otherwise they are stagnating.')
