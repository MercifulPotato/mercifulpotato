Apple will replace them.<p>I got a pair months ago, after using gen-1 AirPods for a couple years. Soon the left AirPod Pro started rattling at certain frequencies. It got worse. I complained to Apple and they sent me a new left â€˜Pod.<p>Soon the right one exhibited the same behavior. This time, I could hear the rattle if I tapped gently on it. Clearly something was physically loose inside it. Apple replace that one, too.<p>I had to argue a little, but less than with most tech support. Now I have two AirPod Pros that work perfectly.')
