(I&#x27;ve seen got in the habbit of doing &quot;apt-get autoremove --purge &amp;&amp; apt-get autoclean&quot; regularly on all machines I manage.<p>The only borked Ubuntu kernel upgrade I&#x27;ve ever seen did not render anything unbootable, but a bad OOM Killer patch caused programs to get spontaneously killed in some cases - and I&#x27;m runnig, and automatically updating, tens of Ubuntu machines automatically all the time.')
