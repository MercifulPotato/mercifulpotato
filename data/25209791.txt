There is little visual consistency or shared UX patterns across apps. I had to hunt down a good font because the one that came installed with Pop and Ubuntu was terrible. Spent a day getting drivers for a wifi card to work. Had graphical flickers due to a bug in picom&#x2F;nvidia that I had to go in and fix. Don&#x27;t even get me started on the app ecosystem - Mac&#x2F;win has stuff like omnifocus, 1password, Alfred, photoshop etc etc. Linux mostly you hope there&#x27;s a web app.<p>There is strong opposition to the idea of paid app stores on Linux but almost all the best software I use is paid, because it takes teams of people working hard to build it. This is actually the most critical issue imo.<p>Linux has come a long way but I think they are understandably reluctant to hear bad news that it&#x27;s still not good enough compared to the alternatives, even if it&#x27;s much much better than it was.')
