This is a physical effect.<p>The big challenge isn&#x27;t to keep things in sync, it&#x27;s to keep the supply equals to the demand. (when we don&#x27;t, the frequency goes up or down depending on which is higher than the other)<p>[1]: in thermal stations only, wind turbines are not directly connected to the grid because their rotation speed depends on the windâ€¦')
