For example, the fossil SCM uses sqlite to store file contents, commit history, deltas and metadata, issue tickets, user access info, custom ticket formats if any, and wiki documentation all in a single file, driven by a single executable. Most applications don&#x27;t have more complex structure than that.

Total win IMO.<p>The argument for this has already been made very well by the sqlite creator.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;appfileformat.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;appfileformat.html</a>')
