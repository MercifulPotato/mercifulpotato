He did not get the tape drive, so it could not save any programmes. It came with a manual that demonstrated how to code in basic.  I recall spending hours typing out code to get a ball bouncing across the screen. From there I convinced my dad to get us a computer. Never look d back since then! Funnily enough I got into Linux by picking up floppy disks with Slackware at a market as well!')
