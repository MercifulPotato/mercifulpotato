Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609257339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570026, text='&gt; As to the DNC stuff, yeah Assange was probabally used by the Russian intelligence, but it was probabally an easy sell. Hillary really did (maybe jokingly?) call for Assange to be assassinated when she was secretary of state. He had every reason in the world to cut off her ascent to power.<p>Hillary&#x27;s joke (if that is what it was) was an assault. She had the means to actually carry out the murder she suggested.  Such actions, even in jest, have been known to cause people to get killed when some subordinate takes it as an order.<p>I think it takes a tremendous lack of empathy to not allow Assange a grudge against someone who quipped about murdering him and potentially the people around him, particularly someone with the awesome power of the united states behind them.<p>Journalists often have their axes to grind and their blind spots.  It isn&#x27;t great but it&#x27;s just something we have to factor in...  and I think this is one that a lot more justifiable than most.<p>And while he may have been used by Russia in the DNC leak, the leak revealed substantial unethical conduct that people were rightfully fired over.  It brought transparency to the world that we deserved.  If its publication depended on some bias on Assange&#x27;s part, I think it wouldn&#x27;t require much bias perhaps only would have been with respect to the timing of it.')
