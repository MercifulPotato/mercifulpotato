Why should I look at &quot;Modern Redux&quot;? Why wasn&#x27;t enough thought put in in the original Redux? Like preommr mentioned, the basic flux model isn&#x27;t that complicated.<p>Why do you guys complicate things? Why do you think new concepts are required? And new terminology? Why do you write so much code? Why don&#x27;t you see how these things have been done in the past? This has been done in Mithril for ages.<p>My suggestion is - next time you guys decide to create something new, don&#x27;t just keep thinking of new concepts and write code. It&#x27;s all been done before. Just make it easier to use.<p>So, no, I&#x27;ll not be looking at Redux, now or in the future. Because I&#x27;ve got applications to deliver and the end user doesn&#x27;t give a shit about how fantastic your architecture is, if it takes ages to understand, implement, maintain &amp; debug.')
