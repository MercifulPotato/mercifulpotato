I&#x27;m not sure why they are doing this, it may just be another way to step around monopoly charges - either way, it&#x27;s cool tech.<p>Apple is the real issue here, because they purposefully cripple any such API, if they ever get around to implementing it(they have far more to lose). Just look at the MDN pages of any API built to facilitate native-like capabilities, you&#x27;ll see them all missing or crippled on mobile Safari.')
