Definitely don&#x27;t buy these GPUs until AFTER ROCm has declared support.<p>The NAVI line was never officially supported by ROCm (though ROCm 3.7 in August seemed to get some compiles working for the 5700 XT, a year after its release).<p>-------<p>Generally speaking, ROCm support only comes to cards that have a &quot;Machine Intelligence&quot; analog. MI50 is similar to Radeon VII, so both cards were supported in ROCm. The Rx 580 was similar to MI8, and therefore both were supported.<p>The Rx 550 had no similar MI card, and had issues that are yet resolved today. Rx 570 had no MI card, but apparently its similar enough to the 580 that I&#x27;m not hearing many issues.<p>In effect: AMD only focuses their software development &#x2F; support on Machine Intelligence cards. The cards that happen to line up to the MI-line happen to work... but the cards outside of the MI line are spotty and inconsistent.')
