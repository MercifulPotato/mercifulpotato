Price has been rising but it&#x27;s worth every penny.<p>You explore personal issues through guided group dynamics. You share and listen to others. By the end of the course, you know more about your group partners&#x27; lives than anyone you&#x27;ve known in &#x27;real life&#x27;.<p>I learned so much about myself, how to deal with my feelings and the impact my experiences&#x2F;impressions have on my performance as a professional, family member and partner.')
