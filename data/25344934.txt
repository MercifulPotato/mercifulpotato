Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607435244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344025, text='&gt; “ Facebook data is valuable only to the extent that it is usable on Facebook”<p>This is an incredibly wrong and misleading section. That data can be processed through data fusion centers and then joined against other data aggregators - all your physical location checkins from Yelp or Foursquare, all your grocery purchase history, what activities you booked on your last vacation.<p>I used to work for a well-known stock photography company and the company collected huge amount of data - browser signatures, upload geolocations, login locations, in addition to the actual images and customer behavior within the product.<p>Most of it was completely unused and one of the senior VPs of engineering was fond of saying we were making “a bet on data.” They had no immediate use for the data, but felt strongly that the larger and more comprehensive they could make an in-house data warehouse, augmented with as many types of data as we could collect, the more valuable it would eventually be in the future for use cases or third party sales that just hadn’t been thought of yet.<p>They are still doing this today with no uses of that data yet (or private uses selling to third parties like Facebook).<p>I can’t believe Stratechery would have an article so completely wrong on the absolute basics of data hoarding.')
