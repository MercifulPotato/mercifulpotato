I am also a self-taught coder and have been coding, mostly in Python, for about 15 years.<p>I also have a passion for curating and systematizing biological knowledge and very much enjoy building databases and tools which streamline analytical workflows. To this end I have developed and published methods for the semi-automated reanalysis of clinical exome sequence data, and also made <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bibliome.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bibliome.ai</a>, a database of genetic variation described in open access literature.<p>Thank you for reading!')
