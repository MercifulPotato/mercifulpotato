Wouldn&#x27;t Google just stop paying for search placement, removing Mozilla&#x27;s main source of income?<p>I get that Chrome isn&#x27;t Google&#x27;s direct source of income, ads are. But, it seems like controlling the web in order to facilitate serving advertisements (e.g. AMP, Extension Manifest v3) is part of its strategy. If Mozilla made a more successful browser, and Mozilla hewed to its stated values, it would just become a threat to Chrome, rather than a harmless surface area for serving ads, and a small opportunity to earn a little good will.<p>From that perspective, it made perfect sense to me that Mozilla has tried to diversify its revenue. The fact that it hasn&#x27;t been successful at doing that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s a bad idea.')
