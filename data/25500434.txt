Even if the incubation and infection time inside this one individual was enough for 1,000,000 generations there&#x27;s no way for something like that to happen.<p>&quot;The accrual of 14 lineage-specific amino acid replacements prior to its detection is, to date, unprecedented in the global virus genomic data for the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;<p>No, this unprecedented on any living and non-living thing that we know.[1]<p>&quot;In all of this, its worth remembering we&#x27;ve never tracked an epidemic in this much detail before, so perhaps this sort of thing is just par for the course.&quot;<p>We tracked very well the flu during its high season, and influenza genomes are used constant to monitor mutations and other aspects of viral evolution, population genetics and phylogeny.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;96&#x2F;24&#x2F;13910" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;96&#x2F;24&#x2F;13910</a>')
