Lots of opinion mixed with a little amount of news and clearly geared against Trump.&quot;</i><p>You don&#x27;t have to be on the left to be critical of Trump.  Plenty of right wingers (including Bush Jr) are critical of him.  He&#x27;s made a lot of enemies all over the political spectrum.<p>To me CNN is basically a right-wing channel, just not as right-wing as FOX.<p>For real left-wing media, watch <i>Democracy Now!</i> or read <i>The Nation</i>.')
