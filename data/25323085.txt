Nor is it okay to constantly refer to their nationalities in such a broad sense, it says several times &quot;the Moroccans&quot; are doing this or that. They KNOW perfectly well how their target audience is going to read that, they&#x27;re not going to think about actual organised crime, but just eye their Moroccan-born neighbour more suspiciously.')
