With manual duplex printing mistakes can cost a significant proportion of paper and may require significant amounts of effort to do correctly.<p>I currently have a Brother HL-2140 (also has HL-21 model number) and it has &#x27;manual duplex&#x27;.  This means if I want to save paper I have to mark a corner of the first page before printing and see what orientation it prints compared to that mark (it is not intuitive).  I have been printing one page at a time because of this, although now I have written this down I realise I could do better.')
