This popup has now been removed.<p>I think a lot of developers may have clicked on <i>Reject</i>, though removing tracking cookies will not absolve GitHub of the requirement to continue asking for informed and free consent under GDPR, if they will continue to process personal data, and share it with third-party services from their servers.<p>The current website code points to the same data still being sent to GitHub, only the implementation has changed.')
