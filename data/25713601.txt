They&#x27;d be removed, parent called, expelled so that all other kids can have fruitful discussions.<p>But somehow here we are discussing that the exact analogue in social media is somehow worthy of protection and being allowed to yell, spread disinformation and incite literal domestic terrorism, sedition and insurrection.<p>My European perspective on this is that speech should be as free as possible without crossing some strict borders. And for me, these borders clearly are calls for violence or destruction of the state. A democracy cannot exist without compromise.<p>Republicans and their far-right extremist equals in Europe are not willing or ready to achieve compromise. For decades it has been an &quot;Us vs. them&quot; instead of finding an optimal compromise. Their mode of operation is disrupt, gaslight, object. No matter how objectively true things are (climate change, Corona...)<p>It&#x27;s not conservatism itself that is bad but at least since Reagan, the shape of conservatism in the US has become inhuman and disgusting. And the GOP is celebrating itself for it, cumulating in the terrorist MAGA cult.')
