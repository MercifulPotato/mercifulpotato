What you see are precisely tiny &quot;corner&quot; reflectors formed by large enough gravel, rocks and building structures.  On a mountainous area, as long as you have some rocks and gravel here and there, you are still able to find correlations--and thus interferences.  Of course, if all you have is wet mud and vegetation there&#x27;s nothing to do, but this is not often the case.  In a region of special interest like near a mine, people often install ad-hoc corner reflectors at calibrated positions.')
