Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609144333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557554, text='&gt;What exactly gives you the right to do that? And why is your reason any better than a different one provided by someone else who wants to argue the opposite?<p>Why use science if it won&#x27;t work without assuming the principles it&#x27;s built on are not true? We assume science is true, we established that logic cannot be established to be true. Thus if logic cannot be established to be true, then science cannot be established to be true, then why do we use science?<p>The only other conclusion is we &quot;assume&quot; science is true and therefore &quot;assume&quot; logic is true even though we can&#x27;t truly know if it&#x27;s true.<p>&gt;We&#x27;ve now turned science into dogma. At what point do we then need to become aware that we&#x27;re pretending? Surely there comes a point where pretending costs us epistemic legitimacy. Where is that point? And what response do we offer to an interlocutor who insists the earth is flat and our logical deduction of it&#x27;s spherical shape is &quot;pretend&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m not a philosopher. I&#x27;m not into epistemology as I&#x27;m not even entirely sure what it is. SO if you dive into that world too deeply the argument is over because I can&#x27;t argue with something I don&#x27;t know about. Either you explain your points in layman terms or the argument can&#x27;t proceed very far because I won&#x27;t be able to understand you.<p>I&#x27;m just saying that &quot;pretending&quot; is the same thing as &quot;assuming&quot; We don&#x27;t actually know if something is true, but we still use science as if it&#x27;s true. The contradiction is what allows us to use the word &quot;pretend&quot; we know that it cannot be known yet we act as if it is known. Hence &quot;pretend&quot;<p>&gt;Both of these statements are nonsensical and are debunked in the Critique of Pure Reason.<p>Well declaring a statement nonsensical doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me without you explaining the reasoning behind your declaration. Citing a book won&#x27;t really do anything for me because I haven&#x27;t read the book. We&#x27;re at a dead end here. Obviously I won&#x27;t read the book because it&#x27;s too long to read right now and obviously you won&#x27;t explain the book for the same reason, so for this point the argument is over... we reached an impasse and can only agree to disagree unless you decide to explain the book to me.<p>&gt;I have a feeling we&#x27;re dealing with a small bit of motivated reasoning with respect to interestingness here.<p>I&#x27;m interested up to a point. If the point is a paradox I&#x27;m not interested in exploring the paradox. If that&#x27;s the direction you&#x27;re taking your argument then it&#x27;s an impasse. Either way we&#x27;re just debating nomenclature here.')
