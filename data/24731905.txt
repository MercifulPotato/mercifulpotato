Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=[24732440], score=None, time=1602262786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24730191, text='Another of my unpopular opinions is that wind power is an abysmally bad capital investment with a terrible ROI (when not heavily subsidized) and even worse EROEI, and all that circus about H2 is a new way to meddle with the financial numbers to paint a rosy (greeny?) future where H2 comes to the rescue before the veil falls. It can only work as long as we have no supply crunch on hydrocarbons.<p>I understand peak renewable at negative prices as an artefact of the market structure. If comes a time when there&#x27;s actual supply problems on hydrocarbons, we&#x27;ll need some other sensible way to provide a baseline, and so far only nuclear does. Furthermore, even for H2 production nuclear probably makes more sense than wind power.')
