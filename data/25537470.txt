The first time I query, it doesnt give results. Then I query it again and it shows all results (same query, pressing the search icon again). This is stealthy censorship and an unsuspecting person wouldn&#x27;t notice.<p>This doesn&#x27;t happen for any other query. And it only happens with my work ip address, not a VPN.<p>Edit2: Still not working for me, I have to query it twice to get the results. Maybe this is happening for selected ip addresses. This doesn&#x27;t happen when I use a VPN.')
