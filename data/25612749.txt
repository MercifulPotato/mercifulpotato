Item(by='AnssiH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609594652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612487, text='&gt; I kinda agree with you - it will be the case even within the EU (albeit with fewer steps) that VAT for anything must be collected and remitted from the sales country to the purchasers country.<p>But unlike the UK import VAT scheme, the EU system will <i>not</i> be mandatory for sellers in all countries worldwide.<p>&gt; It doesn’t take much imagination to see that this could be expanded worldwide, and that as well as paying postage you must also pay the tax to the carrier to submit. This is analogous to how some countries charge arrival &#x2F; passenger taxes. (UK APD, US - various ‘security’ and ‘arrivals’ fees) You usually pay this to the airline and they must pay it on your behalf.<p>One can hope :)')
