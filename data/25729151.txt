Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610375076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725193, text='&gt;  Once an undergraduate is cleared to move in, they must not leave campus for the rest of the term. This should be fairly easy.<p>Maybe CalTech is very different, but I truly cannot imagine this at MIT. Students go out and party, even at top programs that have a disproportionate number of &quot;traditionally nerdy&quot; people.<p>Further, students aren&#x27;t the only people present. Faculty exist, and some of them can bring Covid into the bubble. Administrators and staff exist, and some of them can bring Covid into the bubble. Once a few students are infected the &quot;don&#x27;t leave campus&quot; plan does not achieve much of anything. You mention daily tests, but you can be infectious before a test is positive. And faculty will throw a fit about this.<p>&gt; At Caltech, every undergraduate could understand the science and the mathematical models behind the policy, and see that it is correct.<p>There are STEM faculty at top universities who can&#x27;t seem to understand the basics of how the pandemic functions. I cannot possibly imagine that every single 18-year-old who is smart and interested in science is going to be able to resist the enormous amount of misinformation about the pandemic and stay-at-home orders.<p>&gt; Same for MIT and Harvey Mudd on the science aspect, although I&#x27;m not quite sure about MIT. MIT does offer undergraduate degrees in quite a few fields that aren&#x27;t STEM, such as music, theater arts, global studies and languages, and several others, and I&#x27;m not sure how much STEM people in those majors have to take.<p>This is crossing a STEMlord line for me. Where my wife works, her department (in the humanities) has more teachers choosing to teach online than the computer science and physics departments. I think you are enormously quick to treat fresh out of high school engineering students as rational actors and everybody else as ignorant buffoons.')
