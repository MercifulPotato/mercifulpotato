For several years it seemed that KryoFlux would be the sole dominant USB floppy controller, nice to see there&#x27;s a range of options available.<p>Edit: seems as though FluxEngine may gain support for using GreaseWeazle hardware[2] at some point, which would be neat!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25656283" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25656283</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25675381" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25675381</a>')
