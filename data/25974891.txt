Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612056951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958338, text='&quot;HN&quot; isn&#x27;t a person or even a coherent group. It can&#x27;t &quot;consider&quot; anything anything. If you mean that a subset of HN users post  things as horrible as you&#x27;re describing, that&#x27;s no doubt true, as it is on any large, open internet forum. The intersection of the long tail and the bottom of the barrel produces a lot of dreck here, the vast majority of which gets downvoted and&#x2F;or flagged and&#x2F;or moderated and&#x2F;or autokilled. Some inevitably still gets through, but people should be telling us about those cases so we can moderate them. We can&#x27;t see everything that gets posted here.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that such a subset of users is representative of the whole, or even anywhere close to 10%, of this community. If I&#x27;m wrong about that I&#x27;m certainly open to changing my mind, but that would require real data. People&#x27;s generalized pronouncements about HN are unreliable, and the unreliability is proportional to the intensity and confidence of the pronouncement. In most cases someone has seen a few egregious cases and then makes a generalization about the entire community. The pain of running into egregious comments is real, needs to be taken seriously, and we really do take it seriously (and I&#x27;m sorry that you don&#x27;t feel that we doâ€”that really sucks). But the generalization is a non sequitur.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20%22false%20feelings%20of%20generality%22&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=by%3Adang%20notice%20dislike&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...</a><p>It even used to be a sport on Twitter for awhile to find the most egregious HN comments that hadn&#x27;t been moderated yet and then pass them around as examples of things the HN moderators &quot;agree&quot; with (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20twitter%20sport&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>). But of course we don&#x27;t. Anyone can look through the moderation comments and if they find even one example of us doing anything other than trying to get people to recognize and respect each other&#x27;s humanity, I&#x27;d like to see it. We&#x27;ve written thousands of emails trying to do the same.<p>The assumption that we see everything that gets posted here is false, as is the assumption that there&#x27;s any way to stop anyone from making an account and posting what they choose. It takes time for moderation mechanisms to kick in. That&#x27;s the way an open forum is, and if you think about it, it&#x27;s rather amazing that HN <i>isn&#x27;t</i> dominated by such shit.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=likeliest%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...</a>')
