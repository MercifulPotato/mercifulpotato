We don&#x27;t actually have to cut anything even though we should. Hope budget increases below inflation as much as possible. Other countries have done it, why can&#x27;t we? This means that programs that automatic increases built in don&#x27;t get them if it pushes the budge past the limit.<p>This is not austerity, this is returning to proper budgeting where we don&#x27;t use baseline budgeting which is how Congress lies to the American people with claims a program has been reduced.')
