Item(by='mhd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604430494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977584, text='&gt; The tools are there, learn to use them Luke.<p>That&#x27;s the, excuse my Huttese, friggin&#x27; point. We had versions of those tools for ages. And once we even had high hopes of using them outside of a dev&#x27;s context -- the aforementioned OpenDoc for example, but even early Linux DE&#x27;s seemed to have some intentions of going that route. I remember using the GNOME CORBA implementation because I needed something that would compile with a proprietary workstation C compiler (no C++).<p>And it&#x27;s not even hard to see why we&#x27;re not doing it -- money and bikeshedding. We&#x27;re selling apps. Heck, we&#x27;ve gone a step beyond that and don&#x27;t even do that anymore, we&#x27;re selling services now. There are two environments where you could go beyond that -- made for hire enterprise software and open source (I&#x27;ve given up on academia, especially after the bachelor-splosion). But that&#x27;s where the second part comes in play -- most enterprises have given up on trying to come up with some overarching architecture, things are moving too fast and there are too many managers.<p>Whereas there are too few in open source. Never mind that a lot of open source these days is just commercial turds, github profiling and heavily influenced by what you&#x27;re doing in your day job.<p>Conway&#x27;s Law is really screwing us over.<p>Yes, we have all the tools to e.g. create a desktop where you could have your favorite editor widget in all contexts, where interoperation isn&#x27;t just dropping stuff into UTF-8 files, to be massaged by scripts and other applications.<p>I doubt that it will get better. There&#x27;s a whole generation starting to fill the FAANG bullpens that never saw anything beyond the cordoned appscapes of their indistinguishable mobile devices. Maybe someone will notice that &quot;hey, I&#x27;m using this insanely clever federated way of connecting my microservices with &lt;rpc-du-jour&gt;, what if...&quot;. Probably will end up on something like the suckless&#x2F;unixpr*n pages and go a few steps too far, banging ASCII rocks together to summon the holy gopher.')
