To give a time frame around this time there were companies like Circuit City was busted with the rise of Fry&#x27;s Electronics.  I&#x27;m unsure if Best Buy&#x27;s was a thing at the time. The look of the Thinkpads are still very similar to ones today, but of course very modernized to times then.<p>I would very much appreciate who might be able to weigh in their experience who has used both a Thinkpad and a Macbook book as primary machines.  It&#x27;s been a while since I last purchased a pc-based laptop and would like to explore options again.  Another I was interested in the past include Alienware.')
