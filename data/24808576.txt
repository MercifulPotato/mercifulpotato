You&#x27;d manually have to select the USB device to boot from to continue, which would lead you to the wizard of whatever Linux distro you chose (Ubuntu based ones have &quot;install X alongside Windows&quot; option in there).<p>You could theoretically also shrink a disk partition for a Linux install from a Windows system, but Windows doesn&#x27;t recognise Linux filesystems (like ext4) natively. As a result, you can&#x27;t go any further with installing Linux, and I don&#x27;t know if you can mess around the bootloader to point it to GRUB.<p>That&#x27;s talking about dual boot of course, because I&#x27;m pretty sure you can&#x27;t completely replace a Windows install from a running Windows system.')
