Will I be tier 1, or<p>I think what I&#x27;d say in defense is that we&#x27;ve misunderstood what search engines are useful for. They&#x27;re really bad at helping us discover new things. Your blog might be awesome, but it&#x27;s not going to be easy for a search engine to tell that it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s going to have to compete with other blogs that also want views, some of whom are going to be better than yours at SEO, and so on.<p>What a search engine <i>might</i> be able to tell is that it&#x27;s <i>useful</i>. Because what search engines are at least potentially good at is answering questions. You do that by having a list of known good sites to answer specific types of questions, and looking at the sites they link to. It&#x27;s when you try to do both (index everything on the web and provide accurate answers to specific questions) that you end up failing to do either. For example this is the #2 result for &quot;python f strings&quot; on DDG[1]. It&#x27;s total garbage, and, quoting the blog, &quot;we can do better&quot;. (This result is also on page 1 for the same query on Google.)<p>What I believe ddevault is suggesting is that we make a search engine that does the only thing search engines are really good at, answering questions. You throw away the idea of indexing everything on the web, and therefore the possibility of &quot;discovery&quot;. What that means is that in 2020 you need some other mechanism for discovering new sites, bloggers, and so on. Fortunately we do have some alternatives in that space.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t know if I 100% buy this argument, but I think it&#x27;s the general idea behind what&#x27;s being suggested in this blog post.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careerkarma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;python-f-string&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careerkarma.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;python-f-string&#x2F;</a>')
