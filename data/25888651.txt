I&#x27;m growing more leery of allowing gmail to search what I do through their service so I want to begin switching over to the other account.  That said, I don&#x27;t want one account which could eventually get overrun with spam.  I&#x27;d like to keep a main address for Bills&#x2F;Important stuff, maybe one for shopping, one for blogs, etc.  Do you do anything like this?   If so, any advice?  Thanks!')
