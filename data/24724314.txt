My kids can&#x27;t go to school. I barely go to the store. Even going for a walk is tricky, as unless you take massive precautions (which I&#x27;m fine with, btw) everyone yells at you. I basically have no human contact outside my family, and it&#x27;s been like this for six months. So, yeah, for me the situation couldn&#x27;t really get much more quarantined.')
