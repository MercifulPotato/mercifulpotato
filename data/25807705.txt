Item(by='deanCommie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610852857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25805797, text='&gt; &gt; especially if it&#x27;s only reserved for the local in-group, see: southern &quot;hospitality&quot;<p>&gt; can you explain that?<p>I think you touched upon it in your last paragraph acknowledging being white and kiwi.<p>It is such an overwhelming force of human friendliness and welcomeness, that you assume it must be genuine human connection.<p>Except try being gay, black, or an atheist, and see how quickly all that turns...<p>As far as the rest of your points, I think you&#x27;re exaggerating a bit. Most people (at least in north america) don&#x27;t mind being micro-friendly as part of a service job. Sure, yes, it&#x27;s &quot;required&quot;, but the ratio of monstrous leering arseholes is not high, and while it&#x27;s tiring to be friendly by the end of a long workday at a grocery store, people don&#x27;t feel it to be a fundamentally dehumanizing act.<p>I think the bigger problem with tipping is situations where it allows employers to pay less than minimum wage - that is abhorent. Getting a tip shouldn&#x27;t be a requirement to get to a living wage. But as an incentive to being a little more engaged with your job? I think it&#x27;s good.<p>&gt; Edit: in my experience Canadians and New Zealanders have similar outlooks.<p>We are alike in many ways. We both live in the shadow of a larger, brasher arrogant power who dismisses us, and people on the other side of the world lump us in together with them.<p>But no, when it comes to restaurants, service culture, tipping, and micro-friendliness in public Canadians are much closer to Americans than to New Zealanders.')
