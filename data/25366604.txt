This is when one example for speech that is perceived as acceptable to censor is used to justify <i>personal beliefs</i> about <i>other</i> speech.<p>&quot;Fire in a crowded theater, and therefore you cannot claim that the election is disputed&quot;. The claim that some speech is not protected is not the same as the claim that because of that some other particular speech is not protected. There has to be a fundamental similarity between two sets of circumstances such that they can both be prevented for the same reason. &quot;Not all speech is protected, that is not in dispute, but the speech you&#x27;re claiming isn&#x27;t protected actually is&quot; would be the problem.')
