To be born Native American today is to be born with higher likelihoods of poverty, alcoholism, low life expectancy, etc. These disparities are to some degree (how much is a hotly debated topic down political lines) a consequence of white people treating native peoples like shit (vast simplification) for ~500 years.<p>Prevailing thought on the American political left is that since taking away native land illegally (and other atrocities) created these disparities, giving them their land back is the just and obvious thing to do (this conclusion is much debated). The left feels, generally, that disparities are unnatural, caused by those in power (white settlers and their descendants), and are to be stamped out. The political right, as best I can tell, both doesn’t agree with that assessment and doesn’t care.<p>To integrate fully would be the ultimate subjugation: to accept the destruction of a culture and way of life they care deeply about that has already been almost totally taken from them by force. The political left believes this shouldn’t be demanded of an already downtrodden people.<p>Re your Europe question: I believe the thinking goes that natives there are rich, so why should they have more even more land rights? The political poles are flipped, the political left sees no injustice to be fixed by empowering the privileged.<p>I’m a white American, so my opinion should be discounted appropriately.')
