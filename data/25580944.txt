Or at least an explanation that does not require prior knowledge of (what seem like) niche concepts.<p>&gt;  &quot;It surfaces content related to the node you&#x27;re visiting using a lightweight fanout convention&quot;<p>Requires knowledge of what exactly a &quot;node&quot; constitutes in this context. Since I don&#x27;t know what such a node is, the remaining part of the sentence about the fanout convention is just meaningless (it also seems irrelevant?).<p>Now, it is explained on Agora what a node is, namely:<p>&gt; &quot;A node is the set of all subnodes with a given title, or otherwise mapping to a single entity or wikilink. Subnodes can come from a variety of sources; currently these are mostly notes as volunteered by users via their independent digital gardens.&quot;<p>This suffers from the same problems: I still don&#x27;t know what a node is, since I would need to know what a subnode is. I&#x27;d expect a recursive relation where a subnode is simply a node that is a child of a node, but it seems there is a distinction between both. In any case, it&#x27;s still unclear.<p>It seems as if it&#x27;s written by someone who&#x27;s so familiar with these concepts that they forgot what it&#x27;s like to not have this background knowledge. I&#x27;d recommend letting someone without prior knowledge explain to you what they think it is in simple terms, and build your explanation from that.')
