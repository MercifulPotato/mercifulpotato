So there are now lots of Blond Aryans with Long Noses and Blue Eyes who declared to be Saami. They had sole right to have reindeers and have fishing fleets. Ethnic Finns, for example, did not have those rights, they were not even allowed to fish independently.<p>If you Google Saami, they look really different in Norway and Russia. This is also why Max von Sydow was able to play reindeer-herder in some movie :-)')
