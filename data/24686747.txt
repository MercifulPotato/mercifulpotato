Your scenario works great, if the hardware supports that use case and you&#x27;re not using some intermediate software layer that prevents you from taking full advantage of the hardware.<p>Other scenario is when Windows is being used to control something time critical. I fully agree one shouldn&#x27;t do that, but sometimes you just have to. The new timer change really hurts here.<p>In other words, we don&#x27;t live in the perfect world, but still need to get the software working.<p>I also feel like we&#x27;re somewhat talking past each other.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s kind of bizarre to see you trying to interject into it to argue with me as if you know his situation better than himself while even contradicting his descriptions in the process.<p>I do know highly similar cases I&#x27;ve had to deal with. Not audio processing, but similarly tight deadlines. It was very painful to get it working correctly.')
