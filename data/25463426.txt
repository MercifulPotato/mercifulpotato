This one:<p><pre><code>    if (file == null) throw new Error(&quot;File must exist&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nis literally one character less code than this one:<p><pre><code>    let file = file.ok_or(Error::new(&quot;File must exist&quot;))?;\n</code></pre>\nand seems to be easier to &#x27;read&#x27;, but that&#x27;s of course in the eye of the beholder.<p>More generally, accepting an optional file seems a bit bizarre; shouldn&#x27;t the job of dealing with am missing file value be done by the caller?')
