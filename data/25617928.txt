Item(by='euler_angles', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609632093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617309, text='&gt; My understanding is that if you take away the stealth aspect the F-35 is a sluggish fighter bomber that would be outperformed by most 4th gens. Considering an F-35 is nearly the price of 10 4th gen fighters the choice to &quot;upgrade&quot; becomes pretty suspect for a lot of Nato partners.<p>First, &quot;4th generation&quot; can mean anything from an F-16A from 1978 to an F-16V of today. An F-16V is actually <i>more</i> expensive than an F-35A.<p>Second, if you take away the stealth of the F-35 it still has:<p>* A highly capable APG-81 radar with features like low-probability of intercept transmission modes, electronic attack (jamming) capability, multi-target track, ground moving target indication&#x2F;track, synthetic aperture radar mapping, and passive (receive only) track capability<p>* Integrated electro-optical targeting pod with laser designator and range finder.<p>* Integrated software defined radio that can handle communications on UHF, VHF, Link-16, and inter-flight MADL<p>* 4 pi steradian awareness Distributed Aperture System that&#x27;s a mid-wave IRST and missile launch&#x2F;missile warning system<p>* Integrated Electronic Support Measures suite that provides Band 4&#x2F;Band 5 detection and single ship rangefinding of incoming RF<p>F-16V has most of this same stuff or functional equivalents, but you pay tens of millions <i>more</i> to get it.')
