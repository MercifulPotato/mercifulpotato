Other Hackernews”—as it calls commenters—“think that this plane would have worked better if it were designed by programmers with a tendency to work late for free. A majority of the comments are Hackernews incorrecting one another about FAA regulations, avionics, and lift.”</i>&quot;<p>That&#x27;s brilliant! :-D  I&#x27;ll have to check out N-gate.<p>Oh, this post? Typical newyorker puff piece, too long to read and unrelated to technology. Someone should flag it.')
