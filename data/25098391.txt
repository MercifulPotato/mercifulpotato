It’s not like I can opt out of having a social security number. It’s forced on us and then we can get completely screwed over if someone we didn’t even know had the info allows it to be breached. Also this nonsense about allowing government contractors in and out of information critical systems like that needs to go away. It’s only done because they can’t attract talent with competitive government wages.')
