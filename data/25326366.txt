Compose v3 exists to push you towards swarm, whereas compose v2 exists to make docker-compose a complete mini cluster management tool, and succeeds at it in my experience.<p>We continue to use v2.4 in all our projects today because it allows you do easily do things like define startup order with healthchecks, as well as limit cpu, memory, etc. without having to spin up a whole swarm cluster.')
