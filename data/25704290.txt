This often leads to a kind of stalemate in the debates.<p>And like you say, nobody is allowed to be wrong or fail in politics anymore, which means we&#x27;re not allowed to experiment at the local or regional level, or to rollback policies, or just have any kind of rational retrospective. Nope, now it&#x27;s all ideological, like religion, you can&#x27;t possibly push a policy that failed, or have a bad idea. That just means you&#x27;re weak and shall be casted away for the better sharlatan to take your place, he is never wrong, if you doubt how right he is, you shall be jailed or mocked, if his policies don&#x27;t work, we shall endure them and believe in them even harder.')
