Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=[25423682], score=None, time=1607979157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25421928, text='&gt; As a side note, I&#x27;d be curious what happens when LLVM sees something like: `void &lt;asterisk&gt;p = &amp;p` which is a self-referential pointer. What does it deduce about it? Does it optimize it away?<p>Why would it do anything special here? This is not really different from something like this:<p><pre><code>    struct a { struct a *p; };\n    struct a x = { &amp;a };\n</code></pre>\nThe only real difference is that the void version involves a cast, because the type is otherwise impossible to express in C.')
