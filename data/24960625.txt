They could pay lawyers and millions in fees outfighting the taxi industry. In some countries the Taxi mafia did succeed in outing Uber and Lyft, in some places Uber had such force that they eventually won once someone else got elected.<p>I didn’t quite realize why Uber needed gazillions of dollars, but once a friend told me a significant of their expenses were legal&#x2F;permit related expenses, that made sense. They had so much money, they could keep on paying fines and keep on growing.<p>I’m glad the Silicon Valley complex is able to churn out Ubers and AirBnBs every now and then. Although they create other second order problems, it’s good to see customers have more choice.')
