If I ask for source on the claim and they say &quot;It&#x27;s in the logs, go see for yourself?&quot;, my, and most other people on this sites assumption is &quot;This person has no evidence of this claim, or any evidence they do have is eminently debunkable&quot;. Handwaving the claim away as &quot;It&#x27;s obvious&quot; when to most people, &quot;no it isn&#x27;t obvious whatsoever&quot;, or in the worst case &quot;It obviously is not&quot;, marks you at best as uninterested in having a real conversation, at worst a conspiracy theorist.')
