One collects COVID symptoms from kids attending childcare centres and the other allows users to send SMS from Google sheets.  I&#x27;ve made a total of $5 from both (first customer for SMS tool last month).<p>I had a lot of interest in the symptom screening tool, but then my provincial government changed the rules so child care centres didn&#x27;t need to collect symptoms.  I have 2 centres using it and I just cover the bills.  I&#x27;ve told them they can use it for free.  Probably more of a hassle to collect the $10&#x2F;month from them.')
