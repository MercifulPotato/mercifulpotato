I think I&#x27;ve watched every interview with him I could find on Youtube.<p>He&#x27;s actually very deep into the metaphysical stuff, in particular he has a deep understanding of Christianity. This is my favorite interview with him: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SO_00POR-Po" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SO_00POR-Po</a><p>Yarvin is a much deeper thinker than what those quotes would suggest. He&#x27;s very much focused on the nature of power and he&#x27;s extremely well-read. Every time I watch a new interview with him I end up buying another book or two. I recently finished The Machiavellians by James Burnham which is the book he always recommends people read. Yarvin actually invented the terms &quot;redpill&quot; and &quot;bluepill&quot; interestingly.<p>As far as Nick Land goes, I will check him out. I see that he tends to be associated with Yarvin so I am surprised I&#x27;ve never heard of him. I tend to view &quot;scientific racism&quot; (and when I use that term I assign no moral weight to it) as a trap. On a purely rational level I can understand the logic behind the ideas but when you introduce the irrational dimension (e.g. the Imago Dei for starters) it becomes a lot harder to defend. Thomas Sowell actually does a good job delegitimizing many aspects of that approach on a rational level in his studies that compare wealth and income within racial groups but across cultures (e.g. Chinese within China vs Chinese in Southeast Asia or even American blacks in the 1940s vs American blacks today). Nassim Taleb has argued very forcefully that the idea of IQ is complete pseudoscience.<p>But yes, any person that the Cathedral (a term from Yarvin) goes after is someone at least worth looking into.')
