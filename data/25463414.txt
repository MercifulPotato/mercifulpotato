However, the logic only works if the worker in question had a higher paying job prior to getting the job at amazon. If the worker got paid less, or was previous unemployed, then the the act of amazon hiring him reduced the government&#x27;s burden. Also, let&#x27;s say amazon replaced his job with a robot. Now the worker won&#x27;t be on amazon&#x27;s payroll and he&#x27;s no longer amazon&#x27;s problem, but now there&#x27;s one more unemployed person and less money being paid out to workers.
