Long walks help too. Or temporary short walks.<p>Or if you&#x27;re not a distance runner yet, it&#x27;s okay to jog slow and take frequent walk breaks. In a lot of ways, volume is way more important than intensity.<p>My healthcare plan gave me a watch that reminds me to walk 500 steps every hour or so, and a daily goal of walking 10000 steps. That small nudge has made me way more consistent, because I&#x27;m a cheap asshole who likes the idea of saving $3 on my healthcare plan every day.<p>There was a study that says you make better car buying decisions if you do a crossword puzzle instead of sit there and think about buying a car.
