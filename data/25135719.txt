Yeah sure, but I don&#x27;t really need it.<p>&gt;the display is probably terrible if they’re using a TV<p>why would it be?<p>&gt; paying money if you want to play multiplayer<p>I usually buy ps+ when it is discounted, so I pay about $5 in a month and I usually get two free games for that price.<p>&gt;you paid an exorbitant price for a game that is rarely on sale<p>You can buy ps4 games secondhand usually half price if you wait  a month after the release, at least in the uk. Also, even AAA titles are heavily discounted during the summer sale on ps4.<p>So you probably payed much more for hardware upgrades than I payed for the console and for the games in the last 7 years since ps4 is out :)')
