There have been a couple of specific things. Exchange and now MDM profiles. Probably a few others. But minor tweaks to remove <i>major</i> enterprise blockers. Small investments to remove complete showstoppers is just common sense.<p>&gt;Apple hasn’t offered some sort of build&#x2F;test service themselves and integrated it into TestFlight<p>Seems pretty logical.
