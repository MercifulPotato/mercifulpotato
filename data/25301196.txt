Item(by='klmr', descendants=None, kids=[25302243], score=None, time=1607081343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300310, text='At my last job interview I had to implement popcount and explain how to optimise it (amongst other things).<p>I was able to jot down a naïve implementation and the obvious optimisation based on a lookup tables. I only <i>vaguely</i> remembered the Bit Twiddling treatment of the subject but, with a bit of nudging from the interviewer, I managed to implement and explain the variant that runs in O(set bits) (“Brian Kernighan&#x27;s way”). I got the job.<p>Now, it’s fashionable to deride this this kind of code interview as unrealistic and unhelpful. But in my <i>first</i> week on the job, by sheer coincidence, I had to use the function. Obviously there are existing, efficient implementations, including intrinsics. But knowing how to derive an efficient implementation certainly didn’t harm. My job has since evolved into different responsibilities but low-level algorithmic knowledge is still important. I’m not sure testing for it in job interviews is generally a good idea, and designing good job interviews is certainly a big topic. But in my particular case it happened to be a relevant, fair test of my abilities.')
