But you&#x27;ll never get to the level of, say, an a7iii+85mm1.4 even for portraits, even in good light.<p>In any case, good enough and better are two very different words. I really enjoy taking pictures on an ILC much more and the results I get are noticeably better even in portraits, including by people that don&#x27;t know what I took it with. For example, good luck emulating the look of a 135mm f&#x2F;2.8 (at night) with an iPhone if we&#x27;re talking about portraits, or good luck doing better than a 50mm 1.4 for street, good luck doing better than a 70-200 2.8, and so on.<p>But yes, it has a much lower skill ceiling and often more consistent results, and it really does get close.')
