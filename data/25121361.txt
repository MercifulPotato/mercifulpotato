Item(by='ghego1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605602002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109098, text='I am italian, I am slightly lactose intolerant, and I think this video is both terribly wrong and quite offensive.<p>First, the whole thing is based on a wrong assumption. It is not true that italians do not drink cappuccino after 11 o clock. This should be rephrased as follows: &quot;why italians do not drink cappuccino after breakfast, whenever that is&quot;. I&#x27;ll give you the quickest example I can think of. When I was way younger, on holidays I would go party in the night and wake up way late and I would have breakfast very late, let&#x27;s say at the time of lunch. I would still order a cappuccino if I felt like it. That&#x27;s because, is short, time is... relative! The same applies of course to anyone having night shifts and any other scenario you can think of.<p>To support the first argument I&#x27;ll also add that italians would never have a cappuccino after they had breakfast, even if it&#x27;s still early in the morning. Usually an Italian will have a cappuccino early before work, and then a coffee in the coffee break at mid morning. I wouldn&#x27;t imagine that anyone would get a cappuccino then, even if it&#x27;s before 11 am, and even if they did not have a cappuccino before.<p>So why do italians do no drink cappuccino after breakfast? Simply put, for the same reason in any given meal in western culture no one would eat the desert before the main course in any given meal. I would say it&#x27;s a cultural thing, but we can call it as we want, the only sure thing is that it has nothing to do with lactose.<p>Before anyone replies that the order of servings in meals is not comparable to the time at which is admissible to drink cappuccino, please consider that we italians are very very very observant&#x2F;proud&#x2F;aware of what&#x2F;when we eat.<p>In Italy there are hundreds of other non written rules like this for many other types of food, and like this one, most of them are part of the culture. There are literally too many examples to make, so I&#x27;ll give you just this: go to Bologna and ask for some spaghetti with the bolognese sauce. If you are lucky they&#x27;ll simply call you a &quot;tourist&quot;. The bolognese sauce can be put on any kind of pasta, except spaghetti. This is very little known and the weirdest part is that all around the world the bolognese sauce became famous with the spaghetti, but I can assure you that no one from bologna will ever have the bolognese sauce on spaghetti. Why? In the end is only a cultural thing. Even if I must add that saying that it&#x27;s only a cultural thing makes me feel dirty, because putting the bolognese sauce on spaghetti is actually a sin.<p>Having said that, I hope the message got through and please, do enjoy food, especially italian food, whenever you feel like it and however you like it!')
