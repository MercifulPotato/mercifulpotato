So, a lot of price setting is guessing. It&#x27;s often not cost-based. And often, negotiations will arbitrarily shift high prices over to one service type, eg Blue Cross will say: &quot;Fine, if you want to get paid that much for knee replacements, we get a lower rate for bariatric surgery.&quot; So you&#x27;ll find weird price discrepancies within the same provider.')
