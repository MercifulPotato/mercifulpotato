Essentially all coins that share a proof of work with a larger coin are constantly at risk of a 51% attack. We&#x27;ve seen it before with bitcoin forks.<p>Proof of work&#x27;s security properties are broken for everything that isn&#x27;t BTC, ETH (although this will change soon) and whatever the dominate CPU coin is (Monero?)')
