For example, the 2008 recession was linked with over 260,000 excess deaths from cancer alone [0]. All of the things associated with a lockdown - high stress, decreased social contact, less movement, less economic activity - are also associated with serious increases in other deaths. At what point does a lockdown have negative EV in terms of general public health?<p>To copy a previous comment of mine - regardless of the actual effect of lockdowns, I think this has become such a political issue in the US that the American left would be very hard pressed to publicly change course.<p>I really hope that statisticians are able to look past their own personal convictions and look at possible ways our assumptions may have been incorrect. (Personally speaking, I wear a mask, I don&#x27;t think the coronavirus is a giant conspiracy by the lizard people etc. but I do recognize that the modern scientific community has a tendency to think one way, and then remain cemented in that way for a while.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsph.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;economic-downturn-excess-cancer-deaths-atun&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsph.harvard.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;economic-do...</a>')
