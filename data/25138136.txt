Now, granted it&#x27;s difficult to trust their official statements on anything because of how easily they lie thinking everyone else is too stupid to see through it. But I&#x27;d think if covid were actually a problem there word would get out eventually.<p>I understand they put some pretty severe restrictions in place initially, though.
