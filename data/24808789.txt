Item(by='notahacker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602927417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807408, text='But Thatcher seeking economic advice from an economist, Tory backbenchers finding Hilton a ridiculous figure and SPADs regularly getting fired by their seniors are not remotely similar to Cummings taking personal responsibility for firing the Chancellor&#x27;s employees and holding press conferences to tell the public they&#x27;re wrong to be upset at him for breaking lockdown. If my argument was that PMs never listened to their advisers before you might have a counter example; but my point is that advisers whose behaviour in their personal life has a direct measurable impact on polling support for the government don&#x27;t, in normal circumstances, keep their jobs, never mind do public briefings in the Rose Garden. I&#x27;m not sure why my original assertion that Cummings was an apparent &#x27;rationalist&#x27; with quite a lot of influence has prompted quite such an impassioned defence of his actions, but my last post asked for an example of a PM going to comparable extremes to retain an adviser whose personal life is at the centre of negative media attention and you responded by pointing out PMs fire advisers quite a lot...<p>Suffice to say you are also perhaps in a minority of one in believing that Clement VII had no influence on the Middle Ages. Especially when the point of reference the Church&#x27;s influence is being compared with is a collection of moderately popular blogs and think tanks.')
