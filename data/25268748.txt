Dedicated servers have all the benefits of colocation, only you don&#x27;t need to deal with the hardware. The DC takes care of the hardware, all you have to do it administer the server.<p>I find dedicated servers to be <i>very</i> cost effective. You can get off the shelf servers in minutes and if you need custom hardware that&#x27;s only a quote away. Most providers will offer month-to-month billing, so there is no lock-in.<p>Often dedicated servers are even cheaper than colocation when you add up all the costs of hardware, racking, sparing, financing, etc.')
