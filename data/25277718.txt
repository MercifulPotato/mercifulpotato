You may say this behavior is learned from doom scrolling, reminicent to taboola crap, etc., but who I am to judge? Personally, I find the development of content UIs and new idioms fascinating.<p>Just to be sure, when I&#x27;ve written about reveal menus and scroll position above, I didn&#x27;t mean capturing&#x2F;blocking scroll events or otherwise messing with default browser behavior.')
