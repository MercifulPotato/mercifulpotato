I read it in early teenage years and just loved the mega-history of a book spanning several thousand years. Same with some of Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s books-- before, I had only read books spanning a single persons lifetime. I guess it makes sense that preppers would also be drawn to it, given the nature of the galactic collapse and underdog civilization making it through.')
