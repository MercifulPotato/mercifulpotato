Source control, CI&#x2F;CD, automated testing, pull requests, code reviews, feature flags, linters, good logging etc. might be the norm on HN but not everywhere, especially companies where tech isn&#x27;t the focus.<p>It can also be a tough sell to make process improvements like this when the old way got them this far and they want new features now. I&#x27;ve worked with clients that don&#x27;t even use source control, do all edits on production and there&#x27;s no way setup to develop locally.')
