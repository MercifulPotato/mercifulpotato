I now stand all day, every day with a monitor at head height, which has been the most impactful lifestyle change. Otherwise I do stretching, some exercises like in this article, deep breathing, and massage.<p>Looking forward to getting back to lifting and sprinting full-time, meanwhile though my cervical spine needs to become more stable. I&#x27;m never going back to sitting at a computer, because I literally can&#x27;t! I suppose that&#x27;s good ultimately but I do find it hard to concentrate on certain things while standing.')
