I had an MRI but in the end it was a surgeon with the right experience looking at an earlier ultrasound that diagnosed it.<p>I had trouble believing he&#x27;d diagnosed it when he glanced at the ultrasound and calmly said what it was. Given I&#x27;d had medical practitioners send me for neurological studies to check it wasn&#x27;t all in my head, suggest fusing my wrist to stop the pain, tell me there was nothing visible in X-ray, MRI, or the same ultrasound report the surgeon diagnosed me from... It seemed unlikely anyone could do an apparently simple diagnosis like that.')
