Personally I’m hoping to see re-light and some sort of flip, with limited damage to ground support equipment. IMO a soft landing is too much to even hope for.<p>The engine re-light is non-trivial because they will be fed from a separate header tank at the tip of the nosecone at that point.<p>It would not be surprising if this didn’t actually happen tomorrow, there’s a million things which could lead to further delays. If it happens at all this month it would be thrilling.')
