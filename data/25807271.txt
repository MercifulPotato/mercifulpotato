Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=[25807484, 25810892], score=None, time=1610847649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806065, text='As I see it, Intel and AMD see the super computer market as &quot;niche&quot; and while it gives good publicity, there are perhaps 1 or 2 such machines sold each year. As a result they spend their time and &quot;innovation beans&quot; on things that make desktop and laptop computers more desirable. IBM&#x27;s Power architecture is another computer ecosystem that is really innovative and cool but you hardly hear about it. Different target markets.<p>The second part of the issue is &quot;head start.&quot; For literally decades the &quot;cost&quot; of a computer architecture was perhaps 3% chips and 97% software support for those chips. The &quot;Windows&quot; lock (by having the #1 OS run only on x86 architecture machines) meant that Intel really didn&#x27;t have to do <i>anything</i> for years but shrink their transistor size and they could &quot;win.&quot;<p>Linux took away the Windows &quot;moat&quot;, networking took away the &quot;enterprise server&quot; moat, and gcc took away the &quot;compiler&#x2F;tools&quot; moat. Between the three of them it gave everyone a chance to play if they wanted to stake out a niche.<p>ARM took &quot;low power&quot; and captured phones for which battery power is key. By licensing the architecture widely and inexpensively they enabled parallel investment that well exceeded anything a single manufacturer could apply to a particular architecture. By some estimates you have over $50 billion dollars &#x2F; year being spent on R&amp;D that accelerates ARM compared to Intel&#x27;s $15 billion R&amp;D budget for 2020? Not so much &quot;blowing their head start&quot; as is it getting mowed down by not being able to invest as much as the other guys.')
