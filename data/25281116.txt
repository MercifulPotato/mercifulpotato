Item(by='Brian_K_White', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606940870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25280522, text='This is a pretty good primer on this peculiar new problem.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a case study for future text books about how if there is a certain incentive, it will be embodied and satisfied no matter what. If the names and labels have to change, they will, but the essentials will somehow turn out to not have changed in any meaningful way in the end.<p>It&#x27;s if anything worse now than before. At least before you were allowed to own your inscrutible black box and use it indefinitely. There was sane persistence like a chair. You buy it, and it&#x27;s there for you as long as you still want it after that. maybe you don&#x27;t <i>want</i> it any more after a while, but it doesn&#x27;t go poof on it&#x27;s own.<p>One way things are actually better now though is, now in many cases the saas outside of your control really is just a convenience you <i>could</i> replace with self-hosted good-enough alternatives, thanks to decades of open source software and tools building up to being quite powerful and capable today.<p>I think this is a case of the rising water lifting all ships. If the proprietry crowd gained more ability to abuse their consumers, everyone else has likewise gained more ability to live without them. Both things are true and I tell myself it&#x27;s a net positive rather than a positive and a negative cancelling out, because more and better tools is a net positive no matter that both sides have access to use them for crossed purposes. At least it means you have more options today than you did yesterday.')
