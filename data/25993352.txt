As of a few months ago, I&#x27;m part of the Rust library team, which is the team that manages everything in and around the standard library. I&#x27;m currently working on the panicking infrastructure, improving the synchronization&#x2F;locking primitives*, and on a new (more efficient) implementation of how formatting arguments are represented**. I also spend a lot of time reviewing incoming pull requests for the standard library, and am working on streamlining the organization around all this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;m-ou-se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sponsors&#x2F;m-ou-se&#x2F;</a><p>*: Much of which has already landed: On Windows, mutexes etc. are no longer heap-allocated. And on many platforms, thread parking now directly uses futex(-like) syscalls&#x2F;APIs.<p>**: That is, how a format_args!() is represented at runtime, which is relevant for all println!(), format!(), etc. macros that do any formatting.')
