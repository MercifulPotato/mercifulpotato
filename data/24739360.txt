Laws and police are just their tools, and so are dictators. Whoever is labeled a dictator is just a figurehead supported by majority of elites, who in turn are supported by economically strong coalition, represented by some majority of people who are united.<p>Precisely, there is no difference between oppressing white supremacist minority and any other minority that wants to overthrow the status quo. It’s not going to be easier or harder depending on how the anti state elements are hiding their communication, because their conflict has to  become public to have the effect you desire, which is some systemic change that you agree with ( making you part of this group by the way).<p>I’m not saying privacy is not important. I’m wondering whether unmitigated privacy is more important to people you and I most probably do not support.')
