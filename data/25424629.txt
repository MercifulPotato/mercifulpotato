Usually, I enjoy the grind element as well. It isn&#x27;t too far off of the sensation I get when working on a personal project or learning new tech. I used to &quot;doom scroll,&quot; but have eliminated my FB and Twitter and harshly curated my Reddit due to the significant stress it was placing on my life. I never really enjoyed seeing what was going on with Twitter, I guess I felt obligated to keep up with things that ultimately didn&#x27;t matter.')
