It&#x27;s a voluntary contract, and Epic doesn&#x27;t have to engage in it. We don&#x27;t have to engage in it. There&#x27;s no fundamental right to offer an app on an app store, and if the scope of the market is defined as the market for video games&#x2F;content, then none of these places are monopolies and companies&#x2F;people are free to set their desired prices.&quot;<p>They are monopolies, or more precisely, an oligarchy.<p>Mobile devices have become &#x27;essential utility&#x27; not quite but almost like roads, internet access etc. and Google&#x2F;Apple have absolute control.<p>Imagine if Verizon and AT&amp;T said: &quot;We&#x27;re going to charge 30% of all revenue derived form Internet Usage&quot;.<p>What would be the difference?<p>Could we just &#x27;refuse to engage&#x27; and &#x27;not use the internet&#x27;?<p>We scream &#x27;net neutrality&#x27; when it comes to network access, we need to recognize some of the same logic applies here as well.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to demonstrate &#x27;consumer harm&#x27; when we don&#x27;t know what the market would look like otherwise: in Canada, literally up until the 1980&#x27;s, the telephone system was a de-facto government monopoly called &#x27;Bell Telephone&#x27;.
