If you got only 10 mbit upload, then you&#x27;re able to upload 600 mbit per minute, or 36000 mbit per hour. Which is about 4500 mB&#x2F;hour (or ~4,4 GB&#x2F;hour). Which results in 108000 mB&#x2F;day (or ~105 GB&#x2F;day). Its about 3&#x2F;4 of a TB a week.<p>I&#x27;m glad I got 30+ mbit upload with my VDSL2. My first backups took ages (I got 5 TB with Jottacloud). First I thought it was Duplicati being slow with regards to cryptography or being .NET, but nope that ain&#x27;t it.<p>Incremental backups during night are not going to hamper the connection though.')
