This allows the following workflow:<p>- I am on a YouTube video view<p>- I click on &quot;Closed Captions&quot; (CC) in the YouTube player.<p>- The extension icon in Chrome&#x27;s toolbar becomes red.<p>- I click on the extension icon<p>- A search text field appears<p>- I type a word or a sentence<p>- There is an area with timestamps and sentences containing the words I search<p>This is useful in two ways:<p>1. For videos I have already watched that I know contain a segment of interest to me and I want to re-listen to that segment. I go to the video, type the words, click on the timestamp and it takes me straight to the timestamp of interest.<p>2. Discovery: when I&#x27;m learning about something specific and there&#x27;s a one hour video and I want to know if they&#x27;re addressing my specific question. I type the words and see how many times they&#x27;re talking about the topic (density). I read the sentences, and then click on the timestamps directly before committing to the video. So when I&#x27;m actively learning about a topic, I might have a backlog of ten videos, this speeds up things enormously.<p>One more hack: I use &quot;Video Speed Controller&quot;[1] to speed up videos up to 16x. For talks that don&#x27;t have a link to the slides, I&#x27;ll use the 16x video as a &quot;presentation slides&quot;. One hour becomes about 4 minutes long and I just look at the slides on the screen. If I like the treatment of the topic, I&#x27;ll watch the video. If not, I won&#x27;t. This allows me again to have a backlog of 20 videos to watch, go through them <i>really</i> fast, discard the ones that do not have a deep enough treatment of the topic of interest, and only commit to the videos that do.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;youtube-captions-search&#x2F;kimbeggjgnmckoikpckibeoaocafcpbg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;youtube-captions-s...</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;video-speed-controller&#x2F;nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;video-speed-contro...</a>')
