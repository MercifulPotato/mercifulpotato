You put some dollars in them and you get some variable set to a value somewhere. (In traditional banking, the value is the number of dollars you put in, and it might be stored on a computer or perhaps on paper; with a stablecoin, it&#x27;s a cryptographic capability and it&#x27;s hopefully stored on your machine.) You can then either request that the service transfer some of that value to &#x2F; from other people, or ask for your dollars to come back out at a later point.<p>Furthermore, while the entity you&#x27;ve given the dollars to promises you can ask for them back (plus&#x2F;minus any transfers you&#x27;ve arranged with others) at any point, there&#x27;s no guarantee that they have a bag of dollar bills in a hole in the ground somewhere, and in fact they probably <i>don&#x27;t</i>: they&#x27;re almost certainly doing something with the dollar bills to make themselves money, in a way where they preserve enough liquidity to return dollars for the people who ask for them, but not all at once.<p>The only difference is the technical form of the variable associated with your account. The API and the social purpose is the same.')
