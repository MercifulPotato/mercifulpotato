It&#x27;s not:<p>1. If you can get the tests to show that you actually need prescription-level dosing (rather than OTC dosing), then you can get the prescription far cheaper than the OTC medication anyway.<p>2. If you can&#x27;t get the tests, then you shouldn&#x27;t be taking a higher-than-OTC dose without a damn good reason, and we sure as heck shouldn&#x27;t be encouraging that here or treating it as a priority--although I think the ancestor was half-joking.<p>This particular branch of the discussion isn&#x27;t about OTC dosing.  If you want to just take normal supplements at normal doses, go right ahead.  Don&#x27;t think you need to allocate money to go higher than that, especially when there isn&#x27;t really a guarantee that it will even be safe, much less necessary.')
