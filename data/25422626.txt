And any offense is legitimate, because it&#x27;s all relative.  You cannot question anyone&#x27;s taking offense.<p>Any legitimate criticism of someone&#x27;s work turns into a personal attack, or worse, &quot;bullying&quot;.<p>This is not a reasonable position to take, and will come back to bite liberal people, either in work, government, or policy.   Otherwise you will find officials, managers, leaders, politicians, yes even yourself, taken down by offended people, because there is always someone who will take offense, no matter how illegitimate.  Just wait until you get on the wrong side of it, you&#x27;ll change your mind quickly.<p>Someone has to make a call about what is reasonable, and what is legit to be offended about.  I don&#x27;t want it to be in the hands of the people who are always offended, I&#x27;ll tell you that.')
