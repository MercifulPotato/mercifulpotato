One can imagine infrastructure and tooling to make it easier at scale, or even to enable broad collaboration, but fundable project scope is so much narrower.<p>A related challenge is when site preservation, and neighbor relations and access, depend on location obscurity (I&#x27;m in Boston).  That doesn&#x27;t mesh well with &quot;immersive field trip on the web&quot; and &quot;see geology near you - a national field trip wiki&quot;.<p>&gt; a lot of cool things that can be done within webmaps or similar interfaces<p>Nod.  Especially if XR provides an infrastructure for integrated geolocated content.  &quot;Roadside geology&quot; guides might become more like current leaf identification apps - &quot;point at leaf, get story of tree&quot; become &quot;point at rock or rock face, get story of continents&quot;.  Hmm, neat, there&#x27;s a bunch of current research on ML rock type identification, even with mobile nets.')
