It&#x27;s not about &quot;making information more accessible&quot;.<p>The problem is that the social media architecture as it is, is optimizing for engagement by any means necessary. That&#x27;s how their incentives are aligned. They need eyeballs to sell to advertisers, so all A&#x2F;B tests and all algorithms are constantly being changed to increase the amount of time people spend on the platform, join the platform or engage with others on the platform.<p>This pressure, as has been extensively studied, has lead to the system promoting content that it predicts will lead to many likes&#x2F;retweets&#x2F;engagement. But, there&#x27;s no pressure or incentive on the algorithms to promote health or true engagement.<p>What happens? People get infected with false worldviews, get shown things that will have them engage with the platform, but which are not true. They are shown things that piss them off to drive engagement.<p>This is not &quot;information sharing&quot; this is a machine that is optimized to have people spend time on its pages, no matter what it has to show on that page to get people to do that.')
