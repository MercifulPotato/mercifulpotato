Which means if you pick the wrong type of work, you&#x27;re going to be unhappy. If you&#x27;re naturally independent-minded, you&#x27;re going to find it frustrating to be a middle manager. And if you&#x27;re naturally conventional-minded, you&#x27;re going to be sailing into a headwind if you try to do original research.<p>I&#x27;m asking this seriously. I&#x27;m a fairly unconventional thinker. (I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s always or even mostly a good thing.) So I do find it frustrating to be in middle management, as I have been numerous times. It&#x27;s also usually frustrating to report to middle management. I much prefer to figure out solutions and pursue them independently.<p>HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve also thus far found nothing but greater frustrations as an organizational leader or solo entrepreneur. (Good thing I&#x27;m currently neither.)<p>What are the options for the independent thinker who doesn&#x27;t want to follow orders, doesn&#x27;t care to lead others, but also wants to be a part of a team? Someone who knows they need others with complementary skills? Surely I&#x27;m not the only nerd who fits this bill.<p>Is there a work model for a team of independent thinkers who wish to neither lead nor follow, but simply cooperate? My gut says there is, that it&#x27;s probably pretty obvious, and I&#x27;m just blind to it. Or maybe that they exist, but tend to fail. The only thing that comes to mind is to be a co-founder in the early stages of a startup, but if that succeeds you&#x27;ll end up in a leadership role pretty quickly. Not everyone gets to be Woz.<p>Anyone?')
