Governments regularly engage in nefarious and dishonest financial dealings on a scale many private entities don&#x27;t come close to matching. Governments also often terribly squander vast sums of public finances that they managed to squeeze from the private world, and yes, there is a very valid argument or two in favor of financial privacy being a necessary thing in the modern world, instead of just viewing it as something that automatically comes with criminal connotations just because some owners of assets seek to keep the nature and movement of theirs private.')
