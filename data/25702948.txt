A decade back I built pyvotecore and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernballots.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modernballots.com</a> to help folks run elections with fancier systems (e.g. SchulzeSTV). Years later, I built <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamemenu.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boardgamemenu.com</a> to help reduce choice paralysis with boardgame selection (consensus). A few after that was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sortmatch.ca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sortmatch.ca</a> to assist in Glicko tournaments.<p>Most recently, I built <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deckofnames.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deckofnames.com</a> to help new parents decide on a name they&#x27;d both like. I built it for myself, but figured others might find it useful. So it&#x27;s a bit rough around the edges, but does the job pretty well, I think.<p>Part of the fun of implementing it was hunting down name statistics from various regional governments to compile a list of &quot;which names are popular in which regions in which years&quot;. I really wish that kind of thing were standardized around the world, but that&#x27;s life.')
