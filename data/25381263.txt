That would be hundreds of jobs scattered across several of my devices.<p>I have a tool I wrote which is doing periodic searches for specified queries on different sites and generates RSS feeds with new results + HTML reports (so I can find people with overlapping interests, e.g. if the same person matched against multiple queries) [2]. Sort of like google alerts, but much better. So there is some daily scraping for that.<p>I&#x27;m using a somewhat hacky tool which &#x27;compiles&#x27; a python spec for jobs to systemd and makes it very easy to maintain.

I live by the motto &quot;Never spend 6 minutes doing something by hand when you can spend 6 hours failing to automate it&quot; :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;my-data.html#consumers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;my-data.html#consumers</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;scheduler.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beepb00p.xyz&#x2F;scheduler.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karlicoss&#x2F;axol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karlicoss&#x2F;axol</a>')
