Yields are low, many years in, and there were large delays.<p>This messed up their whole CPU development pipeline, because their designs are tightly bound to the process node, and it&#x27;s a multi-year process. Because 10 nm hasn&#x27;t ever worked in volume, and their new CPU designs are based around 10 nm, their latest server chips are still based on optimized Skylake microarchitecture, which was first released in 2015.<p>Early indications are that Intel&#x27;s next process node (which they&#x27;re calling 7nm) is also experiencing problems, if those problems aren&#x27;t resolved, that probably means they&#x27;ll have cpu designs for 7nm that they also can&#x27;t ship in volume, in addition to the 10nm designs.<p>If they can figure out their fab issues, and they don&#x27;t have a corporate implosion, I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;ll start making competitive CPUs again; they&#x27;ve been way behind before and come back (anti-competitive practices helped make sure they had the finances for that, of course).')
