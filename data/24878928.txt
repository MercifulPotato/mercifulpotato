Now it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to store media than ever before<p>It may seem that way, but it&#x27;s not as simple. A digitized history project in the UK made this assumption, and later worked <i>really</i> hard to get back at the data, [0] is a long description, the Wikipedia entry on the BBC Domesday book doesn&#x27;t go into all the details. You might believe we&#x27;ve learned a lesson since then, but I don&#x27;t.<p>DRM formats are creeping into everything. Right now it seems JPEGs will be usable forever, and that may be; But cultural artificats - games and videos - are already becoming hard to  preserve; People only care about convenience, and I suspect a popular 3D-or-lightfield-or-something-format in the future will be similarly hard to preserve 20 years later.<p>Print media has two main advantages: It requires no equipment&#x2F;software&#x2F;license&#x2F;electricity to use; and treated properly, it has been shown to last hundreds of years.<p>I have a couple of 20-year-old hard drives that are still mostly readable (12 bad sectors so far), and that&#x27;s considered a miracle.
