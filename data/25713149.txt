If ISIS was still having success like it had when it started with quickly overrunning Iraq and establishing a &quot;Caliphate&quot; all the deplatforming in the world would not have mattered all that much.<p>In the same vein, with regard to the alt-right, the big event that happened was that Trump both lost the election and the attack on Capitol Hill was a spectacular failure. The Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to certify the election. Joe Biden is going to be the next President.<p>I imagine that if Trump had won re-election, or that somehow Congress had managed to nullify Biden&#x27;s electoral votes and send it to House delegations that made Trump the winner, all the deplatforming would be pointless.<p>Deplatforming combined with demoralizing defeats is probably synergistic and effective.')
