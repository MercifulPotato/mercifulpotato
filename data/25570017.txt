I do a lot of comparisons, however, and comparing 128 bit numbers is slightly more difficult than 32 bit numbers.  Overall, I stopped remembering IP address a long time ago.  I wouldn&#x27;t recognize &quot;jrock.us&quot; if you showed it to me.  I kind of recognize my current external IPv4 address, but it could be off by a lot before I&#x27;d notice.<p>I think, many years ago, I typed a lot of IP addresses, but don&#x27;t anymore.  I am personally fully-ready for IPv6, but understand that the world is not.  (For example, my website was IPv6-accessible for many years, but changed providers and now it&#x27;s not.  I was a little sad about this, but it turns out nobody cares, so I didn&#x27;t spend any time on it.  Unfortunate, but someday it will work again, I&#x27;m sure.)')
