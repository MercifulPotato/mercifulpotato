Don&#x27;t you feel like holding USDT makes you complicit in whatever shit is going on?<p>Also, I would be very, very weary of using an centralized exchange that &quot;can not hold fiat&quot;. With the layer-2 projects that are coming now (take a look at loopring or Stakenet), you can transact as much as you want, no gas fees and exchange fees are about the same as any CEX.')
