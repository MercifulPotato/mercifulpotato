CIGs does, but that&#x27;s not very common. I can see complex fabrication, but pretty much everything requires that.<p>Besides cost, the other issue with nuclear, or any large single generator, is that they can go down unexpectedly and their output drops from whatever to 0. This is less common when generation is from many individual generators. If a wine turbine goes out, it only drops the output of the wind farm by some small fraction.')
