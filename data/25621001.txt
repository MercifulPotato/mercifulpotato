Item(by='asicsp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609671052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620779, text='Thanks a lot for the feedback :)<p>I was going to say no, but you know what, I&#x27;ll give it a honest try for the 9th book. I can probably afford it now.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of similar feedback before too. Grammar issues (English isn&#x27;t my native and I&#x27;m not good at natural languages in general). Bland covers, like you mentioned. Marketing strategies, many which I do not wish to try (for ex: buy a domain for my blog and ebooks). There&#x27;s just too many things to follow&#x2F;maintain.<p>Researching, writing the book, reviewing and editing it, revising for later editions, etc are painful enough. I love the feeling of completing a book and seeing sales coming in, which so far has kept me going.<p>All I wanted since leaving my job was sustainable income and if I can maintain current sales, I&#x27;m more than satisfied. All my ebooks can be read for free online. I get most of my sales when I post about a new book on social media for free download. Both leanpub and gumroad allow paying more than the specified price and readers are willing to do so.')
