Apache does it. Eclipse does it. Nearly all the major companies stewarding open projects do it.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any substantive distinction in the words &quot;revocation&quot;, &quot;termination&quot;, or the like, except with specific reference to 203. The question is whether you can show license if they plead infringement. In practice, they&#x27;ll often plead breach, too.<p>Bare copyright licenses are largely theoretical here. If the terms of a unilateral grant include assurance of irrevocability, thats a strong fact for reliance and estoppel. If there&#x27;s any question what the terms meant, it will be resolved by rules of contract construction, because it&#x27;s not a public statute, and contract rules are the rules we have. There is a default rule, when the terms are silent, but it&#x27;s just a default.')
