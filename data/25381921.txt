Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=[25382150], score=None, time=1607657255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25380748, text='You seem like you intend to be helpful, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re as surrounded by these politics, or the disingenuous arguments, as I am. imho, Contrapoints is a homophobic monster who supports shaming people with &quot;genital preferences&quot; (ie, gays and lesbians.) If you want a sane person who just happens to be trans, try Rose of Dawn. They&#x27;re honest and sincere. Bair White is also reasonable, and often gets threats and hate from the community for being unwilling to join in the nonsense.<p>Ultimately the rift comes down to lying. Do we have to deny truth to be kind? I say no, and I&#x27;ll leave this rough paraphrasing of Blair. &quot;Am I male, yes. Of course. I&#x27;m a transwoman and I wouldn&#x27;t be trans if I already was female. Do I wish I wasn&#x27;t, yes. But am I offended, no?&quot;<p>As for Contrapoint&#x27;s &quot;seeing gender&quot;, that&#x27;s just simply not the case. For one thing, I grew up when boys were allowed to like pink, so most of people&#x27;s signifiers don&#x27;t stand out to me.<p>I&#x27;m <i>super</i> behind being sensitive, but if you&#x27;re six inches taller than the others, have a beard, or breasts, etc, those are <i>sex</i> linked traits. Not size entirely of course, but often enough that the 10% male is larger than the 90% female. It&#x27;s gaslighting to assume we can&#x27;t differentiate between the sexes.')
