(or i didn&#x27;t research enough); e.g. More space on main display (external 4k monitor) and Larger Text on the macbook screen.\nI&#x27;m also jumping ship due to the worst experience i had in 25 years dealing with technology, 1 month to replace a swollen battery with a 3rd party repair service. Apple throws now all this &quot;complex&quot; hardware issues to 3rd parties since their employees are pressuring them not to execute hazardous repairs in their own &quot;centers&quot;')
