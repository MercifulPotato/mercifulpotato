Just no, that&#x27;s not how it works.<p>Take it from someone who grew up in Sweden but left as soon as I could - I hate to burst your bubble, but Nordic countries aren&#x27;t heaven on earth now and never have been. I also have many, many non-Nordic friends who realized their dreams of moving there, only to leave after a year or two because reality didn&#x27;t align with their nonsensical, wildly inaccurate ideas about what life there should be like.')
