Item(by='seifferth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605229451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074973, text='If you&#x27;re looking for multi-cursor support, you might want to take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;martanne&#x2F;vis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;martanne&#x2F;vis</a>. It doesn&#x27;t support ctrl + click, but I find ctrl + n and ctrl + j go a very long way. For anything more complex, vis supports structural regular expressions.[^1] Those work for both replacement (as is customary) and for multi-caret text selection.<p>[^1]: These structural regular expressions took me a bit to get used to, but by now I really like the concept.')
