Not necessarily concerning fundamentals, as the US is still fundamentally strong. Primarily concerning the edges of the system and the institutions we interface with every day.<p>I know Robinhood, and other firms, are trying to downplay what happened yesterday (and is continuing to happen right now!). Its possible their version of the story is accurate. It feels more likely that its not the whole truth.<p>We were treading really close to a 2007-level market event yesterday, though not due to bad ratings, rather liquidity. It wasn&#x27;t just robinhood that was impacted; robinhood and IB both said that they made the decision internally, but WeBull said they were instructed by their clearing house to cease trading, and even large firms like TDA started enforcing limits. It was very close to going systemic, and not because of bad fundamentals, not because of an economic downturn, all because an unprecedented number of Americans wanted to join in on the stock market they&#x27;re entitled to join in on, but our financial institutions were not ready for it.<p>When you lay out the reality of our system; that money moves so slow that every single institution who wants to handle money, for nearly any purpose, needs a bank account billions upon billions of dollars large just to be able to move as fast as people expect the system to move, and if that bank account gets too low the problem near-instantly spreads to the next bank in line; the system is very fundamentally broken, and people need to demand change, because our financial system runs EVERYTHING.<p>Moreover; if WSB&#x27;s theory on this is correct, and if these WSB stocks like GME&#x2F;NOK&#x2F;BB&#x2F;etc don&#x27;t reduce in value; we missed a meteor yesterday, but a second one is still coming. This isn&#x27;t just about bankrupting a hedge fund. When the margin calls on these short positions start coming in over time, the price of these stocks continues to rise, and eventually, the current &quot;diamond hands&quot; (as WSB call them) will sell their shares. We&#x27;re talking about billions of dollars here; that&#x27;s a massive liquidity spike that our institutions are still not ready to handle. Granted, as always, its the IDIOTIC institutions who got us into this by taking out the INDEFENSIBLE short positions in the first place, but they&#x27;re systemic; they know they can do whatever the hell they want and get away with it, because if they go down they take every American with them.')
