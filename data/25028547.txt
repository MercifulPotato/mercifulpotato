In particular, we were constantly packaging low-level transitive dependencies for C projects, and ultimately you had to not only know how to build your own package, but also any package for your entire dependency tree. If your dependency tree doesn’t involve any C dependencies (or if Nix definitions already exist for them) then you probably won’t run into so many issues (which is likely to be the case for Go, Haskell, etc—languages that don’t have a heavy emphasis on C dependencies and probably those that can be statically linked) but for Python, Node, etc you will probably have problems. None of this is to speak about the dearth of documentation or the difficulty using nixpkgs as a reference.')
