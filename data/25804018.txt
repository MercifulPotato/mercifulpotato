I don&#x27;t want to play a Roguelike ultra difficult game that I also have to race through.  If I wanted to do that I&#x27;d play online FPS twitch shooters.<p>However then if you slow down those mechanics enough the brain can out think a computer AI so people complain because the game is too easy.  I think the reality is that while these games are cool and fun the AI part needs to be very good and very advanced.  Probably several years in the works like dwarf fortress.  Most game cycles simply cannot support this so you end up with basically a cool idea that has to be reduced to a gimmick for sales.')
