They route HTTP(S) and DNS traffic only; other protocols (presumably) get routed in the clear.<p>* IPv6 isn&#x27;t supported at all.<p>* I might be missing it, but I can&#x27;t find any cryptographic design documents or a threat model anywhere. A quick repo search doesn&#x27;t even bring up any cryptographic primitives, which makes me wonder about malicious peers.<p>It&#x27;s good to have more competition in this space, so I&#x27;d like to be wrong (or eventually wrong, feature-wise) about all of the above. But if I&#x27;m right, this is roughly the same as using a SOCKS proxy (and maybe a bit worse, if any other peer can futz with your traffic).')
