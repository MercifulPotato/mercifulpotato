Science has far less variance between cultures than religion. Math, physics, chemistry, etc are largely the same across cultures. Meanwhile diversity and antagonism between religions is extremely high.<p>The biggest difference is that with science only experts get to truly participate in science. With religions every believer is participating either through prayers, religious gatherings, religious holidays, etc.')
