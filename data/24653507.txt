Those 2.1mm barrel plugs are basically that.  Most any 12V LED strip you buy from amazon will come with jacks already attached and maybe include a power supply.  Half the small electronic devices I buy (USB hubs, Ethernet switches, external hard drives) use it, though sometimes they want 9V instead of 12.')
