If you want to use an alternative ISP, you have to pay <i>both</i>.<p>If the public ISP doesn&#x27;t actually receive tax money, then why would the government need to start it? Anyone can start a non-profit ISP.<p>(Note: I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m against the idea, just arguing a specific point)')
