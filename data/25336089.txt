It&#x27;s completely relevant.  I want to know if it was successful, where the money came from and how it got there...<p>Much in the same way people preach a wealth tax would bring in &quot;billions&quot; without realizing that probably wouldn&#x27;t put a dent in anything considering the overall budget.<p>&gt;If you have examples in the United States or the United Kingdom, sure I&#x27;ll take a look at them. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t really see the point, when no other country has had global financial controls comparable to the US&#x2F;UK in the last 100 years.<p>ahaha man, isn&#x27;t that kinda ironic though?  Maybe because the US&#x2F;UK has seen the consequences of an FTT and realized that maybe its not a good idea.  This is like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see anything unless its from the last 50 years, since so much has changed since then&quot;<p>&gt;Further, I&#x27;ve already said that FTT is only one approach, and not one which I have specifically advocated for at any point in this thread. You are arguing against yourself on that one.<p>Where did I ever say you were?  I&#x27;m using FTT as an example of an &quot;effort to tax the rich&quot; that completely backfired because the people behind it assumed they were dealing with a vacuum.<p>&gt;We already tax wealth, so it&#x27;s not clear at all why you think it&#x27;s so catastrophic.<p>Because it is a waste of energy at best and something that could have catastrophic consequences at worst.<p>&gt;It sure doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;ve done real research if you haven&#x27;t been able to come around on the existence (and non-apocalyptic nature of) property and estate taxes.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of those either for the most part.  However, there&#x27;s a big difference between property tax and trying to tax something worth $50b one day and then $100b a half a year later.')
