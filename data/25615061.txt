I don&#x27;t think I could give an example of something which <i>isn&#x27;t</i> frustratingly slow in Jira. It doesn&#x27;t need targeted fixes to specific things; if I successfully made a list of the ten biggest offenders and they were all magically fixed tomorrow I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d appreciably change the experience of using Jira because the next 90 would still be awful.<p>When faced with long-tail performance problems, it&#x27;s often better to target the things which are easier to fix rather than the highest impact fixes. Making 20 relatively low-impact things faster can easily be better than improving 10 individually high impact things.')
