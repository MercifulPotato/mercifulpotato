Multithreading in today&#x27;s game engines should be commonplace, I think. And that&#x27;s outside of the obvious threads like main and audio.<p>The problem is that most naive &quot;game engines&quot; which provide nothing more than bindings to OpenGL&#x2F;bgfx, OpenAL, Box2D, etc. and are really just &quot;game libraries,&quot; don&#x27;t even provide things like out-of-the-box multiplayer or level loading, so the idea that they&#x27;re going to make the leap from providing basically nothing to providing mechanisms for multithreaded game logic, which requires some sort of gamerules&#x2F;gamemode abstraction <i>first</i> is not something I think you&#x27;ll see in practice.<p>Most game libraries or game frameworks like these only provide things like load, update, draw callbacks with some nice bindings.')
