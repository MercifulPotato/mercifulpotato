Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[25452703], score=None, time=1608149563, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25442303, text='The difference is in natural languages you can make tons of errors and be extremely fuzzy and it won&#x27;t harm the interpretation. Compilers make you update, language doesn&#x27;t (this does actually cause people to speak a language for decades and never sound native). Often times we can use grammar of another language and the words from another and still get concepts aligned (useful for language learners who will tend to use the grammar of their native language). &quot;Pineapple store I go get&quot; can be a perfectly understandable sentence when context is involved. You can also use direct translations of words from other languages &quot;I put on my... uh... finger shoes.&quot; (contextual clues always help, especially in writing).<p>Humans are &quot;fuzzy compiling&quot; to such a degree (and giving no errors or warnings to the writer) that it is hard to compare the two.<p>&gt; If we consider &quot;human languages&quot; like legalese or diplomatic language, where the goal as with programming languages is to limit ambiguity as much as possible while maintaining the speaker&#x27;s ability to potentially say as many things as possible, syntax becomes very important, and typically it&#x27;s preferred that the interpreter raise an error rather than try to guess at the speaker&#x27;s intentions.<p>Such a concept is not even possible in natural languages. Natural languages are so full of ambiguity that even native speakers from similar regions often confuse one another. Because frankly many don&#x27;t realize there&#x27;s: what you intend to say, what you say, and what is heard (times number of listeners). When listening to a non-native speaker we focus a lot of trying to understand intent from them. When listening to native speakers we focus a lot on what is said and what we hear (often ignoring intent). There is just so much fuzziness to natural language that it is a bit ludicrous to compare them. The fuzziness of natural language and strictness of programming languages are necessary features too.')
