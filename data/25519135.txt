Surprisingly, usually a bit flipping here or there doesn&#x27;t cause any real problems so they tend to go unnoticed. If your working with TBs of data using a checksumming filesystem like ZFS of BTRFS would certainly be recommended, but you should ALSO make sure your using ECC RAM. Checking the integrity of the data as it comes off the disk doesn&#x27;t do you much good if a bit then flips while it&#x27;s in memory.')
