Perfect for local needs? Yes. Very good against an unarmoured target? Yes. It is also an important status symbol because of its price and artistic beauty. It also requires some amount of skill to use, because of its single edge and the angle at which you need to strike in order to cut. That increased its status as an elite tool.<p>They managed to do something that would not have been possible in this part of the world without the elite craftsmen. In that sense, it was superior to its competitors.<p>But was it superior to other swords? It&#x27;s comparing apples and oranges. It could not deal with the heavy armor seen in the West. But many Western swords could not either. Some could because they were heavier or pointier... but that would have made them poor against unarmoured or low armored targets. You couldn&#x27;t use it on horseback either, but the Japanese had longer versions for that.<p>It was a very good and beautiful tool, that&#x27;s what it was.')
