They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt. – Rob Pike 1&quot;<p>&quot;It must be familiar, roughly C-like. Programmers working at Google are early in their careers and are most familiar with procedural languages, particularly from the C family. The need to get programmers productive quickly in a new language means that the language cannot be too radical. – Rob Pike 2&quot;<p>Source:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;channel9.msdn.com&#x2F;Events&#x2F;Lang-NEXT&#x2F;Lang-NEXT-2014&#x2F;Fro" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;channel9.msdn.com&#x2F;Events&#x2F;Lang-NEXT&#x2F;Lang-NEXT-2014&#x2F;Fro</a>...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talks.golang.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;splash.article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;talks.golang.org&#x2F;2012&#x2F;splash.article</a><p>According to them, Java (a language that was designed with the same cog ideas as Go) is already worthy of PhD level.<p>Ironic, when they needed the help of well renowned PhD researchers that were part of Project Pizza, for finally adding generics.')
