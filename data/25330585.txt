My installs are a bit over 2GB, which seems comparable to a minimal Android Studio install (and a maximal TeXLive install is much less than a large Android development install, if I&#x27;m reading things right), and full TeXLive is less than full Qt.<p>I use the installer from TeXLive itself rather than the distro packages, as you have more control that way.  Not only that, you can share everything but binaries between multiple OSes, like Windows and Linux (via WSL).')
