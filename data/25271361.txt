Newer phones don&#x27;t have access to checkm8, and getting a private jailbreak or exploit working can be non-trivial. And in some cases, researchers may need to avoid <i>reporting</i> that exploit to Apple in order to keep using it.<p>It&#x27;s a good step. It&#x27;s just not sufficient, especially given all the other restrictions.')
