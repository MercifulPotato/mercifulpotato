There is no universal definition of &quot;open source&#x2F;FOSS&quot; or what its spirit might be, which is why everyone uses concrete licenses.<p>It&#x27;s Elastic&#x27;s fault. I support their new license and wish they had picked it from the start; but they didn&#x27;t. If you explicitly grant someone permission to use your hard work in a certain clearly defined way, you can&#x27;t be surprised when someone uses it in that way.')
