Innovation has always involved creative destruction, but for some reason there&#x27;s a bigger than usual portion of society now that is completely unwilling to acknowledge utilitarian benefits and wants to make all change illegal. And the even greater tragedy is it&#x27;s always the comfortable, well-off upper middle class making these arguments on behalf of the working class, with absolutely no skin in the game because they will never be the first ones affected by the negative consequences of their absolutist worldview.')
