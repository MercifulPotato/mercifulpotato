I got into my current job by starting as a contractor, helping a friend out in an emergency situation. I&#x27;ve done PHP for over a decade, but had never written Ruby beyond some basic CLI scripts! I spent a few days learning how Rails works, and then how Heroku works (ephemeral filesystems were a new idea to me at the time), and finally got it all together. I also wish I&#x27;d put something like this together based on what I went through, but I&#x27;m glad this exists for others.')
