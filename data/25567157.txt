I have jeweler friends, cloth makers, leatherworkers, people making cakes at home â€” all of which get their clients on Instagram and other social networks. Also: therapists, astrologists (yes, I&#x27;m not a fan, but it&#x27;s still an occupation), gaming dice makers, photographers, caterers, limo drivers, DJs, hair stylists... And those are just people I personally know that I could remember from the top of my head!<p>The engineers that &quot;make people click on ads&quot; did it. They enabled more small-scale commerce to compete with the giants, gave a lot of people an opportunity to earn a living doing what they love. Without this &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; all these industries would still have been dominated by centralised gatekeeping institutions that have a budget to advertise in print media, radio, TV and billboards. Now, you can get your first customers with a $10 budget.<p>If there is such a thing as &quot;making a world a better place&quot;, this is it.<p>There are many jobs that feel like &quot;bullshits jobs&quot; because you don&#x27;t get to have personal interaction with the person whose life you&#x27;re improving: you work in a giant system, and the cause-and-effect link between your work and their life is not close. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not there.')
