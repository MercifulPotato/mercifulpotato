The entire process is still a matter of closest estimate when you consider that our eyes don&#x27;t work in exact &quot;steps&quot; along a range.  On top of that, the center point of the lens varies a lot based on exactly how a set of frames sits on your particular face.  I&#x27;ve had plenty of glasses that were headache city because the IPD was right, but the lens center didn&#x27;t line up properly with my pupil (vertically, when worn).<p>Then don&#x27;t even get me started on the whole Luxottica thing where it can be another pain in the ass to find nice looking frames at many optometrist-attached stores.  There are a few others with both optometrists and glasses sales (Warby Parker, if you have one of the brick and mortars nearby, for example).<p>For someone like me, even the &quot;cheap&quot; stores usually involve an extra $150-200 per set of glasses due to my cruddy eyesight and the need for the highest index lens material.  I usually end up bouncing back and forth between somewhere like Warby when I really am due for another exam and will stomach the $200 cost for $20 worth of plastic.  If I break or lose my specs too soon after, I tend to just suck it up and roll the dice with one of the cheapie online vendors.')
