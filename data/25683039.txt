Rendering blurred balls means brute-force calculation of contribution of each metaball for each rendered pixel. The larger your blurred image, the higher your fill rate will be. This would choke the performance for large number of balls. You also end up with sampled (pixelized) output which doesn&#x27;t give you normals and similar geometry information.')
