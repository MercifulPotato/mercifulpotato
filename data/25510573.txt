They&#x27;ll echo many of the themes here, but be able to get (&amp; give) more depth&#x2F;detail.<p>This is a negotiation that&#x27;s already started. Any communication about what they are or aren&#x27;t interested in is a negotiating stance, or opening offer, which may be very far from what&#x27;s possible if you properly understand your position&#x2F;needs.<p>Too bad there wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;shotgun clause&#x27; from the beginning. (Then, even if you didn&#x27;t have cash-on-hand, you could seek other financing&#x2F;investment to win a fair&#x2F;orderly divorce process. There are many investors who specialize in SaaS businesses.) Still, insisting on a bilateral agreement that whoever is able to pay more gets to buy the other out might be a reasonable negotiating goal for you, depending on other factors.<p>Your vesting cliff is very important. After the 1 year, there&#x27;s zero justification for not delivering a full quarter of your shares (~10% of total equity). So I&#x27;d see retaining 10% equity (or at the very least 11&#x2F;12th prorated if you do them the favor of leaving ASAP) as the absolute baseline you should consider.<p>It&#x27;s unclear if your use of &#x27;they is for gender-neutrality or indicates your co-founder &amp; investor share this desire to get you out. But if the investor is neutral, or swayable, or cares about their reputation for treating technical cofounders, they may be all-important to a fair &amp; amicable resolution.<p>That the co-founder would try this indicates some combination of real difficulties in the working relationship, differences in your perceived values of each other going forward, and&#x2F;or a willingness to play hardball in grabbing more of a success in contravention of earlier agreements. To the extent it&#x27;s that last factor, there are other ways you can still be edged-out, via dilution&#x2F;re-orgs&#x2F;etc, later on even if you resolved the current negotiation amicably. That&#x27;s not a reason to run or give up, but something to keep in mind: a seemingly attractive result that&#x27;s not ironclad could be further reneged. So you might give a little more, <i>with the right protections</i>, so that the result is more aligned&#x2F;sustainable&#x2F;enforceable in the future.<p>Good luck!')
