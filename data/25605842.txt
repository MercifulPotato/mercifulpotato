Chowning&#x27;s paper doesn&#x27;t mention phase modulation at all, does it? His equation is for frequency modulation.\n&gt;\n&gt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~fessler&#x2F;course&#x2F;100&#x2F;misc&#x2F;chowning" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.eecs.umich.edu&#x2F;~fessler&#x2F;course&#x2F;100&#x2F;misc&#x2F;chowning</a>...\n&gt;\n&gt; I would presume that the relationships between phase and frequency modulation were known a half-century before Chowning.<p>Chowning says his equation is for frequency modulation, but the equation is actually phase modulation.<p>Chowning&#x27;s equation(1):<p><pre><code>    e = A sin(ùõºt + I sinŒ≤t)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s phase modulation.  Frequency modulation would be:<p><pre><code>    e = A sin((ùõº + I sinŒ≤t) t)\n</code></pre>\nVery different.<p>That&#x27;s okay; it&#x27;s the first academic paper on the topic, and things were still a little wobbly.<p><i>After</i> the paper, he and others refined the concept, moved from frequency to phase modulation, and built digital implementations.')
