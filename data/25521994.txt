Which means that example from D is not applicable to the Nim version at all.<p>My preference is Nim over D primarily since Nim compiles to C, but also overall the community appreciates syntax sugar but also has a decent sense as to when and how to use it. Most &quot;sugar&quot; in Nim needs to be explicitly imported. Literally `import sugar` is one of my first lines in many files.<p><pre><code>    let v = &amp;mut some_annoyingly.long.thing();\n    v.foo = bar;\n    v.baz();\n</code></pre>\nIn the example you list (is that Rust, or D?), if it was in C or Nim and those were structs-within-structs and not pointers&#x2F;refs then `.thing` would be copied to a new `v` (if I recall the semantics correctly). So you&#x27;d end up with a weird &quot;logic&quot; bug where updates would disappear. The Nim `with` macro solves that by modifying the generated code,')
