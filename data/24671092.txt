I like trying to find eutectic points of different molecules in software because it cheaper than doing it in a lab, I like being able to explore whats running on my router because I&#x27;d like to know what security holes could lie there. I like c and c++ because its way faster at run time and uses less way resources when trying to find low dimensional space projections of energy matrices than doing it in python. The code itself? I don&#x27;t care about it at all to the extent that I can get what I want from it.<p>Not everyone who writes open source software cares about the same thing, but its good that the author found something they like to do as with I.')
