You are arguing for child labor with emotional manipulation (Some 14 year olds - children - will be sad to lose a job)<p>I realize that folks are different. However, In a lot of places and situations, child labor is illegal - and 14 is considered child labor in so many situations. When they do work, it comes with massive restrictions. This is soley because we, as a society, generally feel that the focus should be on school instead of work. If we cannot pay young folks on par with adults, we shouldn&#x27;t hire them.<p>As a sidenote: I&#x27;m guessing that the real reason the school hired them is because they are cheap labor - soft exploitation - and so long as their rate is less than paying a member of the custodial staff (who would have to pick up the slack), they won&#x27;t be out of a job.')
