I&#x27;ve anecdotally heard this is also the case in California. However, I&#x27;ve also heard that many tech companies state they will not dispute unemployment claims when fired (my company certainly says that), so people in these &quot;privileged&quot; companies often do collect unemployment even when fired.<p>[1] I hope people know the difference.')
