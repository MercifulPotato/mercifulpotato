The scroll-wheels are imprecise and feel like a $5 mouse.  And because there are only two stalks, it means features are moved to the touchscreen or overloaded (autopilot == PRND depending on context)<p>The model S&#x2F;X have better controls + a dashboard.  Autopilot is controlled by a separate stalk.<p>That said, controlling lights and climate control with tiny touchscreen targets in a moving car is... ludicrous.')
