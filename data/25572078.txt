Item(by='rbanffy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609262249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569751, text='&gt; I disagree strongly with this. Numerical facilities should not be in the stdlib, they should be in the language itself,<p>Overloading the language with features that have limited use for most of their users would tie their release cycles and end up a disservice to both users of the language in general and those who use it for heavy number crunching.<p>As for @, my guess is that Python is running out of ASCII symbols for operators (and unwilling to go full APL with operators). I would imagine that, if NumPy arrays don&#x27;t support @ (don&#x27;t they?!), it&#x27;d be a desire to be compatible with pre 3.5, which is when the @ infix operator was introduced. It shouldn&#x27;t be much trouble to implement __matmul__ and __rmatmul__ for them, assuming NumPy&#x27;s own interfaces are sane.')
