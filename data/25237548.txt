If I&#x27;m running a job overnight, I&#x27;m not plugging or unplugging any peripherals or starting or stopping any other tasks.  My sole expectation is that the system will run my job to completion.  Not to rudely interrupt it to restart the system to install updates which it has decided are of a higher priority than the sole reason I am running the system.<p>Another situation is that I&#x27;m running virtual machines on a Windows 10 host.  I want those machines to be available continuously, and I want any system reboots to be planned and manually executed.  Windows 10 has taken that control away.<p>Windows 10 restarting itself on its own whims is a regular occurrence.  It&#x27;s completely and utterly unacceptable.  Even if you change all the settings to prevent it, it still occurs.')
