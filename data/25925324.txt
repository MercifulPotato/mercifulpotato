We (really tiny vs. everyone else here) settled on that as well, because it requires less integration overall. Though if you&#x27;re going the all-AD-route, there&#x27;s the auks-plugin for running with NFSv4 (not sure, how long ticket renewal works though). And you can always just sbcast a zip of your tree and completely forego the NFS (if you store your data somewhere else. Normally you should also be able to write GRES-plugins to &quot;share&quot; this ressources.')
