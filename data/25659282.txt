The faster you get out of writing code and get into designing and delegating it, the better you&#x27;re off. Sucks if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>Coming up with a way to reward and improve nose to the grindstone technical contribution seems to me key to having an effective organization.<p>EDIT: also consider, doing management or team lead at a company like Google is so different from, say, a small company, that the trajectory may make no sense for somebody. Before I came to Google I felt myself on a career track that was team-lead&#x2F;architect focused, mgmt interest, etc. Once I got there, that evaporated. I just couldn&#x27;t imagine myself doing that kind of work in this large of a company.')
