Definitely some mixed messaging?<p>On a more serious note, the notion that Iran wants to build a nuclear weapon so they can throw it on Israel is nonsense. Yes, Israel is perfectly right to be concerned about a country that would act against its security interests whenever given the chance, and would do so at least in part for ideological reasons (though this aspect is also overblown in the common narrative).<p>But they haven&#x27;t really declared their intention &quot;to genocide Israel&quot;. You&#x27;ll find that in most quotes that circulate, a defensive posture is implied (&quot;if they dare to attack us&quot;). People argue about whether the original Khomeini&#x2F;Ahmadinejad quote (&quot;wiping Israel off the map&quot;) should be translated as &quot;removed from the pages of time&quot;, but it more importantly says &quot;the regime occupying Palestine&quot;. Again, no peaceful agenda towards the country of Israel is to be found here, but no need for comically evil holocaust-like plans either.')
