On the one hand, something else is paying the bills, so you can be patient. But on the other hand, you can&#x27;t take meetings 9-5, or push nearly as hard on the work as you could if it was full time, so you <i>have</i> to be patient.<p>It&#x27;s quite difficult to work on something <i>enough</i> on the side to build momentum and get it rolling, and it&#x27;s extra hard to maintain that momentum for long enough for it to reach &quot;escape velocity,&quot; that is, to become profitable to where you can quit your day job.<p>So the challenge of managing the two jobs, and specifically transitioning from day job + hobby (at the beginning), to two jobs but one doesn&#x27;t really pay well, to finally quitting the first job so you can focus on the bootstrapped project...<p>That&#x27;s just a whole different beast from somebody who quits their job and starts a business (with or without raising money).')
