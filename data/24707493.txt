Ideally you want to do it every time. Bosch&#x2F;Siemens have an interesting way of measuring the amount of water:<p>Other manufacturers (and older BSH appliances) use a simple pressure switch. Bosch went all German engineering with a fully electronic system.<p>The intake has a propeller with magnetized blades and a reed switch that counts the rotations, so it knows exactly how much water goes in, which is pretty damn cool.<p>The turbidity sensor in the drain plays a vital role in this - it assures the mainboard that the dishwasher is, in fact, empty. Otherwise it would overfill.<p>And because of that, BSH dishwashers are very trigger happy with the drain errors. They could also be caused by pieces of food&#x2F;glass in the drain pump, btw.<p>Surprisingly, this over-engineered solution is more reliable on a dishwasher because a traditional pressure switch gets clogged more often and is harder to fix.')
