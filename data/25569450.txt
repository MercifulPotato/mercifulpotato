Item(by='drhagen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609247742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568800, text='&gt; A first indication of this is seen in Figure 1a which shows a kernel density estimate of the distribution of productive assets pooling all wealth classes. The distribution is bimodal, with a mass of households around 0.25 and 6.5, and hardly anyone in between.<p>This is an important result in understanding how to get people out of poverty in undeveloped countries, but I suspect it won&#x27;t translate well to industrialized countries like many in the comments are suggesting. The key result seems to be dependent on the bimodal wealth distribution. (Giving a cow to someone in the lower bucket was enough to push her into the next bucket.) Income distributions from industrialized countries look like the cleanest log normal distributions you&#x27;ve ever seen, so there just isn&#x27;t evidence of a great repulser in higher income countries that you could push poor people over like they do in this study.<p>Caveat: They imply that income and consumption are bimodal, but never plot them, only wealth. Wealth is notoriously hard to measure, and I can only find good histograms of income for the USA. Income and wealth <i>should</i> track each other, at least over a log scale, but I am not comparing <i>exactly</i> the same thing.')
