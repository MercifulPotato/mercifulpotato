Immediate response is that they have no evidence. But they said explicitly that they were going to provide the evidence soon, once they&#x27;d finished preparing to present it.<p>Then they come out to present all of this witness testimony and the response <i>while it&#x27;s happening</i> is that they&#x27;re repeating already debunked claims. Already debunked because they hadn&#x27;t previously provided anything like witness testimony to support them.<p>So now even if the claims are bunk, these media outlets have forcefully denied them at a point in time when they clearly couldn&#x27;t have known that yet. Which destroyed their credibility to deny the claims later, once there had actually been enough time to evaluate them.<p>Which increased the number of people believing the claims to a degree that tech companies started censoring them. So now you&#x27;re here:<p>&gt; &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t censor us if it wasn&#x27;t true!&quot;<p>Impossible for anyone to convincingly deny the claims at this point because you&#x27;ve created the impression among believers that the truth is being suppressed. Because that&#x27;s what censorship does.<p>Made a thousand times worse because it was right after notoriously censoring the NY Post over an article that turned out to be true, destroying their ability to claim that they were only censoring things that were false.<p>Who else thinks this isn&#x27;t going well?')
