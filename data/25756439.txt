So maybe 9 million Covid cases means any cold&#x2F;flu symptoms are somewhere between 50% and 10% likely to be Covid - a virus currently killing ~1% of the people it infects.<p>I am certain the prudent thing to do in 2021 is assume _any_ cold&#x2F;flu symptoms are likely to be a virus that&#x27;s quite capable of killing you (and&#x2F;or the people around you) and act accordingly until you are 100% certain it&#x27;s not. (Which probably means 2 negative PCR tests ~10 days apart.)')
