Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=[25361586], score=None, time=1607536757, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360559, text='&quot;Eat less&quot; is the correct advice for weight less just like &quot;don&#x27;t drink&quot; is for alcoholics and &quot;don&#x27;t think of him&quot; is for someone going through a breakup. It&#x27;s just basically useless advice totally lacking empathy. People are different. They have different bodies, different psychological dispositions, different experiences, etc. I think more people should ask themselves some basic questions. What would need to happen in my life to put me in the position of being 100 pounds overweight? What type of person would I be? How would it feel to try to fight my way back? How can I gain a bit of perspective?')
