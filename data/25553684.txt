So, I&#x27;ve concluded &quot;rewrite from scratch&quot; projects get a bad rap because they tend to also be very big, nebulously scoped projects, almost by definition. But it&#x27;s totally unrelated to the fact that they&#x27;re rewriting a codebase, and everything to do with the size and scope of the project to rewrite a codebase.<p>Either way, though, we&#x27;re lead to similar conclusions as the article, regarding refactoring. If a codebase&#x2F;system is too large to rewrite in a single project, you have to break the work into incremental steps. Theoretically the only difference between &quot;refactor&quot; and &quot;rewrite&quot; is the scope of the affected code.')
