I&#x27;ve been developing for the web since 1995, which is why I miss those days of the web so much.  Even a total newbie to web dev could use pretty much everything available in the HTML spec without much difficulty.  Now the learning curve for just a basic web project is colossal by comparison.  Further, web pages were more &quot;honest&quot; and straightforward.  It wasn&#x27;t very easy for sneaky or &quot;dark UX patterns&quot; to be implemented, partly because they weren&#x27;t well-developed by marketing teams, but also because the web specs didn&#x27;t really provide much to work with.<p>Computer hardware has advanced to an amazing degree, and software has become more abstract and complex to nicely use up all that processing power -- but the core user interaction with software remains largely the same, without much actual speed increase and with a LOT more cognitive overhead (ads, animations, popovers etc.)<p>I&#x27;m not denying the extremely powerful nature of the services we have available to us now, but more-powerful hardware wasn&#x27;t really necessary to have that.  It&#x27;s like the thing about technology making it so we don&#x27;t have to do any work but instead we just work on different things, still for 40+ hours a week.  Today, our CPUs are still saturated with work, it&#x27;s just not the same things as it was back then.. for example, interpreting 5mb of JavaScript to show a chat window or a product page :)')
