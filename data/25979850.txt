It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s just always a PITA with a bunch of required boilerplate and always requires that I dig through the API.<p>This streamlines that process in a way I didn&#x27;t think would be possible.<p>That said.... maybe I&#x27;m doing something really dumb, but it&#x27;s basically unusable for me right now on windows since every time I type the letter &quot;d&quot; it just highlights the line in the interpreter instead of typing the letter.  I see this issue has been mentioned already in github though.<p>I&#x27;d love to keep playing around with this some more.  I&#x27;m also SUUUUUPER curious about doing some GIS integrations using the qgis python libraries.')
