In the school records there are two stories of him receiving punishment.<p>The first is pretty relatable for an adolescent in Germany, he was found drunk in a ditch after having a few beer.<p>The second: He ate a sausage behind a pillar in the cloister. (At the time you were just allowed to eat in the dining hall during the appropriate times.)<p>So every time someone uses Nietzsche in an argument, I imagine a pubescent guy saying the thing while mumbling a sausage behind a pillar. Of course in my imagination he has the Nietzsche beard as well.<p>On a more earnest note, Nietzsche  clearly was a great mind. Which was later eaten away by neurosyphilis.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pforta" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pforta</a>')
