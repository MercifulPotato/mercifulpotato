How many people would opt for the vegetarian option?<p>Instead, in the market which we have intervened, it’s the beef that cost $1 and the veggie burger $5.<p>Obesity is driven in part by lack of affordability of vegetables and in terms of resources and pollution (methane), beef is worse. It seems the incentives cater only to our carnal desire and (mostly corporate) cattle ranchers.<p>I don’t really care for meat all that much, but alas my taxes still go towards that damn $1 hamburger.')
