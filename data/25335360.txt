PLBs are monitored from orbit by COSPAS-SARSAT and modern versions have active location reporting which <i>nearly</i> guarantees fairly rapid reception and location fix. Satellite monitoring of aviation guard (121.5) has been officially ended by COSPAS-SARSAT and I&#x27;m not sure it ever monitored marine radio. Radiolocation of VHF 16 can be done but is going to be substantially more time consuming and less accurate than a COSPAS-SARSAT report - accuracy requires having nearby vessels properly equipped or sending an aircraft.')
