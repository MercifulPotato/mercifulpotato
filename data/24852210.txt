I asked why, and the fella said that when they upgrade me to 4Gbit, the specific ONT he installed would be able to utilise it and won&#x27;t need the router anymore.<p>honestly, it&#x27;s more than enough to have 50 TVs streaming Netflix or YouTube, the computers downloading stuff, phones being used and so on.<p>I am really not sure how 1Tbit would even matter for 99% of the population. Maybe if streaming (actual) 4k became a thing. Perhaps for remote-gaming, but latency would need to be very low. I cannot imagine the latency on a train.')
