If at the highest decision making levels we finally start taking global warming seriously, this kind of move makes a lot of sense. Similarly, we are moving towards a situation where the majority opinion could actually turn against ICEs.<p>It seems highly forward thinking to me. There are big barriers sure, but there are also some really big forces that will be pushing this. There are also some relevant tipping points that might happen, where it makes sense to make electric the default just because so many other things are already electric.')
