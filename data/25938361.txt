My company is &quot;woke&quot; and gives you `sudo` access on your mac. However, this mac is useless. The firewall rules prevent us from running a local kubernetes cluster, and most open source software is iffy on it because of JAMF. `root` is not enough. I want control over my workstation. I refuse to give it up just because IT is worried about some people who watch porn on office laptops. I am not those people, stop penalizing power users just because others flaunt your rules or are unable to grok them.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d kill to join a company that says BYOD and you can use Linux (any flavour).')
