It&#x27;s usually lots of low-stakes stuff like bullet journal stuff, pins, phone cases, magnets, small electronics parts, stones, christmas decorations, baking supplies.<p>But I think our experience differs in that I&#x27;m really happy with the quality. Once you start checking Aliexpress for stuff you&#x27;re about to buy you see just how much stuff in stores is just rebranded bulk orders from Alibaba at a huge markup. I think the most egregious example I found was a tapestry from Urban Outfitters. They were selling it for $50+ and it was on Aliexpress for $3.')
