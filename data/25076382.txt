I oversee a relatively small python codebase, but getting good quality, safe code out of the developers in a controlled way is really hard - there are so many ways in which the language just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to serve the needs of more complex apps. We have massive amounts of linting, type hinting, code reviews spotting obvious errors that would be just invalid code in other languages.<p>It&#x27;s like getting on a roller coaster without a seat belt or a guard rail. It&#x27;s fun at first, and you will make it around the first few bends OK ... then get ready ...<p>Of course, with enormous discipline, skill and effort you can overcome all this. But it just leaves the question - really, is this the best tool for the job in the end? Especially when you are paying for it with horrifically bad performance and other limitations.')
