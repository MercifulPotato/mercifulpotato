Excellent for diagrams and notes as I am discussing something on a call, or explaining things (mostly yo myself) consuming information dense video or audio content.<p>But I don&#x27;t always have my notebook on me, and I tend to loose bits of paper easily. So to capture thoughts, I use &quot;email thyself&quot; on my phone.<p>Every once a few weeks, I clear out my inbox. Most notes go to junk. Some get cross referenced. Fewer still become actual files in my git repo.<p>My git repo is just a versioned bunch of files with upto 2 levels of hierarchy.<p>This works amazingly well, for capturing information. no lock-ins, no fear of losing content, frequently gets cleaned up and cross referenced with version history (which I dont mind losing as I have dates in the text files themselves).<p>What I haven&#x27;t figured out (yet) is a sustainable way to regularly go back to the content I&#x27;ve collected to keep them rolling through my memory without it being an overwhelming amount of work.<p>Refreshing things regularly is the best, most effective way to find patterns and make better connections.
