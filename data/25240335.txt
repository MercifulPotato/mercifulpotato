You just never bothered to read any of it<p>Exactly, thank you for proving my point. I, like 90% of Americans, do not care enough about the opioid epidemic to do any research. We care so little, that we don&#x27;t even know Richard Sackler&#x27;s name. I have a million things to care about in my personal life, and a million other pieces of news I could worry about instead.<p>It&#x27;s not a personal attack, I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re getting so offended about it, it&#x27;s simply human nature.<p>The other thing you seem not to grok is that if 90% of Americans said Richard Sackler needs to be prosecuted it would happen. However, maybe 10% of the population knows that name.<p>So, in conclusion, back to my original point -- If you ever want more than 10% of the population to know the name, you have to bring him up in your discussions, because 90% of us don&#x27;t care enough.')
