Can you explain it to me?&quot; You posses the social skill to ask for clarification, you lack the social skill of flirting.<p>That I can have someone translate to and from Urdu for me does not mean I have the social skill required to communicate via Urdu. Likewise, that your parents can ask you whether something is spam or not doesn&#x27;t mean they have the social skill required to communicate via email.<p>Wikipedia defines social skills as:<p>&quot;A social skill is any competence facilitating interaction and communication with others where social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways.&quot;<p>If the ability to effectively communicate via a medium doesn&#x27;t satisfy that definition, what does? You are welcome to use a different definition, but that&#x27;s what I am referring to by social skills.')
