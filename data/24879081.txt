The constants μ0 ε0 are not the fundamental constants <i></i>setting<i></i> the speed of light, rather they are historically the parameters we used at first when writing down the laws. It might be more reliable to think of c as being the fundamental constant, and μ0 ε0 as being the parameters dependent on c and our rather arbitrary choice of engineering measurement units (μ0 ε0 are necessary because of the arbitrary choice of what an Ampere&#x2F;Coulomb&#x2F;Volt&#x2F;etc mean).')
