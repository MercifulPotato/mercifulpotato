What happens there is, when you request a certificate you insist on this &quot;extension&quot; and the extension tells client software &quot;This certificate is only valid if accompanied by an up-to-date OCSP response&quot;. Then you set your <i>server</i> software to fetch OCSP responses for its own certificate and serve those to visitors.<p>This means excellent privacy (PornHub&#x27;s certificate issuer still knows that PornHub is PornHub, not an invasion of privacy, and PornHub still knows that PornHub visitors visited PornHub, but the issuer doesn&#x27;t learn who the visitors are) while being revocable (if the issuer provides REVOKED OCSP answers then you can&#x27;t show that revoked certificate to a client once the last not-REVOKED OCSP answer expires)<p>Unfortunately, and this is a huge shame most especially for Apache, there are a lot of HTTPS servers that got OCSP Stapling badly wrong, meaning you need newer versions of software or have to install complicated workarounds because the early implementations were so stupid.')
