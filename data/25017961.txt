The video blurb does not give any more context. The full video does, as they only call for death of Democrats &quot;politically speaking&quot;, but not only is this retweet from the President a great example of how violent blurbs without context are unconstructive, we&#x27;ve seen example of violent acts recently that one can&#x27;t help but feel the President personally promoted - for example the attempted kidnapping of a democrat official. Context is king, and the President is known for giving vague and awful statements without context. For his followers that only look skin deep, of which plenty of humans do, what do you think they take from this?')
