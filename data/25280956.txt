I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a better term for &quot;o-plus&quot; other than &quot;reciprocal sum of reciprocals&quot;<p>I would call it the &quot;harmonic norm&quot;, which is consistent with is being the &quot;norm version&quot; of the harmonic mean.  It might also be called the &quot;(p=-1) norm&quot; since it would be a p-norm with p=-1.  Also &quot;L-1 norm&quot; to put it in the &quot;L norm&quot; family.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Norm_(mathematics)#p-norm</a>')
