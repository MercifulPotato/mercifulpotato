He proposes all kinds of rules but hasn&#x27;t thought deeply, on a systems level, about what it means to have and enforce rules.<p>Rules about information are hard to define precisely and are often gamed.  Information rules require the government getting involved in information transfers at a very deep level.  It opens up society to all kinds of more serious threats in regards to civil liberties and totalitarianism.<p>Its very easy to say &quot;we should have rules to do XYZ&quot;.  Its much harder to say what those rules should be and figure out how to prevent those rules from creating ambiguity that enriches lawyers and impoverishes everyone else.<p>Everyone wants to make rules with good intensions but they are too arrogant to understand the systems implications of such endeavors.  Everything has unpredictable second order effects, and OP is totally clueless.  He should first work on some cross border applications that implicate user data and then he should make posts on the Internet about privacy.')
