Most people don&#x27;t turn over those stones at all.<p>e.g. Anyone with spotty or slow internet has had the realization that most desktop software has never been tested on a connection slower or less reliable than localhost, and quality software where it rears its head immediately stands out.<p>It might seem like frivolous polish to be adaptive to the user&#x27;s current connection speed, or it might give you a spot to put a smart variable knob that lets you build good software.<p>But I&#x27;d also point out that we&#x27;re not used to writing software that cares much about the user&#x27;s resources like remaining battery life. We just write our iOS app and then depend on iOS&#x27; battery-saving mode (global throttle). It&#x27;s just not something we&#x27;re used to thinking about, so it&#x27;s easy to be dismissive.')
