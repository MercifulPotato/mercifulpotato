A company spins off or sells a chunk to another company that they no longer want but can&#x27;t afford to lay off. Often to large consultancies etc whom then offer a worse deal or a year later offer a worse deal, and most people leave. Problem solved as no long term union negotiation and long severance pay needed as they left on their own accord... And the consultancy gains some IP and maintenance contracts it can ship off elsewhere.')
