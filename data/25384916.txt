Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607689014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378551, text='In my early teens, I was diagnosed with dyspraxia. I have issues with fine motor control, which mostly affects writing (it&#x27;s often illegible, and writing for an extended period of time (40 minutes plus) is painful) or actions like cutting up food and depth perception&#x2F;co-ordination which sometimes ends up with me walking into tables etc. The one accommodation I did accept for it was to type rather than handwrite my college exams (pride did not allow me to do so for my end of school exams).<p>In the software industry, it doesn&#x27;t really affect me, apart from occasional embarrassment at a team dinner where an attempt to cut up food results in some going astray, and I consider myself lucky as most people with dyspraxia (I can&#x27;t remember the exact number currently, but like 70%) also have to deal with dyslexia, something I do not have. I take notes on vim in my laptop rather than on paper like most of my colleagues so that I can definitely read them when I no longer remember them, and shrug off the occasional dropped item or overestimated doorway as clumsiness.<p>Consequently, most of the time, despite having an actual diagnosis, I answer &quot;no&quot; to this question most of the time. Like the author, the conversation of &quot;but you don&#x27;t seem disabled&quot; is one I usually wish to avoid, and when you start saying dys- people automatically fill in dyslexia and ignore what you actually said.')
