Item(by='throwaway201103', descendants=None, kids=[25338768, 25338367], score=None, time=1607377745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338001, text='Can&#x27;t speak for other cities, and maybe not even Chicago today, but when I lived there, there was a lot of diversity in the loop (the downtown business district) during the workday, but beyond that it was a very segregated city.<p>Also, though I did own a car, I really only used it on weekend trips out of town. If I had stayed long-term, I would have sold it, because it&#x27;s expensive to own one there (parking is expensive unless you want to gamble on finding a spot on the street, and there are extra city taxes on gas and registration). Chicago is pretty walkable and has usable mass transit.')
