Yeah, there&#x27;s lock-in, but their free plan (and cheap Pro plan for individuals) offers a great value. And, really, CI is CI; if you ever need to migrate, even for this guy with hundreds of projects it should only take a couple days. Once you&#x27;ve seen one CI yaml file, you get the gist of what all of them do.<p>Other options:<p>* Gitlab CI. Good value, great integration with Gitlab, has integration with Github.<p>* CircleCI. Something of a gold standard in CIaaS among growing companies. But, it goes down a lot, and the new UI isn&#x27;t an improvement. But, it works and its a good value. Word of advice, I&#x27;d avoid using their &quot;Orbs&quot; if I were you. You can accumulate a lot of lock-in with those, and they&#x27;re infamous for stability issues. Instead, use their docker builder and just build a base docker image with all the stuff you need installed.<p>* Buildkite. Really cool product; they handle the control plane and the UI and webhooks, you host the runners. Its a simple binary or docker image you can install anywhere. If you&#x27;re looking for something with low lock-in that&#x27;s still easy to manage, Buildkite is a great option. I&#x27;ll warn you though: if you&#x27;re going to do any kind of cloud hosting for your runners, and you want to build docker images, best to avoid their dockerized runners. Just install natively on a linux box, either manually, with an AMI, etc. Docker-in-Docker sucks; not impossible to get working, but not worth your time.<p>* Jenkins&#x2F;JenkinsX. If you want something with zero lockin but also hard to manage.<p>* AWS CodeBuild&#x2F;CodePipeline&#x2F;CodeDeploy. There is, like, no one I feel comfortable recommending these options to, but people still use them because they&#x27;re AWS.')
