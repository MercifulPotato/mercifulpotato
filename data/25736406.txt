New developers would naturally be drawn from the ranks of enthusiastic users.  (Why would a developer volunteer their labor for software they don&#x27;t use and care about?)  The graying of GNOME shows that the pool of enthusiastic users has been shrinking since GNOME 3.  That&#x27;s about when GNOME tipped over the edge and started losing developers faster than it gained new ones.  The missing new developers would be <i>new</i> developers, not old timers.  If it were only old timers who feel alienated, I wouldn&#x27;t expect GNOME to have trouble recruiting <i>new</i> developers.')
