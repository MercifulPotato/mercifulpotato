Item(by='klenwell', descendants=None, kids=[25520485, 25521208], score=None, time=1608746865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519718, text='One additional tip on recruiters: have a cheat sheet ready (web page or public Google doc) that answers the basic questions they&#x27;ll have for you and makes clear your expectations.<p>Here&#x27;s the info I ask them to provide:<p>- Job Title and Salary<p>- Job Description<p>- Company Overview and Location<p>- Steps in Hiring Process<p>Whenever I&#x27;m emailed by a recruiter, I politely thank them for reaching out, paste the link to the cheat sheet, and invite them to review it and write back if they still think I&#x27;m a good match. It quickly separates the professionals from the wannabes. (You usually don&#x27;t hear back from the wannabes.) The ones who do write back often thank me for it.<p>I&#x27;m pretty cynical when it comes to recruiters. So I find it interesting that 3 of my last 4 jobs have come through one.')
