That seems overly restrictive - where does that leave services in which sharing data is the whole point of the service?<p>GDPR literally says that you&#x27;re allowed to run a service that requires data and you don&#x27;t even have to ask for consent for that type of data.<p>What you&#x27;re not allowed is to collect data that&#x27;s NOT critical for your service without consent.')
