The reason I say this is that I happened across a conversation on Reddit (sorry, I don&#x27;t have the link) earlier today while doing research on WordPress speed issues (don&#x27;t get me started).<p>Anyhow, in this thread a bunch of people who build and support sites were voicing concern because lots of them got hit by spam of different kinds across a range of sites.  One guy said he supports about 80 sites and more than half of them were getting pounded with spam.  They went from normal traffic to mayhem during the last couple of days.  Some report having to temporarily suspend commenting as well.<p>We have a couple of unimportant websites down due to the GoDaddy outage.  Everything else is on other hosts (Linode, AWS, Dreamhost), which seem to be doing fine.<p>Anything weird going on going on for others?')
