I basically don&#x27;t use any other Google services other than Gmail and YouTube, but for email I really don&#x27;t know of an alternative.<p>Sure you can argue &quot;move to Fastmail&#x2F;Protonmail&#x2F;Hey&#x2F;whatever&quot;, but those can also go down on you just like Google is down now. And self hosting email is apparently not a thing due to complexity and having to forever fight with being marked as spam (ndr.: not my personal experience, I never tried self hosting, just relying what I read here on HN when the topic comes up).<p>So, yeah, what do we do about email? I feel like we should have a solution to this by now, but somehow we don&#x27;t.')
