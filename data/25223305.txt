Most of the studies I&#x27;ve seen &quot;widely reported&quot; were using race as a proxy for people with jobs that couldn&#x27;t be done remotely. Is this still bad? Maybe, but if you&#x27;re trying to determine if one race in isolation is more susceptible than another from a medical&#x2F;biological standpoint, that&#x27;s data I haven&#x27;t seen &quot;widely reported&quot;.')
