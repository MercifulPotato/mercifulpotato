LA is legally much smaller than what most people would call LA.<p>That being said, this doesn’t change my argument much for two reasons. First, “you have to live within commuting distance of downtown” isn’t <i>that</i> much different from “you have to live within commuting distance of this suburb”. The nearby suburbs of some of these metro areas are still pretty darned expensive and congested compared to the rest of America. Second, the zone of reasonable commutes is much smaller still if you have a spouse who works in another area, or if you’re liable to change jobs in the next few years. And of course the housing centers with reasonable commutes to all possible job centers tend to be expensive.')
