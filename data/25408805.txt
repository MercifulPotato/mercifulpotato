And speaking of, I found out yesterday that Github now has it. Best news all day!<p>I use Logic Audio on my Mac desktop a lot, but it thankfully is in &quot;dark mode&quot; by default. I assume they made that choice knowing that people would be staring at the screen for hours on end.<p>I also set my screen brightness to a comfortable level that isn&#x27;t nearly full blast, and enabled the feature that lowers blue light when the sun goes down.<p>Another thing I do: My laptop runs Windows, so I also have Linux running in a terminal on screen pretty much at all times. I let the terminal take over half the screen, which is pretty much where Windows wants to place it.<p>However, with my browser (chrome), I stretched it to fill 3&#x2F;4 or 2&#x2F;3 (or so) of the screen so that it partly overlaps the terminal, and then set the defaults for a slightly larger font. This allows me to see web-based resources when I&#x27;m tooling around on the Linux cli. You have to be careful not to accidentally move the browser window too much that it goes full-screen, but you develop super-human placement accuracy after you&#x27;ve done that a few times.<p>Likewise, when I am watching anything that is full-screen, like YouTube for example, I set my laptop on the foot stool so that my eyes can have a different focal length for a while.<p>That&#x27;s about it. I hope other people post some ideas, because I spend way too much time on the screen and so I&#x27;m always looking for improvements as well.')
