As a grad student at WPI somewhere around 2000 or so when AES was first, I took his &quot;Cryptography and Data Security&quot; course and my end of class project was a complete implementation (in C) of Rijndael.  (I later found out that others in the class chose to implement portions of the cipher and not the whole thing.)  It was definitely one of my favorite grad classes.')
