I think you&#x27;re saying bitcoin is no better than normal banking for moving value.<p>Do you really believe this? Yes, in the US I can immediately wire money somewhere as long as:<p>1) I do it within east coast business hours. Weekend? Sorry, wait til Monday\n2) I have the correct information for the receiving institution, some of which require a small transfer up front to confirm the setup.\n3) My bank actually supports wiring (Wealthfront, for example, only supports ACH transfers which take a few days)\n4) I&#x27;m sending within the US, otherwise there are a bunch of other complications and requirements<p>I also need to trust that the bank actually has my money.<p>With cryptocurrency you can confirm that your stored value exists and is stilled owned by you, and transfer it to anywhere else within 30 minutes, in a provably secure and verifiable way.')
