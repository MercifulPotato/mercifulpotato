Its like proper politics - once people chose their branch of religion, be it faith in god or in their phone manufacturer, they go to great lengths to twist reality so that their favorite comes always as good guy. Cognitive dissonance anybody?<p>I have no stake at this topic, never owned an Apple device and I don&#x27;t feel other manufacturers are significantly better, but its a bit sad to see so much apologism at otherwise great place like HN. Or its just paid comments either from employees or otherwise employed, I mean we&#x27;re still just on general internet and its still 2020 so its unfortunately pretty normal.<p>In any case, if you guys try to defend these seemingly amoral actions of Apple, the real effect is exactly opposite.')
