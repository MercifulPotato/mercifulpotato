Somehow the clearinghouses have no trouble with the Apple volume.</i><p>The clearinghouse had no problem with GME volumes either. They just required collateral. Had Robinhood <i>not</i> been able to meet its obligations yesterday and thus gone under, that collateral would help settle its trades with other brokerages.<p>Collateral requirements are re-calculated daily. That means there is risk between the last collateral calculation and where an asset is trading today. That risk is a function of volatility. So for a stock like Apple, the DTCC may only require 2% of the value of the trade be put up as collateral. For a stock like GameStop, it may require 100%.')
