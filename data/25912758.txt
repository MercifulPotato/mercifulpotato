They already spend huge amounts on microwave links overland between e.g. Chicago and New York, for just a few milliseconds advantage over fiber.<p>Starlink gives them the same opportunity across Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. You can bet that there will be orbits that exactly link London and New York, New York and Tokyo, New York and Singapore, London and Singapore, etc. Traffic <i>not</i> sent under extra-high tariffs will be artificially delayed enough milliseconds to match fiber.<p>It would not be surprising if these low-latency contracts, for traffic amounting to well under 0.1% of total capacity, provide 10% of revenue.<p>It would also not be surprising if future satellites have tens of TB of storage onboard to proxy streaming for the highest-demand shows of the moment, and broadcast capability to multiple ground stations simultaneously for live streams, particularly soccer matches.<p>Most likely, aside from financial transaction data, routing will always offload packets to ground terminals as early as possible. I strongly doubt zigzag routing will happen at all.')
