It doesn&#x27;t really give Nextcloud enough credit. Nextcloud can replace _most_ of google in one shot -- calendar, reminders, contacts, drive, docs, hangouts, maps, photos, and more (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.nextcloud.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.nextcloud.com&#x2F;</a>). I think it&#x27;s not as popular because 1. it&#x27;s not free (as in beer, but it is free as in speech) and 2. it&#x27;s kind of fiddly to get up and running. You can either host it yourself or sign up with a provider, but either way it&#x27;s not super intuitive and nowhere near as polished as what we&#x27;re used to these days. But, if you&#x27;re looking to get off of Google and don&#x27;t want to sign up for 10 different things, Nextcloud is worth a look.')
