They&#x27;re opposition to distributed social networking platforms and their recent statement on freedom of speech is absolutely appalling and disgusting. They could be absolutely right about this but the media is the message and the medium of Mozilla no longer even remotely represents the values that brought me to Firefox and the open source world back in the early 2000s.<p>I&#x27;m wondering how services like PeerTube and ffmpeg operate with H264? It appears Linux services can encode and decode H264 fine without explicit payments. Is it because we&#x27;re under a certain threshold? If a site with H264&#x2F;H265 content gets too big, will it start to see legal letters for these costs?')
