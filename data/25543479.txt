You&#x27;re right, there&#x27;s certainly an online &quot;bubble&quot; around privacy&#x2F;security, but equally, from the other perspective if you speak to people outside of the &quot;startup tech&quot; industry, they&#x27;d say the notion of randomly using third party services with unmanaged storage on personal accounts (a la iCloud) simply isn&#x27;t an option for them.<p>I guess when you add it up - regulated financial services, legal, anyone falling under GDPR who needs to show systematic measures in place, any serious business that needs to have processes that out-live any individual staff member, systems based around &quot;convenient personal cloud&quot; suddenly start to become the minority.<p>Most serious companies won&#x27;t allow company IP&#x2F;data to be stored on &quot;personal&quot; systems (which would encompass iCloud and similar).')
