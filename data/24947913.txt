And then get a judge to view that as a favorable move, not asshole at all.<p>(To be honest, I think any hostile move such as a lawsuit is an asshole move, so I think I&#x27;m agreeing with you?)<p>They wouldn&#x27;t need to claim the cases were grouped together, just that the inevitable appeal would be more likely to be found binding if the cases were all still being adjudicated.<p>Or something like that. No court case is a slam-dunk.')
