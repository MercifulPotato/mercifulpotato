I am relaxed. I&#x27;m trying to get you to relax. You should be more self aware as you&#x27;re actually the one that kind of seems on edge with your initial post.<p>You barge into this thread with a tone that is dismissive, opinionated and wrong. You&#x27;re telling me to &quot;just use an IDE&quot; and also that &quot;emacs is not an IDE.&quot; I&#x27;m just telling you to stop doing that.<p>I usually won&#x27;t tell someone to &quot;relax&quot; or that they&#x27;re &quot;not on trial&quot; because it&#x27;s kind of insulting and dismissive. It&#x27;s also a strategic move used to flip the script to make another party seem overly emotional.<p>Just Read the thread next time before you respond so aggressively with your opinionated views.<p>&gt;For clarity maybe?<p>Nah not for clarity, this is a lie. People aren&#x27;t stupid and they know why they say the things they say.<p>You said it because you believed that I held that opinion and you wanted to dominate the conversation by telling I&#x27;m wrong. You made a mistake and you didn&#x27;t really read my post. Don&#x27;t do it again.')
