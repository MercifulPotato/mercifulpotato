Item(by='alxlaz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608020426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427979, text='&gt;  Let me say something shouldn&#x27;t be brushed off lightly while brushing it off lightly. Clueless.<p>Marinetti was literally a member of the Fascist movement -- not &quot;had ties with it&quot;, he was a legit, card-carrying member of the Italian Fascist Party, which he joined when the party he founded, the Futurist Political Party, merged with Mussolini&#x27;s Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. He was one of the more notorious of Mussolini&#x27;s supporters early on, and he literally wrote a book called Futurismo e Fascismo (&quot;Futurism and Fascism&quot;) -- guess what that book was about. They didn&#x27;t quite get along but Marinetti, like most Italian Futurists, remained a keen fascist supporter throughout his life.')
