Item(by='oh_sigh', descendants=None, kids=[25146866, 25146830], score=None, time=1605763922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146248, text='Perhaps my confusion stems from how completely orthogonal this point is to the discussion of a contract not being upheld.<p>Even in a hypothetical world where all &quot;Imaginary Property&quot; is completely free as breck imagines it could be, people may still choose to pay me for developing the robot kitten book. And if I have a contract with you that stipulates I get $9 from that money and you get $1 from that money, I would need to pay you.<p>If breck has no sympathy for this person who is allegedly being screwed over by Disney, then he also has no sympathy for almost all writers, painters, photographers, and other artists in the world. Also, most programmers, since even the most popular open source software licenses still introduce restrictions with the threat of punishment. I&#x27;m sure breck publishes all of his code in Zero-Clause BSD, but that is categorized as &quot;Other&quot; (&lt; 1%) when it comes to most popular github licenses, so there sure are a lot of unethical githubbers.<p>So we&#x27;ve learned that breck has, basically, no sympathy for anybody. That&#x27;s not a very interesting life philosophy in my book, and one I don&#x27;t actually buy, which is why I was inquiring about the details of his viewpoints.')
