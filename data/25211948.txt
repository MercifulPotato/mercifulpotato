Germ theory also covers stuff like non-airborne transmission (food&#x2F;water&#x2F;bodily fluids). The only thing that it got right is &quot;you can get infected by invisible things in the air&quot;, but even then it&#x27;s not that accurate. Do people really get sick from the air near swamps, or is it the mosquitoes?')
