The single CLI app that run on Linux for browsing a spreadsheet that is not formed as a database, SC-IM, does not support searching for arbitrary text!<p>Therefore I am writing osheet: A Linux CLI app for browsing a spreadsheet. It currently supports only XLS files, because that is what I need. It currently crashes a lot. It currently has no features other than searching. It won&#x27;t even scroll yet to display all the rows and columns. I just banged it out last night when I should have been sleeping. But I&#x27;m working on it, you are invited to test it, report bugs, and pull requests are of course welcome. It&#x27;s written in Python and Curses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotancohen&#x2F;osheet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotancohen&#x2F;osheet</a>')
