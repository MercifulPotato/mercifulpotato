I alt+tabbed 100+times and didn&#x27;t experience the issue. Didn&#x27;t edge tabs now recently show in alt+tab? I wonder if it&#x27;s because they are surfing between two tabs and alt tab is showing the last tab they clicked on rather than the last window they had up.<p>FF uses CTRL+Tab to cycle through tabs like alt tab.')
