All the grants, financing, and their largest contracts - all government.  Without government, SpaceX would literally not exist.<p>So in my mind they&#x27;re as &quot;private&quot; as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, or Boeing; meaning sure, the government doesn&#x27;t <i>own</i> the company shares, but they are de-facto extensions of the US government and would die if the government wanted them to cease to exist.<p>The truly amazing things for me with SpaceX are: Elon Musk is somehow allowed to have a role despite ties to China and a behavioural history that would make anyone else ineligible, and the fact that they are intentionally staying privately-owned in order to keep financials out of the public realm.')
