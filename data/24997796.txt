People say AMD has the best Linux drivers, but they&#x27;re wrong! Intel&#x27;s are feature rich and stable, and I think they&#x27;re better than AMD&#x27;s [1].<p>I&#x27;d like to counter this. Intel&#x27;s driver quality is going down for a year or so. My old EliteBook 850G2 is running with Intel Graphics but, it started to show some flickering and corruptions for no reason. Nobody bothered to fix it yet.<p>Intel&#x27;s e1000e drivers started to behave awry on some older cards and, Intel didn&#x27;t fix it. On the contrary, they continued to pile patches over this buggy driver. Kernel guys and Debian developers had to revert some patches back to stabilize the driver again. It still loses connectivity sometimes.<p>By older cards, I mean some of them are barely two years old.<p>IF, a big IF, Intel gets its thing together and restores the quality, it&#x27;s great. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t put them on a pedestal for driver quality.<p>On the Windows side, I have an Intel wireless card which is <i>officially</i> supported by current drivers but, the new drivers bork the card after standby and system has to be powered off to restore card connectivity. The computer is a HP Spectre X2 convertible and, only older, out of the box Windows drivers (which are stock Intel drivers) can utilize the card correctly.')
