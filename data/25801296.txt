I have many small electronic parts from China that I need to keep track of the documentation and the stock. The documentation is particular hard to find online if you don&#x27;t download it when buying.<p>The app is designed as a PWA and runs completely offline. Everything is stored in cache. You can connect a ChouchDB to sync across devices and have a backup.<p>Nothing to demo yet but I plan to host the app for free and take some small amount for the database connection if the user does not want to host&#x2F;connect to their own.')
