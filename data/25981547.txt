Which is in a lot of situations simply not true.<p>Then the article goes on to give you this super easy solution, just save 5 pounds a day, anyone can do that. The reality is however that a lot of people can&#x27;t do that. A lot of poor people literally only spend on bills and food, telling them to just save more is hardly advice. And the amount isn&#x27;t as miniscule as the article presents it to be, it&#x27;s 150 pounds a month. For people who are already saving money, this article basically tells them to spend 5 pounds a day.<p>I won&#x27;t even get to the latter half of the article which essentially boils down to save up and start investing.')
