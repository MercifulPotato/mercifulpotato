And the result of those screw-ups were removal from root cert lists. And they closed down as a result. DigiNotar and WoSign both faced this calamity.<p>There was a time when root stores let anyone in who asked nicely. That time has long since passed however; the modern process is quite involved. See Mozilla&#x27;s process here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Application_Process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;CA&#x2F;Application_Process</a>, and note that it calls out that it&#x27;s expected to take <i>two years</i> to complete. It&#x27;s not a pro forma policy: the Federal PKI [1] was not able to meet the requirements of inclusion into the root store because its rules for issuing certificates are not considered sufficient per modern browser requirements.<p>Quite frankly, I&#x27;d place far more trust in Mozilla&#x27;s ability to audit CAs than my ability to do it myself, and I&#x27;d trust the average user&#x27;s ability even less than myself. Arguing that CAs having to advertise to the user is a good idea for trust ignores the fact that unsavory companies openly abuse their users and yet still have high trust. (To say nothing of politicians...)<p>[1] This is the PKI system that&#x27;s mandatory within the US government for internal certificates.')
