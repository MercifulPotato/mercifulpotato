The one you&#x27;ve linked takes a HDMI signal, compresses it, and provides it over USB2.0.<p>When digitalizing VHS tapes, generally one doesn&#x27;t have a HDMI signal to use. They either have Composite (typical) or S-Video (better, but rarer). Typically, one should get a Composite&#x2F;S-Video to USB device rather than trying to add a Composite&#x2F;S-Video to HDMI device into the link here. Adding more pieces that you don&#x27;t have control over tends to result in more issues and&#x2F;or worse capture quality (due to extra filtering&#x2F;compression steps applied).<p>Devices like the &quot;Hauppauge 610 USB-Live 2&quot; and &quot;Elgato Video Capture&quot; (I&#x27;d use the Hauppage device personally) provide a Composite&#x2F;S-Video to USB 2.0 adapter that can provide uncompressed video.')
