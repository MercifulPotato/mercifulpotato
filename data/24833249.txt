From at least one point of view, the whole point to move to something like Mastodon is to move to something <i>improved</i> over Twitter and recreating incidental parts of Twitter like a single &quot;public master feed&quot; isn&#x27;t necessary. It&#x27;s that centralized, combined fire hose of a &quot;public feed&quot; that I don&#x27;t understand the point of in 2020 (other than for ethically questionable reasons).<p>In fact, as a Twitter early adopter I watched the public feed go from a useless but sometimes interesting curio that sometimes had fun surprises to a useless fire hose full of uninteresting garbage and not worth sifting through. The Federated Timeline on every Mastodon instance gets that wild that most people turn off or ignore the Federated Timeline. I certainly find it even more pointless to use bots to try to ramp that fire hose all the way up to &quot;as much of the network as possible at all times&quot;. I just cannot see an ethical use of that today, and I cannot see why someone would want that when Twitter itself proves that a single massive public feed is way more of a bug than a feature.')
