That is, go talk to the specific people you see behaving in this way and see why they do what they do. I&#x27;ve got a friend who would give out free meals to poor people on the street. I won&#x27;t tell you what race he is, because I think it kind of misses the point to fixate on the circumstances of one&#x27;s birth. He said he had some experience with poverty and being hungry so he took it pretty seriously when he saw it in our community. That may or may not be what is going on with that specific person you observed feeding that other poor person. We don&#x27;t know. You have to ask.')
