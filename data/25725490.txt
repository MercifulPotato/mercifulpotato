Yes, it has to do with the async nature of it all and I agree it&#x27;s stupid and it&#x27;s a miracle the desktop even works. Over time, I&#x27;ve been wondering if Windows dodges this simply by having syscalls that interface with window procedures while Xorg deals horribly with it by being pure userland. Another issue is, there&#x27;s no mapping of pid &lt;-&gt; X11 window. It&#x27;s simply impossible with the current design of client-server.')
