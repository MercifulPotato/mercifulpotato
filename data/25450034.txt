Item(by='hcnews', descendants=None, kids=[25450636], score=None, time=1608160134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447680, text='&gt; My advice to beginners is to not stick with one opening, but to play them all. Include wild openings like the Kings Gambit and Danish Gambit, as well as strategic openings like the Queen&#x27;s Gambit. You will be out of &#x27;the book&#x27; very quickly, and that&#x27;s actually good. You&#x27;ll be learning to play, rather than recall.<p>This is opposite of general advice. Beginners should play only one white opening and 2 black openings (d4&#x2F;e4 response) mainly so that they can focus on middlegame and endgame instead.')
