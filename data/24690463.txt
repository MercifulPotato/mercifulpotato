I&#x27;m not always expecting them to solve it, but I&#x27;d at least like an acknowledgement that the issue I&#x27;m facing is valid. Pretending it&#x27;s just me or that the obviously worse alternative is okay gets annoying.<p>One example is ReasonML&#x27;s async story:<p><pre><code>    Q: What&#x27;s BuckleScript&#x27;s async story?\n\n    A: If you&#x27;re not interfacing with any library that uses promises, you can simply use callbacks. Everyone gets them and they&#x27;re performant. If you need to bind to a JS library that uses promises, or communicate with such library, you can use BS&#x27;s Js.Promise.\n</code></pre>\nIMO that&#x27;s a less than ideal response. I&#x27;d prefer a more honest response like:<p>A: Unfortunately, we do not offer an async&#x2F;await equivalent currently. BuckleScript has a Js.Promise type for using Promises. We understand that this is not ideal, and are working on other options.<p>Lookâ€”it&#x27;s okay that they don&#x27;t have the feature. Nobody&#x27;s perfect. But they shouldn&#x27;t pretend that callbacks are an acceptable replacement because they&#x27;re &quot;performant&quot;.')
