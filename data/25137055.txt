You&#x27;d think that a big company like IBM would have a long line of people ready to take on a juicy project like this, but at the time, all of those people were tied up with more pressing work (customer commits, a high-profile performance project, etc).<p>Also, I&#x27;ve clearly glossed over a bunch of details but I wasn&#x27;t hired as a team lead.  That being said when management saw that I was capable of driving the team (mostly) on my own, they progressively stepped back further and further until I was essentially running the team.  This was over the course of a few years, which I&#x27;ve compressed in the writeup.<p>All that to say that career ladders aren&#x27;t fixed, and if you find yourself in the right place at the right time, you can bypass a lot of the traditional ladder climbing.')
