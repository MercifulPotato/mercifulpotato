This is useful for all drivers to understand from a conceptual level, even if they aren&#x27;t crunching the numbers.<p>There is a similar one useful for RF - doubling your distance quadruples the signal loss. Probably only useful for hams or people setting up wireless networks. But I think it can be good to understand this so that you can reduce your RF exposure for health precautions.')
