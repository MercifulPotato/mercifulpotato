As in, if you already know another programming language, picking up Zig is going to be very fast and simple.<p>Sure, it introduces some new concepts, comptime being the main one, but these are very easy to grasp, and you will immediately use them and understand their value.<p>It’s a replacement for C as the compiler doesn’t get in the way, but still brings you safety features that C never had: checked arithmetic, slices, checked pointer casts, tagged unions, nice error handling, better memory management, defer, etc.<p>It also has excellent support for WebAssembly.<p>I must confess that Zig is the first language that I’ve been so excited about since Rust.')
