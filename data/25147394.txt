Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=[25149159], score=None, time=1605774582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147250, text='Speaking specifically about FPS games, after the heyday of games like Quake and Unreal, a new generation of FPS games came up, iirc starting with Half-Life (focusing more on story, platforming than shooting), then moving on to Medal of Honor and Call of Duty (realistic shooters); the more &#x27;arcade&#x27; shooters fell out of grace, and probably more when other game categories became big in e-sports.<p>But, then Id started to make a comeback; games like the Wolfenstein reboot which were more about over the top violence again, and Doom which made FPS games fast again (if it wasn&#x27;t for the constant scramble for ammo it really would&#x27;ve captured the &#x27;old&#x27; feel even better I think). That one&#x27;s criticized for having too much platforming in it though, but other than that it&#x27;s still a fun &#x2F; fast paced FPS games.<p>Alongside there&#x27;s been the Serious Sam franchise which never stopped feeling outdated, lol. It&#x27;s a weird one because the gameplay of that one seems to be focused on kiting.')
