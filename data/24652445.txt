More recently, I helped get a B2B venture-backed startup off the ground as co-founder&#x2F;head of product and eng. I built this product from scratch, hired a team of 5 and led development for 2 years, releasing nearly 500 iterations of the product.<p>I now work and consult with non-technical founders and early stage teams to own the first versions of their product (and often beyond). As someone who&#x27;s trained as an engineer, I have a very strong sense for the product side of things. Through hard-earned experience, I&#x27;ve learned how to balance trade-offs between quality, speed, and resources to ship great software and lead&#x2F;motivate a team while doing so.<p>React out if this interests you. I&#x27;m open to interim product&#x2F;eng lead roles as well freelance consulting opportunities at early stage companies.')
