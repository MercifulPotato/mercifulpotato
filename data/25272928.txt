Traditional valuation metrics like PER, EV&#x2F;EBITDA, DCF etc. all tie back in one way or another to the cashflow-generating potential of a company.<p>Revenue multiples have, at best, only tenuous relationship to cashflow. If you sell $10 notes for $1, in theory you can have infinite revenue.<p>I wish investors would just stop pretending tech valuation these days have anything to do with financials, which is actually fine.<p>Maybe it is time we shift what we think the equity market is about.
