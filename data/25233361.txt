Racism is just hanging out there for them. Best to lower the attack surface and don&#x27;t give them the bait. If it bothers you, perhaps literature and history isn&#x27;t for you. Back then they had little knowledge and faced a brutal life. They still moved literature from idealism and flowery language to marketable characters and trendsetting themes.<p>Zero sum politics can run amuck. Next thing you know, a million people are horribly slaughtered. Consider if, one day, completely out of the blue, the UN declares all member nations to actively prohibit abortion or be attacked. Zero sum politicians see an opportunity due to recent sensational headlines, and run with it for self gain. What these politicians do not see are the true nature of their followers. New training from military academies. Myths of frontiersman motivating them all. Actual combat experience in Mexico. The war lasts more than a weekend because they face a much tougher adversary.<p>Lee, Jackson, Stuart, joined the military for self improvement. Opposing people like this, determined to be the best person they could be, should not be taken lightly. Virginia stayed out of it as long as they could. The war was going to be fought there regardless of what side they took and they cared little about slavery, or even government. If you look at Parson&#x27;s Cause or Patrick Henry&#x27;s Bill of Rights, they saw the Constitution as a foreign treaty. Government was a town hall meeting. On the frontier, posses were as much as you had and Faulkner was right. No one was innocent out there.<p>I would say every report of USA history is overblown except the Civil War. Far more horrible than most people think, and kept under wraps, rightly so. Why bring up all that horrible stuff again?')
