The Taiwan authorities are feeling the pressure, and the US State Department had issued a statement, urging the Chinese mainland to &quot;cease pressure against&quot; the island while reaffirming its commitment to the island. However, the juxtaposition of the three China-US joint communiqués, the Taiwan Relations Act and the six assurances mentioned in the US statement this time differs from the Trump administration&#x27;s refusal to mention the three joint communiqués in his later period.')
