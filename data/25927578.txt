I wish that (most?) public sites had some kind of filter where things disappeared. There is no reason why comments made as a kid should follow you forever. Or, if not entirely removed, then maybe the authorship masked.<p>I mean, if bad decisions fall off your credit report after 7 years, why shouldnâ€™t the stupid tweet you posted 7 years ago? This is especially true for accounts where the person was under 18 at the time.')
