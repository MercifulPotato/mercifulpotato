I posted over 20 comments in the thread you link to, covering a lot of these points; see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24785165" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24785165</a>. And if you read Troy&#x27;s original report you&#x27;ll notice that the examples he shows of them succeeding come from other places than HN:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;troyd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315441811658219520" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;troyd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315441811658219520</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;troyd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1316038695535833089" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;troyd&#x2F;status&#x2F;1316038695535833089</a><p>If there are botnets or rings escaping our attention and succeeding on HN, they would need to be several levels more sophisticated than that one.<p>One thing to realize is that HN&#x27;s anti-abuse systems don&#x27;t always reveal publicly that accounts or sites have been caught. It can often be more effective to preserve information asymmetry and fight the abuse in subtler ways.<p>Re Rohrschach: the fact that it&#x27;s considered dodgy is part of why I use the analogy. Most internet speculations about bots, astroturfers, shills, spies, brigaders, foreign agents and all the rest of it, are way dodgier than that.')
