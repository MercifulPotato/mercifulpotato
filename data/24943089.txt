The renowned conservation writer Aldo Leopold&#x27;s earliest work was killing bears, wolves, and mountain lions for the forest service.<p>Unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t until we&#x27;d nearly erased wolves and grizzlies (cougars have always been too wily to be wiped out) that we decided it was actually good to keep them around. Now we&#x27;ve got them back--but being back, they <i>will</i> need to be managed, and that includes hunting. Not wanton extermination, but rather a season tailored to remove a specific number of wolves in order to reach what the state fish &amp; wildlife department considers appropriate.')
