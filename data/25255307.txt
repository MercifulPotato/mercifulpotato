There&#x27;s a bunch of different bits that come together to cause this, but the core of it is roughly that keeping stack traces adds a cost that not everyone is willing to pay at all times. Rust is trying to figure out how to best accomplish good error handling in an environment that doesn&#x27;t provide easy answers like &quot;just do it like x at all times.&quot;<p>&gt; Is the presence of a pointer to an error object something that&#x27;s implementation-specific?<p>To use the Go parlance, errors are values in Rust. They&#x27;re not inherently special. There is an interface you can implement if you want interoperability, but Rust only gives you the <i>ability</i> to interoperate, it cannot <i>force</i> you to.')
