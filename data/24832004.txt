It was an example of potentially incredible complexity that can be arranged to large scale patterns emerge. It was the first time I took the idea of the universe being simulated (or created) seriously. Even more fascinating for me is the idea that we can&#x27;t analytically calculate the outcome. To find out what happens we have to simulate it.<p>Even <i>if</i> the real world has a creator (or is a simulation), my money would be on it being impossible for the creator to know what is going to happen. Life would be the simulation.')
