The link is a bug. Screenshots stop working if there&#x27;s a .nomedia file in the screenshot directory, removing it fixes it. That file isn&#x27;t normally there and it&#x27;s unclear how it ended up there, but it&#x27;s just a silly bug. There hasn&#x27;t been any policy change. Nothing changed with screenshots. They behave the same way today that they did 5 years ago.')
