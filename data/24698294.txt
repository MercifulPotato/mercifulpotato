Your latitude will make a huge difference to the answer. Your altitude will make quite a bit of difference to the answer. The amount of available water will make a large difference to the answer. Those 3 alone (and notice that none of them are equivalent to &quot;climate&quot; though they all play a role in determining that) mean that the answers will vary across a huge range. There&#x27;s also the nature of the soil in question, another far from trivial issue.<p>You can get some answers, however, from &quot;How to Grow More Vegetables Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine&quot; by John Jeavons. Some of the answers can be very encouraging, some not so much. I did a weekend course with Jeavons a couple of decades ago in which he pointed out that a typical single olive tree will not even produce 1 cup of olive oil.
