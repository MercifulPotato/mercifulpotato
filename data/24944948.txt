Item(by='bentcorner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604080320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943903, text='Eye contact is a big thing when driving at low speeds - if you don&#x27;t make eye contact with a driver you can assume they either don&#x27;t see you or are not going to give you right of way (e.g., if you&#x27;re jaywalking).  I can imagine moments of confusion at intersections where pedestrians are unsure what the AV car is &quot;thinking&quot;.<p>Similarly with other situations where you might leave a gap in traffic for someone to make that left turn across your congested road (would an AV even do this?), it helps to see that other driver wave you across (even if technically you don&#x27;t have right of way).')
