To my knowledge, it is the only web browser that offers without patching video hardware acceleration.<p>It works on both Xorg and Wayland.<p>But TBH, the last few releases from 79 showed some bugs and regressions that affected my user experience. From 79 to 81-82, I had to disable vaapi support otherwise it made video playing stutter.<p>And in 83, webrender caused some extensions popup Windows to be blank.<p>I hope Linux Wayland user experience will stabilize. But I switched to Firefox full time on my home laptop thanks to hw acceleration support and also tab containers.')
