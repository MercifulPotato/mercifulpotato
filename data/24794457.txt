But what I&#x27;m absolutely not going to use is bookmarking or note-taking app, storing my data on remote servers while not being fully e2e encrypted with something that cannot be broken in 50 years with all quantum-computers of the future and whatnot. This is ridiculous, especially when compared with all the fuss around &quot;highly-secure&quot; remote password managers, that you use to store a bunch of passwords (which will expire after a year) for some bullshit throw-away accounts (everything important has 2fa anyway). Heck, I&#x27;m not even always changing some passwords after I accidentally send them via messenger, because who cares. I wouldn&#x27;t want to accidentally send to somebody the full collection of my bookmarks&#x2F;notes.')
