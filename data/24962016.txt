Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604260614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961814, text='ErrorValues! Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. Post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.golang.org&#x2F;errors-are-values" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.golang.org&#x2F;errors-are-values</a><p>&gt; but readability is poor when every error must be handled many times instead of implicitly returning to callers.<p>I should clarify that I&#x27;m only using these types for parsing and transformation pipelines and not as a general replacement for exception handlingâ€”in other words only in places where you&#x27;d have to already worry about undefineds, nulls, and NaNs.')
