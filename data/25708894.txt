They were in violation of the AWS AUP.<p>For many services with millions of users, if you keep your head down, it can take them quite a while to notice you&#x27;re in violation of your contract... but yes, if you make a bunch of people angry, one of those people is going to notice you&#x27;re on AWS, pull up the AWS AUP that&#x27;s published right on their website, see that you&#x27;re in violation and report you.<p>This should be obvious to everyone.
