Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610487754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753964, text='&gt; There are a lot of Republicans in the country. Are they really ALL crazy? Are they really ALL evil?<p>No. The ones who are evil are the ones who are demonizing the November elections. Sowing distrust across this country, and creating the conditions of riots.<p>There are plenty of Republicans who care about proper transition of power. I&#x27;m one of them.<p>&gt; I think that stepping back, and trying to understand that there is another point of view, even if it is in error, would do much more for you than you can imagine.<p>What&#x27;s there to understand? They think the election is stolen, and that violence is the only way out. Its not exactly rocket science here. Yeah, I&#x27;d be pissed too if I were brainwashed into thinking the results of the election were stolen away by a cabal of conspirators.<p>As stated earlier: we had an election. There were some doubts initially about whether or not it was fair. Then there were 60+ court cases challenging the results, all 60 of them went towards one side (proving that the concerns were unfounded). They still didn&#x27;t accept the court cases, and then came to the Capitol to take the seat of power back... a coordinated protest (turned into a riot) coinciding with 130 House members + 13 Senators discussing the issue in the Capitol.<p>What left is there to talk about? The election is over. The court cases are over. The electoral college votes are solidified. They&#x27;re still angry. Where do we go from here? At some point, we just gotta say &quot;you&#x27;re angry for no good reason, stop being angry&quot; and leave them alone (and hope that they don&#x27;t get angrier).<p>And if they keep being angry and start plotting insurrection across 50 states + the Capitol to coincide with Biden&#x27;s inauguration, then I say lets deplatform the angry fools. Maybe a week off the internet will clam down their nerves a bit.<p>-------<p>So you&#x27;re against deplatforming them. I get that. What&#x27;s your proposed solution? Do you want to give them the election that they rightfully lost (by nearly 10M popular votes, and by nearly 100 Electoral votes) ? Just because they&#x27;re angry?<p>A lot of people on your side of the debate are claiming &quot;Without free speech, we don&#x27;t have a democracy&quot;. Maybe last week I would have agreed with you, but things have changed DRAMATICALLY in just a week.<p>Without __elections__, we don&#x27;t have a democracy. I place the sanctity of elections above any of your free speech concerns. Far, far above free speech concerns.')
