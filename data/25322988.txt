It may be possible to escape the inevitable destruction he describes by sustaining a culture that cares about innovation.<p>The thing that woke me up to the Apple way was when I learnt that an early macbook did not need a crossover cable, because its ethernet adapter would auto-negotiate. In design terms, this was low-hanging fruit that was lying around for years. Nobody gets paid for innovations like that, so nobody did it. Until Apple did.<p>Imagine working at a normal company, and trying to implement that. You would be scorned by colleagues and middle managers as someone who does not focus on the bottom line.<p>I doubt that IBM, HP or Dell could execute a transition like M1. Apple maintains some spark that makes it possible.<p>&gt; Can Apple outspend everybody else<p>The best things in engineering come from small teams who care about quality, and who are given room to chase it. No amount of spend or manpower can compensate for a lack of spark.')
