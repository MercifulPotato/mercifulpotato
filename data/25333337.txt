Fancy Wolf and Vulcan ranges have burner designs that mitigate this issue, but I&#x27;ve never see them on anything cheaper than a few thousand dollars.<p>OTOH, even a basic GE induction range has almost no heat waste.  So while a burner might only be rated for 10k BTUs, all of that heat is going into your pan.  Which is how they do things like boil water in 2 minutes.<p>The biggest issue with induction is that the larger ones have enormous power requirements.')
