Item(by='rallison', descendants=None, kids=[24747691], score=None, time=1602400581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744119, text='&gt; Downvoting and brigading don’t change them.<p>Just to be clear, I did not downvote, nor brigade.<p>&gt; No, it doesn’t. You’re cherry-picking old data, and ignoring the links I gave you, which tell you the updated numbers:<p>I think you may not have understood the numbers in your link.<p>&gt; ages 0-19: .003%\nages 20-49: .02%\nages 50-69: .5%\nages 70+: 5.4%<p>Calculate the overall IFR from these numbers given the age breakdown of the population of the US, and you&#x27;ll end up a bit above 0.6%, which is what I said (when referencing 0.65%). Your link explicitly confirms what I said.<p>&gt; The old reported numbers in New York are not a counterargument: we now know that number of cases was drastically under-counted, and the inferred IFR, if you use the right denominator, was a fraction of a percent.<p>You misunderstood this. When I referred to NYC boroughs and countries, I was referring to population fatality rates. Those are independent of case rates - it&#x27;s a measure of what percentage of the entire population of an area has died, independent of infection spread. They help set baselines.<p>&gt; You clearly know this, because you’re trying to talk about the rates in “boroughs” which are higher. But sample heterogeneity matters: I’m sure if you compute the IFR in Maimonedes ICU, it’s really high, too. The fact is, the fatality rate estimated by the Santa Clara study has been shown to be correct, and you’re simply spreading misinformation, because these new facts aren’t as scary.<p>That&#x27;s fine. We can look at entire states. 0.18% of the entire population of New Jersey has died from Covid. 0.17% of the entire population of New York has died from Covid. And does anyone think nearly the entire population of NJ or NY has been infected already? No. Even in NYC, we&#x27;ve only seen a couple of boroughs that have shown around 50% antibody positives, with most in the 20-30% range. And, of course, incidence rates in the rest of New York state are lower than NYC. What does this mean? With 0.17% of the entire population of NY state dead from Covid, with incidence rates generally at 1&#x2F;5 to 1&#x2F;3 of NYC, with incidence rates lower in NY outside of NYC, the implied IFR for NY state is north of 0.5%.<p>With all that said.. you sourced a CDC resource that puts the IFR of Covid-19 above 0.6%. You used it to support a claim of Covid having a similar IFR to flu. Given that your source actually confirmed the IFR I mentioned, does that change your stance?')
