For me an answer is as good as the question. If you reach the ultimate question the ultimate answers reveals itself. I liken it to maha ati, trungpa and rigdzin shikpo explain:<p>&quot;The ground of samsara and nirvana, the beginning and end of both confusion and realization, the nature of universal shunyata and of all apparent phenomena, more fundamental even than the trikaya because it is free from bias toward enlightenment, is the alaya, some-times called the pure or original mind. Although&#x27; prajna sees in it no basis for such concepts as different as-pects, yet three fundamental aspects of complete openness, natural perfection, and absolute spontaneity are distinguished by upaya as useful devices. \nComplete openess.<p>All aspects of every phenomenon are completely clear and lucid. The whole universe is open and unobstructed, everything mutually interpenetrating. Since all things are naked, clear, and free from obscurations, there is nothing to attain or to realize. The nature of things naturally appears and is naturally present in time-transcending awareness. The everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions and to all people, experiencing everything totally without mental reservations and blockages,  so that one never withdraws or centralizes onto oneself. This produces a  tremendous energy which is usually locked up in the processes of mental evasion and generally running away from life experiences. Clarity of awareness may in its initial stages be unpleasant or fear inspiring. If so, then one should open oneself completely to the pain or the fear and welcome it. In this way the barriers created by one&#x27;s own habitual emotional reactions and prejudices are broken down. When performing the meditation practice one should get the feeling of opening oneself out completely to the whole universe with absolute simplicity and nakedness of mind, ridding oneself of all &quot;protecting&quot; barriers. Don&#x27;t  mentally split in two when meditating, one part of the mind watching the other like a cat watching a mouse. One should realize that one does not meditate in order to go deeply into oneself and withdraw from the world.&quot;')
