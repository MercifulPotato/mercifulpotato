However, the reason for having a weapon up when doing corner drills or stair drills isn&#x27;t because you&#x27;re pointing at someone already in view, it&#x27;s to have the weapon pointing at someone who comes into view. His weapon is up because he thinks someone might either step into view or become visible as he continues to move. He is the only LEO I see not pointing his weapon at the floor the whole time so his actions stand out to me.<p>He may have been following his SOPs perfectly. I don&#x27;t think this is an appropriate SOP for LEOs to use in this situation. I don&#x27;t think this case called for having weapons drawn at all. My view is that this SOP is likely to contribute to unnecessary civilian injuries and deaths.')
