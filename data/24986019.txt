Disallow at will M&amp;A&#x27;s,and also force anyone that still goes down that route and manages to succeed to justify their continued consolidated existence.<p>In short the market&#x2F;regulatory environment should support disaggregated business as a first class citizen, mergers and vertical integration as a very second-class construct. To the tune of if you merge, you must maintain 3 sets of accounts. The original accounts separately, and a combined set. You must gain more capability or utility to create value for the public as the combined company than by being separate. The capacity to measure the utility amplification being facilitated through the extra set of books. As more companies are bought and merged, the audit workloads would increase very quickly. Failure to make a good case for why you should continue to run as a merged company kicks in an orderly spin-off of the previous acquisition to get operated by someone else. M&amp;A&#x27;s should not be one and done. This greatly complicates hostile takeovers, makes the business model by which large entrenched entities buy out and kill up and coming competitors, at best, a stalling tactic, but more often a worthless waste of time to the perpetrating company as much as it is to the public.<p>If you let M&amp;A&#x27;s have their cake (the capital assets of another company) while giving them the option to cut fat without insisting that they &quot;compensate&quot; the public for the decrease in competition, only one side will ever benefit, and it won&#x27;t be the public.')
