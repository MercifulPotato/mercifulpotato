Item(by='neogodless', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611696023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917466, text='&gt; Over the last year or so, we moved from using hard drives to SSDs as boot drives. We have a little over 1,200 SSDs acting as boot drives today. We are validating the SMART and failure data we are collecting on these SSD boot drives. Weâ€™ll keep you posted if we have anything worth publishing.<p>Would love to see SSD stats like this in the future. Recently was talking to some friends about what SSD to buy. I personally really like my HP EX950 - one friend said he&#x27;d never buy HP hardware. He said he was getting an Intel - I said I had an early Intel SSD fail on me, and I don&#x27;t think QLC is the best option, but it is a nice value play. For performance, I do like Samsung, though they are expensive. Another friend said he&#x27;d never buy a Samsung SSD, as he had a reliability issue, and found lots of similar stories when he was researching it.<p>Of course these are all anecdotes and they aren&#x27;t useful in making an informed choice. I suspect most SSDs are reliable &quot;enough&quot; for most consumer use, and not nearly reliable enough for certain kinds of critical storage needs. But it would still be nice to see the big picture, and be able to factor that into your SSD purchase decisions.')
