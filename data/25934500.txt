The shorts are going to lose, no doubt. But once they&#x27;ve lost, the stock price is probably $20. A lot of WSBers are going to be holding stock at that point, and possibly on margin. And that stock is going to be a crappy retail stock. At which point it&#x27;ll be a slow drift as they cut their losses and move onto the next meme stock.<p>The stock price today is irrelevant if you&#x27;re not going to sell, and that&#x27;s what WSB Thto be saying. The price is going to drop much faster than it rose.')
