Like other indie hackers, I believe in building-in-public and being transparent about what you work on - and the results that come with it.<p>My friend, Damien, has been on the fence about becoming an indie hacker. He works a normal, full-time job, but in my opinion has creative skills and the potential to pursue his own projects and thrive from it. I also know that deep down he&#x27;s not completely fulfilled by what he currently does for a living.<p>I believe true fulfilment comes from creating.<p>Hence, I started a newsletter called Convincing Damien. Every week I send out a short email focussed on one actionable tip to help people like Damien become indie hackers.<p>You can signup for the newsletter here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;convincingdamien.kollood.co<p>These insights come from working on my own projects for the last three years. You can also read more about me, Matthew, over here â†’ https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattfreire.blog<p>Thanks for reading and happy hacking!')
