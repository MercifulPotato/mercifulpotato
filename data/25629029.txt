Do you know where genuine bohemian living is to be found today? Certainly not in NYC or any other major urban centre. Instead, you need to run off to a dying rust-best town in Ohio and buy out an empty storefront where your neighbours will be a liquor store and a Pentecostal church. There are places where you can pay $200&#x2F;month in rent, or buy a house for under $50k. Go to one of those and build yourself an artistic utopia.<p>Of course my interests are not neutral here. I&#x27;m from a place like this, and after a decade of urban living I decided to move back. It&#x27;s not trendy or sexy, but I encourage people to give it a try.')
