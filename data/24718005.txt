After a few weeks my tinnitus had become way worse. After 3-4 months it had died down a bit (but not to what it used to be before the pods.)<p>I then used them again for a couple of days. And it became even worse. Haven&#x27;t used them for 6 months and unfortunately it is still as bad.<p>I don&#x27;t dare using them or my Bose headphones anymore. Your comment is the first I&#x27;ve seen relating noise cancelling with tinnitus.')
