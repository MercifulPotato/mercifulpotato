I swear most of these papers aren&#x27;t even read, even if they are cited.  There are whole layers of publication politics that force people to cite work that is almost completely unrelated, if not unrelated and saying so, just to inflate citation counts.  It&#x27;s basically a follow-for-follow system.  Same for author lists.<p>Also totally agree that the papers are written for these referees, instead of the people reading them (which many times I think is not any).  Many of these papers are also written in order to give presentations or talks at conferences where papers are expected, since it is publishing and not speaking that gives you a line on your CV.<p>Also how tenure doesn&#x27;t save you, I feel this is the same as in tech, where they won&#x27;t fire you but they will try to manage you out or make life so unpalatable that you will just leave.')
