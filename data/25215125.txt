My neighbor doing well isn&#x27;t making me worse off.<p>The current growth in inequality does look bad - the bank bailouts in &#x27;08 are a good example of a problem - but if you try to start a conversation first with inequality you aren&#x27;t going to the underlying problem. The underlying problem is that increasingly the people with power are wielding it to stamp out prosperity. Commercial failures, in particular, should go bankrupt, not be rewarded. Companies that rely on massive amounts of debt should be crumpling under the load. The major governments of the world are creating an environment where these companies can limp on for extended periods of time, burning resources (that other people could have used) as they go.')
