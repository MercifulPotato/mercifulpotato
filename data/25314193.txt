Social media is sick. Some people&#x27;s tweets read like she is some kind of a George Floyd level victim. She had the best job one can have. Lead researcher who got resources to build a team to work on her own research interest, having all the freedom. And making a killing doing it. She blew it and her race has nothing to do with what happened. She will be fine, joining academia as a tenured professor most likely. If you care about social justice focus on real victims who really need help. Not about this privileged researcher.')
