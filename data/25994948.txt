I think the other complaints may be regional - and the fact that the proposed solutions all seem to be vaporizing humidifiers (or boiling water) seems telling.<p>I got one because in Arizona, the water quality&#x27;s terrible, but the air is <i>bone-dry</i> to the point it turns your skin to sandpaper. The hard water means that vaporizing humidifiers fill the air with white dust that coats <i>everything</i>, because they vaporize the minerals. Evaporative humidifiers don&#x27;t; the minerals all end up in the filter. And, while an evaporative humidifier has no trouble going through a full tank of water overnight on the lowest settings in AZ, it phsyically can&#x27;t oversaturate the air like a sauna in the way that a vaporizing humidifier does.<p>The air in the north east just doesn&#x27;t get dry enough (maybe in winter, but then you don&#x27;t have the AC fighting your humidifier), and if boiling a pot of water is what the author&#x27;s looking for, an evaporative humidifier just doesn&#x27;t do that.')
