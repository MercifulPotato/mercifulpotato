That&#x27;s not a problem in itself, that happens.<p>But then I discovered that the <i>tooling</i> of btrfs is awful to use. Tools to repair, restore, check, scrub, ... I think I got it to finally print some filenames of missing files after a huge amount of hoops. Just see how complex btrfs restore is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.wiki.kernel.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Restore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;btrfs.wiki.kernel.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Restore</a>. Ideally those tools would know how btrfs works internally including all indirections and be able to translate that into recovering files to the user, not have, for example, a user manually puzzle together objectid numbers from a huge list.<p>But anyway, that made me simply format everything back to ext4 and go with that again for now.<p>So, I was a happy btrfs user until I discovered how bad its tooling is. No issues with bugs or anything though.<p>I really want btrfs to become better given that it&#x27;s present in the kernel and has checksums, cow, .... I hope it&#x27;ll keep improving!')
