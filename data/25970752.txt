What I&#x27;m trying to get across is that people are more used to and, therefore, inured to their dark patterns. There&#x27;s a learning curve for navigating any website&#x27;s dark patterns, so I&#x27;m more comfortable using a site whose dark patterns I believe I can recognize and avoid than one I haven&#x27;t used before and am consequently more likely to be victimized by.<p>I&#x27;m definitely overestimating my own ability to avoid Amazon&#x27;s scammy tactics. I, like most people, am reluctant to admit that I&#x27;m vulnerable to manipulation by things like these dark patterns (and ads, PR, etc.). But since I&#x27;m talking about my subjective feelings towards the websites, I think how good I _feel_ I am is relevant.<p>I totally agree with everything you&#x27;ve said, but just want to clarify my initial comment. I&#x27;m not trying to let Amazon off the hook, though they are less problematic than almost all of the other examples in the article.')
