You&#x27;re from the same pool of people I last saw harassing employees over at Linode when they started matching DigitalOcean with the offering of $5&#x2F;month VMs. Within just a few days, there were forum posts complaining that $5&#x2F;month was still too expensive compared to the previous $10&#x2F;month minimum, and that the cheapest VM should be $2&#x2F;month. What you&#x27;re asking for barely pays for the electricity to run a server, let alone covering even 1% of a single employee&#x27;s salary (out of hundreds or thousands of employees), or the company&#x27;s many other expenses.<p>I&#x27;m tired of people bashing on hosting providers. They provide services which take many thousands of man-hours to plan, engineer, and develop at insane scale and high availability. They only charge what are already bottom-of-the-barrel prices; yet the only thing users can do is complain about $5 or $15 a month for professional services that, by the way, none of these complainers could ever &quot;do better&#x2F;cheaper on their own&quot; (a common–and fictitious–criticism).')
