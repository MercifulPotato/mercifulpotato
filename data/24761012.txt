If strongly recommend you make this available on these three platforms: DigitalOcean Marketplace, Cloudron and Softaculous. Having a one-click installation option in DigitalOcean is going to give you more leads, and IMO the hottest “host it yourself” platform now is Cloudron. Folks who run Cloudron are extremely helpful so they would help you with it. Not really sure about DigitalOcean and Softaculous.<p>I’m subscribing for the lifetime option, and wish you all the best!<p>Disclaimer: I’m not affiliated with Softaculous, DO or Cloudron, just thankful towards everyone who took the time to make one-click options available.')
