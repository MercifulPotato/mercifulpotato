If I am hiking alone, it is often in a form of walking meditation so I wear Kevlar rattlesnake guards on my legs so that it is safe not paying careful attention looking out for rattlesnakes.<p>I feel like I have strange snake karma. Once in India, I was not looking where I was going and turned around and almost bumped into a snake charmer with a cobra, that guy was understandably pissed off at me. Another time I was snorkeling on the big island in Hawaii, disturbed a sea snake that closely followed me for a hundred feet, really it seemed to be chasing me out of its territory.')
