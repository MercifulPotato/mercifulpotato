First of all lots of people who would have bought expensive cars bought Tesla, its absurdly wrong to claim every Tesla buyer would have bought a Civic instead. You are suffering from massive selection bias.<p>And consumer products are almost always more then just pure base value.<p>&gt; But Manufacturing consists a bulk of carbon footprint, so if you cared you&#x27;d get a used car.<p>So everybody who cars can never buy a used car and the people who buy new cars buy gas cars that eventually turn into used gas cars?<p>Do you really not understand how that makes absolutely no sense what so ever?<p>&gt; But, the reason Tesla is doing well is not because it beat the Germans at their own game (as the articles want to imply). It is because they played a different game all together.<p>German game was to build expensive cars the people really wanted. And so did Tesla.')
