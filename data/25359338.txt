If they were clearly aware of this, why go ahead in one of the most-watched &quot;deployments&quot; (in my life-time), and invite the potential risk (and it&#x27;s a huge risk) in only after it&#x27;s gone &quot;live&quot; with the real population? I mean, if I knew those subgroups would be problematic, I sure as hell would make sure the first week of those vaccinations would go as smooth as possible (with all the media and the rest of humanity carefully watching), and give it to people I am most certain will be fine with it. Everything else, the trials should&#x27;ve caught, or should catch in the near future? Why play the risk on day one?!')
