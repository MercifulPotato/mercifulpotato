These he saw as social productions and he wanted to describe their cause, how they came about, without referring to some inherent rationalism (these studies are possible because we can make an assumption about the nature of human cognition) or Marxist historical materialism (they are Capitalist apparatuses of control).<p>This is what all his work is about and I hope it helps dispel this myth that &quot;the postmodernists&quot; are responsible, it would be more accurate to say that the interpretations and applications of those writers by American Humanities departments that the contemporary &quot;identity politics&quot; (post-colonialism seems more accurate to me) derives from.')
