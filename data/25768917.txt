But what I am concerned about is that if Signal is US-based, couldn’t the state demand Signal’s app signing key via a NSL, and couldn’t that signing key then be used for targeted attacks by which someone of interest gets a Signal app upgrade that is malicious (while everyone else gets the non-malicious app)? I admit to being somewhat unfamiliar with Android distribution through the Play Store, so if this is unfeasible, help me understand why.')
