But mostly we can manually troubleshoot them, In 10 years I have fried a motherboard, bricked 2 psu, ram and 3 harddrives. Its that I can just fix broken part and get going.<p>Hardware upgrades are only required if you are resource constrained, like require multiple vm, or multimedia editing and some crypot type gpu and cpu intensive stuffs. Even in those cases desktop shines.<p>Laptops are really great for mobility and they are really  capable machines which can be configured to comparable performance with most of the desktops but not in durability and flexibility.')
