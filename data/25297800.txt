Competition is a great mechanism for preventing counterproductive policies like favoring tenure, avoiding accountability, and so forth.<p>There are also other benefits (unrelated to compensation) from having competing unions. To get more concrete about this, consider that the National Education Association (largest union in the US, representing teachers) is very politically biased and recently started pushing the NYT&#x27;s &quot;1619 Project&quot; on educators (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;the-1619-project&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neaedjustice.org&#x2F;resource&#x2F;the-1619-project&#x2F;</a>). I find this to be unacceptable because it is weaponizing public schooling to achieve political ends, which is indistinguishable from what we label as &quot;propaganda&quot; in other countries (except that it comes from a big monolithic union rather than a government). Not to mention the 1619 project is factually incorrect (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;1619-project-new-york-times-mistake-122248" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;06&#x2F;1619-proje...</a>).<p>So if you&#x27;re a student, parent, or educator who disagrees with the NEA&#x27;s push with the 1619 project, what can you do? If you want to keep your job, you&#x27;re obligated to pay the union dues, subsidize their institutional politics, and play along with union rules. Having several competing teacher unions, on the other hand, would allow for those who disagree with this politicization to separate themselves from the NEA while still having access to jobs and having the ability to collectively bargain as their own subset.<p>Put another way, unions as implemented in US law grant local labor monopolies to unions. Fundamentally, this is no different than when a big telecom player like Comcast has a local monopoly. We can see it&#x27;s not healthy in that instance, so why is this any different?')
