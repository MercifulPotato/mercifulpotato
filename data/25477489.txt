As long as you give input, the wheel turns.\nIt is not quiet.  It is a mechanical device.\nPush trim for a 1&#x2F;2 second, the wheel turns a bit.\nAutopilot puts in trim, the wheel turns.\nMCAS puts in trim, the wheel turns.\nThis is a very obvious and continuous source of information to the pilot that the stab trim is changing.')
