Item(by='speeder', descendants=None, kids=[25795061, 25794972, 25799208, 25796641, 25796155], score=None, time=1610737725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794374, text='Lua is tied with C as my favourite languages.<p>I personally DO use Lua sometimes to code general purpose stuff.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t see Lua ever having &quot;batteries&quot;, the language wasn&#x27;t invented for that purpose, and the original sponsor of the language wouldn&#x27;t want it changing in that direction (I dunno if they still sponsor it though).<p>Lua was invented by PUC-Rio (Catholic University, Rio de Janeiro campus) at the request of PETROBRAS, its purpose was &quot;describe&quot; stuff, and replace another language that they already had, plus being turing complete, because they got tired of hacking things endlessy whenever they needed to describe something &quot;new&quot; in their systems.<p>So to &quot;describe&quot; stuff, Lua doesn&#x27;t need libraries.<p>That said... currently Lua most popular use is add some kind of scripting environment to other software, still that often means a library would be useless, and even then sometimes that usage is still to describe things, for example the game &quot;Crusader Kings 2&quot;, use Lua to read a file named &quot;defines.lua&quot;, and all it does is set some constants, another use of Lua that I find interesting is &quot;xmake&quot;, Lua programs in it are very descriptive, using Lua syntax features to &quot;tell&quot; things to the system, instead of looking like anything resembling a normal imperative program.<p>EDIT: about community size... yeah, it is tiny :( I never found a Lua job, companies that use Lua often hire a programmer of other languages and teach him Lua, I am also currently using PUC-Rio official GUI library (iup) and never found anyone else using it to ask questions about it, I&#x27;ve been in PUC-Rio during a tech event, and when I asked around if anyone knew where Lua authors were, the people that study and work there, didn&#x27;t knew they had anything to do with Lua in first place!!!')
