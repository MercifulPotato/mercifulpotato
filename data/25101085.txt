Iâ€™ll have mature teammates who understand the right tool for the right job. I<p>Honest question: what leads you to believe that Ruby on Rails, or even Ruby, is the right tool for the right job? You didn&#x27;t even mentioned the job, so why do you automatically assume Ruby is the right tool?<p>Additionally, by ignoring popularity you&#x27;re also ignoring availability of documentation and examples and mindshare. You&#x27;re also ignoring experience, and prior onboarding into a language stack, which automatically means odds are anyone onboarding into the project will quickly be up and running.<p>Speaking as someone who was forced to onboard into a Ruby project just because a predecessor jumped on the bandwagon, the experience was an unmitigated disaster. A minor onboarding task that consisted of tweaking a hard codes settin in a module required me and a couple of colleagues to spend a few days a) learning a brand new programming language, b) learning exotic frameworks, c) getting acquainted with idiomatic Ruby, d) learning how to troubleshoot and debug Ruby applications, e) properly setup a software dev environment, and f) finally fix the issue.<p>If my predecessor opted to use Python instead of succumbing to bandwagons and resume-driven development practices, the same thing would take a couple of man&#x2F;hours.<p>How does can this sort of snafu pass off as the right tool for the right job?')
