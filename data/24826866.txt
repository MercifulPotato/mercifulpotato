Those little Lack tables are sturdy enough that they&#x27;re often used as a cheap rack mounts by guitarists. Iirc they&#x27;re almost perfectly a 1U width and depth, for anyone looking into a home lab. Add a couple of corner brackets and a layer of sealer and they&#x27;ll take an outrageous beating.<p>That said, a benefit to the lack(heh) of quality is how light everything is. I do a lot of projects that require using my entire living space. If it wasn&#x27;t so easy to just shove the furniture out of the way, I&#x27;d have that much more inertia between me and doing what I want.')
