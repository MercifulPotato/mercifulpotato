App Library discovered when you &quot;hide&quot; an app. Togglable pages discovered when you tap on dots in wiggle mode. Widgets discovered via + in wiggle mode. Many people won&#x27;t know about any of this, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>Same with Pro apps and plugins, or side-loading. Gradually discovered complexity, and only if you need[0].<p>The post does not argue for introducing a Finder and a file system, or overlapping windows.<p>[0] - one possible downside would be if for App Store rules reasons some major apps would go for side-loading. Even if only Netflix decided to move away from the App Store and educate customers how to install via side-loading, it would suck for most people AND Apple. Probably the main reason why Apple will do anything in it&#x27;s power to never allow this to happen.')
