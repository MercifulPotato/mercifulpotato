Since the gate is wired to Vdd, the transistor is stuck on so it provides a fixed current limited by its size.<p>That seems wrong? Q3 appears to be effectively acting as a diode with cathode fixed at -9V and a 5V threshold, such that Q2&#x27;s gate (Q3&#x27;s anode) can never be above -4V, but will be pulled lower by the capacitor if `out` drops. (At which point Q3 doesn&#x27;t provide any current because its anode is down at -18V.)')
