Item(by='Steuard', descendants=None, kids=[25178523, 25178570], score=None, time=1606060063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177814, text='For main ingredients, sure: when baking bread, I measure flour and water into a bowl sitting on a kitchen scale, and it&#x27;s great.<p>But there&#x27;s no way that I could measure the <i>yeast</i> with my kitchen scale! When a (US) recipe calls for &quot;1&#x2F;4 tsp yeast&quot;, I&#x27;d be lucky if that were even one gram, and that&#x27;s my scale&#x27;s resolution. Same for salt, and for lots of other seasonings. (I suppose I could get a high-precision lab-grade balance for that sort of thing? Seems a bit more complicated than just using a few measuring spoons.)<p>That said, I completely agree about the ambiguities involved. If anyone out there happens to know what the heck &quot;1&#x2F;4 tsp of saffron threads&quot; is supposed to mean, I&#x27;m all ears. (Thoroughly crumbled, I&#x27;ll bet I could fit $20 of saffron into 1&#x2F;4 tsp. Not crumbled at all, even half a dozen threads arch up above the spoon like some sort of abstract wireframe sculpture.)')
