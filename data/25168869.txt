This seems to be a very divisive issue, others prefer working from home, others prefer the office. Some are downright miserable in their home offices. I&#x27;m guessing some were also miserable at their work offices but didn&#x27;t have a choice.<p>If this involuntary experiment has taught us anything, it&#x27;s that people are very different in their preference. Hopefully people will be allowed a choice when the situation is over.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that a lot of people don&#x27;t miss the office as much as they miss the social interaction with their co-workers. If a part of the people will return to the office and others prefer to stay home, the social interaction won&#x27;t be there as it used to and there is a risk of splitting into two camps.<p>My company has said that WFH will be available to everyone once offices open again. I am very grateful for that.<p>I miss my coworkers too, but mostly the lunches and after work beers and coffee breaks. What I do not miss is the daily commute and actually trying to get work done in a distracting office environment.')
