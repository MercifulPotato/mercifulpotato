That way I can do all my coding in my nice shiny Apple UI, and all the build&#x2F;test&#x2F;run stuff happens in a place I have full control over.<p>This probably doesn’t solve everyone’s problems but for me it was the best way to have my Linux cake and eat my candy Apple too.<p>And yeah, the ZSH thing was super annoying.')
