But if you want to double down you need to have better evidence and a better argument. This is the logic that applies in any lab; sure take a punt look at x or y, if you&#x27;re right then you&#x27;ll get a grant and your career will thrive. If you&#x27;re wrong you&#x27;re out.<p>That&#x27;s happened to many people (Hossenfelder included?) but it&#x27;s now happening to the community and no one likes it. But given that is how science as an institution operates they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised.<p>Here&#x27;s a thought experiment. Would there be a bid for a new 100Tev machine if super symmetry had been confirmed at LHC? My bet is :for sure. And the key argument would be &quot;we told you that we were good last time, so you have to back us this time&quot;')
