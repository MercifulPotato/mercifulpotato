This is a direct consequence of signal detection theory and is why you see things described as spectrum disorders, because diagnostic codes are applied to sets of symptoms that are produced by multiple different underlying etiologies, including underlying conditions which would fall into the category of &quot;normal&quot; in the population. This is exacerbated by the fact that there is significant variability in how the person assigning the codes assesses the symptoms. An example example of this is that medical professionals consistently underestimate the amount of pain experienced by black Americans [1], and this is pain which is about is unambiguous as you can get.<p>The question then becomes, can we measure the various biases in these systems to try to recover what is really going on. Usually the answer is no. In the case of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease post mortem pathology is absolutely required in order for a diagnosis to be confirmed, and we don&#x27;t do enough autopsies to improve our models for mapping behavioral diagnosis to the pathology (which is definitional). This situation may improve over time, but as long as we cannot directly measure underlying etiology, those who may or may not suffer from an underlying condition will continue to be subjected to the current, clearly inadequate, system.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4843483&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4843483&#x2F;</a>')
