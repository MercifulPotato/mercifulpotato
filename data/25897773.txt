Information-wise, it&#x27;s not very dense.  It&#x27;s hard to customize; doing so requires a bunch of hacky stuff: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AryToNeX&#x2F;Glasscord&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Installation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AryToNeX&#x2F;Glasscord&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Installation</a><p>Using a third-party client is a bannable offense under the terms of service.

It&#x27;s also a voice conferencing app, which should shut up and transmit&#x2F;receive audio, not try to double as a social network.<p>I know a lot of other people who seem to like it as well; good for y&#x27;all.
