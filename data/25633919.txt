Publicly traded software companies aren&#x27;t hedge funds, they&#x27;re not supposed to be making the kind of investments that can do that.<p>We have a different vision of what traded companies do.<p>For me, a traded company gives either a dividen, or shows a pattern of growth that is reflected in the share price - in either case, it will give me profits in the end, which is all I care about. I do not care about the &quot;how&quot; - that&#x27;s the CEO and board job. I care about the profits. And so do you if you are not retired, because without profit, you won&#x27;t be employed by this company for long.<p>A company that can adapt to a new trend, cut out bad lines of business, and give me more profit is a company I can consider for investment.<p>All that matters is the bottomline! Unfortunately many people here focus on useless things like technical debt or CICD pipelines, while they are just tools.')
