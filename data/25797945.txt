The numeric for loop is there, of course, and the index of the pair (index, value) returned by ipairs will be 1 based. of course.<p>Iteration isn&#x27;t why 1-based indexing is bad, it really shows its inadequacy when doing interval maths. I make abstract syntax trees in Lua, and a node in that tree with zero width at the 4th position is { left = 4, right = 3 } which is... awful.')
