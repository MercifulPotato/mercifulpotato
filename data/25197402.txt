I disagree with that: masks are not a simpler alternative to socialising outdoors, they are a necessary prerequisite. <i>You must do both</i>, not pick one or the other. Additionally, you should consider socialising less often, with a smaller group of people, and any other steps you can take without putting your mental health in jeopardy.')
