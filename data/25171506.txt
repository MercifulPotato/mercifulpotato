Instead, it requires that you cannot change the <i>target</i> function Î³ without the expected loss becoming worse.<p>The paper I referenced even includes a theorem saying that, as long as the value to be estimated can not be exactly deduced from the observation, no estimator is both Bayes-optimal and unbiased.\nHowever for many observations, the Bayes-optimal estimator becomes asymptotically unbiased.')
