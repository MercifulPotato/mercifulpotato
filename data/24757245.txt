We know lockdowns can work because China successfully pulled one off at the beginning of this debacle and people there were largely going about their normal lives after about 6 weeks. The question is really do politicians in the US have the balls to actually prosecute a successful lockdown in the Chinese style (no leaving the house more than X times per week and only to perform essential activities, checkpoints, non-voluntary temperature checks, forced quarantines, forced mask usage, arrests for non-compliance, shutdown of every non-essential business, etc). The answer to that is a resounding no.')
