I usually just go with 8.8.8.8&#x2F;8.8.4.4, I used to always test this with Namebench (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Namebench" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Namebench</a>) and these always turned out as the fastest - but it looks like it hasn&#x27;t been updated since 2010 - are there any better tools for this, or any considerations in general? I prefer performance over privacy here, I think privacy should be on a different layer.')
