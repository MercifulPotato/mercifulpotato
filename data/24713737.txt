Item(by='arrosenberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602111079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706061, text='&gt; Do you know why chain stores are successful? It&#x27;s because their market power allows them to acquire products cheaper from suppliers, which lets them sell those products for cheaper than smaller stores. Lower costs = lower prices = customers benefit. It&#x27;s silly to say that we need the small store to survive if it sells product X for more than the chain store without offering any other benefit than merely providing the product.<p>Which is exactly why we have laws on the books from the era when my theory of market power never existed.<p>Low price = customer benefit isn’t written in stone, except on Robert Bork’s grave.<p>Customers benefit from a fair distribution of economic activity also, it’s just harder to quantify. Unfortunately some unscrupulous economists have used that fact to push pro-concentration policies.')
