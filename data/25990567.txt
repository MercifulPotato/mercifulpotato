A bit of a strawman.<p>Many regimes that have been dictatorial for decades have fallen. Itâ€™s easy to name them. South Korea is a particularly good example where its history is marked by alternating periods of democratic and autocratic rule and now they are a stable and wealthy democratic country. The last few years in Myanmar was a hopeful surprise as they made inroads towards a constitutional democracy, albeit with a lingering junta in the shadows. That did not happen without international pressure. The world is different today, where events are seen worldwide in an instant and movements are inspired in an instant. Many countries expressed shock at what happened on Jan 6 and the four years of isolationism preceding. It will be harder today to call out Myanmar for what the autocrats are doing. The reply will be scorn about our hypocrisy. The madmen are stepping out of the shadows of shame.')
