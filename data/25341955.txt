The point is not about what I would do, or could do, in a situation like that. The point was that people don&#x27;t behave rationally in situations like that; not because they&#x27;re fools, or weak, or immature; it&#x27;s because they are having a physiological response to extreme emotional trauma. If they don&#x27;t, they are textbook sociopaths, or have been put through large amounts of emotional conditioning.<p>Read through your comment:\n&quot;I doubt the husband has a firearm handy or a means to defend himself for this situation. So his emotional response to attack without proper weaponry is foolish&quot;<p>This point of view is speculative, it doesn&#x27;t come from experience (or even a basic psychological understanding). People do NOT function that way. Maybe they do when playing Call of Duty or watching a Die Hard movie, but not in real life. I can&#x27;t really impart what it feels like in that sort of situation, but I hope you never have to experience it. You end up needing therapy.')
