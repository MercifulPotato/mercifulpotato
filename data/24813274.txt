So you don&#x27;t have asymptomatic spread and other things. This ultimately comes down to exactly what you mean by &quot;infectious&quot; though.<p>&gt; is totally unproven speculation.<p>At this point we have more known Covid-19 long haulers in the US than there are Sars-1 <i>infections</i> globally. Comparisons to SARS-1 don&#x27;t much matter.<p>&gt; absolutely does happen in bad flu seasons<p>Indeed it does, most people weren&#x27;t aware of this, and covid-19 making people more aware of the danger of the flu isn&#x27;t a bad thing. Get vaccinated!<p>&gt; youâ€™d have hospital A overflowing yet hospital B 10 miles away was at 30% capacity remaining.<p>There was a period of time when NYC was globally short on ventilators and ICU beds. Raw hospital beds were never a real concern.<p>Also worth remembering that NYC <i>would have</i> run out of hospital beds entirely if they didn&#x27;t implement strict lockdown measures. The NYC (or really NY) stay at home order went into effect on March 20, and daily cases peaked plateaued 1.5 weeks later.')
