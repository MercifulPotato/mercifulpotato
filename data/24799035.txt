Makes zero sense. If you do not have a progeny, focus on maximizing your pleasure instead  of caring for the world that isn&#x27;t going to remember you.<p>The biological purpose of human life is to reproduce, and making sure your progeny reproduces until the heat death of the universe. All the education and hoops most people pass through are just ways to gain access to better mates and ensure better survival of your progeny like civilizations that become multi-planetary will be more resistant to any proliferation event.<p>If you believe in a religion that is Abrahimic like Judaism, Christianity or Islam, then you&#x27;d have another meaning to life.')
