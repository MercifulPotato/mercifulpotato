To get inflation we put a basket of things in the numerator, and currency in the denominator, then compute annualized % change in the said number.<p>Now if you swap (in the denominator) the USD for either gold or bitcoin you&#x27;ll conclude we&#x27;ve been in a severe deflation in 2020.<p>(I do not agree with the above,  I am just fixing basic mistakes in your reasoning)<p>If you would like your basket of things (the numerator) to consist solely of Bitcoin or gold then go ahead but you may as well put baseball collectible cards there, as it doesn&#x27;t relate to people&#x27;s consumption needs.')
