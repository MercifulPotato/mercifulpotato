It is visually distinct, and follows the centuries of typographical design we use to acquire written symbols.  And it refers to a well-known concept.<p>So I have no objection to it.<p>Of course there are some symbols which are easier to visually acquire, and <i>seem</i> to refer to well-defined concepts.  But even the various smileys are unintelligible as to their meaning when taken as a group.<p>So once one gets off the basic &quot;smiling face&#x2F;thumbs up&#x2F;thumbs down&quot; subset I&#x27;d say it is a disaster for communication in a professional setting, and is exclusionary in a way that its proponents actually want it to be - as an in-group indicator that makes them feel a part of something that &quot;others&quot; are not.')
