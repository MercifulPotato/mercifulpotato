From my personal experience the &#x27;stable&#x27; releases are just to slow to keep up with the demands on frequency of updates.<p>To illustrate what I mean, and this is ofcourse very subjective and dependent on my use case etc:\nI work on and manage hosting for RoR applications.\nI have a linux laptop I cannot develop on because I cannot install a recent version of ruby. Yes I can compile it manually or whatever, but that defeats the point of having distros etc.<p>On our hosting platform we use AWS linux, which is based of Centos. The latest version of Ruby on AWS linux is 7 years old. Our app probably wouldn&#x27;t even run on it.<p>So we use containers. Special custom ruby images with recent versions build in a stable debian base.\nNow I have the problem that a.o nginx and nodejs have no recent versions available; versions that we either need for features or just because random dependecies.<p>So maybe the market for stable == 5+ years behind is simply not that viable anymore. Other distro&#x27;s fill that demand and now centos can offer a distro for situations where you need a bit more recent versions.')
