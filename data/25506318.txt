They also limit to whom they sell. And sometimes can help to limit the damage (eg, I suspect Iran cannot use NSO tools to attack the Mossad).<p>But if their employees are hired by companies that are hacking for profit or &quot;national security&quot;, there is no one to &quot;take down&quot;. Or even keep your eye on.<p>And if they are hired by companies that sell this software in markets that are impossible to regulate (such as is done with hacked credit cards et al, from Russia, N. Korea, and elsewhere), then their hacks will be made available in such a manner that you perhaps could eventually take down some of them (if you spend dozens of years and gobs of money and arm-twisting), but by then the damage will be 100-fold, since there are no limits to whom it is sold. And even then, you can never know what else you missed.')
