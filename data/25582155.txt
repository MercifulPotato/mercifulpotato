Later on, it gets messy. Some of my nodes are &quot;lost forever&quot; since i cant recall the exact [[NodeName]] to link it back. Then i implemented a log system to automatically write down all the new node created, chronologically. So, i could always look for this log to rediscover all my lost nodes. Later, i found that retracing all the log to rediscover my nodes is such a laborious task.<p>So i give up, and currently i am embracing the tree structure to manage my networked notes. Now, i&#x27;m testing this new system. Maybe in the future i could find even better way to manage my notes.')
