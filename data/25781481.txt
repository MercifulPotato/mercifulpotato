Item(by='awillen', descendants=None, kids=[25791809, 25791353], score=None, time=1610653802, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25781139, text='You&#x27;re incorrect that you can&#x27;t like or dislike the US policing system and that it doesn&#x27;t affect you. If you&#x27;re in the US, it affects you, because it affects society as a whole. Even if you&#x27;re not in the US, the actions of the US police are worldwide news that affect everyone (see the anti-police brutality protests worldwide).<p>If you can walk down the street and not get stopped because you&#x27;re not white, the system is affecting you, just positively.<p>As for &quot;people are going to make mistakes&quot; let me just remind you that police broke into Breanna Taylor&#x27;s apartment late and night without announcing themselves and without their body cams turned on. That led to her death. First of all, that&#x27;s not a mistake, that&#x27;s an idiotic plan. Second of all, when people make mistakes that lead them to shoot innocent people to death, you don&#x27;t get to shrug and say &quot;people make mistakes.&quot; If you&#x27;re walking around with a gun and a badge and the ability to take away people&#x27;s freedoms then no, you don&#x27;t get to make mistakes. You have to be held to a very, very high standard to have those abilities. And when you make a mistake like kneeling on someone&#x27;s neck for six minutes until he dies while he tells you he can&#x27;t breathe, that&#x27;s not a mistake. That&#x27;s a murder.<p>You acting like people coming into the streets and saying all cops are bad AFTER cops have murdered dozens of black people is ridiculous. You sound very much like Trump saying there were good people on both sides at Charlottesville.<p>It&#x27;s similar to compare BLM protests to the attack on the Capitol. One of them was a response to people being murdered, and the other was a planned protest that was an attempt to invalidate a lawful election.<p>I honestly think people like you are some of the worst out there - intelligent enough to understand what&#x27;s happening and yet without the moral sense to understand the difference.')
