I blocked executable file types I knew of though. It&#x27;s possible someone uploaded a MS Office file with a virus, a HTML file with a phishing scam or some such, though.<p>Still, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for Google to use their iron feet to stomp an entire website &#x2F; product &#x2F; small business &#x2F; personal project just because of a small fraction of users abusing that service.<p>ALL services get abused at some point or another during their growth. Learning to deal with those abuses one at a time is a part of the growth of any product and nobody can be expected to have prevented all forms of abuse upfront. If the owners (e.g. me) were made aware of the specific piece of malware I would have definitely done something about it.')
