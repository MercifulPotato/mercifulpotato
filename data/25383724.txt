Had to get used to chaining the commands, and working around a few issues like when I needed to access something JS object (simply exposed the service object I needed globally when Cypress tests were executed, and then verified what I needed).<p>Used Selenium 1 and 2 in the past, and Cypress is definitely much easier.
