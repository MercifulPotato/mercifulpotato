For example &quot;‘America Is a Republic, Not a Democracy’ Is a Dangerous—And Wrong—Argument&quot; by The Atlantic.[0]<p>To steelman your position a little, let me assume that you meant &quot;direct democracy&quot; and &quot;indirect democracy&quot; respectively.  However, I don&#x27;t think anyone is proposing a completely direct democracy, where every decision is put to a referendum.<p>Also, even if there is some merit in dampening the underlying volatility and limiting the power of small majorities, it&#x27;s not clear that gerrymandering (or the electoral college, or whatever else you had in mind) actually works to prevent extreme outcomes.<p>If anything, the current lack of democracy in the US conditions a minority of voters (not to mention a minority of citizens) to expect over-representation in the corridors of power, and, as we saw on 1&#x2F;6, it is pandering to the will of the minority that is most likely to lead to the rule of the mob, nationally.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;yes-constitution-democracy&#x2F;616949&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;yes-consti...</a>')
