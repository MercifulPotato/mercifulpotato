It is a feature that allows you to restrict how a function is used. In a sense you are using generics to deliberately make a function less powerful.<p>Golang doesn&#x27;t have parametric polymorphism as a restrictive option . Instead you can use interface {} which removes all restrictions makes go as unrestrictive as python. Type checking and any feature related to it in general exists to make languages less &quot;expressive&quot;')
