Indeed, as your experience demonstrates, posting the version of the electoral reality--namely, that Trump lost--that&#x27;s accepted by all but 30% of Republicans is now taboo.<p>Posts that touch on these issues will be censored either through downvoting or bad-faith flagging. I&#x27;m not entirely convinced this is organic behavior, but it is what happens to posts that speak too clearly about the dangers of Trumpism.<p>Some people may try to frame this as a &#x27;no politics&#x27; position, but this is at best inaccurate. Trumpist disinformation does not get downvoted or flagged with any regularity.<p>If the HN staff don&#x27;t want to preside over yet another (quasi) social media echo-chamber, they need to do something about Trump loyalists bullying fact-based posts regarding Trump off the platform. The current staff viewpoint, however, seems to be ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯.<p>To quote Edmund Burke, &quot;the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot; Giving Trumpists a platform to corrode the foundations of American democracy while shouting down the viewpoint accepted by most of the planet--again, that Trump lost the election--is, at this point, very much an evil.')
