Always. We like to think of it as our way of giving back to a community that gives us so much as well.<p>That is simply not what&#x27;s going on. As far as anyone can tell, they are offering some OSS which meet specific criteria (including no company funds any part of it, including paying people to work on it(?!)) free minutes in fixed monthly allotments, which you have to keep asking for every month. And there are only so many total minutes they are willing to give out, which apparently have now been frozen.<p>How can they have written a letter only two weeks ago saying  &quot;Open source accounts, as always, will be completely free under travis-ci.com&quot;? How can their home page still say &quot;Testing your open source projects is always 100% free!&quot;??<p>At this point, it is hard to explain it as anything other than intentional manipulative dishonesty.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t just say &quot;Yes, we can no longer provide free open source accounts.&quot; They aren&#x27;t actually fooling anyone, I mean people notice that they don&#x27;t have free accounts anymore, right? It is a weird attempt at some kind of reality distortion.<p>I guess you could try replying: &quot;Credit allocation&quot;? I don&#x27;t understand, Paul Gordon wrote on Nov 24 &quot;Open source accounts, as always, will be completely free under travis-ci.com.&quot; Is this not true?<p>I&#x27;m kinda curious what they&#x27;d say, but I guess it&#x27;s just torturing poor support staff whose jobs probably aren&#x27;t going to last either.')
