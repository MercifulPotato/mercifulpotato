No spammy articles, focused onto a single tech topic, a moderate amount of ads (Google), well researched articles. Then one day my organic Google traffic fell by some 80%. If I remember correctly it bounced around very wildly during the following months as Google updated their algorithms.<p>At the time I was very much not happy about it. Now I&#x27;m happy it happened before I had scaled it too far and come to depend on that income too much. It made me realize that it&#x27;s not only my work that my income depended on, but the whims of a single giant company. And that that&#x27;s a position I don&#x27;t want to find myself later down the road.<p>It&#x27;s a sad truth that any internet business that&#x27;s not yet a strong brand in itself is reliant on Google and their AI in a very unhealthy way. I have no idea how to fix this.')
