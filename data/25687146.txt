In fact, the first alternative FB clients I remember using sprang up on the iPad, before FB bothered to put a native app out for it.<p>What killed alternative FB clients was FB itself -- they&#x27;ve slowly closed off the APIs you&#x27;d need to access to make an alternative client optional.  FB has also closed off their own alternative clients as well (FB Paper), and have been forcing users into their official web or native clients for a while.')
