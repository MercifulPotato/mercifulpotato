Maybe the network isn’t saturated yet, but that blew me away. That isn’t too far away from mm wave, and I get that inside my apartment. What is Telstra doing differently here to make it work like that? Also worth mentioning, I would consistently get 150mbit down indoors on 4g. Feel lucky to have such a fast network here. I pay ~$30&#x2F;month for 80gb data')
