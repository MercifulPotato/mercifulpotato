It&#x27;s in the EULA.  You want free speech, go outside and yell. No one is stopping anyone from free speech. What Google is doing is cleaning up content on their service according to their EULA. If you disagree with the EULA, you can gladly go use another service.<p>I will add, targeting a specific genre of videos looks bad, sure. It&#x27;s only that we are talking about that genre and not all the others of topics YouTube has removed.')
