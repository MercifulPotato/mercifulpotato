(cheese)<p>Anyway super excited to see people talking about my project here. I originally built it just for myself. I have a healthy collection of old computers. I&#x27;m really happy that other people are getting something out of it.<p>I see some good feature suggestions. Keep them coming. I have an ever growing backlog of things I want to add to the site. And one by one I do what I can to add them.<p>Just a couple weeks ago someone mentioned on a facebook group that they wish they could use wikipedia from an old browser. So I built a proxy for that.<p>One issue I&#x27;ve been struggling with since the beginning is continually getting flagged by cyber security tools as a phishing site. Anytime this happens all I have to do is contact the security company and without question they lift the blacklist status of my site. But none of them will tell me anything I can change to avoid these false positives proactively. If anyone has concrete advice on this please let me know.<p>Thanks!')
