Even if they&#x27;re only online.  Creative hobbies, foods, sports, religious&#x2F;philanthropic groups.<p>Be proactive, even&#x2F;especially if you&#x27;re an introvert and it feels awkwardly forward.  Most extroverts have already formed their fill of friendships by their 30s so you can&#x27;t rely on them to initiate anymore.  And people are more socially flexible&#x2F;accepting than you may think, and welcoming of human interaction.<p>Give more leeway for who you consider &quot;friend&quot; material than you would in younger years.  It&#x27;s easier to find someone who&#x27;s generally cool to hang out with but only has a couple interests in common, than someone who shares your exact set of interests but is easy to get along with.  E.g., neighbors are a good place to start.  Even if all you have to talk about is the neighborhood, if they&#x27;re not a colossal asshole, they&#x27;d probably be a cool person to grab a bite to eat with once a month.<p>Don&#x27;t plan for attachment.  Expect that you might just grab lunch a couple times with someone, and they or you might move, have a kid, turn out to be a colossal asshole, etc., and the friendship drops in priority.  If you get really invested early on, you&#x27;ll get burnt out quickly by this.<p>Same advice applies to rekindling old friendships.  Check back in with people you knew from college who were cool but you lost touch with.  Maybe they live in the area and would like to catch up, and maybe they happen to still be a cool person and have a new interest which matches a new interest of yours.')
