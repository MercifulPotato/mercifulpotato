With an erroneous AOE reading, MCAS would immediately and repeatedly force the nose down.  Pilots, not even told that MCAS existed, would somehow need to quickly recognize it as a powered flight control problem, cut off power to the stabilizer, and use the manual trim wheel to raise the nose - which can be physically impossible at high speeds in a nose-down attitude.<p>No rational person would think this system wouldn&#x27;t kill people.  The people responsible committed manslaughter.')
