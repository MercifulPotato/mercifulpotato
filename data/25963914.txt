Whereas a company can issue shares at any time. Obviously if the market cap stays at $30 billion for a long time, Gamestop management is going to start spending their overvalued stock like drunken sailors.<p>First it&#x27;ll be just to plug up the money their operations are constantly losing. Then they&#x27;ll start going on acquisition sprees, giving out giant compensation packages, get into empire building. Maybe they&#x27;ll buy a movie studio or a Vegas casino. That&#x27;s a constant supply of new stock that will keep pushing down the price.

That&#x27;s why AMC didn&#x27;t moon like GME. But give it a week or two, and GME&#x27;s board will pretty much be forced to do the same thing.')
