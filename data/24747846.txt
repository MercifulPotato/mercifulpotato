Higher prices of food in New York allow a dense city of 9 million to channel enough food from the economy to feed the populace. The more accurate the prices, the less waste (in terms of both the commodity and time).<p>While it may seem like any improvements to price-time reactivity would be negligible compared to the 300mm investment, these things are simply too difficult to measure in a complex system like a global economy where any change can result in a butterfly effect. Over many years, more reactive prices could prevent arbitrageurs (who perform a critical service) from making less efficient trades. In fact, the firm who commissioned the new line is likely doing arbitrage, which is one of the key services that allows us to have a globalized economy with relatively stable prices.')
