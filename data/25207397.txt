Possibly Swift-made apps uses less RAM compared to other apps, but microarchitecture shouldn&#x27;t be matter.<p>My guess it&#x27;s mostly faster swapping.<p>Microarchitecture could help, perhaps by making context switches faster.<p>But it could also be custom peripheral&#x2F;DMA logic for handling swapping between RAM and NVM.<p>I think it makes sense.. NVM should be fast enough that RAM only needs to act as more of a cache. But existing architectures have a lot of legacy of treating NVM like just a hard drive. Intel is also working on this with its Optane related architecture work.<p>You could also do on-the-fly compression of some kinds of data to&#x2F;from RAM. But I havent heard any clues that M1 is doing that, and you&#x27;d need applications to give hints about what data is compressible.')
