Coming from a family of carpenters, I can assure you none of them really know that much at all about the internals of the table saw. Maybe a little bit.<p>The &#x27;black box&#x27; analogy is upside down: there are a million artifacts of the computer that you use every day for which you have no understanding. We use encapsulated concepts to be able to leverage much more complexity than we would otherwise.<p>Having to deal with the &#x27;inner workings&#x27; of git, is like having to have the instruction set for the chipset your computer is running on handy &#x27;just in case&#x27;.<p>Git is very powerful, but very poorly designed from a product perspective, there was no &#x27;strategy&#x27; just &#x27;add commands and flags that do this and that&#x27;.<p>When products expose considerably more complexity than they need to for most uses cases, it&#x27;s just bad design.<p>I also have a sneaking suspicion that so many &#x27;git experts&#x27; are really just expert within a fairly narrow range of commands&#x2F;options - because when I start to ask more detailed questions, the answers are never clear.<p>No other product has consistently caused so much confusion, wasted time. Though 95% of my personal interactions are fine, there are just too many times where we have Senior Developers, huddled on someone&#x27;s machine, trying to solve some arcane problem - this is the &#x27;not very hidden cost&#x27; of git.<p>I would say:  &quot;Within Git, there is a much smaller and clearer CVS struggling to get out.&quot;')
