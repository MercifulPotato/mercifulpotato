There are dials on the algorithms that control what users see in their feeds. What canâ€™t be controlled is what happens as Facebook pursues engagement.<p>I disagree with this and agree more with the original article. Zuckerberg, or no other individual, even with the magic of &#x27;algorithms&#x27;, has the ability to centrally plan the information flow for billions of people in a way that does not produce misinformation.<p>Even if Zuckerberg has the best intentions in the world, there is no one discourse that will ever work for a billion plus people, Facebook is totalitarian  in nature and it is its size that creates structural problems.<p>Social interaction needs to be brought back to human scale, with publishers who are stakeholders in their community they operate in, and human moderation that is oriented towards social ends. Not one network for the entire world.')
