Then see if that applies to programming.<p>There&#x27;s various accounts of the &quot;reasons&quot; ligatures came to be, but of the few I&#x27;ve seen all would (imo) apply equally to code as to language. The obvious one is pure aesthetic preference, but another is that ligatures came about as a way for business people of the time to differentiate letter&#x2F;symbol-combinations for single repetitious use (as is done for operands: e.g. `===` has a single semantic meaning, it does not represent 3 programmatic operations in a row).<p>All in all though, I would guess this is about aesthetics mostly.<p>My own personal preference is to use ligatures in presenting code and avoid them in text editors&#x2F;IDEs. I think this fits with traditional font use (writers would hand-write or typewrite manuscripts, ligatures would only be used by publishers&#x2F;printers). It&#x27;s possible presented code may &quot;suffer&quot; in readability for some unaccustomed to ligatures, so there&#x27;s a trade-off to consider, but that&#x27;s also true of books&#x2F;articles using ligatures in natural language, and I think the problem is overstated in both cases. The nice thing is that copypasting the code doesn&#x27;t force retention of the ligatures.')
