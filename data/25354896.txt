Certainly, I don&#x27;t keep even all my information on my computer, or even a single phone, and I think phishing _everyone_ is harder than you&#x27;re making out. On the other hand it&#x27;s all sitting right there at the NSA et al. Your other attacks are similarly focused on individuals, although the credit and health agencies are prime surfaces for data mining, you&#x27;re not going to get the metadata&#x2F;connectivity needed.<p>I&#x27;m interested to know what you&#x27;re proposing, but I suspect you simply misunderstood what I meant, and perhaps what your (and everyone else&#x27;s) file at the TLAs looks like. It&#x27;s a mighty plump target, and not comparably secure.')
