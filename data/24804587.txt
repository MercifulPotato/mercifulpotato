I think we need to put the paddle to the metal and take this baby for a spin. I do think the analogy needs a tune up. Web browsers are not the &quot;automobiles of the information superhighway&quot; because while they let you go forward or go back, they don&#x27;t let you turn left or right. So clearly, web browsers must be the trains of the industrial revolution, riding on the coast-to-coast rail network which was built in Dot Com Boom and Bust fashion [1]. So I think Silicon Valley will chug along for many years to come. Of course, there&#x27;s a chance this gravy train could be derailed. Owning all of the train stations has something to do with Monopoly. I&#x27;m running out of steam... need more analogies and puns to shovel into the furnace..<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Railway_Mania" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Railway_Mania</a>')
