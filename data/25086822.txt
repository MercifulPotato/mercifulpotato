It comes with challenges, but it&#x27;s not like privately run news are perfect either.<p>- Civil liberties can be protected in any form of government and economy, even a dictator can decide to do that<p>- increasing employment is a no-brainer, it&#x27;s a prominent feature of socialist countries.<p>- agrarian reforms are similarly commonly observed, it&#x27;s probably one of the defining things of the USSR (and China, where it famously didn&#x27;t go as smoothly)<p>There&#x27;s also no real reason why you can&#x27;t have prices in socialism (and as far as I&#x27;m aware most socialist systems have prices). The loop looks a bit different since the supply side is typically centrally managed, but even that is technically an implementation detail and not a required feature of socialism.')
