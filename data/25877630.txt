I did this for 2 years with a 50 mile round-trip commute.  I started each day with 100% charge on my Nissan Leaf, arrived home each night with ~35 miles of range, and plugged it in.<p>When we got our Model 3, we charged exclusively on 120v for about a year and only used a Supercharger on road trips out of state.<p>We&#x27;re a BEV only household and have used a charging station once in the last 6 months.  I took the Leaf out to empty a storage unit 40 miles away and I only stopped for 10 minutes to put enough range so I wasn&#x27;t coasting home on fumes.<p>I realize that not everyone can charge at home, but a large portion of the population can and that will dramatically reduce the demand for charging stations.  When you realize that anywhere you stop for long periods of time (e.g. restaurants, grocery stores, office parks) can install chargers, then you quickly realize that charging stations will only really be needed along highways.')
