Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=[25924758], score=None, time=1611724823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924471, text='&gt; Research output is reliable where it is actively relied on by engineers -- and not elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;d word it this way: if the person producing the output is not responsible for it really working, it almost certainly won&#x27;t. Even innocently this will be the case with anything complex, people get things backwards, miss a scale factor, etc. Finding that last bug can take more work than the rest of the project combined, much easier to publish what appears to work and move on. Much more so when there&#x27;s direct career benefits to &quot;hacking&quot; the system over competing honestly. Especially considering the internet is awash with people trying to cheat through every other competition (exam questions, interview questions, etc.)')
