Is the USD fiat backed by gold?<p>Soon per person debt in the USA is going to sky rocket. Is it really such a bad thing having a domestic digital currency with no intrinsic value?<p>We can control quality of life and local exchange. If it’s not pegged with the usd, it might bifurcate economy as local&#x2F;domestic and international. We might avoid a revolution or civil war or mass youth revolt. Perhaps it can be in lieu of UBI.<p>I can’t see how what’s happening now can be a good thing for Americans and USA a decade down the line. On principle, I don’t support UBI. Having said that, I don’t see how it can be avoided. From a macro economic and micro economic POV. Perhaps having some form of it ..with some kind of flexibility..will be a better compromise.')
