Using &#x27;liberal&#x27; as an epithet, using the term &#x27;ordinary citizens&#x27; to distinguish from those who need to be deprived of rights, bringing the idea of those who pay taxes as being especially worthy of government protection... these are all talk radio jingo.<p>A governing institution that interns individuals based on being different, or not morially aligned, of not thinking the correct thoughts has been tried often in the past and indeed there are many regimes around the world who still do so today.  If society feels the need to institutionalize people for their thoughts it should at least formalize the crime in law and open the process to justice instead of relying on the fiat of those who hold the reigns of power.')
