I suppose in a way its true - wikipedia has its own culture, norms, etc, both written and unwritten, which can be hard to penetrate for an outsider (i would argue that WMF also struggles with that). But i think any large online community is going to have that. Heck, actual anthropologists have written actual books on the culture of debian, i dont see why wikipedia would be any less complicated.<p>&gt; Another issue is that Wikipedians probably won&#x27;t want to associate their Wikipedia identity with their HN identity (and similar).<p>And that is an issue because? [For the record my wikipedia username is the same as my HN username, and i know other people for which that is also true]')
