For example, I had wave internet in seattle and when I moved I obviously canceled.  They screwed up setting the cancellation date though and ended up  charging me the next month.  Just got a collections notice for that 1 month of charges. I messaged them and apparently there is nothing they can do from their end at this point so now I&#x27;m disputing it with the collections agency.<p>Pretty dumb on their part if you ask me considering now I&#x27;m telling everyone not to use them because of their screwup and the fact that they would sell it to a collections agency over 1 months worth of payments.')
