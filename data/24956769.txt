Political Islam is not compatible with any secular system, and adherents are commanded to destroy competing systems and religions.<p>France&#x27;s Muslim population is approaching 11%. Already French women are harrassed when walking down the street in many areas outside Paris as Muslim men don&#x27;t want &quot;gender mixing&quot;, and there are continual fatal attacks.<p>It&#x27;s estimated there have been 31,000 attacks world-wide by Muslims since 9&#x2F;11. It&#x27;s odd that I haven&#x27;t heard any from other religions.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the above as civil war rather than terrorism, then you need to do your own research to understand the events that are happening around you.<p>I&#x27;d like a reason as to why this is flagged. Everything I said is verifiable.')
