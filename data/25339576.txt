In the end its simply the usual issue with internet access in the US -- ISPs have zero incentive to invest&#x2F;improve, there&#x27;s no meaningful competition.   With everyone WFH its even worse -- oversubscribed networks are causing trouble all over (esp if you use a cable ISP).<p>When a city (or someone like Google) brings fiber in a meaningful way, it only then lights a fire under the incumbents&#x27; ass.  In theory cities with non-buried lines (like Mountain View) may be easier to upgrade; but it still depends on ATT granting pole access (which they promptly slowwalk).')
