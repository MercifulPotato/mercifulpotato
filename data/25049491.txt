Heck, my GPS can do groundspeed easily enough and you have basic pitch and power settings.<p>How did they not notice their altitude was climbing as they pulled the plane up - they got into a CLIMB rate of 7,000 feet per minute - that&#x27;s STUPID! WHY climb like that? This has nothing to do with airspeed.<p>The stall alarm goes off 75 times!<p>They reduce power to idle for a bit??<p>It&#x27;s total nonsense, anyone who has flown a single engine cessna for 200 hours or more would have been able to get out of this easily just based on stall buffet and stall alarms.')
