Also deterrence prevents conflict.<p>2) War is the normal state of mankind, and has been for thousands of years. The globe has had relative peace since 1945 because the USA has the biggest stick, and chooses to use it for mainly deterrence.<p>(This is not commonly featured in discussions, but all of the Allied and Axis power leaders were warlords before WW2 started: Roosevelt and Churchill (Navy), Hitler (Army) and Stalin (revolutionary.))<p>The two things that can upset the current peace are:<p>i) The CCP, for some completely unnecessary reason, wants to subjugate mankind using salami-slicing tactics. Instead of just being the world&#x27;s factory, they want to dominate the world. This appears to be insecurity over China&#x27;s 200 years of decline before the current Western capital injection.<p>According to Dr. VDH, 75% of the time when a new power arises, there&#x27;s war.<p>ii) Each day brings the world closer to an Islamic atomic bomb. If you&#x27;re familiar with the Koran, then you know what the implications are.<p>So enjoy the current peacetime while you can. It won&#x27;t last.')
