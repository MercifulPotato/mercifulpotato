Ecclesiastes has some great and often quoted lines: “For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die…”  “…There is nothing new under the sun”. It’s not a typical old testament book, which I think is why I finished it.<p>(going really off topic here)<p>I was inspired to look at the Biblical version after reading the awesome “A Rose for Ecclesiastes” by Roger Zelazny, in which a poet on a mission to Mars uses it as a basis for communicating with the ancient Martian elders. Incidentally, a copy of Zelazny’s 1969 story was landed on Mars in 2008 on a DVD carried by the Phoenix probe [0]. If &#x27;The Martian&#x27; was the perfect story of engineering on Mars, &#x27;A Rose for Ecclesiastes&#x27; is perhaps the perfect poetic look at the planet, at least on a par with &quot;The Silver Locusts&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phoenix_(spacecraft)#Phoenix_DVD" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Phoenix_(spacecraft)#Phoenix_D...</a>')
