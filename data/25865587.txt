A begrudging hard work, that most prefer to skip (get the quick compensation, and move on).<p>That&#x27;s also why there is a big difference when companies still have their founders in, as they tend to pay more attention to these issues since they are personally invested in company&#x27;s future and brand, than recently promoted middle managers which are just temporarily in for the check.')
