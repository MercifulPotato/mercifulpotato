It is covenient for companies to get guaranteed money in advance. As for customer it&#x27;s way cheaper to start with usage based model. This is because a lot of users are underusing their services.<p>This at least is the case in hosting industry where overscheduling is a big thing.<p>So best scenario for customer would be a pay per usage for low usage and subscription for moderate to high usage. At least this is what AWS is doing and I believe this is fair for both bussiness and customer')
