His grandparents would have lived through it, though I&#x27;m not sure if one half was in the US at the time. I&#x27;d ask why, but he died some years back. I know that particular botulism outbreak still affects folks&#x27; attitudes towards pans.<p>I figure it was either stories from his parents - his father ran a grocery for some years. I know they had cans with missing labels around, but I don&#x27;t think they had dents. Or it could be that someone (maybe him) got really sick. I just cannot remember - either one would make my father anxious, though. (He was cautious with car jacks, and always put a tire underneath. Something happened to someone he knew).<p>I do know that canned goods have gotten a bit safer, but not if the can has been dented or damaged.')
