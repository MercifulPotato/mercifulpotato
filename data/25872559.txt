On top of that, there is a desktop app that can instantly show the shortcuts of the currently active application.<p>So, displaying keyboard shortcuts was always an important part of KeyCombinder, and I spent a lot of time to optimize this experience with searching and filtering features. However,  these feature are not sufficient when you want to understand a collection of hundreds of shortcuts at a glance. I have been thinking about this problem since I started working on KeyCombiner almost precisely one year ago. Today, I am happy to announce that KeyCombiner offers a solution:  \nThe Shortcut Collection Visualizer<p>For any shortcut collection on KeyCombiner, (public collections of 60+ popular applications, your personal collections, collections shared with you by people you know), it is now possible to show a virtual, interactive keyboard that uses colors to highlight which keys are used with which combination of modifier keys. Hopefully, it will be more obvoious if after you tried it out.')
