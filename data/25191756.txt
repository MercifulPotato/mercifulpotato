You literally just made up nonsense.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re just looking for a fight.<p>No. I believe you are projecting.<p>&gt; Go for a fresh air walk outside instead.<p>Go read about the solomon islands. This issue is about corruption in solomon islands - a democracy. Or go crack open a book and learn about democracy and its history. Why everyone from the ancient greeks, who gave us democracy, and the founding fathers, who gave us modern democracy, all distrusted democracy.<p>As a matter of fact, democracies are by nature corrupt ( tyranny of the majority ) and that&#x27;s why most democracies have measures to product the citizens from democracy. Rather than regurgitating nonsense you&#x27;ve seen on tv or the news, learn about democracies or take a moment to think about it.')
