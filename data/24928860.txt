It&#x27;s not necessarily just a matter of malware spreading rampantly and it happening to land on a hospital system before encrypting all their shares automatically.<p>I&#x27;m sure that still occurs, but a lot of them are now picking organizations ahead of time and doing more sophisticated, hand-tailored things to try to get in and encrypt as many files across the network as possible, then explicitly setting and negotiating a hefty ransom based on what they think the organization is able to pay.')
