My 1st year drawing teacher at RISD, Nicholas Evans-Cato (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.georgebillis.com&#x2F;nicholas-evans-cato.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.georgebillis.com&#x2F;nicholas-evans-cato.html</a>), taught us how to draw using cameras. We built our own camera obscuras from cardboard (about the size of a watermelon) and then made landscape paintings by looking at the image projected inside the camera as opposed to looking at the landscape directly.<p>With his mentorship I then got into other &quot;primitive photography&quot; methods like pinhole cameras. My favorite thing I made was a camera that had a vertical slit, as opposed to a pinhole, and a gear system that would pull 35mm film across the slit as the camera was rotated on a base. It was effectively a panoramic camera, but the cool thing is you could follow moving objects like cars and stretch them out.<p>RISD campus: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;VoONn1W.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;VoONn1W.jpg</a><p>Stretched out cars: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Gm6LMRE.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Gm6LMRE.jpg</a><p>See how on the far right, the front wheel of the minivan is a regular circle while the back is a long oval.<p>That was a very fun hobby, I expect to pick it up again when I have more free time.')
