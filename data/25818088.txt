Sure, private companies aren&#x27;t democracies, but why should they be? Democracies are extremely inefficient. Imagine if Linux or Python projects were run as democracies and not lead by BDFLs? I can&#x27;t imagine them being nearly as effective because democratic processes to get new features would always be gridlocked. Benevolent dictators are 10x, maybe even 100x more efficient than democracies.<p>Outside of work I certainly live in a free society. I can  walk up to a rich person (&quot;a lord&quot;) and insult him to his face and nothing will happen.')
