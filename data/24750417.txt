Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[24753752], score=None, time=1602463503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743403, text='&gt;<i>To me, it looks like technology is the difference, making its case for neutrality suspect IMO.</i><p>I&#x27;m not convinced this follows. It&#x27;s seems like what the OP is saying is that technology has the ability to amplify the morals of those wielding it. That technology is the difference is exactly the point. It&#x27;s amoral and when owned by the &quot;good guys&quot; (whatever your definition), it amplifies those morals and ethics and vice versa for the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not the technology but the morals of those who own it that is the root of good&#x2F;evil. Unless your point is that a neutrality requirement is that technology must be incapable of being used for either good or ill, the neutrality claim is valid. (Personally, I prefer the term &#x27;amoral&#x27; to neutral but I suspect the OP meant the same thing).')
