You will still have to check for nil values ( see Kotlin, Swift for alternative) or you have to use old for loops to manipulate cumbersome collections types like slices instead of having functional paradigms build into the language ( again Kotlin, Swift, Java Streams etc). A good alternative if already using JVM would be some of the newer generation frameworks like Quarkus (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quarkus.io</a>), Helidon etc')
