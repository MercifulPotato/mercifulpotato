I quoted two claims from the parent comment and refuted those based off of industry experience.<p>&gt; I have serious doubts that a company can run and do well designed statistical experiments when academic experts are plagued by p-hacking and other foot guns.<p>By &quot;company&quot; are you referring to individual advertisers or digital advertising platforms? Why do you doubt that either are incapable of running well-designed experiments? It&#x27;s in both parties best interest to spend ad dollars as efficiently as possible.<p>While it&#x27;s certainly possible that every one of the 100 million+ ad experiments ran over the past decade have been fatally flawed, it&#x27;s highly unlikely. I guess the alternative scenario is that digital advertising is one giant hoax being kept secret by the millions of employees who work in the industry, but given how easily tech news leaks, this also seems extremely improbable.')
