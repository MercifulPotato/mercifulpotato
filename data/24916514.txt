I mean, just because you saw people talk a lot about such studies on memegen doesn&#x27;t mean that they were ever done, I never saw anyone seriously believe in them just posting about it for fun like &quot;what if I&#x27;m the one they let in with failing scores?????&quot;. However Google definitely did studies showing a decent correlation between interview scores and future job performance, I read them myself.')
