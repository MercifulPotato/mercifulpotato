IMO, the issue isn&#x27;t that insurance is required or not but that they are using it to outright lie about prices in published advertisments.  If a minimum level of insurance is required, that needs to be included in advertised price (and not just small print).<p>For the one I used they let you check a box that said you have external insurance that provides sufficient coverage, at least for a while until maybe 6 or 7 years ago when they stopped allowing that.  It is possible that others are making that kind of transition and are violating existing laws or possibly existing laws aren&#x27;t covering this type of case sufficiently.  Centurylink lost a lawsuit a few years ago for similarly outright lying about prices (to the point of saying &quot;this is your final cost&quot; with a tiny asterisk leading to a long page that described additional fees).<p>It seems like it can be hard to tell when this type of common unethical buisness practices crosses the line into the deadly form described in the posted article.  It also depends on where you are and in some places it is not that unusual for large international corporations to kill union organizers, for example.')
