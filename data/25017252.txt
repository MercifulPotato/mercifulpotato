If you were too young to remember or not born yet, it was absolutely devastating. At least the equivalent of today&#x27;s opioid crisis if not worse. Entire neighborhoods just fell apart. Politicians and voters freaked out and demanded harsh new drug laws and penalties. Lobbiest support from those who benefited helped perpetuate this, but it got started at the time with widespread public support.')
