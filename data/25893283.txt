As part of the 0.5 release I have just published, I split the language core from the standard library to ensure the former remains as small as possible. So far, it&#x27;s at 2,500 lines of non-test code and about 480kb compiled. Not the tiniest, but not too huge! (I know, possibly still huge for microcontrollers, but I&#x27;m not too familiar with that domain.)<p>As for a book... yeah, that&#x27;d be nice too. I attempted to write some worksheets earlier with screen-related concepts (rows&#x2F;columns, cursor positioning) but, well, uncovered enough bugs at the time that I had to put those in the back burner ;) I&#x27;ll keep thinking about this though, as a few individuals have also asked for something similar.')
