The government decided not to repudiate old debts. Instead it issued more and more paper money (assignats) supposedly backed by seized lands. The result was escalating inflation. The government imposed price controls and persecuted speculators and traders in the black market. People increasingly refused to pay taxes and the annual government deficit increased from 10% of gross national product in 1789 to 64% in 1793. By 1795, after the bad harvest of 1794 and the removal of price controls, inflation reached a level of 3500%. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but their replacements also fuelled inflation. Inflation was finally ended by Napoleon in 1803 with the franc as the new currency.”<p>Https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usdebtclock.org<p>I don’t mean to be alarmist, but the US Dollar is a devalued currency and you need to leave it any way you can.  More than 23% of all USD ever created were created in 2020 to prop up the sham we call the stock market, which is at all time highs amidst a pandemic.')
