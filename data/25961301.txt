I just took a look at the line of gdb code that&#x27;s crashing on you. I&#x27;m only slightly familiar with gdb&#x27;s internals, but I can imagine a bunch of different sources for this bug:<p>- gdb has a misconception about which c++ ABI was used when compiling the target program, or<p>- your program is stomping on an object&#x27;s vtable pointer, leading gdb to follow invalid pointers when trying to parse the object&#x27;s RTTI, or<p>- there&#x27;s a bug in clang++, or<p>- there&#x27;s a mix of abi versions in your program&#x27;s code, perhaps because of unexpected linking issues (static or dynamic), or perhaps because of inconsistent compiler flags when building your code<p>I&#x27;m curious what happens if you build your program with g++ instead of clang++.')
