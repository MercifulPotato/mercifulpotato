First it&#x27;s &quot;continue in browser&quot; to dismiss the overlay that shows up each time trying to get me to use the app, then it&#x27;s &quot;read the rest of the discussion&quot; to go from amp trash to the actual reddit site, and now they only load like 4 comments at a time and you need to click a link to load another page each time you want to see the children to a comment.<p>Apollo is a breath of fresh air, but iOS rules for having a website link open in an app are extremely convoluted and require explicit hard-code dapproval from both the domain owner and app author, meaning even if you man-in-the-middle reddit.com on your intranet to provide the required headers&#x2F;metafiles, you would need Apollo&#x27;s author to also add reddit.com to the list of URLs the app is capable of intercepting.
