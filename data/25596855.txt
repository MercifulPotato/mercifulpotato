Like async&#x2F;await in .NET. If I want guaranteed delivery I write logic to provide that. Again, using .NET. If in-order delivery is required, again, .NET.<p>Of course .NET can be replaced by anything that supports async, non-blocking functions.<p>If instead I used message queuing instead of writing the code myself I&#x27;m adding yet another configuration item to my system, replete with security holes, patches, operational management, and sourcing the skills to procure, install and run it. Of course each has idiosyncracies you need to learn and understand - like Rabbit&#x27;s memory-based queues. When the instance goes, so potentially does reliable messaging.<p>I&#x27;m very much not a fan of message queues. Haven&#x27;t been for a good many years.')
