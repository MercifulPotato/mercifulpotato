I like how you get the 4 enclosures for hdds and an internal usb slot for a thumb drive to put the OS on... And even a fifth internal sata slot you can use to add ssd cache to the raid (as long as you use Software RAID with lvm). There is even a second DDR3 non-registered ECC RAM slot so you can get up to 16gb memory.<p>... But quiet is not how I&#x27;d call it. My Synology NAS (718+) is not only more powerful but also requires significantly less cooling.<p>I just hate that I need two ssd&#x27;s (read&amp;write separately)  and need to use the hdd enclosures, so it reduces the potential raid size to an awkward&#x2F;uneven number: 5... I wouldn&#x27;t buy the NAS again because of that.')
