Item(by='jochemg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610951654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25816073, text='Thanks for sharing your thoughts; I actually have heard of those 2 companies&#x2F;communities before, though never really looked into them (and didn&#x27;t purposefully use similar language).<p>It&#x27;s true that it really depends on where you are as an entrepreneur. We currently have 2 such mastermind groups running with more experienced founders, and assuming you&#x27;re on the same &#x27;level&#x27;, if you join one of these, you&#x27;re definitely able to both give and receive plenty of value (in terms of advice, ideas, etc.)<p>With regards to amateur marketers and idea predators, I do not share that experience. Almost everyone in our community is already working on an idea or company, and while some do offer B2B services, they are not actively pitching those to others. Rather, they try to help each other by giving feedback and often simply help others for free.<p>I&#x27;m happy to talk to you about it some more if you&#x27;re interested. And thanks for the feedback, those are clear pitfalls that I have to look out for when we grow this community further.')
