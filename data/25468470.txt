If OP spends time honing their coding abilities then by all means learning more about git is a great plan.<p>I am really surprised by your comments about git at &quot;regular&quot; companies. If all we are talking about in this chain is understanding workflow and how to rebase, cherry pick, etc. then I completely misunderstood the discussion.<p>I have certainly gotten myself into some hairy situations. Since I avoid making massive commits, if things get too bad I have always been able to quickly resolve the issue by just doing a clean clone somewhere else and moving my changes over. As a last ditch effort it works quite well and does not take too much time (or stress :) ).')
