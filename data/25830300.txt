Then, I think, different regulations should apply. I don’t know how this is going to be implemented in real life though. We clearly see that Twitter and FAANG have power to shut down such attempts and even more so after entering a mutually beneficial symbiosis with certain political groups. It’s hard to see where this is going.')
