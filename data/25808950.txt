On my laptop I use a decent text editor, but trust me, Notepad is sufficient.<p>I have a simple style that is easy to fill out:<p><pre><code>    [.] Commenced high-level task.\n        [o] Completed sub-task\n        [.] Incomplete sub-task\n        [ ] Not yet started\n    [-] Cancelled or not-applicable\n    [?] May not need doing at all, or pending advice\n    [!] Issue or error\n    [ ] Include command-lines under the tasks:\n        wget https:&#x2F;&#x2F;test.com&#x2F;foo\n    [o] Record output after the tasks if needed -- &quot;Task ID: 929123&quot;\n</code></pre>\nOf course, the aim is to slowly convert something like this into a script or a service desk workflow.<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s almost impossible to correctly automate a complex, high-level task given no other information that its English description, such as &quot;build a new web server for a developer&quot;. However, if you&#x27;ve built 5-10 such servers manually, diligently recording the tasks in a checklist each time, then the script practically &quot;jumps out at you&quot;...<p>As a practical example, most engineers will say that to install a new physical server (not including the OS) is about 5-10 steps. I counted 50-100 after developing a checklist!<p>E.g.: Did you remember to:<p>Check that the firmware version matches the version of the other servers in the same cluster?<p>If not, did you update it?<p>Check the NIC firmware too?<p>RAID firmware?<p>System time, date, and <i>time zone</i>?<p>Secure erase &#x2F; factory reset the BIOS?<p>Upload an SSL certificate for the management port?<p>Register it in DNS?<p>Register it in the CMDB?<p>Register it in system-management software?<p>Burn-in test the memory?<p>Configure LACP on the NIC?<p>On the switch too?<p>I have personally witnessed major issues, even outages, caused by the above being skipped by careless engineers.<p>&quot;Oops.&quot;')
