In a Vs fighting game the match is over under three minutes every time. In an RTS you might be there for 20-40 minutes and lose because of a single mistake. Except when playing on lower tiers and getting rushed and beaten in 5 over and over.<p>I played SC2 for a while, at rather modest level (got to gold). After a few years I tried getting back to it and couldnâ€™t even get out of bronze as I found defending against constant rushes not fun.')
