However I believe that the current solution is optimized too much for routing tables, and not at all for end-user usability.<p>You can modify my proposal to have multiple 16-bit prefixes to the 32-bit range syntax, and from that &#x2F;80 range you give ASs depending on size a &#x2F;104, &#x2F;96, or &#x2F;88, or something in between. That would still leave plenty of room for the ASs to distribute addresses to customers. Maybe customers could get &#x2F;8s or such, with the option for bigger customers to get larger assignments. NAT on the router could be enabled by default, reserving the range for devices which explicitly request a publicly reachable address. Usually in most networks that number should be small.')
