I find Go a far superior experience. Part of that is the standard library which seems to strike a perfect balance providing what you need but not too much.<p>I also think a lot of it has to do with the <i>culture</i> of the languages. Kotlin is a pretty nice language, but using it for Android still makes me want to hit my computer with a hammer because the over-abstraction of the Java ecosystem is maddening.')
