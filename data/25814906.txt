The included Workspace support (&quot;Standard Support&quot;) includes phone support and a &quot;Four hour SLO for P1 Support cases&quot;.<p>So if one of your employees did somehow get flagged for violating the Acceptable Use Policy, there is phone support included that would let your resolve this. You can pay more for higher levels of support with shorter response times, dedicated representatives, and so on.<p>Edit to add: if you&#x27;re <i>really</i> concerned (and some folks are, I get that), I&#x27;ve seen some organizations make a <i>separate</i> domain for production. I don&#x27;t love the ergonomics of switching accounts like that, but it&#x27;s also not the worst thing I&#x27;ve seen people do.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;use_policy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;use_policy.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;aup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;aup</a>')
