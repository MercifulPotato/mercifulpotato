Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25676887], score=None, time=1610050956, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676785, text='&gt; Letâ€™s say the Fed prints 1 quintillion dollars, and then gives it to me. I then put it under my very big mattress. I will never spend a single one of those dollars. Has this quintillion dollar print changed the value of the dollars that are actually changing hands? It has not.<p>Probably, very slightly, because even if you plan to never spend them, the fact that you have a quintillion of them in your mattress probably changes the value <i>you</i> attach to other dollars (because, <i>in extremis</i>, you could break into that stash), which has an effect on the overall value of dollars (but only imperceptibly, because you are a very small part of the market.)')
