I have a higher mortality risk from the flu than from covid. From a purely selfish point of view I don&#x27;t understand why the flu vaccine is difficult to get but the covid vaccine will be easy. It might make sense when you take into account the wider social costs but the situation seems weird to me. I&#x27;m not anti-vaxx. I actually want to get a flu vaccine based on advice from my doctor in Australia but I haven&#x27;t because it looks like it would be an ordeal to get one from the NHS.')
