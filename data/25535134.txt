If PC (I hear Steam is doing something about it as well) - Windows and Linux - games can have the support as well, third parties have a bigger base for these features. Likewise for Android use for remote play.<p>Also, yeah, it sells more of these controllers which are considered by many as THE defining next gen feature.')
