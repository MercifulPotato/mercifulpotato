This is very easy to do if you&#x27;ve experienced a middle or upper middle class upbringing.<p>This is almost impossible to do if you were raised in a household of abuse or food scarcity, or where your network doesn&#x27;t contain any well educated individuals. Basically it works for...middle class people.<p>In short: trickle down economics is being pissed on and calling it rain, and &quot;just work harder&quot; blames people for their station and expects them to be extraordinary just to have a reasonable life. It&#x27;s essentially blaming the poor, the easiest way out possible, with nice gloss on top, and it&#x27;s total and utter bullshit that papers over the systemic forces acting against all workers - let alone those just scraping by.')
