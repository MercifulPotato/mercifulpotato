I had forgotten exactly why I wasn&#x27;t using them with my XPS but turns out it&#x27;s because they are a nightmare getting them to connect. Once connected the audio stutters awfully but only when I type on my wired keyboard or move my bluetooth mouse. Maybe it&#x27;s my laptop at fault but it all works fine under Windows. I tried following the steps in the article (just in case that helped) but it&#x27;s still unusable. Shame. I&#x27;ll go back to only using the H21&#x27;s them with my Android phone and in Windows, both of which work flawlessly!')
