Anyone who installs Slack as a desktop app is <i>using</i> Chromium. The more people who use Chromium, the less incentive Slack has to make their website compatible with anything which isn&#x27;t than Chromium, which is presumably why you can&#x27;t, for instance, make Slack calls in a browser other than Chrome or Edge.<p>If the purpose of Firefox is to give Mozilla a say in the direction of the web, they should be supporting and encouraging users to install websites as &quot;apps&quot; through Firefox.')
