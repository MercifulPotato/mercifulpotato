I&#x27;m not looking for anything in return. I&#x27;m not trying to be known as someone who gives to the great cause. I do what I have to do because it should be that way -- if everyone gave a little bit, and for my case, I tend to favor charities that help terminally ill children, veterans, or shelter animals - it makes a difference to those who need it. In fact, any time my friends on Facebook or anywhere has a charity for their birthday or something, I often donate for the good of the cause. I donate at least a dozen times a year, usually around $25 each time, so we&#x27;ll say that I donate around $300 a year.<p>In 2020, I donated nearly $2,000 to various causes... and I did want to donate and I don&#x27;t have any regrets or anything for donating, but I realize that donating so much -- I went into a bit of debt not realizing it, and like I said, I&#x27;m not looking for anything in return -- however: when I&#x27;ve ran my own charities or asked for help, I realize that the people I expected to help me... did not lift a finger to help. Fortunately, there were others who stepped in their place and helped. But the ones I thought I could count on... weren&#x27;t there for me. While I probably will return back to my normal charitable giving, I overexerted myself last year and am paying a price for it.<p>So I&#x27;ll likely be taking a break from donating large quantities to any organization this year. And no, this isn&#x27;t an invitation to ask me for charity. I just realize that one man, me, can only do so much. And while you can help others out... I suppose the lesson to learn or unlearn there is: there are some unsung heroes in this world that make things happen.. and its great to appreciate them, but realize that not everyone, who you think is close to you and has your back, is going to help you, or even have your back.')
