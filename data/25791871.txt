Avarice: They rode the FOSS wave and gained industry mindshare for a conveniently long time. Now, after making (well deserved) millions on the back of it, they turn to an absurd license to basically say, <i>fuck you, looser, I need my billions</i>.<p>2. Hypocrisy: Spinning the whole thing as &quot;doubling down on Open&quot; with a <i>source-available</i> license. One must be so delusional to call out &quot;naysayers&quot; as spreading FUD about SSPL when the fact remains that SSPL is a landmine.<p>3. Short-termism: It is all fun and games till Elasticsearch is wealthy and healthy. Once some PE firm takes over when they get pushed into a corner, I can see them doing Oracle-esque law suites even if it isn&#x27;t their current intention.<p>If their core product was Elasticsearch, they could have SSPLd it from the start. I&#x27;d be curious to see where they&#x27;d have ended up then. I&#x27;d absolutely not have been upset in this scenario.<p>The current scenario is what we are in, lets see how it pans out.')
