Obviously, differences between versions -- even patched versions -- can results in subtle, unintended, differences in how the code works for a given program. But there is no reason to think a system that operates at a lower level (&quot;replace key&#x2F;block X, which should have contents C_x, with C_x&#x27;&quot;) is less vulnerable to this kind of issue, compared to one that operates at a higher level i.e. statement-based replication, which rqlite uses. In fact I would argue that the system that operates on higher-level of abstraction is <i>less</i> vulnerable i.e. to care about the subtle changes.')
