Of course we&#x27;re well aware that sometimes commonplace words in one language can mean something offensive in another language.<p>But I think it highly likely that the original developers of the GIMP knew exactly what it meant in English and probably chose the name <i>because</i> of its English meaning, as a joke that may have been funny in geek circles back then, but now we realize is just in poor taste.  (I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were probably more targeting the sexual connotations of &quot;gimp&quot; and weren&#x27;t making fun of physically disabled people.)<p>The downvotes are likely because it seems like you have an axe to grind about English being the de facto common language of the internet, not because people think you don&#x27;t have a good point to make or because of some silly nationalistic reason.')
