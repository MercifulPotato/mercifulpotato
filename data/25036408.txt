Item(by='pmeunier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604939203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25033729, text='&gt; - The Pijul front page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org</a>) has a prominent link in the middle that points to their source code hosting service, Nest. That page has always been dog slow. It takes multiple seconds for that page to open, and then it shows me &quot;Not found&quot;. Maybe I should log in to view the code? There is a &quot;Sign in&quot; form at the top right of the page, so maybe I should do that. Where&#x27;s the registration button?<p>The Nest is still experimental (which explains the downtime), but you shouldn&#x27;t need to sign in order to view any code there.<p>&gt; - The project got renamed to Anu. A couple of days ago I tried to visit that page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anu.dev</a>), and I wasn&#x27;t able to find any source code there. I just tried to go there again and the page is offline.<p>Right, there have been really strong reactions against that move. As a person who carefully listens to HackerNews and Twitter comments for life advice (as one should), I decided to revert that move.<p>More seriously, I noticed it was distracting from the main point. But then I managed to find another distracting thing, by writing a rant about occurrences of plagiarism that have happened to me, including theft of actual GPL source code, as well as republication of academic papers (in one case, I was fortunate enough to be picked for review).<p>&gt; - As BlackFingolfin pointed out, the blog post has a &quot;Warning about licenses&quot; at the top. Even though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how the GNU GPL works, it&#x27;s already a big motivator for me to simply close that tab. I do work in the area of data storage myself. Would I want to put myself at legal risk, just because I want to try an experimental VCS?<p>That is clearly not what I meant, and I&#x27;m deeply sorry about this.<p>&gt; - Why isn&#x27;t there an official Git mirror of Pijul&#x2F;Any? Sure, it&#x27;s awesome if those tools can host themselves, but what about being able to set it up quickly? Pijul&#x2F;Any is written in Rust. Doesn&#x27;t Cargo depend on being able to &#x27;git clone&#x27; software for it to be installable?<p>Until there are packages in linux distributions, you can get it with `cargo install pijul --version 1.0.0-alpha`. You would need cargo to compile it from source anyway.')
