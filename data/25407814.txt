Let&#x27;s start by saying that marihuana is just one of the products that cartels sold and represents a miniscule part of the earnings since the 80s. Cartels not only sell marihuana, cocaine and pills, they control human trafficking, prostitution, oil robberies, kidnapping, etc. Removal of local police won&#x27;t help nor legalization. (Remember marihuana is not even legal in Mexico) I believe a full Mexico army intervention and UN blue helmets as monitors is required to bring back peace')
