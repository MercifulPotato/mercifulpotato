Writting the above I vaguely realised that the video player example didn&#x27;t have many legs to stand on. I used it because, for me, the interoperability of mpv and ytdl is a poster child for taking content that&#x27;s on a closed platform (Youtube) and lifting it out for high interoperability with the rest of the system.<p>It&#x27;s a fair point that Windows doesn&#x27;t put burden on applications to be less interoperable, but it doesn&#x27;t facilitate it either. The UNIX philosophy has completely bypassed Windows. You can do things on its command-line, especially if you augment it in various ways, but do you ever feel like it&#x27;s a first-class citizen on Windows, or its ecosystem? I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s reasons for why, as a rule of thumb, only the biggest FOSS projects are compatible with Windows.')
