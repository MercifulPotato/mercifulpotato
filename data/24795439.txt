Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24796374], score=None, time=1602803504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794470, text='&gt; As soon as one company does it, though, that gives cover for any other company.<p>That was exactly my point! &quot;The quick collective action tends to dilute the criticism against any single one of those companies.&quot;<p>The problem in this case is that Facebook and Twitter are not simply local gas stations. They are two of the biggest social networks in the world, with billions of users. They effectively control a gigantic chunk of the entire market, in a way that is nowhere even remotely analogous to local gas stations. Even if 2 gas stations explicitly colluded, they couldn&#x27;t hope to control the market, because there are just too many gas stations. You can&#x27;t drive a mile down the road and find another Facebook. There&#x27;s only 1 Facebook in the world.<p>You haven&#x27;t actually showed that there&#x27;s a market for censorship, because it&#x27;s not obvious that censorship is actually financially beneficial to those companies. This is a controversial decision at best, and not really analogous to the price of gas, where the financial implications are clear. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s false (after all, I&#x27;m the one who suggested the idea), but it requires more elaboration than &quot;there&#x27;s a market for everything&quot;.<p>EDIT: Reportedly the US Senate will subpoena Jack Dorsey, so there&#x27;s already severe backlash.')
