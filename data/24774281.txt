Not being able of using stack for short lived objects is also pretty bad for performance, especially if the allocation&#x2F;deallocation is done in a cycle. I understand the desire of maintaining a stable ABI, but I think this should be optional and at the discretion of the user instead of being shoved down as the only way to use a library. At least, I think such libraries should allow their users to overload whatever malloc&#x2F;free the library is supposed to use, even though it&#x27;s less than ideal.')
