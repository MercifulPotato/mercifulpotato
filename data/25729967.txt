Item(by='malwrar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610378153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723988, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t want this to sound wrong, but I perceive most of the people complaining about censorship to be hypocrites. They&#x27;d be the first to censor if they were in charge of these platforms.<p>&gt; The reason they&#x27;re upset is because they are not in control.<p>Do you notice how that starts me, as someone who is firmly anti-censorship, off on the defensive as you seem to view me as an insincere or stupid bad guy?<p>&gt; I think in some ways they are like the people scared of change, and the once change has taken place they are scared of not being in control.<p>As a general principle I’m for the idea that we aught to allow free expression of ideas, especially online since that is <i>the</i> way to share ideas. Life happens very differently for people even just domestically in the US, and when our viewpoints come into conflict I’d rather understand what they have to say and talk about it. How is that possible to do when there’s a party in the middle that is able to determine what you’re not allowed to read? I&#x27;m scared of not being in control of that and thus censorship in general, not about having my version of truth be published.')
