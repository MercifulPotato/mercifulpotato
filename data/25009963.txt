By changing here I don&#x27;t even mean swapping out entirely, but even randomly changing the operations inside the hashing function - which will make it a moving target for any ASIC or even GPU implementations.<p>Right now we use standard blake2b as nobody has repurposed a miner to solve hashes for spamming yet.<p>The thing is, a determined spammer will be able to attack any CAPTCHA - even in labeling tasks there is always the fallback to human-in-the-loop which is cheap at scale (or even free if these are MITM&#x27;d users..).<p>Any (new) CAPTCHA system will have flaws and break in some way at scale, we&#x27;re open to ideas and of course will try to address any (future) concerns. We are trying to provide a viable alternative to ReCAPTCHA that respects the user - and we will iterate on these problems as we go. Without some new thinking and openness to new approaches we&#x27;ll be stuck with ReCAPTCHA.<p>Small nit: the difficulty is set to require around 2.5 million hashes, not 115 thousand. Your point still stands though.')
