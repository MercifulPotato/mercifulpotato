However, I don&#x27;t think that it matters much for a web API: in most cases, inside web browsers, the TCP connection will already be &quot;warmed&quot; when the browser will send the first (and subsequent) requests to the API, because the browser will have loaded the HTML page, the JS code etc, usually from the same origin. And even if it isn&#x27;t the case (mobile apps, API served from a third-party origin...) only the firsts requests will have to &quot;warm&quot; the connection (it doesn&#x27;t matter if you use compound or atomic documents then), all subsequent requests, during the lifetime of the TCP connection, will use a &quot;warmed&quot; connection.<p>Or am I missing something?<p>Anyway, a PR to improve this benchmark (which aims at measuring the difference - if any - between serving atomic documents vs serving compound documents in real-life use cases) and show all cases will be very welcome!')
