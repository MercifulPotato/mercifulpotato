You could argue that cells are themselves named, but those names are really indices into a 2D array, you can have relative references or do offset-based math if needed, and there&#x27;s indirection (i.e. you can use an arbitrary value as an index to read&#x2F;write another value). Given all this, an index of a cell containing a lambda is really a lot like a function reference, and can be used in much the same way - passed around etc.<p>So, these are anonymous functions. The more interesting question is whether they&#x27;re <i>closures</i> - that is, whether a LAMBDA nested in another LAMBDA can reference the latter&#x27;s parameters, and how it interacts with LET (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;let-function-34842dd8-b92b-4d3f-b325-b8b8f9908999" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;let-function-3484...</a>).')
