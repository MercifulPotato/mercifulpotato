This kind of enterprise is normally associated with manual labor, but I can&#x27;t think of a reason why you couldn&#x27;t have a tech coop. I actually think it would go hand in hand with the idea of more craftsmanship in software development (something I&#x27;m also in favor of), not to mention that it would greatly improve workers&#x27; rights (since the workers would also be the owners of the business).')
