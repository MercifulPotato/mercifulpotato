They say, &quot;so what?&quot;<p>We should only ever be saying &quot;Global Climate Disruption&quot;.<p>I am estimating a 50% chance of global civilization collapse by 2030.<p>It starts with crop failure in tropical and subtropical countries. Fishery collapse, as coral reefs are wiped out by bleaching and acidification, slashes access to protein. Famine drives mass refugee migration across borders.<p>Rich, temperate countries panic at the influx and allow fascists into power (as has already happened in Brazil, Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, India and Russia, and is only forestalled in the US, Italy, France, and Germany; <i>pace</i> China and the former SSRs).<p>Fascists in power will (as they do) start wars, disrupting trade, generating economic crises, and more wars spiraling out of control, and ultimately nuclear exchange.<p>A big part of the problem is actually refrigerants; HFCs currently in use, if vented, force as much heating as all the CO2 already in the atmosphere. We could remove CO2, <i>in principle</i>, but not the HFCs.<p>You might suggest 2030 is too soon, and 2040 more likely. I hope so, but it doesn&#x27;t make that much difference, really. If we don&#x27;t act like 2030 is the deadline, we will hit one soon enough.')
