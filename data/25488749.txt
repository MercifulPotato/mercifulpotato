How long before Tesla’s earnings catch up to the risk free returns on $680B (roughly $32B&#x2F;year)?<p>Assuming an optimistic 15% after tax profit margin for the rest of its life, Tesla would have to grow revenues seven times. At 15% a year, revenues double ever 5 years. So in roughly 14 years Tesla would be reach an annual after tax profit of $32B. And it would still be $200B behind in total net profits, it takes nearly 20 years for Tesla to generate more total net profit than the risk free investment.<p>Is that reasonable? It all depends on the risk Tesla falls short, and whatever assumptions are in your DCF analysis. That’s a long time to catch up, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say far from a slam dunk.')
