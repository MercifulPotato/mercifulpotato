If you rant about women or left leaning people etc on reddit like women rant about men or left leaning people rant about right leaning people then you&#x27;ll likely get banned.<p>So the large group of people who just wants to rant harmlessly but aren&#x27;t allowed allowed to do it on mainstream sites has nowhere to go now so they seek out sites like Parler where they then get radicalized since the environment is so toxic. It would probably be better if Reddit etc was a bit more tolerant of them, but it is what it is.')
