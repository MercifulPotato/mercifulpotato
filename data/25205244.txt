It&#x27;s not about &quot;What can you do&quot;, but &quot;what don&#x27;t you have to wait for&quot;. If I&#x27;m downloading a 100MB file, I don&#x27;t look away or browse somewhere else - The 10 second it takes to download isn&#x27;t enough to interrupt my concentration, while if you&#x27;re on a &quot;mere&quot; 50 megabit connection you&#x27;re waiting 40 seconds and your mind has wandered and you&#x27;ve walked away.<p>Snappy is important. The more that&#x27;s snappy, the better you&#x27;re going to feel.')
