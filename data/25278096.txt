I can&#x27;t think of a time I&#x27;ve ever wished I could search my bookshelf in that way, but you never know.<p>Obviously I use tools like ripgrep for searching codebases and the like.<p>But the extreme flexibility of this one in particular (and others like MacOs Spotlight) makes it seem more like a data recovery tool for me. If my directory structures and databases ever completely failed for some reason I might need to search through everything to find the data again. It&#x27;s good to know such tools exist, I suppose.<p>But my fear is that tools like this teach people to not worry about organisation of data and to just fill up their disks with no structure at all. I think that unless something goes terribly wrong nobody should ever need a tool like this. Once you rely on it, you&#x27;re out of luck it if it ever fails you. What if you just can&#x27;t remember a single searchable phrase from some document, but you just <i>know</i> it must exist somewhere?<p>It&#x27;s similar to what Google has done to the web. When I was growing up it used to be a skill to use the web. People used tools like bookmarks and followed links from one place to another. Now it&#x27;s just type it into Google and if Google doesn&#x27;t know, it doesn&#x27;t exist.')
