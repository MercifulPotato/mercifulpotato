There hasn&#x27;t been much evidence about the transmission rate.<p>On the other hand, while the transmission rate from outdoor dining may be very low (4% per posts in this thread), if that difference happens to be enough to push R0 above 1, or worse, cause a decrease in the number of available ICU beds, then allowing it could be a big mistake.<p>To put it another way, even if the evidence to close outdoor dining is weak, running an IRL experiment by leaving it open is very risky.')
