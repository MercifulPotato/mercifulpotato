It&#x27;s really fringe.<p>Yet all of those 1000 are vulnerable to any vulnerabilities it contains.<p>PS: By forgotten I don&#x27;t mean useless. I mean out of the minds of developers. This kind of code was written decades ago before many new exploit techniques were invented and probably never touched again. It probably wasn&#x27;t written with things like buffer overflow exploits in mind, yet it&#x27;s still in this application which is often used to connect to various servers which may not be fully trusted, and sessions which are elevated to root. A lot of vulnerabilities in common software come from such legacy features.<p>It&#x27;s useful for sure. But it should be an elective compile option or something. Distros can package that version of Xterm for those who will actually use the Tektronix emulation. The rest will be safer off without it.')
