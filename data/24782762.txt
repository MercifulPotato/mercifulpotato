And their reputation depends on your personal political bias.<p>You&#x27;re asking for evidence the emails are real but no such evidence was demanded when NYT posted findings from what they claim are Trump&#x27;s financial records.<p>If you&#x27;re a social media company, your job isn&#x27;t to decide what&#x27;s true or untrue or what is permissible to share or not share. It is to facilitate communication and get out of the way. Instead, we&#x27;re seeing companies that control the digital public square enact severely biased policies that favor their employee&#x27;s politics. That&#x27;s dangerous and unacceptable.')
