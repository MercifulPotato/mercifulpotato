He was running a country in a style of a mediocre corporate executive.  Same type of an executive that, for example, resulted in The Boeing Company suffering losses and having fleets grounded. But nothing special, really.   Think &quot;Uber&quot; type of a corporate culture.  Or &quot;WeWork&quot;.  Used to run a country.<p>It is no wonder, the likely result is 400k+ deaths and a worst downturn in a century.  And one doesn&#x27;t need to look further than Taiwan or South Korea, to see that it was not inevitable and preventable by good governance.<p>A wish for good governance.  Less cynicism.  And a shift of culture in both politics and corporate world that doesn&#x27;t allow for such disasters.')
