Just use the same system as Slashdot: periodically throw a random moderator’s decision in front of another mod. Ask them if the decision was fair. A portion of the bad decisions will get reported and screened.<p>If all mods are routinely screening each other’s work, everyone has an incentive to be fair. Biased mod decisions are thus a risk to your continued employment because you know your work is spot-checked.')
