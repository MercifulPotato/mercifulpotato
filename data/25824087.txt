Misusing it should be. If you can&#x27;t point to specific harms, you end up in a dystopia of &quot;precrime&quot;.  You also tend to give actual human beings (like this one) _less_ credit than large corporations (full of lots of human beings) for their ability to, over time, forgo doing the actual harm that they _could_ given the (massive) resources that they have.')
