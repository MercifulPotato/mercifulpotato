Traditionally, in Japan that kind of contract also implies &quot;staying at a single company for one&#x27;s whole working life&quot;.<p>&gt; Do you have any statistics showing that this is decreasing?<p>Look at the second chart  here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;currents&#x2F;d00151&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nippon.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;currents&#x2F;d00151&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; Even if it does, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing.<p>You think so because in the US and Europe, &quot;staying at a single company for one&#x27;s whole working life&quot; is usually sub-optimal for the employee&#x27;s career and earning potential. When switching companies, you can usually negotiate a higher salary than you could get via raises at your old company.<p>In Japan, it&#x27;s different. High salaries and career prospects are basically <i>only</i> available in those &quot;staying at a single company for one&#x27;s whole working life&quot; gigs, and they are given only to fresh university graduates. If you don&#x27;t manage to get one of those (because companies weren&#x27;t hiring when you were a fresh graduate), you&#x27;ll be forever a second-class employee with a temporary contract, lower pay and less benefits.')
