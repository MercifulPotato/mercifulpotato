For example, in 2007 the Energy Policy Act of 2005 changed the date when DST begins and ends. Any system unable to update its libc data files since about 13-15 years ago will display the incorrect time. I have a cheap $10 radio clock which I&#x27;ve had for two decades. It always displays the wrong time for a few weeks around the DST change.<p>Any system which needs to display the correct time needs to have a mechanism for updates.<p>The time_t wraparound is a bit deeper and more serious, granted.')
