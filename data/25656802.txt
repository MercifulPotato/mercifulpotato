I don’t have data for it, but I’ve also never seen data that shows insurers deny coverage just to dissuade people (post ACA).<p>&gt; experience the problem with our health care system is not just denial of claims, but about the cost of medical services and medicine.<p>Yes, I agree here about the cost of healthcare, but that is a separate issue from insurance companies <i>erroneously</i> denying coverage.<p>&gt; how does that even make sense?<p>Prices for medications are extremely obfuscated, and you will never know the true price paid due to various rebates and fees on the backend between manufacturers, insurance companies, and retailers.  There are various reimbursement rules from CMS (centers for Medicare and Medicare services), state Medicaid, various employers, and it’s a very, very inefficient method of price discrimination.<p>&gt; Since they are by law limited to earn a capped percentage on premiums minus costs (at least in my state),<p>ACA caps health insurer profit margins federally, so it applies to all states.  Assuming there are multiple competing health insurers, then unless they collided, they would not be able to arbitrarily raise prices to increase the absolute value of their profit margin.<p>The problem was the political compromise that had to be made in order to pass ACA, which is that it allowed employers to maintain their silo’d group of employees.  So you have a whole bunch of healthy white collar lives taken out of the healthcare.gov market, which leaves it with all the sick and poorer lives, making it less viable for multiple health insurers to exist.  If everyone had been forced onto healthcare.gov, then it’s feasible for multiple health insurance companies to exist and compete.  Also, there should be no state boundaries, since some states’ populations are so small that they can’t afford to spread around the healthcare costs.')
