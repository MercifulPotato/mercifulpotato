It&#x27;s a bit more overhead, but if you believe in it, it&#x27;s worth it. (edit: never mind, this is not possible apparently, GitHub charges you for a whole year)<p>Also, slightly off-topic, and this entirely depends on where you live. Regarding your bank, you may be able to look into start up banks (also called Neo banks), they often have zero foreign currency fees and exchange at the Master Card or Visa base exchange rate. This has in the past saved me a huge amount, mostly for travel to foreign countries, but also for purchases, however, receiving money is the same.<p>As examples, in the UK we have Starling, Monzo and some others that all give you zero foreign exchange transaction fees. In many European countries Revolut is available (also in the UK), but I closed my account with them for ethical reasons. There is undoubtedly more neo banks available especially in the development world but you will need to do research for your country.')
