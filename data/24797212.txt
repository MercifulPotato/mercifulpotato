No it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not the government. What would be free speech violation is if you criticized the government then had the government tell the social media company to remove something.<p>Then there&#x27;s the hypothetical, if social media companies had to listen free speech. Is spreading manipulative false information protected free speech? That seems abusive to me, close to slander.That&#x27;s not protected speech.')
