Something that doesn&#x27;t handle arbitrary user input or deal with the messiness of humans, like first&#x2F;last names, dates and timezones, etc.<p>As an example, I had once written a WebSocket server in go which took a program as input, ran it in a heavily stripped down docker container, and streamed the stdout back to the client. Go was perfect for that use case. (though to be honest I&#x27;d pick Rust now because I&#x27;m past the learning curve on it)')
