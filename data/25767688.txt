Every other American seems to think they are &#x27;part Irish&#x27; and I think the average American&#x27;s awareness of The Troubles is high, at least compared to other foreign conflicts (at least for Americans old enough to remember the 90s at least anyway.)  Furthermore &#x27;Irish car bombs&#x27; are a tactless but popular bar drink in America, which indicates an awareness of the conflict.')
