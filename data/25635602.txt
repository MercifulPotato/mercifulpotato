I am used to working outside from cafes, esp. coffeeshops, rotating my surroundings little by little. As of late, though, all relevant establishments are shut down in the vicinity, which disrupts both my work and sleep schedule.<p>Of course, I understand the need for such measures. Hopefully Iâ€™ll manage to continue consulting through this without losing a customer.')
