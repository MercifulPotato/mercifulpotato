I think ideally the specification would be precise enough for the user to conclude: &quot;If this is a specification conforming Scheme implementation, then this must be a tail call.&quot; I was under the impression, that this is the case with the Scheme specification, but I might be wrong, as I am not very knowledgeable in terms of the specification. If it is not so specific about what exactly becomes a tail call, then I would say, that it would be great to have an explicit way to tell the interpreter or compiler, that you want something to definitely be a tail call.')
