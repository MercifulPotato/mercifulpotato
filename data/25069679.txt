It&#x27;s a good question for 10-15 minutes in to the first conversation. It&#x27;s always revealing - about you, about how you&#x27;re perceived, and about how the other person perceives you and what matters to them.<p>Also - bug your desired-sex friends and family. Show them your profile. Focus-group it. This has been massively helpful for me.<p>At the end of the day: change stuff and see what happens.')
