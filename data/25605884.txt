Some things know that it’s text&#x2F;plain (my Arch Linux &#x2F;etc&#x2F;mime.types and &#x2F;etc&#x2F;nginx&#x2F;mime.types both do), but I expect some common server software won’t handle it properly out of the box (haven’t checked beyond nginx’s mime.types), and common OSes won’t have a handler for .text files set up (Windows, for example, comes with .text set to PerceivedType text like .txt has, so that it’ll suggest the right sort of apps to open it, but it’s still not hooked up to any app by default, unlike .txt which is “Text Document”).')
