Item(by='hackyhacky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607901584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405274, text='&gt; The earnest falsehood can cause great damage, and the truth - even when spoken by someone of ill intent - is still important.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that earnest falsehoods can&#x27;t cause damage, I merely said that it&#x27;s not a weapon. Someone who is weaponizing information to achieve their own ends definitely knows what they&#x27;re doing. And obviously, speaking the truth, regardless of intent, is not a case of misinformation.<p>To draw an analogy: I&#x27;m not saying we should outlaw guns. I&#x27;m saying we should outlaw murder. The problem is not the spread of opinions the problem is the intentional use of insincerely held opinions to cause damage.<p>I support the right for everyone to make up their own mind, which is exactly why I oppose weaponized misinformation. I don&#x27;t even know what it would mean to oppose the right for everyone to make up their own mind. Reminds of the caps from the Tripod Trilogy.<p>The power of those with great wealth to influence others should not be underestimated. We&#x27;re not immune. If you want to live in a society where everyone makes up their own mind, don&#x27;t let them join a cult.')
