If you make over $138k (and self employed) you pay around $17k annually into social security.<p>One small problem though. Just where exactly is the US government coming up with the annual $26B to fund these Birthright funds? Perhaps we abolish social security tax, and convert everybody under a certain age&#x27;s SS into a Birthright fund which grows tax free until retirement.')
