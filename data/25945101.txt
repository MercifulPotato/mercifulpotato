It is discount brokerages imposing the rule, and they are doing so because they saw what looked like market manipulation and are not interested in helping with that sort of thing.  They could have stopped trading entirely, but that would have been worse for their customers, who would have watched their positions lose value and been helpless to do anything about it.')
