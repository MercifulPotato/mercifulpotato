One must consider the entire pipeline, from sales to QA, in order to understand where are the bottlenecks. At one point, _if_ technical debt becomes a problem, non-tech people will pin-point this cause, and they will ask for either mitigation or resolution.<p>When found, the entire pipeline should be made aware of the bottleneck, because some small changes at some steps could lead to huge gains in other steps. Example : &quot;if ops could do this thing, we could remove the entire library from the codebase&quot; (ops), or &quot;that feature was actually never used&quot; (customer feedback), or &quot;if we can get the customer to accept this alternative, we wouldn&#x27;t need this piece of complicated sub-feature&quot; (need sales)<p>Then, even the smallest change could impact all other steps such as tests, documentation, reviewing, sales, QA, etc<p>Personal preference : I would rather hire developers who ship the requested ticket&#x2F;story, rather than &quot;fixing tech debt&quot; under the hood. To drive the entire company, all its parts must correctly report and correctly execute.<p>Edit : from the article , “We’re in a build the plane while flying situation, how can we get this out now without doing a big rewrite?” is exactly what non-tech people would ask, because they can take action to mitigate at other steps of the process')
