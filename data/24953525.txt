You are advocating for cultural genocide and trust me I know what comes after that.<p>It&#x27;s okay if you want to speak for yourself, but if you want to apply such a statement globally then I think that&#x27;s a little ethnocentric. The whole idea of last names and who has to take whose in marriage is steeped in a lot of history that plenty of folks had issue with even back then not to mention today.<p>Your identity and heritage is more than your name, and your identity is more than your heritage. By advocating for keeping last names for all societies, you may be unintentionally advocating for keeping an oppressive caste stratified authoritarian regime going which has been alive for over three thousand years which affects others even if it doesn&#x27;t affect you personally. Is that really what you want to do? Why not accept that the cultural utilization of last names varies from society to society?')
