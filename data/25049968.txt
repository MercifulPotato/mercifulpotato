I would like to see us debate charged topics a bit more objectively and constructively and with the genuine desire to understand other points of view. On the other hand, posting here has taught me a lot about how to structure comments to head-off the obnoxious &#x2F; predictable &#x2F; low-value responses while still being able to find a fair number of good-faith participants (which isn&#x27;t to say &#x27;people who agree with me&#x27;, but rather &#x27;people who can constructively disagree or even challenge my logic when they agree with my conclusion&#x27;).')
