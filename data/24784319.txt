There&#x27;s no obvious reason why DNA &quot;extension&quot; should produce useful proteins over un-useful ones, at least, no mechanism that we have discovered so far.<p>Instead of accepting a theory of incremental improvement that &quot;sounds nice&quot;, waving our arms about random chance and an old, vast Universe and going &quot;yup, that&#x27;s how it happened!&quot;, let&#x27;s try to develop testable mechanisms and validate them.<p>I&#x27;m asking for more rigor while simultaneously shooting down &quot;random chance&quot;, &quot;plenty of time&quot;, and hand waving about the Law of Large Numbers. We&#x27;ve done the math and we need far more effective, directed mechanisms than random chance to produce useful DNA sequences.')
