Odds were they wouldn&#x27;t be designated anything because the ship would sink long before it got through the pacific: aside from polynesian navigators (which likely had at least some pre-columbian contact with the americas) navigation was coast-hugging and ships were simply not designed to survive through the Pacific. And then the crew would still need to survive through a journey they were completely unprepared for.<p>Not to mention the pacific doesn&#x27;t really work that way: usually the ship would get caught in the gyres and never make it out, without wilful navigation it&#x27;d have incredibly low odds of catching the Alaska current or the equatorial counter-current.')
