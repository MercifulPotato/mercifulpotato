I&#x27;ve been using Fosstodon for a couple months. It&#x27;s not much different from the others, except that the typical Fosster is at least as tech-focused as HN. Without room for 10-paragraph expositions.<p>My daily surf starts with topical sites I <i>know</i> will pay off <i>for me</i> from experience. Later I&#x27;ll quickly scan HN and various subReddit headlines for items of interest. Finally (time allowing) do I drop into xtodon to walk the seashore and see what the waves left.<p>Some nice days I like to sit and people-watch. Social media&#x27;s more like mind-watch. Like BBS&#x27;s did, sometimes the waves leave some useful flotsam. Mostly it&#x27;s kelp.')
