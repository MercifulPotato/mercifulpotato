But the rest -- the &quot;build&quot; story, parts list, internal constructions, non-obvious details would be so much better in traditional format, text + pictures.<p>Well framed, high resolution pictures, so I could look at each part carefully and not try to pause the things at just the right moment. As well as nice text with sections, so I can skip over parts I do not care about, and jump right to the interesting parts.')
