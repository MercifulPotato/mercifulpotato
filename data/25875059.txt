I was in Physics and knew the head admin for our school (he was also a physist and a research scientist) very well despite being an undergrad.<p>We discussed it over lunch and he outlined how they&#x27;d been being warned for over a decade. How they hadn&#x27;t reduced their expenses. How they hadn&#x27;t increased their undergrad intake or done excellent research or even gotten a lot of grants.<p>In the last 20 years I&#x27;ve seen plenty more examples of departments, companies or projects that do NOT listen to warnings or take care to maintain their metrics.
