A congruent example I can think of is a lot of immersive 3D games going more minimal on the UI, using plain text overlay and no visible style, e.g. Ghost of Tsushima, where I think the UI style helped the goal of &quot;immersive&quot;. I can see Pokemon S&#x2F;S is going for a more realistic or immersive 3D world and can benefit from a more minimal UI, but to me visually it turns out to resemble too much to the typical &quot;flat design&quot;, and my personal visual taste is stopping me from understanding what it achieved on the game design level.<p>And I agree there&#x27;re places like &quot;hub&quot; where it&#x27;s more disconnected to the game world, and you can say it&#x27;s less important for those to use a very consistent style. I would argue these places should also be fun and game-like (or, the UI interaction feedback should match with some of the in-game feedbacks), but that&#x27;s more experimental and a different subject.')
