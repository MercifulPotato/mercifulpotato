I&#x27;m using Jottacloud, 7,50 EUR for 5 TB (actually &#x27;unlimited&#x27; but the speed gets slower after 5 TB). Rclone also has support for Jottacloud. Nice thing about Jottacloud is its hosted on Norway. They got privacy laws there. I know if you encrypt in-flight without having your private key remotely this is far less important, but still. Arguably, these products are therefore competitors.')
