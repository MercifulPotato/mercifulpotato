The board, likely made up of NTF, TCF, and investor could then fire the NTF.<p>In any case, this is not going to end nicely, and I would recommend walking away with whatever equity can be had without setting the counter-parties against TCF. If NTF and investor get really mad, they can easily dilute or destroy TCF&#x27;s equity, so I&#x27;d try to avoid that.')
