Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608962164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25539319, text='To be clear, this is a tech demo; we&#x27;re long past the point where running anything useful on a system with graphics and 4MB (8MB with expansion) of RAM under Linux is reasonable. You can barely get the kernel itself that small. There&#x27;s a reason why even cheapo consumer routers have at least 64MB of RAM.<p>So it&#x27;s for fun; you won&#x27;t be able to run any existing &quot;normal&quot; Linux emulators and you&#x27;d be better off porting stuff to run on bare metal than trying to squeeze it in under Linux on an N64. Cool project, fun, great that it&#x27;s getting upstreamed... just keep in mind it&#x27;s not really useful for end users for anything (unlike, say, Wii Linux, where with ~80MB of RAM you can actually get somewhere, though still with many limitations).<p>OTOH, as other people have mentioned, it makes a good test case for N64 emulators. If they can run this, that&#x27;s good validation.')
