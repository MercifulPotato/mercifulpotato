The math works better when buying used. By that same math, I had a &#x27;97 Suburban with a 5.7l V8 that cost me less to own and operate than a new Prius, but only because I bought it used.<p>If I buy a new car, though, it&#x27;s going to be a BEV. The driving experience and cost savings are more than incremental.')
