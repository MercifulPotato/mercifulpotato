Item(by='ColinWright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611416836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882963, text='&gt; I, too, am puzzled by your downvotes.<p>OK, so it&#x27;s not just me, but I can see that others continue to hold contrary opinions.  Which, as I say, is fine, I just wish they&#x27;d express them (as some have - thank you) and not just downvote without feedback.<p>&gt;&gt; ... annoying for someone to pop something completely different into my feed and just baldly ask the question<p>&gt; Why? Can&#x27;t you just reply whenever you can?<p>No, because of the nerd-sniping problem.  If it&#x27;s an interesting question that requires thought, I&#x27;ll inevitably start thinking about it now, even if only in background, resulting in context-switching, and my productivity goes <i>way</i> down.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that many in the HN community quite simply work differently from how I work.  I&#x27;m learning something already from the responses, and I&#x27;m getting the sense of a real disconnect between us (me and them, not me and you).')
