But I think more people are raising is simply in bad taste and often just cruel. Yeah, it&#x27;s just speech and no one is harmed by it, but myself and are choosing we don&#x27;t want to partake in it or give it the time of day. So go ahead, do it, but if I hear you doing it I&#x27;m going to think a lot less of you as a result. Your speech is free, just not free of consequences.<p>It&#x27;s just unkind and there&#x27;s not really any reason for it.')
