Hmm, it&#x27;s still pretty mysterious to me. Why should a deep network with the same number of parameters as a wide network represent a wider variety of functions? In some sense they represent the &quot;same&quot; number of functions, in the sense that the manifold of functions given by two network architectures with the same number of parameters have have the same dimension, even if one is wide while the other is deep.')
