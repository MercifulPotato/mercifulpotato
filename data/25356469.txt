Can&#x27;t do anything significant without them involved, and if your doctors turn out to be idiots with a degree, well you&#x27;re shit out of luck, especially in Europe, where the holy universal healthcare can not be questioned.<p>Where such abuses are rarer. The US healthcare system is broken, at least keep an eye on what other countries are doing. If say, Iceland, Germany, Italy, Japan start vaccinating, maybe it&#x27;s time to get vaccinated ;-)')
