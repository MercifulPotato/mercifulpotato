Or at least for the IPs they use for sending queries.<p>It&#x27;s not strictly required, and leaks information. I don&#x27;t know what an dns server would do with an icmp unreachable to its reply anyway.<p>Random drop would work too of course. I think there&#x27;s a general concern about these rate limits leaking information, but it&#x27;s hard to address because of many concerns. Alternatively a big push to use lots of IPv6 addresses would increase the search space and make it harder to spoof (contingent on IPv6 support in authoritative and recursive severs and their networks)')
