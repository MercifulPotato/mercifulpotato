The U.S. has twice as many illegal immigrants as &quot;Europe&quot; (EU-27+UK+EFTA), despite having a third less people overall. That is the result of policies--lax border enforcement, lack of enforcement of work eligibility requirements, etc.<p>People get hostile when other people don&#x27;t follow the rules and the government doesn&#x27;t enforce the rules. (E.g. Wall Street after the 2009 recession.) But that&#x27;s still a matter of policy.')
