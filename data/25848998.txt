In interviews with convicted murderers, the most common reason for murder is that they felt wronged and that there was no other form of justice available to them.  This is direct evidence that a desire for extrajudicial justice is the top cause of murder.<p>Murder is not evenly distributed.  It is concentrated in places and communities where people feel that they do not have access to the justice system.  In the USA that means concentrated in minorities, inner cities, and rural areas.   Unsurprisingly, murders are concentrated in the same groups.<p>This suggests that improving trust in the police should reduce crime.  In fact that is the idea behind community policing, and there is evidence suggesting that it really works.<p>Let&#x27;s focus on minorities for a second.<p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;10-things-we-know-about-race-and-policing-in-the-u-s&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;10-things-w...</a> you can verify that over 80% of blacks believe that the police system is unfair to them.  Over 60% of whites agree with that assessment.  We had a bunch of protests last year over this issue.<p>Independent research has verified that the blacks are basically correct.  This has lead to consequences including many successful lawsuits that put various police departments under outside control for particularly egregious behavior.<p>We should therefore predict that blacks should commit murder much more often than whites.  And indeed, US blacks commit murder at about 6x the rate that US whites do.<p>Let&#x27;s contrast to Germany.  Germany does not have a large disenfranchised minority equivalent to US blacks.  In fact you can see in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europeansocialsurvey.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;findings&#x2F;ESS5_toplines_issue_1_trust_in_justice.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europeansocialsurvey.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;findings&#x2F;ESS5_topl...</a> that an absolute majority of every socioeconomic group in Germany believe that poor people there are treated fairly by the justice system.  Which means that the top reason given by murderers for murder is much less likely to happen in Germany.<p>So you see, it isn&#x27;t as simple as saying that both the USA and Germany are law and order systems.  A significant minority of Americans believe that they don&#x27;t have access to law and order.  And that portion commits most of our murders.  Therefore while we have a justice system and it works pretty well for you and me, inequitable access to justice is still a problem in the USA.')
