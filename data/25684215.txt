Trump and the right wing are the ones being banned but it&#x27;s the democrats who have created the divide.<p>&gt; I agree that this is technically non-trivial, but many experiences have been made already and there are many methods like moderation, karma systems, IP banning, shadow-banning, banning by degrading service, limiting amplification&#x2F;re-distribution of messages, identifying sockpuppet and bot accounts, and so on.<p>I also find it funny that to justify banning and other moderation that it&#x27;s only being done to the &#x27;radical minority&#x27; but it&#x27;s absolutely not. This is about political opposition being silenced.<p>Which again comes back to the first problem. The political division in 2019 was 100% democrats. In 2021? Not 100% democrats anymore. The republicans are now adding to the division and that&#x27;s not going to end well.<p>Attempting to silence them will never work.')
