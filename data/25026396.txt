Trump had done that identical style of mocking to many non-disabled individuals before doing it to the disabled individual, most likely he didn&#x27;t even know the reporter was disabled, it was just a way that Trump mocks people. The media framed it as though Trump was specifically picking on his disability even though this historical context (which they omitted on purpose) makes that explanation unlikely.<p>This is, of course, no defence of Trump&#x27;s behavior in this instance.')
