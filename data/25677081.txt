Some features I think such a system should have are:<p>1. End to end encryption\n2. search as a first-class feature\n3. decentralized&#x2F;federated\n4. standard minimal rich text format (maybe something like markdown), instead of an inconsistent subset of html\n5. Fix some of the legacy limitations of email, like having to be ascii safe, line limit of 70 characters etc.\n6. Possibly make it easier to have an identity that isn&#x27;t tied to your service provider<p>The big questions are how would you get the general population to switch from email, and what to do about spam.')
