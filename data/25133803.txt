The real gold in this book though, is about how you need a &quot;trusted system&quot; - ie. we all have multiple channels (work email, IMs, personal email, phone(s), family, colleagues, ...) creating demands on our time, and we each need a system suited to our own mind and our own siutation for remembering and organising those demands, which nobody else has permission to add to.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;23600431-perfect-time-based-productivity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.goodreads.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;show&#x2F;23600431-perfect-time-ba...</a>')
