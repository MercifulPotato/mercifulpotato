When you say &quot;deter X from Y&quot;, usually Y is the thing being reduced&#x2F;prevented and X is the actor who is now less likely to Y.<p>So the use of &quot;[action] deterred <i>from</i> [region the action might occur in&quot; was surprising and possibly incorrect.  If you&#x27;d said &quot;[...] deterred <i>in</i> [...]&quot;, it would have been perfectly grammatical English.<p>It&#x27;s a weird nit to pick in such harsh language, especially on a comment section that&#x27;s more likely than the typical HN comment page to attract people who are not native English speakers.')
