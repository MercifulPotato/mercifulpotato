Item(by='yokaze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602367354, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24741508, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sorry but I have a hard time reconciling Laplacian determinism with quantum physics, I&#x27;d like to see more details.<p>As I understand it, it&#x27;s not really Laplacian determinism.\nWe still have the chaos and quantum randomness. But the argument is, your &quot;decision&quot;, what you perceive as free will is the result of it. Not the other way around.<p>At a certain scale (time and scope-wise) it can be predicted what you will &quot;decide&quot; before you think you consciously take a decision.<p>I picture it for myself a bit like a partly covered Pascal&#x27;s marble run. The upper covered part standing for quantum randomness.<p>Neurosciences don&#x27;t make a claim on being able to predict that, but they can (more or less) accurately observe the lower uncovered part and seeing where the marble goes. (Or at least which side)<p>And then we have the subject of the experiment, which becomes conscious of the marble when it drops, claiming that it willed the marble to drop there.<p>I hope my picture helps more than distract, as it will have its own flaws.')
