The family father who is hiding his frostbites on his feet from the doctor,  accepting to be voluntarily handicapped for life (or dead right there) in hope his children will survive, he’s not free to work. Plus you don’t organize hobos to fight just for the show. You can get hurt in military or in oil, but at least you are being useful to something. Being a gladiator to willing die on the TV arena, 1500 years after the Romans quit doing it, we can’t let that happen.')
