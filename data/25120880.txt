That assumption ignores some important factors;<p>- Seamless have enough capital to buy the ad space at the top of every restaurant search. They&#x27;ll always be at the top.<p>- Google weights things like inbound links highly. A massive site like Seamless will always win on those factors.<p>- Google allegedly considers domain and website age as important in pagerank. Seamless has an advantage over new restaurants there.<p>- Most importantly though, for all we know Google&#x27;s algorithm could simply be biased in favor of Seamless. It&#x27;s a black box. There could be a rule that just says &quot;if (seamless.com) rank += 10000&quot;. If Google users prefer SERPs where that gets applied then it&#x27;ll be there. There&#x27;s no reason to believe pagerank is fair.')
