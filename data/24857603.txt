Both numbers are large but finite, the first is bounded by the value of global economy (no matter how many dollars you create, the total purchasing power of these dollars can&#x27;t grow beyond that), the second is bounded if not to a few hundred years then by the time until the heat death of the universe.<p>In a similar manner, the total amount of reward that you might ever get is capped by the amount of pleasure your brain can perceive at any given moment (which is finite) times your lifespan (which is finite).<p>You might reason and hypothesise about agents perceiving infinite rewards (as we are doing now), but this has nothing to do with the reality of homo sapiens rewards system(s), or, in fact, the rewards system of any agent existing in our physical reality, which is effectively bounded both in time and space.')
