I still remain an arm-chair skeptic, but it&#x27;s my guess is the reasons it&#x27;s practical for storage (i.e. you need greater charge to make the tunnel, but the charge is durably stored because it can&#x27;t tunnel out) don&#x27;t make it practical for increasing transmission rate vs a direct connection.<p>Edit:  Just to fix a confusion, by &#x27;reliable&#x27; I meant, one electron sent, one received.  I know one &#x27;bit&#x27; isn&#x27;t typically sent as one electron, but being reductive for comparison&#x27;s sake.  Obviously with enough current you can make the tunnel happen, but you&#x27;d need far more electrons and &#x27;time&#x27; to do so.')
