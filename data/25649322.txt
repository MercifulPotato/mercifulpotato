I recall years ago when I did my Windows 10 box they didn&#x27;t push the Microsoft Account on you so hard during setup, but when doing newer laptops for family members that&#x27;s clearly changed.<p>I&#x27;ve basically demoted my Windows 10 box to headless status.  If I want to do anything I either use Remote Desktop or Steam Streaming to access it.<p>Interestingly OS X also has plenty of Cloud services, but Apple seems to have at least figured out how to sell them in a less intrusive manner while letting you feel like you&#x27;re still in control of the machine.   Just little things like you setup a local account and then Apple sells you on &quot;Hey want to link your iCloud so you can remote wipe this machine if it is stolen?&quot; vs forcing you to lie about internet connectivity so Windows 10 gives you the local account option.')
