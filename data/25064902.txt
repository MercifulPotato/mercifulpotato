I remember when I arrived here to the states many years ago and all I knew was enfield and fury from India. Asian bikes were called ‘rice bikes’ ..and at least in the east coast, there was a certain derisiveness towards anything that wasn’t a Harley. Indian bikes were neither here nor there but were rice bikes anyways.<p>Eta2: I agree with the sentiment. it’s the same with cameras. I remember a cheap Chinese TLR called Seagull.
