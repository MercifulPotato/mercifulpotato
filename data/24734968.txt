They don&#x27;t pay my rent, literally.  You can say &quot;screw insurance; we&#x27;re offering all employees this super expensive concierge medical plan,&quot; and that literally has no effect on <i>my</i> balance sheet, which is the problem if you want me to be a good consumer in the economy and buy stuff.  Or, if you don&#x27;t think we need more homeless people in this country.<p>If you want to look at the &quot;value&quot; of, say, an employer&#x27;s group health insurance plan to me, what you really need to look at is the difference between buying the exact same coverage as an individual versus participating in the group plan.  This is not an analysis that can typically be performed, because insurance companies don&#x27;t want you to be able to compare on price like that.  But, assuming you could, if I got, say, a $100 discount per month, and I was going to buy that coverage <i>anyway</i>, then, sure, you&#x27;d have a good case for calling that +$100 on my balance sheet.')
