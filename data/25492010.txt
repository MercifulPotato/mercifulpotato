You don&#x27;t interrupt a conversation about aqueducts to say &quot;I got mud on my shoe once&quot;, so a reasonable interpretation is that something they said made you think they&#x27;re not something; and, since the conversation was about relating things to other things and that&#x27;s a very philosophical act, the insinuation is that they&#x27;re bad at it.')
