For the first 6 months you&#x27;re paying a sr. engineers salary to get jr. engineer productivity.</i><p>Ouch. While I myself have been guilty of that 2-3 times during my sadly way too rich on customers and employers career, this is definitely the exception and something with your hiring filters is very wrong.<p>Combined with your disclosure that you pay about $200K but still have problems with good programmers then I&#x27;d think you are letting people in either way too easily or you don&#x27;t aim well. Which brings me to...<p>&gt; <i>2. While great devs are great, it&#x27;s a lot easier to figure out if someone is a framework&#x2F;language expert than if they are an intrinsically great dev in an interview. i.e. (&quot;Do you know C# well?&quot; is easier to determine than &quot;Are you a good problem solver?&quot;)</i><p>I will respectfully disagree with the last assertion. You or the people who interview devs must reach outside of the usual leetcode &#x2F; whiteboard tests and do some research on more general interviews and learn techniques through which you will get a <i>very good</i> idea if the interviewee is a good problem solver.<p>Trouble is, most tech interviewers view gaining those extra evaluation skills as a waste of time.<p>Piece of advice: give the candidate 10-15 minute and an <i>easy</i> coding problem they could solve in front of you, or give them a <i>really small</i> homework (not this &quot;you&#x27;ll need 1-2 days at home to solve this homework&quot; nonsense) -- but don&#x27;t make the tech aspect of the interview the dominant part. Talk with the candidate. Give them a few examples of tough situations from the past. Chat with them about how would they approach the problem(s). Ask them what they know about CI&#x2F;CD, about best practices in framework X or Y, what project or task that they did makes them proud of themselves. Many other such great interview questions exist.<p>Not meaning any disrespect to you, you seem to be trying hard to get good devs. But from what I read here it does seem like the aim of your company isn&#x27;t good and it&#x27;s mis-firing the hiring gun.<p>$200K will tempt a lot of people to lie and &quot;wing it&quot; when they get hired. But you should leave the high remuneration in place. That way when you get a good professional they&#x27;ll have one extra -- and very fat -- reason not to leave. :)')
