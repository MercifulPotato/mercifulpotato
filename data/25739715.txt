Were Zeno and Marcus Aurelius not Philosophers? Chrysippus or the countless others involved with Stoicism weren&#x27;t philosophers either?<p>Firstly, most philosophers never wrote anything, as the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and most of the other Greeks came from the lecture notes of their students.
