Item(by='omaranto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606399221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25217194, text='&gt; Surely you have a day or two where it gets hot.<p>That depends on what you mean by hot: the highest temperature ever recorded in Mexico City is 38C, so my friends from northern Mexico and from, say, Arizona would say that no, Mexico City does not have even a day or two when it gets hot. (Of course, 38C is probably much too hot for comfort if you are playing football.)<p>But back to June 22, 1986.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the Mexican national weather service knows exactly how hot it was on June 22, 1986 in Mexico City, but unfortunately their website doesn&#x27;t seem to have day-by-day data available for download (at least not that far back). I did find a table of monthly average high temperatures [1], and for June 1986 in Mexico City (see &quot;Distrito Federal&quot; in the table) the average high temperature was 23.6C. The Weather Underground says that on June 22, 1986 the highest temperature was 75F [2], which is 23.9C. (Why doesn&#x27;t the Weather Underground default to Celsius for visitors from Mexico?)<p>So it looks like I would have won my (very conservative) bet that the temperature was somewhere between 15C and 25C that day.<p>&gt; Maybe the TV commentator said it was a hot day.<p>This is definitely possible!<p>1. The commentator could have <i>assumed</i> that because the game was in Mexico it would be hot! This happens all the time. I have explained to dozens of people that Mexico City doesn&#x27;t really get hot, most are surprised. Of course, when I remind them Mexico City is at an altitude of 2.2km they usually believe me about the lack of heat.<p>2. The commentator could have known it was 25C and still thought that was hot for a football match.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smn.conagua.gob.mx&#x2F;tools&#x2F;DATA&#x2F;Climatolog%C3%ADa&#x2F;Pron%C3%B3stico%20clim%C3%A1tico&#x2F;Temperatura%20y%20Lluvia&#x2F;TMAX&#x2F;1986.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smn.conagua.gob.mx&#x2F;tools&#x2F;DATA&#x2F;Climatolog%C3%ADa&#x2F;Pron...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wunderground.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;daily&#x2F;mx&#x2F;mexico-city&#x2F;MMMX&#x2F;date&#x2F;1986-6-22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wunderground.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;daily&#x2F;mx&#x2F;mexico-city&#x2F;MM...</a>')
