I&#x27;m sure Putin will be mighty pleased that he is being given so much credit for having destabilized a Superpower by doing <i>literally nothing</i>. Can you imagine the ego boost he would be getting out of it? If there is a way to self-destruct Americans have for sure found a way to do it. Irrational fears about Russians meddling in elections while saying in the same breath that mail-in ballots cannot be subject to fraud. Do you see how disconnected both arguments are? On one hand you say a foreign adversary can easily influence your election but in the same breath you say domestic actors cannot influence elections. Either your elections are so weak that they can be manipulated or they can&#x27;t. Can&#x27;t have it both ways. And yet Americans believe both stories coming from the same party and accept that it must be true.')
