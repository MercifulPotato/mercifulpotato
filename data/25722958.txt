(I am not even sure if you are on my side or not. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> accusing you of anything at all.)<p>But &quot;Last hired, first fired&quot; is not and has never been exclusively about &quot;Hiring managers are just racist assholes who look for bullshit reasons to not hire Blacks.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s an observation about general trends that result in worse unemployment for Blacks. Some ways that can play out without any hiring manager being blatantly racist and intentionally wanting to exclude Blacks:<p>1. It&#x27;s harder to get a job with a criminal record and you are more likely to have a criminal record if you are Black.<p>2. It&#x27;s harder to get a job if your criminal record is for certain kinds of crimes and Blacks are more likely to be convicted and do hard time rather than get probation for the same thing.<p>3. It&#x27;s harder to get a job if you have less education and education costs money and Blacks tend to have less of that than others.<p>4. It&#x27;s harder to get a job if your education is from a less prestigious institution and the prestigious institutions cost more money.<p>5. Certain classes of jobs may be cut at a big company to save money because they are deemed &quot;less essential&quot; and those classes of jobs may be typically held by Blacks while the &quot;essential&quot; jobs are typically held by Whites.<p>At my corporate job during a recession, they cut janitorial service to save money. They stopped having all trash removed daily and had it removed every other day.<p>Janitorial jobs and cleaning jobs are very often held by people of color.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a racist piece of shit to go &quot;Oh, the company is not doing well. We need to make some cuts. Um...let&#x27;s have the trash taken out less.&quot; You can do that for completely good reasons that aren&#x27;t inherently racist and it can still result in higher rates of unemployment for some groups than others.<p>I don&#x27;t really want to argue this further. I cannot believe I am being given so much grief over this as if no one on the planet has heard that &quot;racism is alive and well in the US of A.&quot;')
