For example, you&#x27;re somehow assuming that academic papers about to be subjected to peer review are somehow milestones which write in stone the truth instead of what they actually are and always have been: a way to share data, observations, theories, hypothesis, and even assumptions on research topics. Researchers share their work not because it&#x27;s bullet-proof but because it&#x27;s food for thought that can be used to drive our understanding a bit further.<p>And a paper is retracted only in extreme cases such as gross scientific malpractice such as fraud. Unless you have some info that you refused to share, I see no coherent and rational reason to indicate any of these papers should be retracted. Having strong emotionally-driven positions on a subject is not a reason to demand a paper should be retracted.')
