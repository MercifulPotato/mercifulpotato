Say I have a team with many responsibilities (including non-technical ones), and it is every developer&#x27;s responsibility to do these. You will likely never find a 10x employee there.<p>Yes, if you&#x27;re team is so poorly managed that has neither top-down not bottom-up organization for efficient task distrobution but instead features mechanistic, blind task distribution, you&#x27;ll both decrease output even of a team of whatever overall competence and minimize the performance differences on the team that aren&#x27;t do to absolute superiority on every type of task. Which is why, whether it&#x27;s agile self-organizing teams or other bottom-up approaches on one side or any kind of top-down management theory on the other, every approach to managing work is about.<p>&gt; To be clear, I don&#x27;t doubt that a person is 10x better than the average in doing X, but I&#x27;ve found that X is always a very narrow scope<p>I find 10× in a narrow scope to be very rare, though it probably happens somewhere. Something more like 3× in a narrow scope of focus personal tasks (e.g., the more complex design and coding tasks) and providing a 2× multiplier on the rest of the team by helping choose efficient direction of focus, identifying problems proactively early, and otherwise keeping the team from wasted&#x2F;misdirected work that otherwise would get done is both more common than 10× in a narrow field and a bigger productivity win.')
