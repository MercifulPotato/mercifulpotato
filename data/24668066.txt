A bijective function will map all inputs to distinct outputs and its inverse will also map all inputs to distinct outputs.<p>They don&#x27;t need to be the same length.<p>For a toy example, I could give you a compressor which:<p>If the input begins with a billion copies of &quot;HurrahHackerNews!&quot; output a one bit then the rest of the input (if there is any more input).  Otherwise it outputs a zero bit, then the input (but if the input begins with a billion copies of HurrahHackerNews! except last one ends with &quot; instead of ! it skips that last bit, so the encoding isn&#x27;t redundant).<p>The decompressor just perfectly reverses this process.<p>This format is a bijection, and if you often have inputs that begin exactly with a billion copies of HurrahHackerNews! it will get pretty good compression. :P')
