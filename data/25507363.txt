Since Ripple is all about cross-border payments, you&#x27;re potentially dealing with hundreds of currencies. So if you were a bank that needed to do global business, you&#x27;d be required to hold a subset of each traded currency in nostro&#x2F; vostro accounts. XRP was then meant to be the &quot;standardized&quot; currency that member-banks in the Ripple ecosystem could transaction with.<p>Since you as a bank would only need your own fiat currency + XRP, you could materially cut down on additional costs from holding all the other accounts. When it comes time to convert currencies, because Ripple (XRP) transactions settle in seconds, the period you&#x27;re exposed to market volatility is virtually zero, so you can move in and out of a position in XRP in exchange for whatever other currency you need almost immediately.')
