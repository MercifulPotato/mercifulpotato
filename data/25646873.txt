Every time I&#x27;ve tried to dive into Pearl&#x27;s justifications for what makes his methodology superior, he mostly spends time attacking the character of long dead statisticians (and some living ones), and bemoaning how awful the Rubin causal paradigm is, without giving any actual, verifiable specifics. I also have yet to see just about anyone using do-Calculus in a practical way.<p>If it really is all that, I&#x27;m interested and please explain it to me. Because up until now it seems like its basically someone who reinvented the wheel, and has formed a cult following around it by saying &quot;but MY wheel has no death crystals!&quot;')
