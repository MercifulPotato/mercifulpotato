The reading machines read a QR code generated by the ballot-marking-device.  Or so I&#x27;ve seen experts testify.<p>The QR code could mis-match the printed ballot on say 5% of the ballots and nobody would notice a thing.<p>Need a recount?   Ok, just run em through again, and they&#x27;ll read the same (wrong) votes again, no problem.<p>Only a hand count of the paper ballots would catch the mis-match.<p>Did that actually happen?  I don&#x27;t know.  But if the machines are truly reading a QR code, that seems a glaring flaw regardless.')
