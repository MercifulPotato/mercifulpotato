Typically you&#x27;ll have a mix of both languages, some statically typed, some dynamic, so strongly typed, some not. The problem is not about serializing data from language A and deserializing back to language A, although that comes with enough problems (e.g. what if you language supports functions as first-class types?), but going from language A, serializing the data, and then deserializing it to a language that may or may not support something the source language has built in: floating point, complex types, UTF8 strings, and so on.')
