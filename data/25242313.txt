Neither uM nor uBO static rules block that. The only way to block it is a uBO dynamic rule `no-scripting: $hostname true`, which you&#x27;ll also need to be able to render the `&lt;noscript&gt;` content anyway.<p>BTW, you probably want to move off of uM given gorhill has abandoned it in favor of uBO. (I converted all my rules to a mix of uBO dynamic rules for JS and static rules for everything else, except for cookies which I still use uM for because uBO can&#x27;t manage them.)')
