So everybody on Digg was already aware of Reddit. Then when the redesign hit, a meme spread that &quot;This redesign sucks, try reddit&quot;. And so people did. And what they found was a much better <i>community</i> (Digg was more like a news website with a comment section).<p>The cautionary tail for Reddit is that what keeps people locked into a social network is <i>community</i>.
