I prefer a separate mouse.<p>In my case a mouse slows me down. I have to take my hands off the keyboard and reach for the mouse. The touchpad is right there where my hands are. My touchpad also have three physical buttons, which are very useful instead of tapping the touchpad (I disabled that.)<p>I really need a mouse only for playing (which I stopped doing on my laptop since many years ago) or to try out some very rare sites linked to HN. It doesn&#x27;t happen every year.<p>This is probably the only ergonomics pro of a laptop (except that I carry it with me, of course). Just in case I&#x27;ll need a separate keyboard again, does anybody know of a good full size one with a touchpad under the space bar and physical buttons? I googled and found many keyboards with a touchpad in place of the number pad or further to the right. By the way, the number pad is not important for me. I&#x27;d love not to have it on my 15&quot; laptop. I can keep it there on an external keyboard, but it&#x27;s extra travel for my right hand if I really have to use a mouse and I never use it anyway.')
