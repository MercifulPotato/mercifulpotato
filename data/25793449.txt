I’m one of those guys who started on the command line and lived on the command line most of his life. I couldn’t imagine a more productive environment! I consider a bunch of xterms running vi to be the pinnacle of IDEs. But I did two brief stints at Windows shops and just couldn’t get really productive. The guy next to me who was scared of the command line and never went outside Visual Studio? He wasn’t stupid, he just had a different lineage and got accustomed to a different environment and workflow. One is not inherently better than the other.<p>That said, if you are a modern web developer, you just have to understand the command line. You have to know what &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin is. You have to know how to install your toolchain. It’s inconvenient, but it’s table stakes. I don’t think it’s reasonable to say “Hey! I’m used to GUIs so people programming on the command line are wrong and I shouldn’t need to know about &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin“')
