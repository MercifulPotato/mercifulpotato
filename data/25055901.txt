Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605074382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055606, text='&gt; When you enroll a device in, say, your primary Google account, trying to enroll the same device again produces the same cryptographic key.<p>That&#x27;s not correct. The keys are random so of course there would be statistically no chance to get the same one.<p>However, if you actually try to do this it simply doesn&#x27;t work, it says you already enrolled this authenticator, which is true. How does it know? During enrollment the site presents a list of identifiers it already knows for your account, and your browser shows this list to all your authenticators, they won&#x27;t re-enroll if they recognise an identifier as their own.<p>This delivers a nice UX. If you have several authenticators you don&#x27;t need to unplug ones that were already enrolled to enroll more. Likewise you don&#x27;t need to unplug the ones that don&#x27;t know, say, Facebook credentials, to log into Facebook, the browser will see OK, this authenticator can&#x27;t help me, let&#x27;s try the others.<p>If you own the backend (I have a test system for this) you can just not provide that list of existing identifiers and if you do that the authenticator will cheerfully generate a fresh key pair (different from the first one) and complete enrolment again for the new key pair. A real site should never do that.')
