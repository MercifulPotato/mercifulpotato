Germany tries buying gas from Russia and the USA sanctions the fuck out of companies that are even just marginally involved in it.<p>As for innovation, that&#x27;s relative. Europe, for centuries, was the undisputed worldwide leader in innovation, now that has shifted a bit to the USA and seems to be on its way to shift to China or maybe India in the next few decades.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem that Europe can&#x27;t really focus on organizing itself in a self-sufficient manner because there&#x27;s still separatists bitching about everything and always screaming for separation instead of forcing governments to address issues, and the impending rise of fascism in east-europe that may or may not become a huge deal for the rest of the 2020es. The USA has this problem as well, but to a far lesser degree.')
