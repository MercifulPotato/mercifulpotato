An EV with 300mi of range can be treated like a gas car - stop to charge every week or two instead of gassing up.<p>I had a supercharger 1 mile away, and 3 more in a 20 minute radius.  One urban supercharger was at a grocery&#x2F;Target and another was at a Museum&#x2F;Garden, so in those situations Iâ€™d park longer for a deep charge and make use of my time productively.  I never ever just sat in my car for 20..30..60min like some people imagine you might.')
