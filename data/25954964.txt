Item(by='dartmoose', descendants=None, kids=[25958563], score=None, time=1611905311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954656, text='Thanks again for the insights here and in the other thread!<p>&gt; In the implicit paradigm, it&#x27;s not necessary to evaluate the smoke ahead of time since sphere tracing can reduce to marching adaptively when we are within smoke.<p>Makes sense. The SDF is separate from the density grid for the cloud&#x2F;smoke. We need both, one to detect the boundary (SDF) and another to actually render the volume (density grid).<p>In offline rendering we usually just have some primitive (sphere, cube etc) that acts as the boundary but that obviously isn&#x27;t as adaptive and doesn&#x27;t let you easily reveal arbitrary slices of a volume.')
