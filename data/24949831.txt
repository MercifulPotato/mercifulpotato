Highly gig oriented, extreme efficiency that leads to classes of workers (actual RNs, down to CNAs), a clear cohort of what appears to be cheaper immigrants, crazy crazy saturation and demand at the same time, with basically shit pay.<p>You make reasonable money by basically working as many hours as possible in that hyper industry. That could mean working straight double shifts multiple times a week in one place, or in multiple places. And there is crazy demand to have these shifts filled, and crazy saturation by cheaper and more available nurses. I doubt anyone in that overworked, treated like shit, industry gives a fuck that they are going around spreading COVID to it’s target demographic.<p>Gig economy is scary stuff when in full effect, pure ruthless capitalism on all sides. Brings out the worst of us.<p>Oh, and the nurses are in a perpetual fight with facilities over pay raises. Nursing homes regularly optimize for minimum number of nurses needed, minimum pay, but maximum hours and shifts. There’s no way you can treat people like this and expect them to not turn callous. It’s factory work model more or less, and we all know how those people are treated.<p>Got nothing good to say here unfortunately, someone paint a rosier picture.')
