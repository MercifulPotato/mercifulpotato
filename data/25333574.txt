And in anycase, how will you have access to the body cam ?\nIn my country, body cam is still not a thing so I really have no idea how the recording are used in practice, but it was my understanding that the PD has to give it if asked.\nUnless this tool can retrieve data that was &quot;erased&quot; (i.e the police officer trying to cover their track) ?')
