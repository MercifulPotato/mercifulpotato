Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=[25156852], score=None, time=1605839662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25156775, text='&gt; The article you posted doesn&#x27;t mention that YouTube is promoting ad-free hosting that the creator doesn&#x27;t have to pay for.<p>The article from 2008 doesn&#x27;t mention that butterflys might be appearing across the video randomly either. How is what they didn&#x27;t specifically say (or imply) relevant? I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here.<p>I thought the messages from that far back was interesting, which hedged toward this eventual practice.')
