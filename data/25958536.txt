At this point shorts from significantly lower levels have almost certainly been covered, if for no other reason out of simple necessity. At this point what started as a short squeeze has ballooned into a false narrative that retail is sticking it to shorts when in reality it’s almost certainly HFT traders pushing this stock up and down by now. Retail simply doesn’t have enough cash to move a stock like this especially when by their own admission they aren’t selling any shares!')
