In applications I work on right now, trace tags contain the richest and best-described request metadata. Tags are indexed differently depending on their cardinality, and there is no cardinality limit.<p>Tempo&#x27;s implementation seems pragmatic as a short to medium term solution though. Log engines still have a lot more investment and maturity than trace engines. In my work, even though the trace tags contain the best data quality, the tracing system is currently worse at answering a good deal of my questions. It&#x27;s simply that Splunk has many tools that work well, and the tracing system is behind.')
