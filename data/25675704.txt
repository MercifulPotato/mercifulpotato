Unless there&#x27;s an implication that they&#x27;d need to hire more people, why would they need to pay you less?  If you&#x27;re generating the same amount of revenue, just working fewer hours, their fixed profit should be able to cover your fixed healthcare whether you work 80% of the time or 10% of the time.  As long as they aren&#x27;t incurring additional expense by hiring multiple people to do the same job to facilitate fewer hours.<p>A shorter work week obviously can&#x27;t work for all businesses, but there are plenty that have tried it and found that workers spend more time working and less time socializing with a shorter work week (which would seem to be a win for everyone).')
