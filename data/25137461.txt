You can run a business entirely unrelated to iOS, release an iOS app because your users expect it, and then Apple comes in and starts making demands that you change your business model...<p>Seriously, that&#x27;s entirely unacceptable.<p>And the Spotify and Amazon issue is textbook antitrust. Amazon won&#x27;t sell ebooks on iOS devices because Apple will take 30%, which is too much for Amazon&#x27;s commission structure. Apple also sells ebooks. Spotify has offered a music streaming service for years, and Apple demands 30% of every month&#x27;s payment if purchased through iOS...and now Apple offers a competing service at the same price point.')
