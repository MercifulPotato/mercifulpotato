Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a physician, with experience from a foreign country and a years-long unimpeachable track record. What I don&#x27;t have is a US degree or residency. I&#x27;m 100% going to prison if I perform a surgery in my van. Licensing and various other requirements are imposed on physicians in order to practice lawfully. One of those requirements would be not to accept direct payment for services outside the public system. If you do, then you are practicing without a license, and whatever comes of that comes of it. Likely a fine, or license suspension or if you continue to defy the law, prison.<p>Your argument that &quot;you consider it unethical to withhold medical care from someone who requests it&quot; is not a defense today for practicing medicine without a license, and in my scenario, that would not change.')
