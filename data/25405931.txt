Models are never perfect, the map is not the territory. We are constantly figuring out what our shared  values are, and it&#x27;s a moving target. And the body of law itself is a complex beast with its own surprising dynamics. It&#x27;s part of an ecosystem. You can&#x27;t wave away its complexity with such a simplistic ideal.<p>A given law may be &#x27;bad&#x27; (regrettable, even draconian&#x2F;immoral) when enforced in certain cases, and yet it may also be unfeasible to change that law to add those cases as exceptions. This is why the law gives judges flexibility on sentencing, for example.')
