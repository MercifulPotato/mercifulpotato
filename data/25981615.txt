Citing Wikipedia for the statistics:<p>In coverage of the CIE 1931 color space, the Rec. 2020 color space covers 75.8%, the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space covers 53.6%, the Adobe RGB color space covers 52.1%, and the Rec. 709 color space covers 35.9%.<p>Technically DCI-P3 as used by projectors isn’t Display P3 as used by computers and smartphones but the numbers should give you an idea.<p>What you want to look for is high rating for “colour volume” such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;tv&#x2F;tests&#x2F;picture-quality&#x2F;color-volume-hdr-dci-p3-and-rec-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rtings.com&#x2F;tv&#x2F;tests&#x2F;picture-quality&#x2F;color-volume...</a> ... it varies based on LCD vs OLED.
