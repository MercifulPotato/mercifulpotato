Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606391817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213611, text='&gt; This friend refused to interview people who had graduated from our department or pass along resumes. Instead they started hiring other people from non-engineering departments that they thought they could train to program. This guy is now a C-level and still refuses to hire people that graduated from our department.<p>I&#x27;m not doubting your story for an instant, but this is incredibly strange behaviour and not something I&#x27;d consider normal.<p>Companies I&#x27;ve worked at <i>love</i> hiring referrals because you generally get higher quality and skip all the hassle of dealing with external agencies, dozens or hundreds of applicants, etc. Something like half my team is made up of people I&#x27;ve worked with at other companies in the past - I was overjoyed when they applied for jobs with us - and I still keep a mental rolodex of people I was at university with 20 years ago who I&#x27;d be happy to work with.<p>Cambridge is a bit of an odd place, in that plenty of companies have a bias for Cambridge graduates. That&#x27;s fine as far as it goes, but I&#x27;m generally happy to hear from anyone with a CS background from any university, and am absolutely open to other STEM graduates who demonstrate that they can do the work.')
