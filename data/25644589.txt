Stuff at a point in spacetime only affects stuff at that point and in its causal future. If you want to affect something somewhere else then you have to fire a light particle or whatever there.<p>Interference between different &quot;branches&quot; of the wavefunction is local if you&#x27;re comparing the value of the two branches at the same point(s).<p>Edit: I should emphasise that interference is a completely local (in the sense I use it above) process in every interpretation of quantum mechanics I am aware of (even Copenhagen) generally the thing that makes quantum mechanics non-local in various interpretations is measurement.')
