That&#x27;s not hard to work out. A Bugatti veyron goes for a lot more than a specced out mercedes S-class because they&#x27;re designed to be sold to different markets.<p>The leaf&#x27;s entertainment system, for example, does the job it&#x27;s intended to do fine, the tesla one is designed to innovate.<p>They are empirically desirable because they&#x27;ve sold half a million of them.')
