The bill is written by an outside team of analysts funded by a private prison magnate, Sherman Tans. He packs the bill with extras intended to expand the prison population. Jonah accepts the bill because he&#x27;s an idiot and doesn&#x27;t like to read. He only got elected because he went negative against the president, a member of his own party. In the end, the bill fails because Jonah flies to close to the sun.')
