I recently picked up a camera to go with my binos and it&#x27;s been awesome.\nI go out to a park or my backyard for an hour or so and sit while looking for birds and taking photos.\nThen when I get back I spend a little while editing them and posting to ebird.<p>It&#x27;s not 100% free, but you can get into the hobby with some 8x42 binos (Nikon Prostaffs are ~$100 and great, but you can go cheaper). Cameras can really eat budget - there is a $300 lumix that would be fine and even a cheaper point and shoot will work.<p>It&#x27;s like fishing. If you are patient, you can see a lot of unexpected kinds of birds wherever you are. You can bird <i>anywhere</i> and have a nice time. Migration is a fascinating time where tiny birds wander by, popping in your area for a day and moving on.')
