Item(by='raegis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606520414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25232346, text='The major problem with this &quot;people of color&quot; designation is that it sweeps specific discrimination against African Americans* under the rug.  It is certainly possible to have 100% employees &quot;of color&quot; while consciously excluding African Americans, which I have witnessed at private companies (blue collar jobs mostly) in California (where I live).  The result is that affirmative action for African Americans, which has been replaced with affirmative action for women and non-white men, does way more for non-African Americans than the originally intended recipients (collectively).  Even black African&#x2F;Caribbean immigrants are used for diversity accounting-- see the NYTimes article from 2004, &quot;Top Colleges Take More Blacks, but Which Ones?&quot;.<p>Please note this is not a slight against women, immigrants, or anyone else.  They obviously have valid discrimination claims.  But if you work in a community where less than 1% of African-American students are scoring at grade level in mathematics, and your company claims it is &quot;diverse&quot; yet hires no local African-Americans, there is still a serious problem in your community that should be addressed. (It&#x27;s OK if you don&#x27;t care, as long as you don&#x27;t pretend otherwise).  So please do not conflate hiring &quot;people of color&quot; with hiring any specific group.<p>* By &quot;African-American&quot; here I mean descendants of slaves who lived in the USA, and are thus severely disadvantaged because of it, having actual wealth stolen without any legal means available for recovery.  I do understand that &quot;African-American&quot; is commonly used to mean any black U.S. resident.')
