After 60+ hours of gameplay, I can say Cyberpunk is significantly worse than the Witcher 3 was at launch.<p>The thing is, on PC, the bugs are mostly visual annoyances or obvious lack of polish. Menu&#x27;s not updating, UI glitches in cut scense, etc... I&#x27;ve had the game crash on me exactly once.<p>The core game has a great story. The side quests are unique and interesting. Characters have depth. Combat is surprisingly good. Cyberpunk has all the things I need to enjoy it and I did enjoy it.')
