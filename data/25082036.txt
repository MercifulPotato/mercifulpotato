Most Linux distros don&#x27;t require you to &quot;manage every nitty-gritty detail&quot; of anything. In fact, some of them make it easier for you to choose your privacy settings once and only during installation.<p>&gt; I have better things to do.<p>Oh, mr. I&#x27;m-so-important, if ignoring your privacy and the rights to use your own machine is low on your priority list, you gotta respect those people who see it as something important, as well as their demand for something better. If you are fine with Apple&#x2F;MS, great, use it. But don&#x27;t try to take away the rights of others to look for something that better addresses their needs, and, especially, their right to try to tell others that it could work for them too.')
