If a car has a 300 mile range, I think dealing with charging stations is tolerable. Few people drive more than 500 miles a day so you just have 1 stop, not a bunch.<p>&gt; Right now there are already busy gas stations by every exit on the highway. Imagine how overloaded they would be if it took an hour to fill up the tank.<p>How much of that traffic would be eliminated because EVs start the day full charged?<p>It only takes 20 minutes for the supercharger stations (And most newer entrants are pushing for faster charging with mixed results). It will certainly be interesting to see how well these networks hold up to increasing traffic over time. I&#x27;ve heard the super charger network can get pretty bogged up already on holiday weekends.')
