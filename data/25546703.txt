It expands the tech availability gap, which further expands the income gap. &quot;we are keeping it secret for folks we know for security&quot; is a lie.<p>Does anyone know a commercial application using gpt-3? I&#x27;ve played around with it before and wrote about it a bunch [0,1,2] and I was both impressed but also skeptical of its usefulness in commercial applications. I don&#x27;t see how this is driving the income gap. Does OpenAI perform some kind of background check to make sure you&#x27;re from &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; before they sell to you? Their api was incredibly straight forward and barely required any tech skills to use.<p>&gt; You are giving away usage availability to people you can invest or to people can invest back to you. This is pure evil and sorry but this is not ethically right for an organization brags about ethics for AI.<p>Are they doing this? What does this even mean? They give a key to a VC company, they are impressed and invest and something something, evil? If they are limiting usage from actual engineers that could make businesses off this, they are essentially running a ponzi scheme that will end with investors losing big as they are dumping money into something without actually generating anything valuable.<p>&gt; This is not equalitarian neither meritocracy. Monopolising every single text-based content market and accumulating all the money to Silicon Valley and then what?<p>How are they monopolizing text-based content market? If anything, they showed its potential and others will be able to apply the same techniques to train a network very similar to gpt-3 at much lower costs.<p>This rant seems like its generated by gpt-3 as a word soup of tech grievances without any real substance<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;using-gpt-3-to-explain-jokes-2001a5aefb68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;using-gpt-3-to-explain-joke...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;demo-apps-and-building-a-business-off-gpt-3-612fbcbbb189" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;demo-apps-and-building-a-bu...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;the-beautiful-dark-twisted-gpt-3-generated-nassim-taleb-aphorisms-a750d6572ee3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ml-everything&#x2F;the-beautiful-dark-twisted-...</a>')
