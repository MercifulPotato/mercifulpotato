Considering yalls success, I would say extremely reasonable. What is the alternative? A half assed version of those (my state imposed a weak curfew, bans to arbitrary activity, but nothing really targeted at preventing COVID). I think there is a particular horror in the current US (and elsewhere) experience where it quite literally feels like a lottery of who among your contacts will get it next. Is two months of an admitted harsh lockdown not worth avoiding that?<p>- lots of shops forced you to give your details over and some demanded that you sanitize your hands (these are two things I didn&#x27;t want to do for my own reasons)<p>- increase of police powers, fines around $1600<p>That I find more concerning, and agree with you')
