Spotify and Figma are listed, but presumably there&#x27;s others too.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing. These web apps are <i>much worse</i> from a freedom perspective than the client-side software they&#x27;re replacing. You&#x27;re less likely to be able to run them if the company doesn&#x27;t want you too, e.g., they normally can&#x27;t be run without having an account. But more importantly, with closed-source web software you&#x27;ve taken the one thing you actually did own, your data (which once lived on your hardware that you have full control over) and now <i>you&#x27;ve given that to the company too</i>. And you still don&#x27;t have the source code.<p>In a freedom sense, this is absolutely the worst of all worlds. Slowly losing ownership of your data as we move to web apps is a path to a Kafkaesque nightmare where a tech company can arbitrarily cut off access to your life&#x27;s work on a whim. This is already happening.<p>You can still get by only using apps that let you own your data today, but it becomes harder and harder every year. And at least in the tech community, a lot of this is driven by a mind-bogglingly paradoxical-on-its-face preference among open-source advocates for closed-source web apps over native apps (which are actually &quot;freer&quot; from a data ownership perspective).')
