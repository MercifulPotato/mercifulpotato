The 24h IP reset sounds more likely, but don&#x27;t discount the microwave, they typically use the 2.4 GHz frequency (as do bluetooth and some wifi networks of course). So, if the 24h IP reset isn&#x27;t it, try switching to a 5 GHz wifi network to see if the same dropout occurs. If that solves it, it could be a nearby microwave oven.')
