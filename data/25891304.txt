Item(by='FabHK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611489151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25889571, text='You’re completely correct that Republicans fret and complain about the deficit when a Democrat president is in office and social spending and aid for the poor is concerned, and then turn around and institute huge gratuitous tax cuts when they’re in power (the deficit be damned), and empirically increase the deficit more than Democrat presidents.<p>I’d call that hypocrisy though, not principled and appropriate Keynesianism. Remember for example the opposition to the Obama stimulus after the financial crisis, which promptly resulted in a stimulus package that was too small and needlessly slowed recovery, followed by Trump’s tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.<p>Keynes calls for anti cyclical spending, not indiscriminate one.')
