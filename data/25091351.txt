Until like 2 years ago, I used to travel long distance nearly every week, often all the way across germany.<p>The problem is not the ICE or high speed rail connectivity, the problems arise at the edges, when you need to switch over and travel the last few miles. For example, I used to travel from Berlin to Hamburg for on-site work. The leg from Berlin to Hamburg was faster than the connection from Hamburg Main to the client site.<p>Certainly, there’s delays, but I’ve done the same trip by car and it constantly took longer than by train, I had very few trips where I didn’t end up caught in a traffic jam somewhere on the autobahn. There’s a bit of a perception problem: nobody notices if you’re late by five minutes if traveling by car because no one has such an exact expectation for car travel.<p>Delays in train travel also have a problem that is exacerbated by the timetables of the DB: In an attempt to make travel times seem shorter, there’s often insufficient buffer at places where you need to change, so that a few minutes of delay will result in an hour of layover. Combine that with lack of maintenance on the rails and you get unfavorable results.<p>None of the problems would be solved by hyper loop or any other technology. It’s a result of misaligned incentives.<p>Still, with all the things wrong in planning, maintenance and political incentives around it, high speed rail still is the best way to travel medium and long distance.')
