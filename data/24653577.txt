You will need to be very proficient with C++ and be willing to work on AI Framework Internals (PyTorch, Tensorflow), A.I Compilers (LLVM&#x2F;MLIR) and&#x2F;or very large scale HPC systems. You need to be able to work remotely indefinitely given the current state of affairs we will not return to the office until everyone feels safe doing so.<p>You: Self starter and mostly importantly a finisher - pick something up and deliver without supervision.
