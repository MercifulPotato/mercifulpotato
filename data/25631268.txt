The majority of shareholder ownership in Google is held by wealthy non-employees, who probably didn’t want a leftist culture.<p>Is it the executives? Seeing as unionisation probably reduces their power and their pay, they probably didn’t want it.<p>Is it the rank-and-file engineers? These people tend to be left of centre, and the younger ones are likely quite socially progressive, but anti-capitalist? Not many. Seems wrong to generalise that they want a leftist culture.')
