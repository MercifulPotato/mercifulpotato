I would expect to see 5nm Ryzen before 3nm Apple Silicon.<p>There&#x27;s also a major question about what happens with Intel. If they ever get their process advantage back then it&#x27;s not clear what Apple&#x27;s response is. But if they implode then AMD takes over the PC market and probably becomes TSMC&#x27;s biggest customer, which could put them in a position to get on newer nodes at the same time as Apple.')
