From that, I decided it&#x27;d be cool to turn it into a game, so I built out a drawing&#x2F;guessing game from there and got it up on a domain I&#x27;d been sitting on for a while (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.multiplayer.com.au&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.multiplayer.com.au&#x2F;</a>)<p>It&#x27;s got some mild polish on it now, but there&#x27;s still a lot of scenarios where disconnects&#x2F;reconnects or generally unexpected behaviour can break the current game room. One of my goals this year is to address all the remaining bugs, add some more UI polish, then look into working on bots to seed a single game room because right now if you land on the game and no one else playing, you&#x27;re met with a &quot;please wait for another player to join&quot; screen. This essentially means that it&#x27;s BYO friends for the most part right now.<p>Later in the year when the current game has been fully-baked, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll come up with some other random idea to try and it&#x27;ll end up as another half-baked game to put up there.')
