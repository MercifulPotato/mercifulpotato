Small time creators or others ineligible for the Youtube &quot;partner program&quot; have no choice <i>but</i> to monetize outside of Youtube. With this change, the only way you as a creator can choose whether ads appear on your video is to make partner.<p>The scummy thing here is that Youtube has made it harder and harder for creators to become eligible to monetize their channels, and now they&#x27;re swooping in to take 100% of the ad revenue on those small-time channels.')
