Unfortunately the official software is not available for Linux which prevents me from switching to Linux on my corporate machine. I know there is a plugin for Pidgin to use Lync. I wonder if anybody tried to use it long enough to tell if it is good enough. I know that the official Mac client is much less stable then the Windows one.')
