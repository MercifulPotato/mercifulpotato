Compared to control (HIIT-like), HIIT reduced risk by 1.7% while moderate intensity training increased it by 1.2%. The overall mortality in the control group was 4.7%. For a controlled trial, that seems like a large number of participants (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), they just were too healthy ;-)<p>I assume the significance problem is inherent to studies looking at mortality as the outcome is very binary and can take a long time to manifest. As an effect on all-cause mortality can be seen as the ultimate metric of how healthy something is, it&#x27;s probably still worth it to investigate. In this case, they made it quite difficult for themselves by comparing active people to other active people.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that they made other observations during the study that are or will be published separately.')
