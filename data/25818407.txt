A large number of Japanese recipe are highly homecook-able especially for Japanese people living in Japan, who probably already have the right tools&#x2F;ingredients. It all depends on what you usually shelf at home.<p>In fact, even as I live in US, I find it easier and quicker to cook Japanese food rather than Chinese or western food. When I&#x27;m tired or in a hurry, Japanese recipe is my go to choice.')
