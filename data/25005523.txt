You&#x27;re likely committing future generations to using last-gen (or worse) tech because upgrades are expensive and there&#x27;s no local competition to nudge the provider to upgrade.<p>The other argument is simple politics: If the city owns&#x2F;controls the pipes, there will be a contingent of voters that want to control content (say, pornography) and a contingent of politicians ready to accommodate them. All of which flies wholly in the face of First Amendment protections covering how the government can(&#x27;t) regulate speech.<p>The combination of cries from the public and very limited options will make this a political briar patch after a few cities stub their toes on high-profile cases.')
