I don&#x27;t like changing my phone too much, so I use it until the battery only is good for a 10 minute call or a day without calls, or one of my kids drop the phone and it gets broken.<p>So I change it probably every three years, and sometimes my wife use the new phone and I use her old phone. (She use the phone more than me.)<p>One possibility is that the manufactures add more batteries, but it makes the phone more expensive and heavy, and it doesn&#x27;t solve the accidents by the kids.')
