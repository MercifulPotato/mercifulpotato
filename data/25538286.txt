Even though some people might share &#x27;their mother died&#x27; and surely everyone would be nice about it ... it is absolutely not the place for that.<p>There is no doubt everyone loves to be asked these question on some level, and it&#x27;s certain fine to do between colleagues when frankly it&#x27;s more sincere.<p>But in a &#x27;group&#x2F;managerial setting&#x27; this exercise become cultish, expectant and oddly insincere.<p>In particular, the more intimate, the more likely people have to &#x27;gel&#x27; deeply on cultural issues, and if they don&#x27;t, there will be problems.<p>These are the people to talk most of &#x27;diversity&#x27; but they end up being the &#x27;least diverse&#x27; groups in terms of interest and ethos.<p>On some level - they are <i>designers</i> who generally tend to be a kind of &#x27;specific type&#x27; of person, and I&#x27;m sure many&#x2F;most of them would be fine with it, but I&#x27;m also doubtful of the level of self awareness.<p>The alternative - abrupt but highly productive meetings might leave people feeling cold; &#x27;dispassion&#x27; all the time can feel that way. So I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but maybe something less formal like &#x27;shared meals&#x27; where people just naturally engage in a more classically informal setting, on their own terms, would work.<p>I worked at a place that had &#x27;free lunch&#x27; with a presentation every Wednesday, it turned out to be a great way to meet and chat with random people.<p>&#x27;People like to be Productive&#x27;<p>What I&#x27;ve found, is that almost all professionals actually love to do their jobs, to the extent they can do them. What &#x27;we hate&#x27; is bureaucracy and &#x27;things in our way&#x27; - but people love to talk about (and do!) their work and are eager to &#x27;complete&#x27; if they feel their work will be used.<p>What would be a great &#x27;follow up&#x27; to this, is more on the mechanics of actual process, and how new projects and details are shepherded through the system.<p>Is everyone working from spreadsheets? Atlassian tools?<p>How do people feel about working out of a &#x27;ticket system&#x27; all of the time.<p>How much time is given to learning, exploring?<p>What&#x27;s the breakdown between panic fixes, ongoing work, new projects?<p>What&#x27;s the team balance there?<p>How do they work directly with Eng., where are the hurdles?<p>How do they document and record stuff (because that seems to be a byzantine thing everywhere I&#x27;ve worked).')
