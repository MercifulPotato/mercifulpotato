Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25739989, 25745942, 25741098], score=None, time=1610406556, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738187, text='Most of those old password-length &quot;time to crack&quot; estimates are based on a single machine. Many of the common ones you see today are based on the added assumption that they aren&#x27;t spraying directly at a password endpoint but are instead predicated on breaking the hashes and the extra (increasingly minimal in the age of Bitcoin) cycles needed to hash&#x2F;salt&#x2F;pepper the passwords and&#x2F;or building rainbow tables.<p>I believe that the password spray capabilities of today&#x27;s botnets on any endpoint that returns results as fast as network messages travel should not be underestimated in a distributed enough attack. Given that not-varying the password length had a noticeable impact on time, the warnings from my email providers, and other increasingly paranoid measures I&#x27;ve taken [0], I have no reason to suspect that this anything but a very distributed password spray attack.<p>Simple GitHub searches seem to indicate that there are known password spray capable Steam endpoints that currently still leak password correctness&#x2F;verification data regardless of 2FA enabled (and also leak whether or not 2FA is enabled on the account) and always falls back to email-based 2FA. (These leaks and that fall back would have me believe it&#x27;s one of the Password Recovery or 2FA Recovery endpoints.) Though I&#x27;ve not attempted to run such gists&#x2F;&quot;utility libraries&quot; myself to verify (I&#x27;m too lawful neutral&#x2F;not a black hat whatsoever), at a surface level it seems like more than enough evidence to suggest botnets would use such things if enough people were posting &quot;helpful password recovery tools&quot; on GitHub that password spray accounts you tell it to.<p>[0] The paranoia has gotten quite &quot;fun&quot;:<p>- I only ever sign in to Steam now inside the Steam client and Steam Mobile app.<p>- I disabled all OAuth applications on my account, no longer sign in under any web browser, and have refused to allow new applications.<p>- I&#x27;ve removed all devices except my primary gaming desktop and mobile device.<p>- I&#x27;ve removed all credit card data that I can and haven&#x27;t bought or paid for anything directly in the Steam client in years.<p>- There&#x27;s evidence that password hashes used to be leaked from a file in the Steam client&#x27;s folder. (I believe that file no longer exists in recent Steam clients, at least.) For that reason, I&#x27;ve turned on Windows Controlled Folder Access (aka Windows Ransomware Protection) on all of my Steam folders. This has been an amazing bundle of joy~ and has basically stopped me from playing Steam games. Games are developed by children and it is <i>amazing</i> the number of entry point binaries a single game might have to run, how often even &quot;offline only&quot; games still want to run binaries they copy or bury in random places in %LocalAppData% or worse %Temp%. The whack-a-mole to enable games to run under Controlled Folder Access becomes its own very not fun minigame before you can actually start the real game. (It&#x27;s also really interesting to see what some games do when they fail to get folder access they just assume they&#x27;ll always have. So many permutations of &quot;the game works but crashes at weird points&quot; or &quot;the game thinks it is running on a Mac for stupid reasons&quot; or &quot;the game thinks you intentionally want to run it without the ability to save or load saves, because that&#x27;s a thing people might do?&quot;.)<p>My paranoia suggests my next steps are only to isolate Steam to its own entirely separate user account on the machine and&#x2F;or its own unique VPN.<p>My basic threat modeling assumes if they were compromising anything specific outside of Steam, they&#x27;d have compromised my email accounts already.<p>At this point it increasingly feels like the only reason I keep Steam installed is to reset the password every time I get a Steam Guard email.')
