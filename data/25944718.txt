It&#x27;s a terrible predatory practice that is not just gambling, but also creating artificial risk that does not correspond to the value being created from such transactions. This can easily collapse the entire market as we already saw in 2008 and many times before.<p>The sooner we prohibit these terrible exploitative practices (lending money with interest being the first to go), the better and stronger and more fair the economy will become.
