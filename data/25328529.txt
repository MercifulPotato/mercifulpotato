Firstly, Apple has access to better chip technology. That gives them extra room and extra speed for free (actually, for a lot of dollars)<p>Secondly, AFAIK, nobody has attempted something similar with a different CPU. It is possible (but IMHO not likely), that a similar approach as the M1 (optimize a system , not individual chips), but with x64 (or x86, or MIPS, or RISC-V) would outperform the ARM version.<p>“Desktop-class” is a moving target, so if that were the case, the M1 wouldn’t be called desktop class anymore.')
