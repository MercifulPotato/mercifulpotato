To concatenate strings we only create new nodes and refer to the old nodes. You don&#x27;t even need to read what&#x27;s in the existing nodes! The essential fast-path of building up a template is write-only with bump-allocation into the extremely well-managed TLAB. No reading required. That&#x27;s why it works so well.<p>Yes traversing the tree means writing it out is a little slower, but that&#x27;s one small part at the end, with good pre-fetching opportunities.')
