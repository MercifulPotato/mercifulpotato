Item(by='soupson', descendants=None, kids=[25406277], score=None, time=1607714028, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383186, text='&gt;People cannot be trusted with computers. They install everything that crosses their path.<p>I think this is a point that people who advocate for breaking down the walls of the Apple garden don&#x27;t adequately consider. The iPhone is not really comparable to the desktop computer you could do whatever you want with in the 1990s. It&#x27;s basically an extension of the person, with all their bank, emails, locations, web history. To make it a truly &quot;open&quot; platform, it would open its users -- who trust them -- to these kinds of problems, and would need to somehow solve them for those customers in a way that doesn&#x27;t run afoul of the &quot;open&quot; aspect that people demand.  That&#x27;s a tightrope that becomes very difficult to walk when the headlines read &quot;Apple app let hackers steal bank details, enable widespread fraud.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t matter that it wasn&#x27;t an Apple app. It doesn&#x27;t matter that that App was downloaded on a 3rd party App Store. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the user tapped through a dialog that said &quot;This is a third party app that doesn&#x27;t have Apple&#x27;s protections on it, be careful!&quot; Those are all nuances that are lost in that headline.<p>It&#x27;s asking Apple to risk the privacy of their users <i>and</i> their business profits, so that people can have marginally cheaper apps.<p>I think the only way forward, really, is the model where smaller developers don&#x27;t have to pay a fee until they reach $1m in sales. That tiered approach seems reasonable; after all, there&#x27;s no reason to let huge developers off the hook for paying their fair share to keep the system running.')
