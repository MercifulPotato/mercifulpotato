Given the protein structure, you can predict which molecules will bind with it, even for molecules which have never been sythesized. Many protein targets have not been amenable to this because we don&#x27;t know what the potential binding pockets look like. That set of proteins will now drastically shrink. We&#x27;re going to have a lot of new drug candidates, and with any luck new drugs, come out of this.')
