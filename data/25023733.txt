I think that probably removes any intelligent reference you could make to Romneycare, which was bipartisan and for a single state.<p>McConnell threatened to filibuster due to the inclusion of the individual mandate which was in Romneycare (and still exists today in the form of a tax[0]). This was part of McConnell&#x27;s strategy to prevent any democrat from doing <i>anything</i>, even things that have republican or popular support, even among republicans.<p>For example, while holding the majority, he prevents bills, which would pass on a floor vote, from getting that vote.<p>&gt; It was Pelosi. Her position was my bill or nothing.<p>IDK, it sounds like she found a deal with the President, and McConnell refused it. I&#x27;d also expect that, like I mentioned above, the relief bill the house passed would pass a floor vote in the senate, which is why McConnell would refuse to bring it to a vote. If anything, it sounds like he&#x27;s the one saying its his bill or nothing. Notably, you ignore the important point that McConnell also doesn&#x27;t want relief to take effect until next year. Yes McConnell claims to want relief, he also claims to want to repeal the ACA. He claims a lot of things for political reasons that he doesn&#x27;t actually want.<p>I&#x27;ve edited this post to address the (incorrect) response below.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;National_Federation_of_Indepen...</a>')
