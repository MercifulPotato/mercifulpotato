That said, this analysis overlooks the relationship between supply and demand on price and availability. Because housing is relatively supply inelastic a small increase in demand can drive large increases in prices.\nThat said I think it is a valid point that the current housing shortages in the US are caused by bigger forces than 100 billion dollar company. Long term policy initiatives at the local, state and federal level have all contributed to the skyrocketing cost of housing, and these should really be higher priority than hotel zoning reform.')
