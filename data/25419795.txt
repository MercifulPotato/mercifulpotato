This isn&#x27;t just about stakes&#x2F;skin in the game; It&#x27;s also about quality of the debate, and when someone has so much invested in the outcome that they won&#x27;t <i>allow</i> their position to lose, the quality wrt a free exchange of ideas, isn&#x27;t likely to happen.<p>In fact, most versions of this can&#x27;t be described as a debate at all. &quot;shut up and listen&quot; while being dictated to (without the right of reply) bears no similarities. This perspective is basically: &quot;certain people believe the wrong things, so shouldn&#x27;t discuss them; they should just be told what to think by the right people, and believe that.&quot;. If &quot;wrong-thinkers&quot; now want to debate amongst themselves without correction from self-appointed &quot;right-thinkers&quot;, is it any wonder, even <i>if</i> they valued diversity of opinion&#x2F;perspective?<p>&gt; consequences are something for &#x27;the other&#x27; to deal with<p>Can you give an example? There is a big difference between, say, the consequences of the <i>topic</i> of a discussion, and the consequences of the discussion itself.')
