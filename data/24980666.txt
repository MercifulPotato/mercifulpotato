Item(by='AlexandrB', descendants=None, kids=[24981049, 24981091], score=None, time=1604418373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24980468, text='&gt; Price controls will only result in low or no supply.<p>This gets trotted out again and again even though it doesn&#x27;t apply to the kind of price gouging we saw at the beginning of the pandemic. It wasn&#x27;t 3M raising prices, it was third parties buying up supply in bulk and then reselling at a higher price. This has no impact on supply, because the manufacturer is not seeing any increase in profit margin - it&#x27;s all going to parasitic rent seekers in the middle.')
