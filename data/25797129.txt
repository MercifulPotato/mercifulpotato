If I&#x27;m on the highway driving, or if I have to get somewhere in a hurry or it&#x27;s an urgent situation, I just cannot trust another platform.<p>One time my friend was driving and he asked me to navigate. The exit was coming up, meanwhile I&#x27;m stuck trying to get OSM+ to understand what rounte we are on. That was an unpleasant few minutes. Despite trying to stick with it, such moments kept coming up again and again. It made me realise that Maps is mission critical to me.<p>By contrast, Gmail was easy. Fastmail ftw, forward all google mail to it, and the fact that most of my email use is work email, which is on its own domain anyway.')
