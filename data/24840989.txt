Microsoft engaged in anti-competitive behavior to dissuade users from having alternative browsers installed -- which is similar to a shopping mall starting its own jewelry store to compete with outside jewelry stores renting space in the mall.   There are certain behaviors that are kosher, and there are certain behaviors that destroy competition in unsavory ways.  Ultimately, the illegality was not able to be shown, and Microsoft started a [not-so-good] trend of acquiring competition rather than dissuading its existence and adoption.  This is in some ways a lot worse than finding them guilty.')
