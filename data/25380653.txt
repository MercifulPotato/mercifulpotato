Inexpensive commodity goods like soap are frequently stolen because they are much easier to fence than expensive goods, since everyone needs them including poor people. Poor people can&#x27;t afford to buy expensive stolen goods, and non-poor people don&#x27;t buy fenced goods generally. Non-perishable household commodities are among the most liquid stolen goods to sell, so that is what people steal.<p>I&#x27;ve seen (obviously stolen) soap being peddled by apparently homeless addicts on multiple occasions. In some locales, they&#x27;ve been locking up the soap for a long time.')
