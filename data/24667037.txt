It&#x27;s a common time for seasonal allergies to present themselves (I&#x27;m dealing with them right now), and colds and flu tend to start spreading around this time.<p>People, being the way they are these days, will see headlines like these whilst having a stuffy nose, then immediately freak out when they realize they can&#x27;t smell quite as well as normal. They won&#x27;t take in the nuances of what it&#x27;s like to lose their taste senses due to COVID versus other causes.<p>Regardless of how intentional these outcomes are, the media are well aware of the risks and are being rather cruel - not to mention, careless - for engaging in these practices.<p>That person who freaked out with the stuffy nose is now more at risk of catching COVID by forcing themselves to go to a testing location unnecessarily, thereby increasing their chances of exposure. Not a productive outcome at all.')
