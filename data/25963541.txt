Do the electrons move slower in the ACH network? I make a request to purchase, the funds availability in my account are verified, the withdrawl is requested, then, waiting, waiting, waiting. Why? This is the area I would love to see &quot;distrupted&quot;. Force the banks to honor the requests in order they are received (not in the order they choose that is most lucrative to the bank). If a transfer request comes in for a value greater than my account has, decline the transfer.')
