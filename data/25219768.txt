DNSSEC requires additional infrastructure, especially for key rotation. Yes, it&#x27;s not that hard (I set it up for the domains that I control) but it&#x27;s also not just a record that you can set once and forget. It is beyond unsreasonable for widespread DNSSEC support from domains when browsers have been dragging their feet for years. There needs to be an actual benefit that comes with setting up DNSSEC <i>before</i> most will do it.')
