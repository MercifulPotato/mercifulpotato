When I first dual booted Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows as a middle schooler or so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to figure it out even with this article&#x27;s help, it doesn&#x27;t go into rich enough detail. But it&#x27;s also not a great abstract of the process either because it doesn&#x27;t explain what it tells you to do. Ultimately there are better resources.')
