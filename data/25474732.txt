There is no experiment to determine this. The &quot;facts&quot; of quantum have this weird disconnect with reality.<p>If you have access to many <i>copies</i> of the same state, then you can do tomography to learn if the state is entangled or not. But this is a different situation to what you are asking in your question. Actually I&#x27;m not entirely sure what your question is asking, but I won&#x27;t delete this comment just yet.')
