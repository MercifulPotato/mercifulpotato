Similarly bizarre are the signs at the parking lot entrance that act similarly.<p>I&#x27;ll take that one further! Every street that enters the city I live in, has a sign with text that you&#x27;ll only be able to read if you park your car, get out, and walk up to it. I&#x27;ve lived here 5 years and I still don&#x27;t know what the heck those signs say lol. My guess is it&#x27;s something about parking enforcement? Sigh. It&#x27;s completely absurd lol.')
