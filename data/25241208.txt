This pre-supposes there&#x27;s an external universe with exact conditions that produces our experiences, but there&#x27;s no way to distinguish this possiblity from other possibilities (like a multiverse, for instance.) This lack of ability to distinguish, in my ontology, makes the distinction meaningless. Yours may differ.')
