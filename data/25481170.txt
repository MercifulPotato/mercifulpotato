Item(by='nirv', descendants=None, kids=[25484088], score=None, time=1608411743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='The Cyberpunk 2077 game is already amazing in terms of art direction, level design and story wise. I would also argue that the game is excellent in terms of graphics, although it has massive issues with performance. In my opinion, in addition to a lots bugs, at the moment the weakest aspects of the game are the complete lack of NPC AI, as well as some emptiness in the game world outside of story and other quests. The latter is understandable, there is room for multiple updates in the future, without affecting the storyline, including massive online multiplayer game mode.<p>As for poor, or rather the lack of, AI and NPC behavior was mentioned as a &quot;bug&quot; that will be fixed at a recent CDPR board meeting. In 2018 CDPR were advertising full day cycle AI system for all NPCs in game. The promise was not fulfilled. At the moment there is simply no AI, like it&#x27;s 2003 again. Including awful police spawns behind player&#x27;s back with no vehicle chase.<p>However, users reported that rare glimpse of intelligence does exist in the game, perhaps through an oversight, e.g. police is actually able to chase player in a car[1] (for a short distance though), and some NPCs can actually be found in unusual places[2]. We don&#x27;t know for sure, but it&#x27;s believed that CDPR hastily trimmed all of the NPC and vehicle AI in the game. If so, we can only guess for what purpose. Maybe they didn&#x27;t have time to polish it for the mandatory release date on December 10, or perhaps older consoles weren&#x27;t able to process it. However, in its current shape NPC AI is at the level of AAA games from 15 years back (GTA: San Andreas), not to mention the CDPR&#x27;s own Witcher 3. In fact, it is so awful that it is even good: it gives hope that AI system will get significantly overhauled with one of the game&#x27;s upcoming updates (two major updates are expected in 2021Q1).<p>Nothing of that prevented me from enjoying this amazing game for 100+ hours with great pleasure. I haven&#x27;t been as excited about a videogame as a kid since 2004, when Half Life 2[3] was released.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W-OZqwjzNas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=W-OZqwjzNas</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LowSodiumCyberpunk&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kewbai&#x2F;the_one_romance_option_everyone_wishes&#x2F;gg511oi&#x2F;?context=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;LowSodiumCyberpunk&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kewbai&#x2F;...</a><p>[3] The Prey (2017) was an unexpected gem which I fell in love with, but I had zero hype since I didn&#x27;t know anything about the game beforehand.
