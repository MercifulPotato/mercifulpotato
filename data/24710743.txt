The cool thing about QUIC also, is the ability to &#x27;lower down&#x27; to the UDP layer and skip the control and encryption protocol if you need it. (I just dont know if they will extend this feature to the application level).<p>WebRTC is SRTP with UDP have hole punching et al. if you want so use UDP but with a whole problems of the UDP approach P2P world already taken care of.<p>WebSockets works over plain TCP.<p>QUIC is the more advanced of the protocols and it will probably &quot;take over the world&quot; with time, but it has yet to prove itself.<p>It probably can be a good fit to the cases where the WebRTC is being used for, but i dont now if Chrome will be ambitious enough to let developers mess with the building blocks of QUIC. If not, it will just become a sink to HTTP3 (a no small feat anyway).')
