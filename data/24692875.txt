No one (including lawyers I know) wants lawyers; but a world-with-lawyers is better than a world-without-lawyers.  Doctors: why do you go to the doctor?  To <i></i>improve<i></i> your body?  Almost never; it&#x27;s always to reduce problems or prevent them, a cost you only incur because of the fallibility of your body.  Sales people: imperfect information in society.  Police: lovely folks; would be much better if we didn&#x27;t have people being assholes so that we needed <i>police</i>.<p>Then add in all of the secondary effects of exploitation&#x2F;corruption of these not-productive-and-shouldn&#x27;t-exist positions...<p>Further for every $1 you spend on an attorney, someone else has to spend $$ and the society has wasted that $$$ plus that time, none of which is productive.<p>On the other hand, get rid of lawyers and you&#x27;re going to spend $$$ on mercenaries...')
