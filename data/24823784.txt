Mattress industry in the US is a scam. Yes, you should invest in a good mattress. But a good mattress doesn&#x27;t need to cost $8000. Just get a simple, relatively firm mattress. Mine is a simple $120 spring mattress from Amazon, and those are the best I&#x27;ve had. (Also reviews from other people who slept on it and used more expensive ones).')
