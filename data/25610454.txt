Only that which is relevant.<p>Suppose we count both separately, research citations and review citations, the latter for your great review papers or even if people just want to reference the lit review section of your research paper. What would happen to the incentive? I suggest that reviews would be less incentivized as people would primarily be concerned with rating researchers according to their research citations. Just like no one cares about your textbook sales, popular though it may be for introductory uses. This would imply reviews were not &quot;honest&quot; citations but are done to hack the metric.')
