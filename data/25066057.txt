This is literally how every notification message that you do not ever accept in to your browser gets delivered.<p>This also highlights the core missing WTF, which is that the server can PUSH a resource, but there is no way for the client page to tell. 5 years latter, we&#x27;ve talked &amp; talked &amp; talked about it[2], but no one has done a damned fucking thing. Useless fucking awful biased development. PUSH gets to be used by the high &amp; mighty. But it&#x27;s useless to regular web operators, because no one cares about making the feature usable.<p>Now that the fuckwads can declare it&#x27;s not useful, they&#x27;re deleteing it. From the regular web. But not from Web Push Notifications. Which will keep using PUSH. In a way that websites have never been afforded.<p>You&#x27;d think that if a resource got pushed, we could react to it. These !@#$@#$ have not allowed that to happen. They have denial of serviced the web, made this feature inflexible. Sad. So Sad.<p>Even without the reacting to push, it seems obvious that there&#x27;s just more work to do. That we haven&#x27;t made progress in 3 years just seems like infantile terrible perception of time, of what the adoption curve looks like. A decade for critical serious change to start to take root is fine. The expectation for progress &amp; adoption is way out of whack.<p>So so sad. Everything is so wrong. You can&#x27;t just unship the web like this. You need to support the HTTP features we agreed we wanted to create. None of this is happening. I hate what has happened to PUSH so bad. This is so critically terribly mismanaged, the browsers standards groups have fucked this up so so so bad, done so little, had such attrocious mismanagement of what the IETF wanted to do. It&#x27;s embarassing. We are terrible, we have screwed the pooch so bad on this so many times, &amp; pulling the plug is a colossal fuck up of unbelievable proportions, fucking up a very basic promise that we ought have made for the web, the ability to push things, that never got delivered in to any useful ability on the web to do anything about it. Fuck up, 1000000x fuck up, just fucking shit balls terrible work everyone.<p>This one issue causes severe doubt in humanity for me. This is a fucked up terrible thing for all humanity, for the web. I can&#x27;t believe we were so terrible at this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;push-notifications&#x2F;web-push-protocol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;fundamentals&#x2F;push-notifica...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whatwg&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;issues&#x2F;65" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;whatwg&#x2F;fetch&#x2F;issues&#x2F;65</a>')
