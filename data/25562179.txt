Thanks to the RER train system even far away suburbs, with cheap or cheapish housing aren&#x27;t that far away - e.g. i have colleagues with houses ( with big yards and two stories) in the 200k euros range south of Paris, in fancy-ish suburbs, and are 40-50 minutes from the office ( i live in a suburb right next to the city and i travel entirely by subway, and it takes me 50 minutes, because the subway is much slower).<p>Depending on what you want though, it can indeed be very expensive - e.g. if you want an apartment in the city to profit from the night life ( after 1am the transport to the suburbs is only with buses and much slower), it is going to be very expensive to buy.<p>And that&#x27;s just for &quot;regular&quot; people. Each city in France is required to have a minimum percentage of social housing, to which you can have access ( including to buy) if you&#x27;re below a certain threshold of income ( so on minimum wage, you&#x27;re there).')
