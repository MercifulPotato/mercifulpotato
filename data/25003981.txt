Now I&#x27;m at another company and we do it here as well. I&#x27;m not a fan of it, but having someone else write up your review sounds like a wonderful dream.<p>The way I see it, you write your review, it goes up the management chain, they get to pick and choose what they agree with and now they have evidence since you admitted to doing it (or not, if it&#x27;s missing in your self-eval), and then come back and justify why you get the bonus&#x2F;raise or not using your own statements. Anyway, off-topic for this post.')
