Refactoring old stuff you don&#x27;t like so the code base is &quot;nice&quot;, which incidentally introduces 100 bugs that didn&#x27;t need to exist, pushes deadlines back cause someone has to fix those bugs, and loses customer confidence to the point that investors and customers don&#x27;t care anymore and then you have no one to build for (but at least your code base is nice and scale-able, to bad 10 x 0 customers is still 0).<p>I&#x27;ve seen more issues because of nonsense like that, or people insisting that code should be DRY and making ridiculous mental contortions in the name of a three letter acronym, or personal taste (the amount of fashion in software development is insane) but I&#x27;ve yet to see a project truly fail because someone cobbled something together quickly, and introduced tech debt. So far anyways.')
