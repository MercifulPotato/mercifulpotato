I never liked playing FPS games with people. Wolfenstein 3D was an exception because the people were pixelated nazis. Doom and Cube&#x2F;Sauerbraten were also ok because the player killed monsters.<p>Microchip Corp. is an actual business. They make cool stuff like the PIC MCUs used for building useful things such as a HVAC thermostat. They&#x27;re not General Atomics or Lockheed Martin who make drones used for killing people.')
