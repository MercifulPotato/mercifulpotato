I replaced it in my workstation&#x2F;gaming PC last year and demoted my 4670k to a home server, but now that I have a home server I&#x27;ve found an increasing number of things to do on it and it has trouble keeping up with transcoding video to multiple watchers, or simply writing to my LUKS raid 5. Been considering a second 3900x for it for a while, but with these gains I&#x27;ve bought a 5900x for my workstation and will put my current 3900x in the server.')
