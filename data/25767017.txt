It&#x27;s about the lowest possible energy expenditure to erase one bit of information (or irreversibly destroy it by performing a logical operation).  The principle comes about from reasoning about entropy loss in said situations.  There&#x27;s a hypothesized fundamental connection between information and entropy manifest in physical law.  The idea is that if you destroy one possible state of a system, you have reduced the entropy of that system, so the 2nd law of thermodynamics implies that you must increase the entropy of the universe somewhere else by at least that amount.  This can be used to say how much energy the process must take as soon as you choose a particular temperature.<p>This applies to any irreversible computation.<p>IMO, The fact that it&#x27;s only 38x the minimum is MIND BLOWING.')
