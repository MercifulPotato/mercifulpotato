Language is a massive barrier and simply hand-waving that away by claiming that internationalisation is cheap is silly. Language drives a whole host of things and operating in several languages is far from easy. You are also being <i>very</i> generous with claiming that most folks in Europe are bilingual. They may have basic knowledge of multiple languages but can likely function fully in only one. The generations below 30 are likely to be almost completely bilingual. Look at Belgium for example. How many Flemish people can function in French and vice versa?<p>The fact that the US operates entirely with the global lingua franca is a gigantic advantage that can crush competition before it even begins.<p>The unified marketplace is one problem but look at what has already been done - EU labour is free to move. Degrees are almost always mutually recognised. What stops further integration? It ultimately boils down to language. This is why a Greek doctor can&#x27;t just move to Germany. Also why a Spanish lawyer can&#x27;t easily move to Sweden. Language is a much bigger problem than people here seem to think.')
