Specifically I think everyone should be thought about:<p>- cryptography basics<p>- how the web works (cookies, JavaScript etc.)<p>- how email works (MTA&#x2F;MDA&#x2F;MUA responsibilities, OpenPGP, S&#x2F;MIME, maybe also SPF&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;DMARC)<p>- TCP&#x2F;IP basics<p>- how computers and operating systems generally work and execute programs<p>Though I&#x27;m not suggesting we should replace other subjects with IT.')
