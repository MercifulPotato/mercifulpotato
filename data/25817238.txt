We&#x27;re trying to get rid of around half of our stuff and almost all of it has been going to the Buy Nothing group. It&#x27;s been fantastic. So many things I&#x27;ll say &quot;just throw that out&quot;, my wife will say &quot;Nope, someone will want it!&quot; She posts it on the group, rolls a die to decide who among the replies gets it, puts it out on the front porch and it&#x27;s gone the next day.<p>We&#x27;ve gotten a ton of stuff from the group as well. A big thing is, as someone else mentioned, stuff for children. For example in our group there&#x27;s been a package of accessories going around for a 1 year old&#x27;s birthday party. When our daughter turned 1 we got the package, threw her a birthday party, then passed it along to the next person. We&#x27;ve gotten lots of toys from the group, and when we find that our daughter doesn&#x27;t care for a toy anymore we pass it back to the group.<p>The only problem with it of course is that it requires Facebook. I deleted my account a long time ago and have Facebook blocked from all my devices but my wife keeps it around largely for the Buy Nothing group. I wish there was a way to participate without Facebook.')
