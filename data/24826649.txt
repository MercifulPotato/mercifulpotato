I believe this article mentions using manure and organic fertilizers.<p>I&#x27;m no expert, but you cannot maintain a healthy soil without putting stuff back in it - manure, biomass &#x2F; mulch, etc.<p>Anecdotal and incomparable, but my backyard (just a few m2 of exposed soil) has had an overhaul in the past year or two; it was very sandy and kinda boring, but mixing in mulch &#x2F; soil improver made it a lot better. There&#x27;s worms in the soil now, that kinda thing.<p>But yeah, you need some kind of fertilizer or the soil will just &#x27;die&#x27;. Leave the clippings after harvesting, yeet a load of other biomass on there in between harvests, let it lie fallow, etc.')
