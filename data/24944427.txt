Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604077903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942446, text='I&#x27;ve seen videos about this case on and off. Some of the things that seem particularly problematic for Billy&#x27;s case are the conflict of interest in the fact that moderators were able to post records, the shady record trail for the DK run (only &quot;seen&quot; by one said moderator, who later was found to cheat, and the proof tape subsequently &quot;disappearing&quot;), and a claim that a run was done in real hardware despite video proof showing glitches that only happen in MAME (an emulator). He made claims that said video was adulterated after the fact without his knowledge, but hasn&#x27;t provided any evidence for that claim (nor is it particularly believable that anyone would go through the trouble to do so).<p>There&#x27;s also some surrounding circumstantial videos where Billy originally claims to change an arcade machine circuit board to a different game board in a very theatrical video, but then is called out for merely putting the same board back in (one can verify by looking at the circuit boards and cross-referencing with verified images of each alleged board), casting doubts into his motivations and general credibility.<p>There are also cracks in his main line of argument (decks and decks of &quot;signed testimonials&quot; from people who allegedly witnessed him doing the runs). Some of those witnesses have later come out claiming to having misrepresented, and would likely testify to that effect if ever called to stand.<p>Personally, I agree with the sentiment of the vast majority of the community that Billy is likely a cheat and that he sees this whole thing as &quot;defamation&quot; merely because it is a threat to his income model of milking sponsorships etc through his fame. I don&#x27;t particularly see this as a good use of the courts&#x27; time, especially given how &quot;productive to society&quot; the monetary impact is here, but alas, he does have a right to pursue whatever crazy suit he wants if a judge hasn&#x27;t thrown out his case.')
