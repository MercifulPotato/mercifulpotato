To many of us that moved on from Linux on the desktop, the combination of a stable&#x2F;uniform&#x2F;attractive desktop environment with a Unix core that had great developer documentation -no longer the case!- and nicely-designed APIs was too much to resist. Unfortunately, the push towards consumers and Apple&#x27;s increasingly one-sided my-way-or-the-highway approach (fueled by security concerns that to me are completely irrelevant, if not a huge annoyance and waste of time) means that a lot of us oldschool Unix hackers were left out in the cold.<p>I don&#x27;t plan to upgrade past Mojave and at some point in the future I will move back to Linux.')
