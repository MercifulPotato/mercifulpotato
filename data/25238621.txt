I think in general non-rigid is surely more conducive to a good fit.<p>I have an FFP3 (~N99) one from some DIY pre-pandemic (so cheap, good luck even finding it now! I do wonder what tradesmen who need them for workplace safety, but their work isn&#x27;t medical, are doing at the moment) - it isn&#x27;t rigid and fits well.<p>It is used and &#x27;not reusable&#x27;, but I&#x27;m hanging on to it. If I &#x27;have to&#x27; travel or something at some point I figure used FFP3 beats piece of loose-fitting cloth.')
