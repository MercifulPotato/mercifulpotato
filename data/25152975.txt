Covid is yet another disease that&#x27;s going to take away a certain (small!) fraction of the population, for little fault other than being born with the wrong genetic makeup. Given the extreme infectiousness, everybody is going to get it within a span of a few years. Those that will die, will die. Most will survive. Life goes on. Covid is nothing new, 100 years ago, before antibiotics, pneumonia was significantly more deadly, and yet here we are. The answer to death is birth, not cowering in a basement.<p>The astute reader will retort &#x27;BUT VACCINES&#x27;. This deserves a special note. The cold logic of natural selection is that descendants of organisms naturally resistant to disease inherit the Earth. We can supplant disease resistance with artificial means, of which vaccines are amazingly effective. To a point. Beyond which we realize that we&#x27;ve inadvertently cultivated a debilitated fragile population that can <i>only</i> survive through sophisticated technological methods. Any disruption of the technological supply chains then brings swift and large scale catastrophe. Hoping that our Andaman and Amish brothers and sisters will still be around at the time of reckoning.<p>Let&#x27;s have a bit more charity. People worry and suffer and grieve like the rest of us. They just don&#x27;t surrender their lives, as short or long as they will end up being, to fear of a disease that, by now, it&#x27;s obviously not anywhere near as deadly as the Plague.')
