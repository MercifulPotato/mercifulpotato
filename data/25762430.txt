Because I <i>needed</i> one under my insurance plan I had to pay the full cost, over $3k. If I didn&#x27;t need one it would be a &quot;screening&quot; colonoscopy, and covered in full by the insurance.<p>Under what logic does that make sense, that you get insurance coverage for a procedure but only if you don&#x27;t really need it? Does it work like that anywhere outside of the U.S.?<p>The colonoscopy was completely clear. Two years later I was having constipation and bloating problems and went to a gastroenterologist. He examined me, asked a bunch of questions, and I asked for his advice. He said he really couldn&#x27;t tell me anything ... without a colonoscopy. The two year old one didn&#x27;t tell him enough, he said.<p>Now I&#x27;m supposed to drop another $3k, very likely for another clear test result, just to hear what the doctor says I should do about my constipation and bloating?<p>It felt like a scam. Instead of getting advice from a specialist M.D. I was driven to get it from the internet. And dang if it didn&#x27;t work. I went on a low-residue diet that resolved my digestive problems almost immediately and has had numerous other benefits. My diabetes is in complete remission, I&#x27;ve lost weight, etc. But when I asked the gastroenterologist if diet changes would help, his answer was short and simple: &quot;No.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m very happy to see far less expensive alternatives. One less leverage point for the health care system to empty my wallet.')
