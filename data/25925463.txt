It isn&#x27;t tangible, most code doesn&#x27;t do anything that has any direct effect other than through people interacting (if that) with the real world. It is a format of making that does not age well as most code fails after a few years, it&#x27;s all in your mind, and it never interfaces or have a texture outside of a screen or a keyboard. It doesn&#x27;t have the feeling of a true project.<p>My suggestion is to start tinkering with hardware. The feeling of accomplishing real world things - even if it&#x27;s just an LED blinking! Is extremely exciting for someone tired of only imagining physical processes and instead actually witnessing your code doing things in the real, physical, actual world.<p>I did this, and it opened a whole new world for me. I build robots from scratch, and I&#x27;ve turned it into my full time job. Even if most never go that far (hardware is hard! I don&#x27;t suggest it in most cases! ) it will still be the best decision you could make for your mental health.<p>Write some code, see it play out in the real world. Have fun with servos, motors, lights, vibration motors (my favorite, seeing them jump around) , and rekindle that child within you. You&#x27;ll love all forms of coding afterwards again, and you&#x27;ll build some cool stuff you can show your friends and family and be proud.<p>You could be a great hardware hacker in disguise, we need more of them in the world!')
