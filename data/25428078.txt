They are poorly translated and unpronounceable.<p>Yes, you would not make up these words just for the sake of speaking in German. We are not in the 30s any longer.<p>But no person in its right mind would speak German with 30% of the words “borrowed from english” because “all the other advantages of the German language outweigh borrowing so many english words”.<p>I love how people are downvoting me in their evening frustration about their lives - but yeah, if you miss like all the relevant vocabulary in a language why would you state that communicating in it is “smart of efficient”? There is no inherent reason. English has -for many fields- the best vocabulary. The english language does not get lost in four line sentences so easily like the German language and it’s not made up of 80 character words.<p>Have any of you ever read a German paper or textbook on a topic? Its awful. I love english textbooks I love english papers.')
