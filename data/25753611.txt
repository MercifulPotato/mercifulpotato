Most real world RSM deployments (Spanner, DynamoDB, etc) are composed of many separate RSMs one for each shard&#x2F;partition. The requisite performance is readily provided by the aggregate performance of these essentially independent RSMs. Don&#x27;t see any real situations where adding additional hardware to make a single RSM faster makes sense. Any ideas?')
