Item(by='knorker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611166828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844984, text='&gt; How about “the guy burning the person they are currently in a business relationship with without getting all the facts is wrong”. Or “a wrong by party A against party B does not justify a wrong by B against C.”<p>I don&#x27;t even know what you think are the actions people have been taking, to make you interpret things in a way to make you say that.<p>&gt; Er, nothing in Google’s story, even taken as gospel truth, indicates that either Gebru’s fact claims in this case were lies or that her speculations were unreasonable or inconsitent in her position given the observable facts.<p>It&#x27;s very damning that she chose to call out Jeff Dean as being the person who fired her.<p>Her manager was not a man. Her manager&#x27;s manager (who actually delivered the news) is not a man. The CEO is not white. She chose probably the ONLY person in her entire reporting chain who happens to be a white man (and in engineering circles famous), and she points to him and says &quot;He! He did this!&quot;.<p>And that&#x27;s just a start.<p>Face it, you don&#x27;t even have to read Google&#x27;s official account, much less believe it, without seeing that her story absolutely does not add up.<p>Even the headline does not match the content in any article about her.')
