Most of the fault of our copyright laws fall on Disney. And to be honest: I think it&#x27;s okay if Disney retains a near-perpetual copyright on Mickey Mouse, as they&#x27;re actively continuing to build on and produce content, and otherwise exploit that resource.<p>I am most irritated about copyright holding on abandoned works. If a book or game or movie is not republished, continued, redistributed, etc. by the copyright holder for a number of years, I feel like their copyright should expire so that others may do as they wish to copy and distribute and build on.<p>I think there&#x27;s a place a line could be drawn there: I feel Disney tends to use and continue and redistribute their assets for a very long time. If you want them, you can find them. I don&#x27;t feel like Conan Doyle&#x27;s estate should be able to basically copyright troll and just solicit license fees... if it was truly interested in maintaining control of Sherlock Holmes, it would be actively pursuing new stories from within itself, not just trying to tax people who create new content.')
