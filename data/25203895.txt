After being screwed over and passed over for multiple years, I feel like there&#x27;s no point in trying to climb the ladder. Why should I try to improve myself for the company&#x27;s benefit, especially if I&#x27;m not going to be rewarded? For reference, I&#x27;m a midlevel who has filled the role of senior and even tech lead.')
