Like in the story in the link, and more so in the movie &quot;Castaway&quot; there is a big difference to what you will undergo if you are saved in a reasonable timeframe and when you DON&#x27;T get saved within that timeframe or get saved at all.<p>If Tom Hanks in Castaway got saved in a month or two he would mostly dust himself off and have a GREAT story to tell.<p>But he didn&#x27;t and now he&#x27;s both kinda alive and not alive and kinda weird to himself and other people. Humans go through some weird stuff when hooked off civilization. Even within the civilization some people fall through the &quot;cracks&quot;. What those cracks are I do not know.<p>Resets are not for the faint of heart, and really shouldn&#x27;t be messed with.')
