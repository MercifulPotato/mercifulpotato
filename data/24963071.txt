In SA, WA, QLD, NT, we&#x27;ve had closed land borders between the states, with police at border crossings and points of entry to stop anybody trying to come in without a valid and allowed reason. This has prevented the cases from Vic and NSW from spreading to the other states, in much the same way that would occur in the European scenario you describe. It&#x27;s not impossible, it just takes the will of the people to accept a lack of freedom of movement.')
