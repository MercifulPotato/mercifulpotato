Due to imprecise measurements, it&#x27;s actually having a light fever. Flip note: C scales the same - 0 is the water freezing point, and then you have the same scaling as F but in 5s instead of 10s. [and you gotta remember: (f-2pow5)*5&#x2F;9].<p>That&#x27;s an old debate, yet if you are born&#x2F;used to C, F is pretty horrific.')
