It was considered the top Macbook alternative back in 2017-2018.  The design is good, but the parts are flimsy and the customer service is poor.<p>My wife and I both bought one:  me a 9360 and later her a 9370.<p>Around a year into using my laptop, the power button started to occasionally get stuck behind the case and turn off the computer.  After 3 years, it&#x27;s gotten so bad that this happens any time I close, open, or adjust the angle of the laptop screen.  The screws that hold the bottom of the case together tend to get loose, but the root cause of this problem is a crack in a metal part of the internals of the laptop that&#x27;s probably been there since day 1.  Currently, I&#x27;m using KDE Neon since Plasma gives a good warning when the power button is pressed.<p>Additionally, I had to replace the battery since after 2-3 years just outside of warranty, it went down from 10 hours to 45 minutes.<p>Dell Support refused to fix either of the issues.<p>You might think this is just a case of getting a lemon, but my wife&#x27;s 9370 had problems too.<p>The computer came with several keyboard keys not working.  Dell Support took over a month to ship a new one, and I spent forever on the phone with them figuring out why the repair was still &quot;processing&quot;.<p>Now after 2 years, the battery has started to swell and has cracked the outside of the case a little.  No luck from Dell Support getting this issue fixed.<p>Unless you buy a good support plan like many large companies do that have large amount of Dell Laptops for employees, I&#x27;d stay away from the brand.')
