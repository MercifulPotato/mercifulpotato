They cost less than a USB webcam and deliver much better image quality.<p>Also, lighting. A couple of 5500 Kelvin Led lights on a clip mount, with good color rendition won&#x27;t dent the budget but they will make even cheap webcams perform much better - color, frame rate, aperture. A softbox is wonderful but I don&#x27;t have space for that, so I aim the light at the white wall - good enough substitute !')
