Fuel poverty is already a significant problem, the UK government gives out &#x27;winter fuel payment&#x27; benefits to some, but doubling the price of energy would push <i>a lot</i> of elderly, infirm, and poor people to stop heating their homes.<p>This idea would need to come with nationalised energy costs for it to work.')
