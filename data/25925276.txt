Item(by='nsm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611732048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924566, text='I really like Dorian Taylor&#x27;s analogy of software to movie production: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doriantaylor.com&#x2F;softwares-ailing-mythology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doriantaylor.com&#x2F;softwares-ailing-mythology</a>\nTheir point is that software is a refinement of a process to the point where it can be executed by a computer (in a generally bug-free manner). Just like a movie spends a lot of time in pre-production and writing the script, we must spend a lot of time on refining our own understanding of our processes, before trying to explain them to computer via code. The faster one jumps to code, the more likely one is to have to go back and fix things, delaying the delivery of software.<p>So software is more similar to writing novels or movies, than construction, where a lot of time is spent just thinking through things, and going through the ups and downs of &quot;writer&#x27;s block&quot;. Perhaps one way out is to loosen the delineation between making software and using software (a la spreadsheets, Smalltalk) and moving towards more programmable environments, so one doesn&#x27;t deliver software, but rather allow users to build their own as part of refining their processes.')
