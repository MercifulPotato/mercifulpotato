The same for Amazon account or any other. Can someone inherit a Google account for the Email  and Photos history, as well for books on Google Play and any other purchase? Can someone inherit a Kindle Account? Of course they can have access with user and password, but if these companies are still on the market 50 years from now I wonder if they will start deleting accounts from people supposedly with 110 years and over.')
