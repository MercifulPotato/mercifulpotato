It&#x27;s very powerful indeed and you can do a lot of things with it, but I think it&#x27;s overkill for many people if all you want is a blog where to publish your own content.<p>For this reason I built DynaBlogger (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynablogger.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynablogger.com</a>) as a fully managed (hosting, backups, updates etc are taken care of do you can focus on content) alternative to WordPress which is simple, to the point and focused on blogging and at the same time much more affordable than Ghost, which is perhaps the most similar product available.<p>Simple but not too limited like other options in the market, DynaBlogger has all the features one really needs for publishing content baked in. No plugins on purpose - most WordPress plugins are poorly coded and introduce vulnerabilities or performance issues, and I didn&#x27;t want that.<p>It has a free plan, so it would be awesome if you could give it a try. I&#x27;m looking forward to any feedback')
