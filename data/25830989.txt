Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611043081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830663, text='That is a very interesting question that I have never seen a satisfactory answer to. I suspect there is some broad-based misinterpretation of the Paradox of Thrift [0].<p>If everyone has enough that they don&#x27;t need to work any more, then the economy will start signalling to people to stop producing resources because they aren&#x27;t needed (by lowering prices and reducing production). Rather than making the obvious connection that most people have what they need and lower prices will free up resources for people with very limited means, the mainstream thought seems to list towards savings &amp; retirement being an adversary that must be defeated because the GDP might drop.<p>Basically if people stop working because they don&#x27;t have anything they want to work for, economic output will drop in a way that can only be described as good. My interpretation is economists &amp; government aren&#x27;t ready for that idea so have declared an ongoing war against retirement (and - by extension - savings).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_thrift" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paradox_of_thrift</a>')
