The blog posts starts out with &quot;I am looking to serve small communities that would have trouble hiring someone at all to do planning and economic development work for them.&quot;. So I&#x27;m thinking you offer work in that field, right? But your website mentions copywriting and generic web development? What are these &quot;small communities&quot; you&#x27;re talking about, if not small towns or neighbourhoods? Are you targeting small government agencies? If not, who are you targeting? What does Patreon have to do with it? I mean, no small organisation that can&#x27;t afford a few thousand for consultancy work is going to pay a tiny recurring amount to some random person on the internet - just the accouting for those expenses will cost a multiple of the actual payment!<p>You say &quot;It&#x27;s an experiment&quot; - but what is? What are you offering? What are you asking, and who are you asking? So far the argument seems to be &quot;some things are too expensive for some organisations, but I&#x27;m going to offer it cheaper!&quot; without even knowing what those &quot;some things&quot; are? The post says &quot;services under $5000 and some under $1000&quot; - what are those services? If I have $2500, what can you do for me for that money?')
