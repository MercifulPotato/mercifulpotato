In cryptographic terms, it might be possible to find a collision in MD5 or SHA1, but finding a collision in both for the same target payload would be significantly more difficult.<p>This is actually a very valid use of blockchain, imho, that would go very far in securing elections, make remote online voting more secure, and provide a public, auditable, immutable log.')
