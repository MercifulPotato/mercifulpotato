I remember my grandfather tell me about how they used to gather around the radio to listen to the radio shows (or whatever these were called...).\nIncredible how something like a land line phone is now a thing of the past (not so distant!). In Argentina it was not until the lates nineties that most people have access to a phone at home. Now everyone has a mobile phone. \nThe power of technology evolving at exponential rate I guess!')
