Black farmers won a billion dollar lawsuit against the Department of Agriculture a few years ago.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackenterprise.com&#x2F;black-farmers-to-receive-payouts-in-1-2-billion-from-federal-lawsuit-settlement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blackenterprise.com&#x2F;black-farmers-to-receive-pay...</a><p>2. “Open Market” land is what children from farm families use to get started in farming, or expand their operations to support a family.  Taking some of that off the market, or jacking up land prices, is not going to go over well in local rural communities.  As in, really not well.  Families will start selling to other families directly, bypassing the market.<p>If there is no pressure from the communities, i.e., the kids don’t want to come home to farm, then people will be happy for the land value bump, if taxes don’t go up too.<p>3. Would be nice if the lands purchased were in places with an established black agricultural community.  Ease the transition into a rural lifestyle, and appropriate rebalancing for those States whose racial practices triggered the Black Diaspora.<p>4. Using the fact that the black community was preempted from participation in the land grabs in the 1800s to justify this land program is...morally ambiguous.  The blacks didn’t get to benefit from the Federal actions against Native tribes, so give them some of that land in 2020.  Not a great slogan.<p>5. For me, much less about “40 acres and a mule” justice (that way lies madness) than a great stabilizer for the US black community.  The diaspora led the black community of the 1900s to get stuck in the urban centers they moved to.  That move meant freedom from the civil rights abuses in the South, and a richer, better life in the cities.<p>But the life of the land became something they ran from, and didn’t have the connotation of a “better life” as it has had in the white community.  The diaspora black community in the US is an overurbanized subculture as a result.  Agriculture would be a great social stabilizer for that community.  Purely my uneducated opinion...<p>5. Looking forward to the “Fresh Prince of Omaha” spinoff...')
