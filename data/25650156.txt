It&#x27;s important to separate those with a hero complex from those that are more morally sincere. Greater moral sincerity means you&#x27;re more concerned with solving the problem than being the one to solve the problem. It&#x27;s not about you, it&#x27;s about the problem and seeing it solved. I think this is an especially relevant point in today&#x27;s culture.')
