So far so good.<p>But Crypto is more than a payment method. Obviously it is purchased in hopes of capital  appreciation and that makes it a Security.<p>Accordingly, Ripple should have filed a S-1 security disclosure application with the SEC BEFORE issuing XRP.<p>Failure to register XRP as a security should lead to big fines.<p>So why does the US SEC leave Bitcoin and Ethereum alone?<p>Because there is no central administrator that issues and redeems the tokens.<p>Ideally, crypto tokens should file with the US SEC and their exchanges should be MSBs.')
