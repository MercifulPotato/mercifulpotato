Age of Empires II works, but has multiplayer issues (which, while it &quot;works&quot; in GloriusEggroll&#x27;s 5.21 build, that&#x27;s about all it is since I get frame stutter &#x2F; 13 FPS which I do not see in single player).  Warframe is another game which kinda works, but can have some visual&#x2F;audio quirks (audio issue being listed as fixed in GE 5.21 proton as well but I haven&#x27;t tested it yet).  On the more positive side, Witcher III works well enough for me to consider it &quot;no tinkering needed&quot;...so there are definitely success stories out there.  I just wouldn&#x27;t expect the majority of titles to &quot;just work&quot; at this point in time.<p>All in all, I stand by what I said in that Proton is great, but expectations should be tempered since it definitely has some rough edges still.')
