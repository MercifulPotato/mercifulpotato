Stops on the lights and stop signs, btw. So the way you use it, you engage it on the long stretch, where it knows what to do, and monitor on the intersection. If it tries to take wrong lane on the intersection, you interfere. On simple intersections it goes through just fine. All this without FSD Beta.<p>Is it autonomous? No. Is it way less tiring to drive a car, when you don’t have to do lane keeping, speed control and traffic light stops yourself all the time? Absolutely.')
