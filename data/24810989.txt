Professional Services Engineers also tend to be better compensated than their internal product engineering counterparts because the PS Engineers are closer to the revenue stream (their $$$ time is billable to the customer, and thus they&#x27;re a revenue generator for the company), so it&#x27;s often easier to justify and negotiate for higher comp. You also get to rapidly grow your network of people in industry, and if you&#x27;re strategic about your relationships and on-site engagements, you can often establish rapport with executive level folks as well.<p>If I look back over my career, the single greatest accelerant along the arc from programmer to co-founder &amp; CEO was my time spent learning, working, and networking as a PS engineer.')
