Item(by='ben_w', descendants=None, kids=[25462593], score=None, time=1608247709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25461712, text='&gt; No, I&#x27;m literally saying what you&#x27;re advocating: if one has to expunge the research of an individual on the basis of their morals... well take these two examples and good luck with any progress in these fields while keeping them &quot;canceled&quot;.<p>No, you’re not saying what I’m saying. I don’t even know how you can have that take given my 3rd and 5th paragraphs. (My 4th could’ve been clearer even if it was trying to make the same point).<p>It’s the willingness of someone to violate <i>their</i> social norms which I regard as a problem for quality research, not the fact <i>my</i> moral code is being violated.<p>Unless you want to suggest that Gentzen and von Braun were violating the social norms of <i>the literal Third Reich</i> by <i>enthusiastically supporting the government of the country they lived in which was also The Third Reich</i>, your claim is <i>totally different</i> to mine.<p>(That said, I really wish you’d chosen a less emotive example than figures from the Third Reich, as I don’t want to even implicitly compare this situation to that one).')
