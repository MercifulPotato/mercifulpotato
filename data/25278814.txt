It&#x27;s just the manufacturing capacity and fabrication facilities.<p>Intel holds some shares on European based ASML which is the crucial partner for TSMC. The US could even force both ASML and TSMC to not sell products to Huawei even though Huawei was paying a lot of money. The US can effectively kill TSMC anytime.<p>I don&#x27;t think mass-scale in-house semiconductor manufacturing is really critical as much as having the tech and the IPs are. Also the US has enough influence on manufacturing, and enough emergency manufacturing capacity already in place. I think public cloud (AWS, GCP, and Azure) is more critical today than mass production semiconductor manufacturing.')
