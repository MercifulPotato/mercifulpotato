Item(by='grumple', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609530839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605211, text='I have experienced abuse at the hands of supervisors (generally disrespectful &#x2F; belittling behavior). You have to have a special kind of privilege to have not experienced this sort of thing. I haven&#x27;t ever experienced such a pervasive environment of targeted abuse as in the OP, but it certainly sounds believable. It&#x27;s the reason why unions came into being. We didn&#x27;t go from being a society of slaveowners to a society of saints in the past 150 years.<p>I have learned hard lessons though:<p>HR is not there to help you. I consulted HR and a senior director about my previous supervisor&#x27;s toxic behavior; not only did they do nothing, but they said they had previous complaints about them! And of course, I knew this, because I had many friends in the org, and I had witnessed the disrespect this person displayed towards others.<p>Collect evidence and get a lawyer if you want to stay in the org. This is the only way to protect yourself - it becomes very difficult for them to fire you in retaliation. I haven&#x27;t taken this route, but I&#x27;ve seen others do it.<p>My advice would be to make plans to leave. OP was in a tough spot due to citizenship. But you have to leave toxic environments. You will not fix them, and if you could, you&#x27;d be better off quitting and starting a consultancy to fix those places. Find someplace new and be more particular about joining them.')
