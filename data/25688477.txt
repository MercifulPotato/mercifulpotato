Most posters are center-right and don&#x27;t advocate violence.<p>I would also note that there&#x27;s been plenty of talk of violence <i>against</i> conservatives on left-leaning platforms, Twitter especially but many others.  These people are never called out even if they talk about &quot;rounding them up and putting them in camps&quot; and similar Nazi-like talk, even killing them seems to be permissible.  I&#x27;ve reported lots of such tweets and sometimes they&#x27;re taken down, other times, not.')
