Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=[25147716, 25146545], score=None, time=1605760352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146085, text='It seems pretty straightforward what breck is claiming, I&#x27;m astonished at the incomprehension and downvotes.<p>Breck has said, plainly, that the author is welcome to write a book and sell copies (on robot kittens or otherwise).  Or accept money for writing a book, or offer money to write a book, with or without selling copies.<p>Breck has also claimed that it is unethical for the author to attempt to control what purchasers of that book do with those copies, e.g. make copies of their own and sell them.  Relatedly, they claim that it&#x27;s unethical to profit off of someone else enforcing such control.<p>In modern legal systems, if that purchaser sells copies, likely the author will ask the government to exercise their monopoly on violence to stop the copier, claiming that the copier violates &quot;copy right&quot;, the right to control copying.  Breck is saying that it is unethical for the government to stop this copying, and unethical for the author to ask the government to do so.  This is a very coherent and reasonable position, though you may reasonably disagree.<p>From this, breck reasons that if ADF has a contract with Disney that, to make any sense at all, requires that copyright be enforced, then defaults on this rogue&#x27;s contract are not breck&#x27;s ethical business, and thus breck is not sad that the contract is being violated.  Much as breck would not be sad on the carpenter&#x27;s behalf if the mob boss didn&#x27;t pay his licensing fee, because the whole contract between the mob boss and the carpenter is (according to breck) unethical.')
