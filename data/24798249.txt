Some of my personal projects are still deployed like this as it is really simple (it&#x27;s docker with a very thin yaml), works exactly like on my machine and is against my expectations really stable.<p>Is there some plan to support docker-compose or something like this? The &quot;magic&quot; why it is working so good for simple solutions is the service discovery. Since version 1.10 dns resolution by container names in created docker networks is possible which would be enough to replicate most of the functionality of docker-compose. Is there some plan to support a lot more docker configuration options? Or is the docker mode just a small neat feature which will not receive much development as kubernetes and nomad will be the main deployment system for most of the users?')
