Item(by='rafstone', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605887517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25161554, text='Loituma Girl (also known as &quot;Leekspin&quot;) is a Flash animation set to a scat singing section of the traditional Finnish folk song &quot;Ievan Polkka,&quot; sung by the Finnish quartet Loituma on their 1995 debut album Things of Beauty. It appeared on the Internet in late April 2006 and quickly became popular. The animation consists of four frames showing the Bleach anime character Orihime Inoue twirling a Welsh onion or leek, set to a 27-second loop from the song.<p>The animation of Loituma Girl is taken from episode two of the Bleach anime series, between the twelfth and fourteenth minute (depending on the version). In the clip, Orihime is twirling a leek while talking to Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki. The scene is an instance of a recurring joke surrounding her character, in which she wants to cook something so unusual that it seems almost inedible.')
