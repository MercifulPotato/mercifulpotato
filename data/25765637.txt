The current paper isn&#x27;t super clear on what their working definition is (to me), but seems to be &quot;a compulsion or an uncontrollable need to work incessantly&quot;.<p>How does that relate to actual work demands? The paper says that the effort put in must beyond what is &quot;necessary&quot;, but this is pretty vague, and would seem off in different contexts. Am I a studyholic if I study for an A instead of a simply &#x27;sufficient&#x27; C? Should we call parents who stay up helping their kids finish a school project due tomorrow parentaholics? What is the &#x27;correct&#x27; amount of effort to be expended so that the scientific literature won&#x27;t label you as having a mental health problem?<p>Aside from that, can this even be extricated from simple enjoyment of work? One cited paper says:<p>&gt; Cantarow (1979) suggests that workaholics are those who seek passionate involvement and gratification from working. Finally, it has been observed that hard-workers often use the word ‘fun’ to describe their work experiences (Kiechel, 1989; Machlowitz, 1980). Thus, it seems that workaholics typically find working pleasurable.<p>The horror! From that same cited paper:<p>&gt; Therefore, in this paper, workaholics are defined as those who enjoy the act of working, who are obsessed with working, and who devote long hours and personal time to work. In short, workaholics are those whose emotions, thoughts, and behaviors are strongly dominated by their work.<p>If I actually enjoy my job, <i>of course</i> I&#x27;m going to spend more time on it! And if I don&#x27;t like to exercise, or play parent, or if I only eat what I need to keep me alive, that&#x27;s going to look like workaholism, even though it&#x27;s just someone doing what they enjoy as much as they can. That&#x27;s going to lead to neglect of other things, because there are only so many hours in a day. That&#x27;s an important part of the definition, by the way, <i>neglecting</i> &quot;other parts of life&quot; is seen as a central component of workaholism, but this obviously applies to every activity, be it studying, exercising, parenting, whatever. Are we supposed to think up a portmanteau for each of these to signify individuals who &#x27;overindulge&#x27; by our judgment?')
