They can look for the conflicts they&#x27;re programmed to look for by packages, and they can walk dependency graphs that are generated by the packages in the repos maintained by a person. The root of the problem is that modern software architecture (even for trendy languages) cannot express the dependencies in the first place.<p>I wrote you an explanation, but it ran to 1,355 words, so I Gist&#x27;d it here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;peterwwillis&#x2F;e96854532f471c739983c0bba7608834" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;peterwwillis&#x2F;e96854532f471c739983c0b...</a>')
