Item(by='pvaldes', descendants=None, kids=[25828821], score=None, time=1611010995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25824110, text='&gt; doctors in the US command a much higher salary than their counterparts elsewhere in the world<p>Yes, but salaries are also linked to huge debts to pay in their first years, a permanent state of fear to be sued by negligence (losing their license and seeing their only possibility of income vanished). It seems that suicide and depression are too common among young students. They also work too many hours in irregular schedules (working in sundays, holidays or passing one on each three weekends at the hospital is not uncommon. This will add a lot of stress for parents with small children trying to having a normal life. And is a emotionally charged work.<p>... So either you provide a particularly high reward in form of a golden salary, or perhaps nobody would wanted to be a doctor.')
