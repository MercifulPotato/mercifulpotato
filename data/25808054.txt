Rosetta 2 works quickly and well. I’ve found M1 builds for things like ffmpeg, VS Code, TeX.<p>The #1 problem is external monitor support. I use a Seiki 4K monitor. If you unplug it, the laptop regularly becomes unresponsive and kerneltask eats all your cycles. If it sleeps with a monitor on and wakes with it off, that’s almost a sure beach ball.<p>Rumors are that a fix is coming, but you never know. You can see from the other comments that in general external monitor support is erratic, and that’s very bad for a 13” laptop.  I’ve taken to rebooting between monitor unplugs. Very obnoxious and I’m infuriated having to do it.<p>But then when it all works, it’s pretty sweet, so all is forgiven. So basically, it’s a slightly abusive relationship. Buyer beware.')
