I don&#x27;t want to spend 30 minutes plus waiting for the car to charge 2 or 3 times on during the journey, assuming there&#x27;s even a free charger.  Using an electric vehicle, with the current range, would make my 365(!) mile journey about 2 hours longer than it already is.<p>I&#x27;m not an outlier either.  We have friends and family that do London to Edinburgh weekly, or fortnightly, and often further.<p>As for &quot; bogus &quot;massive investment&quot; argument&quot; that&#x27;s a bogus-bogus statement.  Sorry.<p>We need to double the energy generation in this country to go fully EV and replace all new, and <i>old</i> registered vehicles (there&#x27;s 25 million registered with the DVLA).  We need to additionally add charging points to homes, and on-street.  On-street is the worst - can you imagine digging up every street in inner London that has residents with cars to satisfy &#x27;all EV in new cars by 2030&#x27;?')
