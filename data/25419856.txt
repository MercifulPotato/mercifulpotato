Item(by='BossingAround', descendants=None, kids=[25427658], score=None, time=1607965285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25419378, text='&gt; I&#x27;m curious how you&#x27;d describe external mechanical keyboards with cherry reds or blues. &quot;Ludicrously&quot;, perhaps? Even my Logitech keyboard was louder.<p>The point wasn&#x27;t to say that the keyboard was &quot;insanely loud&quot; in and of itself. The point was to say that to think Apple cares for quiet sound is to disregard the comparatively amazingly loud (and generally faulty) keyboard.<p>So it&#x27;s not really the quietness Apple it after. It&#x27;s the cool factor, a differentiation feature. Otherwise, if it was a genuine desire for quiet environment, the keyboard wouldn&#x27;t have made sense.<p>Tangentially, I do own a number of these &quot;ludicrously loud&quot; mechanical keyboards (with various switches). I wouldn&#x27;t take them with me to a library, or a lecture hall though.')
