They&#x27;re pretty well documented around page 5 of FTB 1031 [1].<p>In my case, I quit my W2 job in California, entered into a contract to lease a home in NV, got rid of all leased or owned real estate in CA, sold or re-titled all motor vehicles from CA, registered to vote in NV, surrendered my CA driver license for a new NV license, re-titled all my financial accounts at my new address, got a NV phone number, etc.<p>This was all easy because I was single without children.  If my situation was more complicated, like I had a spouse or ex-spouse with children enrolled in CA schools, or decided to retain owned real estate in CA, the situation can quickly fall into a gray zone.<p>If you have a W2 job in CA while claiming you&#x27;re in NV, it&#x27;s very hard to escape the CA FTB.<p>CA is very aggressive about chasing down its former residents.  It&#x27;s important to check all the boxes to get them from chasing you.<p>After I left, I filed non-resident CA returns for three years basically saying, &quot;I had income but I am not a resident and it was not from a CA source, therefore I owe no CA tax.&quot;  This is important because it starts the statute of limitations running.  If you don&#x27;t file, the statute of limitations doesn&#x27;t start.<p>And while I&#x27;m writing all this: what in the world is up with a 13.3% state tax bracket?  Screw California.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2019-1031-publication.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftb.ca.gov&#x2F;forms&#x2F;2019&#x2F;2019-1031-publication.pdf</a>')
