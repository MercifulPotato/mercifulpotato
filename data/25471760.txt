This meant that while the designs had amazing peak performance figures, the chips were unable to sustain them for prolonged periods beyond 2-3 minutes. Keeping that in mind, the devices throttled to performance levels that were still ahead of the competition, leaving Apple in a leadership position in terms of efficiency.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16088&#x2F;apple-announces-5nm-a14-soc-meagre-upgrades-or-less-power-hungry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16088&#x2F;apple-announces-5nm-a14...</a>')
