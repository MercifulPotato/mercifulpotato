The News-Letter is not a scientific or economic journal, and the staff don&#x27;t validate or endorse the academic accuracy of this type of content.<p>Additionally, the &quot;Applied Economics masterâ€™s degree program&quot; is an adult extension program located on a satellite campus.<p>I agree the headline here is completely misleading, as it attempts to tie the content to other schools&#x2F;divisions of JHU that have a much more solid reputation for academic rigor.')
