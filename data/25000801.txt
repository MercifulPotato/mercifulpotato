More decoupling means you can use an entirely different langauge<p>2. Services can be deployed, restarted, etc. independently.<p>But that comes with disadvantages. The contract then becomes message passing and serialization&#x2F;deserialization, which is fairly primitive. You can&#x27;t pass functions&#x2F;callbacks, and simple static checks become a whole validation problem. It also limits your ability to use interesting types across services.<p>The XML craze 20 years ago tried to tackle all of these problems (remember XML schemas?), but it became unweildly and didn&#x27;t really succeed despite a huge enterprise push.')
