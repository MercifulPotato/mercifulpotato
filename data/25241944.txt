Apple isn&#x27;t the same underdog that it was when PowerPC was put to bed, and the transition is challenging because the Mac platform is bifurcated in the interim.<p>PowerPC to Intel isn&#x27;t a good proxy for this because the technology is different, the transition strategy is different, and the company itself is different.<p>If the M1 transition is to be smooth, it has to achieve that on its own merits, without looking back in search of comparable transitions past.')
