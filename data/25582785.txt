It would be insane to allow a technology on the streets that makes as many mistakes as humans are making. I certainly wouldn’t use self driving cars if they killed 30000 people per year like humans are doing right now. How would you assign responsibility for crashes? Our current system is far from perfect but at least it’s something people understand and know how to navigate. And there are drivers that are better and more cautious than others. So it’s not just an illusion of control.')
