Worse still is that politicians and the press back research when it suits their narrative and dismiss it when it contradicts their narrative. Which creates a precedence for &quot;free thinkers&quot; to also accept or reject any evidence that falls outside of their own chosen narrative.<p>Social media compounds things here because it allows people do get swallowed into this world of like minded people (aka the &quot;echo chamber&quot;).<p>There&#x27;s a fair amount on Wikipedia about the psychology at play which causes this. There&#x27;s names for it all, all of which I can&#x27;t recall because I&#x27;ve hit the Christmas spirits. Hopefully someone sober can be more helpful than I.')
