I probably should have said 100,000 binary searches, or 1,000,000 binary searches.<p>You&#x27;re right, 1000 is a small enough number where the CPU might still win. If its a large-enough data-structure to hit VRAM (ie: a binary search across a 8GB vector), that&#x27;s what&#x27;d be best for the GPU.<p>Raytracing is millions rays per scene. 4k is 8,294,400 rays at 1-sample per pixel, and each one of those rays has to traverse a BVH tree (similar to a binary tree). Each of those rays <i></i>MIGHT<i></i> set off a 2nd or 3rd ray, depending on what its bouncing against. The big BVH tree that organizes all of the video game triangles &#x2F; objects is shared for all rays.<p>That&#x27;s the &quot;1000s of binary tree searches in parallel&quot; I was trying to reference. But I guess its closer to 10s of millions.')
