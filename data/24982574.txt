I probably should have said 100,000 binary searches, or 1,000,000 binary searches.<p>You&#x27;re right, 1000 is a small enough number where the CPU might still win. If its a large-enough data-structure to hit VRAM (ie: a binary search across a 8GB vector), that&#x27;s what&#x27;d be best for the GPU.')
