Violent crime rate (excluding murder) is roughly 2x the average, and so is the death rate to police.<p>That&#x27;s why I think we need to be focusing on why black people have a higher crime rate, and how we can fix the societal problems that lead to that. Reducing the number of police shootings is a great goal, but so long as there is a racial (and gender) divide in the crime rate there is going to be a divide in the police shooting rate.')
