Our founders built businesses like Monzo, Curve, and Florence and we&#x27;ve raised a substantial seed round. We&#x27;re looking for our first two engineers to integrate with grocers, build a recommendation engine, and make it all smooth for users. Can you help us?<p>We&#x27;re very early stage so our tech stack is evolving. Currently we expect to use Go, React, JS&#x2F;Node.JS, Python, Ruby on Rails, and AWS, but we&#x27;re looking for polyglots who can use or learn whatever tools are needed. What we need to do right now is to run fast experiments with cycle times measured in hours or days so we can learn what users need from a dramatically better grocery ordering experience.<p>Check out our careers page at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lollipop.breezy.hr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lollipop.breezy.hr&#x2F;</a> and introduce yourself, weâ€™d love to hear from you!')
