I would be more at ease to find a line like :<p>That&#x27;s just your bias kicking in. I didn&#x27;t define the requirements of the program. If I defined the requirements of the program to be ONLY printing out a number that represents the left edge of a box when the measurement is inputted into the console than defining an entire box struct is in itself a code &quot;architecture&quot; problem.<p>Maybe another name wouldn&#x27;t trigger any &quot;Smell&quot;.<p><pre><code>   speedOfLightInVacuumMetersPerSecond = 99999999999....\n</code></pre>\nIs your brain telling you that it should be structured like so:?<p><pre><code>   Vacuum.light.speed = 9999999999\n</code></pre>\nLikely no, because it doesn&#x27;t make sense to place light as a parameter of vacuum... showing that a big long phrase in a variable name is not in itself a &quot;smell&quot; that needs to be &quot;re architected.&quot;<p>You see it is not the grammar of the phrase that is making you want to restructure the code but the contextual meaning. This is one of those optical illusion like triggers in our brain, you want to organize something in a certain way but my post didn&#x27;t give you a logical reason to do so. I never defined that an entire Box was provided as input.')
