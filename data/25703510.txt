Item(by='daenz', descendants=None, kids=[25703590], score=None, time=1610219585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703219, text='You&#x27;re misinterpreting my &quot;endless videos&quot; comment to mean &quot;happens with great regularly&quot;, instead of &quot;this an established scenario to train for&quot;, within the context of traffic stops. People shoot cops at traffic stops, it&#x27;s a thing that happens, and people should be aware of it.<p>From your comments, it seems that because you can show that it&#x27;s relatively rare, nobody should expect, plan for, or train for it. I look at stats that show police murder rate comparable to the general population and I am honestly impressed that they are able to keep it that low while dealing with some of the most dangerous elements of society. Do you believe it is because violent criminals have a similar level of hatred towards police as they do a member of the general public, or is it because police train for the worst case scenario?')
