That&#x27;s a laughable, yet dangerous take. Incredibly inflammatory and accusatory.<p>Either Coinbase is an incredibly racist and black-unfriendly company, or some people would like you to believe that, and these accusations can all be unravelled to crying wolf, accusing others of downright illegal acts, without even filing a formal complaint to help others not suffer the same fate.')
