They don&#x27;t actually prove anything, the standards of this kind of research are incredibly low.<p>The problem is that western egyptologist are unlikely to go out of their way to put effort into researching what particular crimes colonialists committed. The victor writes the history books, and they probably didn&#x27;t even think to write prominently anything about the countless artifacts they destroyed, to them it was all just the work of godless subhumans so why bother.<p>They have a very good motive to do it, and that today the decedents of the racists will go out of their way to deny it isn&#x27;t surprising at all.<p>The whole ancient alien thing comes from a different direction, its whole foundation lies in the disbelief that african people could&#x27;ve ever possibly built the pyramids, even aliens is a more plausible theory to them.')
