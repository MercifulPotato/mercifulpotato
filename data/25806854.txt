C# was just another &quot;copy&quot; of the VM concept Java had, as you well know. Even if C# was superior under the hood (which it isn&#x27;t) I still claim it just fragmented the industry and was just an example of a company creating their own proprietary stuff for their own self-serving reasons, and before you think you&#x27;re correcting me, yes I know the CLR is supposed to be machine independent. When VBScript was finally yanked out of browsers the world celebrated.<p>I will openly admit however when VSCode came along and TypeScript I totally regained a new love for Microsoft, and they have redeemed themselves, also by accepting Linux into their dying OS.')
