Also, I don&#x27;t see concrete measures to end monopolies being mentioned. Maybe it&#x27;s time to realize that our industry has left the innovation phase, and is into consolidation. In this environment, legislation is well advised to look into mechanisms for a regulated market given the extreme importance of digital platforms and markets (which are the only ones having growth). And perhaps states should also play a much stronger role in setting standards rather than leaving that in a mixture of naivite and corruption to failed initiatives of market participants (such as the wannabe standard bodies W3C and WHATWG with disastrous results). After all, if &quot;national security&quot; (of the US, that is) is an argument to block market participants, and the web being monopolized, there&#x27;s no point in pretending  international trade or other fair trading rules apply.')
