Memory latency is the same at ~100 ns; Firestorm is clocked lower so latency is lower in terms of cycles. One Firestorm core can saturate the memory controller while Intel&#x2F;AMD can&#x27;t so that should be an advantage for single-threaded scenarios. Intel&#x2F;AMD are behind, but I wouldn&#x27;t say embarrassingly so and they haven&#x27;t been lazy.')
