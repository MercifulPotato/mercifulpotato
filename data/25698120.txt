My Facebook feed is more than just a simple serving of my friends content, it’s a work in and of itself (like a collection of essays).<p>It seems like a stretch given that the law states that they can’t be considered the publisher of “information” provided by others, but possible as these sites are the ones engaged in picking content.<p>The article mentions the roommates.com racial discrimination case. I wonder what a court would do if a site had some black box algorithm that ended up consistently showing a feed of  rooms in one zip code to whites and rooms in another zip code to blacks, never overlapping.<p>Edit-\nMy point being- it might be possible to hold Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;YouTube liable for the information in their feeds, particularly that which is surfaced out of order or from people a user isn’t subscribed to. But I’m not lawyer, nor do I play  one on TV.')
