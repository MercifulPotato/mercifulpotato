There&#x27;s also WikiBooks, which has simpler&#x2F;shorter books, though it seems that their printable and PDF versions of books aren&#x27;t updated as frequently as the wiki contents.<p>One idea might be to load up a flash drive&#x2F;memory card with a bunch of different PDF books as well as Node.JS, Visual Studio Code, Java JDKs, Java IDEs, etc. and let her try them and see what works best for her.')
