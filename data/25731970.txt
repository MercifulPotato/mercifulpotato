You need at least the configuration channel in order to negotiate charging voltage and maximum current.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s possible to make one lacking both USB 2 and 3 data though, but I haven&#x27;t seen one yet.<p>Nor have I seen a public USB-C outlet, for that matter, and I probably wouldn&#x27;t be plugging my laptop or phone into one anyway: My own charger doesn&#x27;t only protect me against bad intent, but also against cheap charging circuits that might or might not accidentally expose 220 Volt to my laptop&#x27;s mainboard in case of faults.')
