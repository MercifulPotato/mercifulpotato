Why do we even use them any more? Apps should have had plenty time to adapt to higher DPI displays by now, and X11 has supported per display DPI since the 90s and a scale factor on top of this seems obviously wrong.<p>And for the niche case where you have a big disparity in DPIs of multiple displays + apps that can&#x27;t adapt to DPI on the fly, scaling up is surely the wrong solution, you should be scaling down no the smaller screen.')
