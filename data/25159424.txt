Because the opposite is precisely what happens here, which is caring only about a specific set of &#x27;aspects&#x27; that are currently fashionable in the society, while failing to cover for the large majority of inequalities that are not &quot;visible&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s the exact same than positive discrimination, you end up only caring about women or color people in the name of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; and no one care anymore about economic inequalities that are largely the main factor of inequality at birth. In the end it&#x27;s still the same rich people from the same parents but they just look more diverse, and no one care of young people from trailer parks &amp; getthos.<p>I don&#x27;t blame prejudiced people fighting agaisnt their prejudices tho, imo it&#x27;s more a consequence lazy politics and politician trying to get votes instead of taking on more complex and deeper problems.')
