There are plenty of languages, and even visual programming (via flow-diagrams, like Unreal Engine&#x27;s &quot;Blueprint&quot; and Blender&#x27;s shader flow diagrams), for those who just want to play around. For people who want to write a quick and dirty script, languages like python make it very easy already (relative to what they actually do).<p>&gt; Programming COULD use [...] removal of barriers<p>Absolutely agree with this, though. There&#x27;s an unnecessary elitism in many places that really needs to go..<p>&gt; Development is sometimes hard and requires hard work to do right by people.<p>This is *so* important for these people to understand. There are languages and domains where the &quot;elitism&quot; is fully justified. If someone decides they want to write a high performance, easy to use, cross platform native application and complain about C++ or Rust being too complicated, then they should find an easier job. There is justified and unjustified elitism, and there are domains which could use, if anything, even more &quot;complication&quot; and more specifications, more &quot;barriers&quot; to ensure higher quality.')
