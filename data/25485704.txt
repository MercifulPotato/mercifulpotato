You can strategically answer any question. So the game becomes how to answer the audit questions effectively rather than an honest appraisal of the situation.<p>Also it&#x27;s not really fun. It&#x27;s a frustration ridden shit show. You spend all day solving complex problems instead of building business value.<p>A fine example of where the tradeoff ends is spending three weeks solving fundamental networking issues due to stack complexity and immaturity.')
