You need to be prepared to not have a job when at the end of it, and you were the one who initiated the process. I&#x27;m not too concerned with if she <i>technically</i> should have been given a chance to take it back. Don&#x27;t send an email threatening to resign, lose your job, then say &quot;actually, I was fired.&quot;<p>&gt; and without respecting her stated plan to work on an end date.<p>You don&#x27;t really want to let an employee already sending inappropriate emails to a wide audience have another week to send more.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a professionally self-destructive place before and I didn&#x27;t realize it until later. 100% speculation here, but I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if she had a death wish and was hoping for some version of this outcome. Could be frustration with work, covid depression, or something else.')
