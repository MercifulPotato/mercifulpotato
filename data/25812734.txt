A few specifics:<p>I deeply believe, with some reasons, that the US Constitutional principles and some other good things will continue to be in place in the long run, in spite of difficulties.<p>Among the very most important things we can <i>do</i> are to be good to our families, and continuing to practice at honesty and treating others the way they would want to be treated. Those things seem essential for maintaining anything, long-term. (cf. the &quot;Anna Karenina principle&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anna_karenina_principle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anna_karenina_principle</a> ), for families or cultures that last across many generations.)\n(Tolstoy said something like &quot;All happy families are alike, and all miserable families are miserable in their own way&quot;. I think there is much to that: multigenerational unselfish service to others, in a widening circle, brings greater sustainability and peace. Seeing what families&#x27; and&#x2F;or cultures&#x27; traits allow them to persist over time is interesting.)<p>Jesus Christ said &quot;love your enemies&quot;, &amp; more ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;nt&#x2F;matt&#x2F;5.3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;nt&#x2F;matt&#x2F;5.3</a>...

(And: &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them&quot;: Matt 7:11-21; and see D&amp;C52: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;dc-testamen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;churchofjesuschrist.org&#x2F;study&#x2F;scriptures&#x2F;dc-testamen</a>...

This means treating others with respect, for starters, and the way you would want (or they would want) to be treated.<p>Please, along with seeking wisdom &amp; kindness, let&#x27;s try to get info and news from reliable, trustworthy sources. (Many; refs avail.)  Honesty, principles in the US Constitution and rule of law seem much more important than other policies, even ones we care about deeply (per some of my Church&#x27;s scriptures, such as D&amp;C98). Let&#x27;s pray for our country&#x2F;ies!  (Trust, in anyone, is earned, not a right -- by behavior over time, not just promises &amp; piles of words.)<p>And really, we all can learn, help &amp; encourage each other, grow &amp; be better if we keep trying.<p>And yes, things can be OK.')
