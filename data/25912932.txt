If someone else out there is in the same boat.  How would that person find you?<p>If you can answer that, then you&#x27;ve found your answer and on your way of solving one of the biggest issue straight men are facing.<p>I&#x27;m in the same boat as you thus scoping out HN right now ;-), but also do Reddit and Indiehackers.com.  I&#x27;m finding it&#x27;s harder to find someone to befriend than it was finding my soulmate!  Seriously.<p>Other places due to my interests are arduino&#x2F;ESP8266&#x2F;IoT forums.  As for late, I&#x27;m been active on Hubitat forums since I&#x27;m trying to hobble together a worthy home automation and security.  Lot of great people but hard to &quot;connect&quot; as a friend in forums.  They are there to find solutions, not friends or at least I think they are?<p>It&#x27;s almost as if one needs to &quot;invent&quot; match.com for for friends ;-) FriendFinder site start with that mantra where the founder started out looking for golf buddies only to find out most men that are looking are looking for one thing....<p>Incidentally, great podcast on this subject:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;594719471&#x2F;guys-we-have-a-problem-how-american-masculinity-creates-lonely-men" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;594719471&#x2F;guys-we-have-a-prob...</a><p>I&#x27;ve been looking long and hard to try to find a solution to this problem.  Women simply do NOT have this problem.  Only men and it&#x27;s becoming an epidemic of sorts.  My father died &quot;lonely&quot;, while my mother thrived with friends and same as for my in-law&#x27;s.  Men just do not want to talk, approach or converse with other men unless forced to.  Stigma men seem to unwilling to let go.<p>Sorry, rambling since I got tired of coding and was looking for a break by reading HN ;-)')
