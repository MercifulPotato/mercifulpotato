I&#x27;ll take another look at windows movie maker, but I do think I have all that.<p>About LUTs - I will certainly have that, I do think in a 3-4 months timeframe, it&#x27;s certainly on my TODO list. I know how to implement it, but it&#x27;s certainly far from trivial :D My take is that it&#x27;ll take me roughly 1 month to have it done.<p>&gt; The more magic you can do for the average user, the better (e.g. how Lightroom or Instagram work for pics)<p>Agreed, that&#x27;s what I intend to do, thanks again!')
