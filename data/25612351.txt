That was hacking documents into apps.<p>Today&#x27;s approach for building web apps is basically code up a fat client application which downloads to the browser, runs, and talks to some remote web API (i.e. REST) using JSON. This is much closer to native apps and very far from the document approach. The app and the pure content are cleanly split between the initial app bundle and the web APIs.')
