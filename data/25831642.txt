I googled it, and while the exact circumstances don&#x27;t seem to be clear yet, it doesn&#x27;t sound like murder to me. It sounds as if most likely the officer was hurt in a brawl between rioters and police (being hit in the head with a fire extinguisher). While that is still awful, murder requires murderous intent and planning (afaik).<p>Therefore, it seems really interesting what sources gave you the impression it was murder.<p>On the other hand I remember a police officer being shot during BLM riots, while he tried to protect a business. So by your logic, is it reasonable to assume that BLM activists would murder their opponents without second thought?<p>Did people throw bricks during BLM protests? That seems roughly the equivalent to throwing fire extinguishers, accepting that somebody could be severely hurt or even die.')
