Even on insurance, a lot of Americans routinely ignore preventive care because of the hassles, overhead and out of pocket costs even after insurance. Unless you are lucky to have great insurance by your employer. The point is that insurance should NOT be involved in preventive care. It should be a direct free market cash exchange b&#x2F;w just 2 parties. Patient and doctor. That&#x27;s it. NO premiums, no copays, no coinsurance, no claim paperwork, no calling insurance companies to figure out the charges etc etc and most importantly, no dependency on having a job to be able to afford going to a doctor even for preventive care.')
