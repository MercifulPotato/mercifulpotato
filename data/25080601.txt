Item(by='porker', descendants=None, kids=[25083377], score=None, time=1605259475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076228, text='<i>&gt; If you want to comply with worldwide payment laws and tax requirements, then I&#x27;d disagree it&#x27;s &quot;not one of the complicated problems&quot;.</i>\n<i>It&#x27;s also not something that a service like Stripe will handle for you to a useful degree.</i><p>And yet it is a key part of the engineering problem that has to be solved, which moves it away from &quot;not one of the complicated problems&quot; and being &quot;quite standard work&quot; (the original post I was replying to, disagreeing with the thrust of their post).<p><i>Which, AFAIK, you still can&#x27;t actually test properly with Stripe&#x27;s system before making it live. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s fully documented yet, and if it is, that&#x27;s a relatively recent development.</i><p>We&#x27;ve discussed testing payments before (GoCardless last time) and are in agreement that it can be improved. I&#x27;ve seen no way to test Stripe&#x27;s dunning.<p><i>You can literally write the code to do things like this in a few minutes, including all conceivable edge cases. Many of us have. It&#x27;s basic arithmetic combined with some almost-but-not-quite-trivial logic around dates.</i><p>And yet last month I worked with a SaaS which implemented recurring billing a few years ago, and can&#x27;t get it right. They overlooked pro-rata entirely (which at least prevented edge cases) and dunning didn&#x27;t work. They aren&#x27;t the first either.<p>Which is why, when I see the mess people have made of it, I disagree with the original assertion.<p><i>But Paddle&#x27;s model is a merchant-of-record, which also takes care of things like the tax reporting and remittance headaches that a service with Stripe&#x27;s model doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not a fair comparison.</i><p>It is an accurate comparison when answering &quot;[Managing recurring billing] is not one of the complicated problems&quot;. We have merchant of records, we have profitable subscription companies like Recurly, Chargify and Chargebee. If it (and keeping up with a changing landscape) wasn&#x27;t a significant problem for businesses then more would roll their own rather than outsource (and of those that have, get it right).<p>Reading your other comments on this page, we agree on many more things than we disagree. Here we likely disagree on semantics: what&#x27;s an engineer&#x27;s role; what&#x27;s simple vs complicated? Great to correspond again.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25078516" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25078516</a>')
