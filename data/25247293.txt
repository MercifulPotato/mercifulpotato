It shouldn&#x27;t be buying applications for it that fund it. In fact considering how little older phones get supported, it&#x27;s pretty meaningless to say that it&#x27;s to keep devices drivers up to date as they aren&#x27;t ;).<p>&gt; Maintains the developer tools, compilers, documentation, so that your binary can run on the device&#x27;s OS.<p>Again, it&#x27;s the customer that pay for it once he buy the device.<p>&gt; A app store offers reliable hosting of the game binaries and provides a versioning and upgrade mechanism on a platform with billions of user accounts.<p>It doesn&#x27;t cost 25% to host game binaries. I&#x27;m pretty sure Roblox host it all on Windows for example...<p>By the way, on Android, the license fee isn&#x27;t for the Android system, it&#x27;s for the Google Play services specifically.
