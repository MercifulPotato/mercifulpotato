I got tired of data cleaning, experimenting, tuning parameters, and managing unrealistic expectations about DS work. Data Science tasks seemed open-ended, I wanted something more deterministic, tasks that I could call finished at some point.<p>So I went from Data Scientist to Data Engineer which, in my current company, is a SWE working on data (as opposed to full stack or backend  engineers). In my new role I worked closely with data scientists to ship their code to production, as well as data pipelines and some backend and infrastructure tasks. I&#x27;m enjoying it so far. It gets repetitive sometimes, but more bearable than DS work.<p>If you have enough SWE skills, as well as DS knownlegde, your profile could be attractive to some companies. You can also target ML Engineering or Data Engineering jobs. I think you don&#x27;t have to worry much about switching. It&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right company.<p>Good luck!')
