Every community is an echochamber, any dissenting views are downvoted to death simply for disagreeing with the hivemind. If someone compared HN to Tiktok, you&#x27;d laugh. But reddit is closer to tiktok than it is to HN in terms of signal to noise ratio.<p>HN is one of the last communities where I can see someone post a contrarian opinion and have an actual discussion about that opinion instead of it vanishing from downvotes. I don&#x27;t ever want HN to become like reddit, and in that context calling out reddit specifically makes sense.<p>The sad thing is HN <i>is</i> slowly trending towards being like reddit as the community grows. I see more and more instances of people using downvote as an &#x27;I disagree&#x27; button or posting low-effort comments. To that end, yeah, I think the community should do what it can to call those behaviours out.')
