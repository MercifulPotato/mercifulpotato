I don&#x27;t eat indoors so the recent weather change has meant more time at home. My favorite thing about Detroit winter, the skating rink, is going up right now (probably the only thing I&#x27;ll do outside till spring 2021) But, downtown isn&#x27;t the same as the other neighborhoods, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going farther than a mile from home for a while')
