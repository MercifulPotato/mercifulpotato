Porting an open-source player for your particular situation might cost more in developer time than simply licensing Bink. Bink&#x27;s developers are also going to be more conscious of the technical limitations of a game console that you might be running into (eg: hard thread&#x2F;socket&#x2F;resource limits) compared to a more general-purpose codec.<p>This becomes a more notable tradeoff for a studio looking to get funding for a particular milestone from a publisher.
