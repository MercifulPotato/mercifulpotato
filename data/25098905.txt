I2C or SPI sequencing and there having a logic analyzer that I can cross-correlate with actual external signals is so much more useful. They&#x27;ve gotten cheap enough these days that it is sometimes just easier to connect one to a spare pin and toggle that pin based in the internal state I want to track.')
