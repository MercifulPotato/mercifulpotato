Item(by='lawnchair_larry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610850668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25771871, text='This kind of comment suggests that you are completely devoid of conservative perspective. When people respond to complaints of biased moderation by saying that social media is full of conservatives, they haven&#x27;t heard the complaint. The fact that you call PragerU &quot;insane&quot; seems to further support that.<p>Even though I find that it&#x27;s rare for folks on the left to understand what&#x27;s happening on the right, I&#x27;m surprised that even you are so misinformed about what gets people booted. Appeals to violence and &quot;KKK-grade bigotry&quot; are not what these complaints are about, and don&#x27;t even approach the correct universe in describing the types of folks getting moderated (although hate speech should be allowed IMO). Not only that, but twitter is chock full of appeals to violence, which, as long as it&#x27;s directed at conservatives, has remarkable staying power compared to anything directed elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s worth watching some of the opposing folks that you&#x27;ve been taught to hate once in a while, even if just to keep abreast of the concerns being discussed. Otherwise, all you get are the distorted caricatures of the fringes.')
