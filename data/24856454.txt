Taking that as a reference point to evaluate our sense of peace, is pretty damning.<p>Industrial and technological development prior to WW1 and WW2 enabled mass killing at an unprecedented level.<p>You might say, if we don&#x27;t take it as a reference point to avoid in our spectrum of peace. But then again, I am not sure there will be much of human history to talk about with another WW level conflict. So that makes the whole point of using that as a reference pretty mute. Because then it is just accepting we are living in verge of armageddon. Pretty low standards of peace if you ask me.')
