It keeps things contained on HN and connected to HN and that&#x27;s how I prefer it. Also I have them handy when I&#x27;m on the site and can look things up when writing my own comments. When I&#x27;m not on HN I don&#x27;t need the favourites and should HN ever die I&#x27;ll probably not need them anymore anyway. I think you can easily fetch them as JSON with the API should you want to have them offline. Only downside I can think off is if you want to remember a comment privately for some reason, but that never happened to me so far.')
