I honestly don&#x27;t miss Google.<p>Every time I use !g I&#x27;m reminded just how bad it&#x27;s gotten. Between the SEO spam and ads I find myself scrolling at least halfway down the page to find anything even remotely relevant. I can&#x27;t say that DDG always has the &#x27;best&#x27; results, but at least they seem appropriate to what I&#x27;m searching for.<p>One thing I do wish DDG has is webmaster tools. I know they don&#x27;t do their own indexing, but it would be nice to have a way to get performance &amp; keyword data the way Google&#x2F;Bing&#x2F;Yandex etc present it.')
