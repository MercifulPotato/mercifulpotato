And why does Biden&#x27;s luck improve over time when _only_ mail in ballots are counted?<p>Cause voting is not luck based. Democrats are more likely to vote by mail. Partly because of covid, which they are more likely to believe is an issues. Plus, Trump and republicans discouraged mail voting and claimed it is fraudulent long before election. They did also tried to stop the mail counting and slow down post.<p>So, republicans were less likely to trust mail and more likely to vote in person.')
