Not everything doesn&#x27;t last&#x2F;changes fundamentally.<p>I would think there&#x27;s a version of 2920 in which nothing changed so much in how computers work (e.g. we&#x27;re not using personal quantum computers) that we&#x27;re not still using Linux (v87.9.2 or something).<p>But there&#x27;s equally another version in which we don&#x27;t need to sit down and compute because things just happen and even those things aren&#x27;t run from Linux robots because the robots we built 500 years from now decided a microkernel approach would be better and rewrote everything. Another in which we live on Mars and Linux doesn&#x27;t work there for some reason discovered 320 years from now.<p>I just think it&#x27;s not <i>obvious</i> the answer&#x27;s &#x27;none&#x27; which is at least how I read (what I took to be) your rhetorical question.')
