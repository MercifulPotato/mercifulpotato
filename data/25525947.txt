If you have the option of flying instead then surely that&#x27;s <i>always</i> better. If you&#x27;re driving it to save fuel, then you end up driving something that needs to drag all the parts necessary to fly around as well, which is far less efficient than a normal car. It seems like a crazy compromise that fails to capture the benefits of either flying or driving to me.')
