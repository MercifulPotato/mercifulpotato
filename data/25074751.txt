Like, if 2% of the deaths due to covid are indeed people who were going to die anyway, but may or may not have died a week earlier due to covid, well<p>1. They may have died a week earlier due to covid. Whose place is it to judge that? (there are measures that try to take into account loss of livable years, but they agree that Covid is pretty terrible)<p>2. Who cares if the estimate is off by a few percent?<p>So concern about this overcounting is predicated on an assumption that some significant number of people are on death&#x27;s door already, and that basically <i>only</i> those people are dying of covid.<p>Most covid-deaths are of people under 85 years old, and even an 85 year old has a life expectancy of 6 years though, so that seems unlikely.')
