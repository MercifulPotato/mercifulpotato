Kept the habit for 5+ years. Every day, wake up, type 750 words of whatever&#x27;s on your mind, move on. Takes about 6 minutes.<p>Over time my typing became fast and reliable enough that it just doesn&#x27;t need to be any faster. It&#x27;s as fast as I can think.<p>Shortcuts slow me down because they don&#x27;t fit naturally. They cause a hiccup in the brain. A little pause when you think of the right shortcut to use. So I never invested in shortcuts.<p>But take my ZSH history away and it&#x27;s like chopping off an arm. Maybe that counts as having a bazillion shortcuts.')
