Similar to how the GOP&#x27;s cozy relationship with fossil fuel industry drives a policy of inaction and denial for environmental regulation, I worry that the Biden administration and DNC apparatus will simply give a pass to these companies for violations of worker rights and individual privacy.<p>A good test would be to see if the Biden administration supports a US adoption of GDPR-like standards.')
