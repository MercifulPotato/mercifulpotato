I have heard of smaller numbers of people encountering issues (no denying that), but yet a greater number are still active...so i don;t know what to say...and it certainly isn&#x27;t my job to try and convince or convert to towards it if you&#x27;re not really interested.<p>&gt; ...documentation is confusing, the spec has been changed less than a year ago IIRC and different clients a at different stages of implementation.<p>An opinion on confusion around documentation is too subjective for me to comment on, and i&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re referring to user doc or developer doc or sys admin doc.  Regardless, many folks seem to be building plenty of clients, bots, bridges, services, etc. using the documentation. So i&#x27;d at least say the dev. docs seem to be sufficient for many devs.  While i do wish there were many more examples used in the dev docs, i have found them to be quite helpful and informative...but again, this is subjective.  As to the spec being changed, actually i believe there is quite some acceleration around this, and i feel that is good in these early days...I feel like we might want a dynamic spec at least to get things as best as possible...and then years later, slow things down to avoid breakage - but maybe that&#x27;s just me. Finally as far as the numerous clients, i think this is a good thing too.  Let there be plenty of creative attempts at &quot;getting this right&quot;, i say! Diversity is a good thing, and for apps&#x2F;clients too! ...and much like the presence of numerous email clients, many users might just have different preferences, so its great that the underlying protocol (and associated specs) allow (if not encourage) that.  Yes, eventually, after dust settles we might all congregate aroiund a small number of clients that are the &quot;best&quot;...but until then, it is still early days! I for one am enjoying my journey in the matrix world! (Caveat: I am not at all affiliated with any matrix project nor corporate entity, nor client dev. team, etc...I&#x27;m really just some random fan boy of matrix.)')
