The fact that the USB-IF hosts this paper on their own site seems to be a strong endorsement of their conclusions too.<p>It is worth noting that the RF noise generated by USB 3.0 covers a fairly wide spectrum from basically zero up to the mid-4 GHz range, but it gets discussed mostly in the context of interference with 2.4 GHz because most USB 3.0 capable devices don&#x27;t have any other radios in that range to interfere with.')
