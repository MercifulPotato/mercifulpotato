The worst-case is if  the FAA rules something like jets must be 100% disinfected between flights, which could be $250,000 or more per leg. (That is the case for some drug-resistant TB patient flights.)<p>But I&#x27;d estimate that international airline travel will take a year to start again after a vaccine is globally available, so in the area of 2 more years. I say globally because travellers were found to be skirting travel bans from China to the USA via legs to Africa and Canada.<p>The international airline industry really doesn&#x27;t have any corona answers at this time.<p>A gradual increase in air travel is unavoidable since unpickling airliners will take a considerable amount of time - each jet will take about a calendar week to prepare for inspection, consisting of one man-month of work. If problems are found, then longer.<p>(Airliners aren&#x27;t designed to sit for an extended period of time, so there&#x27;s all kinds of moisture, landing gear&#x2F;tires and corrosion issues that are possible. Big planes create big problems.)<p>Besides planes, another issue that will need to be addressed is that pilots need a variety of recurring training and medical certificates, so that would cause a spike in demand that can&#x27;t be met after a sudden re-opening.<p>Currently, the FAA has various modified rules and extensions, but those are temporary and the FAA is loathe to allow gaps in airmen standards.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ainonline.com&#x2F;aviation-news&#x2F;business-aviation&#x2F;2020-10-08&#x2F;faa-continues-extension-expansion-covid-relief" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ainonline.com&#x2F;aviation-news&#x2F;business-aviation&#x2F;20...</a><p>Source: commercially-rated airplane pilot.')
