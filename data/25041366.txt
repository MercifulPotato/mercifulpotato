Item(by='_RPL5_', descendants=None, kids=[25041699], score=None, time=1604965767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039354, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see how it could have played out any other way.<p>I suppose we are getting technical here, but at some point someone working for these governments (an actual person with a calculator) has had to sit down and do the math to figure out how much money needs to be set aside in order to achieve the advertised pension payout.<p>Who is that &quot;person&quot; in most cases, and why was their math so off? The math must have been very optimistic on the ability of the pension funds to compound wealth.<p>And so the facetious answer to your remark would be &quot;things would have played out much better for these governments if the person doing the math was more realistic about expected returns.&quot; Not sure how realistic that goal is in itself.')
