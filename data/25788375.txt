I think these are completely arbitrary limitations as a result of them needing to justify the cost of the server in the rack.<p>If you pre-pay for 72 hours straight, plausibly you&#x27;re going to be asleep and working&#x2F;learning for 2&#x2F;3rd of that time, which is all wasted time that you paid for.<p>My aim is to enable a player to buy X credits and pay by the hour. Parent gamer who only gets an hour of play in the evenings and a few in the weekend? Price conscious student who still wants a high quality MP server to play with friends? You get a lot more value for your â‚¬$5 this way.<p>My email is in my profile if anyone is interested in trying it out once I release the alpha version.')
