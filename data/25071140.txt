Although we claim our talent to be at top 5%, they are virtually at the same level as Toptal&#x27;s. Top 5% is less misleading than Toptal&#x27;s top 3%.<p>Also we believe, based on our previous experience, huge timezone differences can be a hurdle for remote work. So we aim to assign developers from similar timezones. Our US based clients will be assigned with Latin Am developers, where as our European clients will be assigned with European developers.')
