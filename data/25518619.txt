Really?<p>I&#x27;m sorry but this is exactly what tons of &quot;old&quot; businesses have done for ages. But they are being told over and over that that isn&#x27;t &quot;web scale&quot;.<p>In my old life we just scaled via the DB and were able to deploy as many copies of our monolithic services as we needed to scale. We had a few monolithic services (no, not microservices, really nothing micro about them at all) that even shared some core code through a library.<p>In my new life that is no longer wanted and we need microservices and multiple databases. Except that it&#x27;s all just logically split and in reality ends up in the same DB instance. But you know, we could scale it to a new DB instance if we ever needed to. Not that we will if you ask me because we run maaaany customers on the same database instance too. So it&#x27;s all fake and we could&#x27;ve just used the same old boring working fine approach as any old business. Go figure.')
