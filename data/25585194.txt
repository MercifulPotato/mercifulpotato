When the &quot;good guy&quot; narrative breaks down this far, society would reject violent video games as well.<p>There are games that toe the &quot;good guy&quot; line, most notably Grand Theft Auto. But GTA also has some of the most tame looking violence. I cannot imagine a GTA with the &quot;sadistic gaze&quot; of Mortal Kombat&#x27;s finishers being widely accepted.<p>This is especially more palatable if non-humans on receiving the violence. There is strong interest in killing aliens&#x2F;monsters&#x2F;demons&#x2F;robots, but I think it&#x27;s safe to say there is comparatively little interest in having sex with them.
