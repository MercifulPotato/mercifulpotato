That&#x27;s 9 miles away! A march of that length is practically a death sentence for a lot of these patriots! Trump is playing 4d chess as always.<p>Sure, some of them may have rascals or walkers to lean on, but that march might as well be 40 years in the desert. Stumbling, out of breath, leaving a trail of high capacity ar-15 mags emblazoned with the cross, and dragging a confederate flag through the mud like a starving sauropod&#x27;s tail, just after the meteor.<p>Trump new exactly what he was doing. Exercise for Americans!? He&#x27;s bold,you got to give him that.')
