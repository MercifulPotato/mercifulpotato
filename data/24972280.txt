It actually maxing out implies being done only because all supply is accounted for. A bigger &quot;value add - salary&quot; essentially moves towards the front of the queue for hiring.<p>If given two &quot;equal&quot; canidates why pay more if you don&#x27;t have to? (The actual equality given other complications like cultural, language barriers, and similiar is another topic.)<p>The &quot;fairness&quot; is also not mathematically viable as it assumes axiomatically that no action can be taken to earn profit that isn&#x27;t &quot;unfair&quot; as the deserved value is based upon output and not input provided, which leaves no room for expansion nor buffer and no incentive to actually operate a business.<p>TL;DR - most popular understanding of economics is pretty damn confused.')
