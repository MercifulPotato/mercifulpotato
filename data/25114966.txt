We were also ventilating people who didn&#x27;t need it. You don&#x27;t need an ICU bed if you aren&#x27;t vented. Furthermore, the mortality rate of being on an ventilator is non-negligible.<p>I would be interested in seeing if there is data to say whether being put in the ICU actually _increased_ risk of death. Of course this would be hard to prove as only the most sick went to the ICU etc.')
