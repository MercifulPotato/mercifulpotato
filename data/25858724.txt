I said US because &quot;the Bill of Rights only constrain government actions&quot; (which is what GP was saying with slightly different phrasing) is a very common talking point from American libertarians. I said &quot;morals and things worth encouraging&quot; to avoid using obvious examples of human rights (to avoid side-tracking the conversation) but okay here are some examples:<p>Slavery is an obvious and unquestionable violation of a person&#x27;s human rights -- and that is a true statement regardless of the fact it was not illegal in many countries until the late-1800s (it was a violation of their human rights at the time as well). Same goes for the right to vote -- or if you prefer the right to self-governance -- which was not given to women and minorities until the mid-to-late 1900s. The fact that laws did not grant these people their rights doesn&#x27;t mean their rights did not exist.<p>In addition it should be obvious that rights can be taken away by someone who is not an agent of a government. If you enslave someone it is a violation of their human rights regardless of whether it was sanctioned by a government. So (hopefully this was already self-evident) human rights also exist outside of government action.<p>That was the point I was making.')
