I don&#x27;t think that the argument goes with more funding Little Smalltalk would&#x27;ve been our software savior.<p>There sure was a lot of abandoned programming environments, but it was usually the enterprised that fathered them that killed it. NeWs was more interesting than pretty much all of its successors. And I&#x27;m sure the Lisp Machine or Oberon grognards are willing to chime in, too.<p>Everything being boring AF, both on the hardware and software side, certainly enabled Linux to succeed. It&#x27;s a lot easier to compete if the state of the art is libc and X11.')
