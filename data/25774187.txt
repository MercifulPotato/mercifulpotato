You still can&#x27;t do the things you want to do.  You can relax, travel (limited due to funds though), which are both nice for a while but eventually become frustrating.<p>My passions are expensive - too expensive unfortunately.  For example I could really do with a house to build things in, but I can&#x27;t afford to buy a house, so I can&#x27;t build the sorts of things I&#x27;d like to build in one.  And you should see the small factory I wish I could afford.<p>Even small stuff like attending conferences is too expensive if you can&#x27;t afford the travel and tickets.<p>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve come to see there are many situations where, if I&#x27;d had more money, things I tried to work on would have turned out very differently.  That&#x27;s the #1 reason I now pay more attention to income than I did for a long time, when I focused on voluntary work for what I thought was worth investing time in, with &quot;SWE side gigs&quot; to pay the bills.<p>&gt; When exactly are those passions supposed to be pursued? When retiring? I&#x27;m pursuing that now.  I have had 6-8weeks off in summer the last 10 years. I like to travel, etc.<p>Depending on what they are, it may have to be evenings, weekends, or when retiring.<p>That&#x27;a definitely a compromise.  But if you don&#x27;t have the money and your passion projects need money, it will probably be never.')
