His provided name of &quot;Jesse James&quot; was obviously fake and he was clearly sketchy (he claimed to have a PhD in physics, was the CEO of some AI-related startup, and various other outlandish things, and all that within the first ten minutes of speaking with him) but he seemed friendly enough.<p>The news of his murder was a pretty big shock locally. Everyone is talking about his youthful neo-Nazi fling but to me the most amazing part of this story is his past as a spammer. I read the book Spam Kings way back when and I clearly remember everyone hating these guys. Then fifteen years later or something, I&#x27;m chatting with one of those same guys at some local crag without knowing it. I know it&#x27;s a cliche, but life is strange.')
