Item(by='mistersys', descendants=None, kids=[25511032], score=None, time=1608666889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500894, text='Okay, why is there this attitude about dynamic typing vs. static typing that we can&#x27;t have debates about it? As if it&#x27;s an inherently subjective debate, not worth discussing? How is it ludicrous to say that for big programs, rules that allow the computer to automatically verify things for you can never be proven useful?<p>Modern statically typed languages are not the abtrusive, verbose dinosaurs of yesteryear. They can be used without type annotations quite often, and have almost no expressiveness limitations compared to dynamic languages.<p>I love clojure. It&#x27;s almost my favorite language, the syntax is amazing and the experience of using paredit and the many bespoke control flow structures that make your problems easy to model make it feel like God&#x27;s language. But yeah, debugging is massively painful. Stack traces are useless, and the lack of types makes errors pop-up in places you wouldn&#x27;t expect.<p>That&#x27;s not a subjective thing. It&#x27;s a weakness of the language. There&#x27;s no drawback to having optional static guarantees. Can we stop pretending this debate is not worth having?')
