Sometimes I find better results by first finding a good website in space of my query, and then searching within that site, as opposed to applying a specific query over all websites. Once example would be recipes: if you search for &quot;bean burger recipe&quot; you will get lots of results across many website, but some may not be very good, whereas if you already know of recipe websites that you consider high-quality or match your preferences, then you&#x27;ll find the best (subjectively) recipe by visiting that site and then searching for bean burgers.')
