What kinds of benefits do they get? In the US, the annual salary is $40-50K&#x2F;year - roughly half that of a tenure track faculty member. I just checked one university and picked a random post doc and a random <i>assistant</i> professor. Postdoc is getting $51K&#x2F;year, assistant professor is getting $110K&#x2F;year.<p>It&#x27;s fine if you do one stint, but a lot of people need to do multiple of them. It&#x27;s not all that unusual seeing someone approaching 40 before they get a tenure track position.')
