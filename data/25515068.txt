Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608705473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514359, text='&gt; Sure, if your requirement is that you pass regulatory muster, then lighting is &quot;simple&quot; in that you can buy an off the shelf bulb, socket, and housing. But those aren&#x27;t the requirements.<p>Yes they are.  You don&#x27;t get to point to random fancy things and call them &quot;requirements&quot;.<p>&gt; A phone light is just a little LED you could buy for a dollar and put on your keychain.<p>You&#x27;re taking &quot;phones have lights&quot; too seriously.  It was a deliberately vague and useless rebuttal to a deliberately vague and useless point.  The real answer is what I already said.  Replicating the functionality of a bulb&#x2F;socket&#x2F;housing is not hard to such an extent that the only reason to bring up lights is for jokes.  So the joke got a joke back.')
