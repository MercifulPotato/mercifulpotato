It&#x27;s not YOUR stuff that is basic, it is what you can find that is basic.<p>Many of the challenges that would lead to a revenue generating idea seem (to me) to come from something that isn&#x27;t regularly discussed - something basic along the pipeline that causes someone, somewhere down the pipeline a small and&#x2F;or large headache - with varying degrees of course.<p>Let us take a small peek at Stripe, they identified a piece of the puzzle by creating a solution for online business payments. That is awesome and all but I want to detract from that into a more manageable scale. What do you find is a headache, to any degree? Maybe a prebuilt excel sheet for those who don&#x27;t whelm the power of being an excel guru. Perhaps an app that allows drivers to simply upload a receipt every time they get gas to track average mpg - with some nice extras that could track mileage. The market is flush with these type of solutions. I think the real challenge is pushing beyond the idea of this mindset being challenging.<p>Think of all the moving parts vs the large scale. You&#x27;ll be sure to find something along the way, I guarantee it.')
