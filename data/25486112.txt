In my opinion, one of the best examples of this is to be seen in our films, videos and multimedia presentations, etc.  With very few exceptions, extremely tight editing is now the norm, scenes are cut to within an inch of incomprehension and there&#x27;s rapid switching from one scene to another and back again.  We now have the ridiculous situation where scene switching is so rapid that the set designer&#x27;s work is in vain as the viewer has hardly sufficient time to comprehend the foreground material let alone the background scenery. <i>(You can easily test this by recording some typical video then playing it back and asking typical viewers to explain what they&#x27;ve seen.  It&#x27;s devastatingly informative in the negative sense in that they miss almost everything!)</i><p>From my observation, this fast, ever-changing stimuli is harmful from the perspective that people now have a shallower grasp on reality&#x2F;everyday things around them than they once did when times weren&#x27;t quite so fast. What&#x27;s more troubling is that there seems to be no attempt to make people aware of the fact.')
