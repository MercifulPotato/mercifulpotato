A cynic would claim that this was a deliberate decision in order to create a much more robust, ethnically homogenous state that can more easily play up the &#x27;us vs them&#x27; division.<p>You&#x27;re also confusing &quot;China&quot; the CCP governmental apparatus, with &quot;Chinese citizens&quot; as individual people. When people criticise &quot;China&quot;, it is the former they are criticising. Confusing the two only serves to further play into the &#x27;us vs them&#x27; divide.<p>Both of these factors are commonly used by the Chinese state to frame anti-China sentiment as anti-Chinese sentiment - a very important difference.')
