Item(by='anarazel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603817766, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905513, text='&gt; I always see people recommending external pools like this here on HN. I&#x27;m wondering a bit about that as many frameworks&#x2F;libraries that use Postgres already implement an internal connection pool. Is this recommendation generally assuming that multiple applications will access the server? Or are there other reasons to prefer an external pooler over internal pooling in your application?<p>It&#x27;s pretty common to want <i>both</i>, particularly for larger installations. If you have more than one or two application servers the number of connections held by the &quot;internal&quot; pools can become pretty large. With naive configuration you often end up with each of the internal pools being substantially over-sized, due to handling some momentary imbalance between the application servers.<p>In particular if your workload allows to use transaction (or even statement) level pooling, you can get very large boosts by having those two levels of pooling. The application pools ensure the connection overhead is not incurred, the external pooler ensures the total number of connections is manageable.')
