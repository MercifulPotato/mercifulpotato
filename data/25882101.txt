Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611409115, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881425, text='Bullshit jobs are a product of low interest rates and low yield government bonds driving capital allocation elsewhere.<p>If CPI inflation is high that means there are not enough workers to do the most valuable work. Workers reallocate to more productive jobs and earn more money.<p>Interest rates usually follow CPI inflation. If interest rates are near 0% then you get lots of people starting stupid businesses. That&#x27;s fine if everyone is unemployed and thus would prefer a bullshit job over a productive job but once the pandemic is over it won&#x27;t be true anymore.<p>High interest rates force a company to be profitable enough to at least cover the interest payments. In theory the Fed should raise rates to at least 1% just to match current inflation but the economy is now full of bullshit and that bullshit is going to fail once the cheap money dries up. We can&#x27;t afford to do that during a pandemic but once it is over it is necessary to cull the useless zombies.<p>I may or may not have conveyed this in a dramatic way but don&#x27;t take this as a call to action. If you are invested in the stock market you should always make sure that you don&#x27;t put too much money into dead companies regardless of how well the economy is doing. Timing crashes or whatever is futile. Your personal goals (risk tolerance aka financial security and when you want to withdraw money) are more important and should be planned well in advance.')
