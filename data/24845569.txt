Wordpress commenting is a minefield, and from my experience has many issues - particularly around moderation. A lot of the suggestions in the comments here show there are a tonne of methods to integrate comments into a statically published website. Yes most of those rely on server&#x27;ful&#x27; implementations but you&#x27;know what that&#x27;s ok! I&#x27;ve been following &#x27;serverless&#x27; and &#x27;JAMStack&#x27; and whatever for years now and I think it is at a point of existential crisis. On the one hand you have the purists that want everything to exist in cached buckets otherwise it doesn&#x27;t count. These people are taking the &#x27;serverless&#x27; vibe a little too seriously for my taste. Yet on the other hand you have things like Nuxt, Next and Sapper - yes more frameworks - but these &#x27;meta-frameworks&#x27; embrace the great things about static content alongside the benefits of dynamic APIs. Some of the stuff that Vercel is doing is insanely good and makes it possible for small teams to implement rapidly and let ideas win out. At the core it feels this argument is a team of 8 devops, vs the two or three product people that are doing it all. I get that metal will always win, but I feel that there are compromises in technology that need to happen to get stuff made.')
