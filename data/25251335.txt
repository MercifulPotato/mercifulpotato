Nobody EVER reinvents the wheel. We all know about wheels, and how they work and why they are useful. But we invent new types of wheels all the time. Maybe we put teeth on it and invent the cog. Maybe we invent the tire to improve traction and reduce bumps. Maybe we put spokes between the hub and the rim and to reduce rotating weight. These are all new and useful inventions despite still being wheels.<p>Sometimes an existing wheel design is perfect for our use case, or at least good enough that creating a new one isn&#x27;t worth the effort. Sometimes a tweaked wheel is what we need. Sometimes a radical departure from established wheel design is required to make a new machine possible.<p>Build vs buy is an eternal question, and it&#x27;s reasonable to examine and reexamine it for any project. But &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; is just hyperbole.')
