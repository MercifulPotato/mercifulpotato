Oracle charged per tiered cpu so their incentives were not aligned with the dev’s. IMHO this is pretty damning reason to generally avoid using the db for this reason. It may be true that a db has lots of spare cycles to utilize but so do your hot spare servers, and I’d hope that you’re not trying to wring performance out of those without thinking long and hard as to what hot spare means.<p>Source: migrated code from oracle to mysql to avoid insane licensing fees once upon a time. Luckily we only had limited stored procedures at the time, most of which I could ignore.')
