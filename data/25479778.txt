When an app developer runs an ad on Facebook, and a user converts and buys the app, attributing that conversion requires “cross app tracking” that will be banned by this update. On the other hand, if the developer runs the ad though App Store search, Apple will be happy to attribute the sale to get paid. One could reasonably guess that the real purpose of this change is to take that market from Facebook.')
