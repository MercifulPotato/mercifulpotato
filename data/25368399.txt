People regularly quoted Osama bin Laden&#x27;s statements about how he did 9&#x2F;11 to force the US into overreacting. It may have &quot;normalised&quot; him to see that he had rational reasons for what he did, rather than being a religious maniac. But it didn&#x27;t make it right, and it didn&#x27;t lead to people flocking to his cause. If it had been censored, we might have had more people believing the harmful &quot;religious war&quot; frame, just from not knowing any better.<p><i>&quot;All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al Qaeda, in order to make generals race there to cause America to suffer human, economic and political losses without their achieving anything of note other than some benefits for their private corporations&quot;</i> -- Osama bin Laden')
