It&#x27;s sort of become low priority.<p>The main signal issue is that our router is in the garage next to where our internet comes in.<p>For a few weeks in the spring I was looking at setting up a wired network since all the phone jacks in our house are actually Cat5e cable that could be upgraded to ethernet jacks pretty easily.<p>But then I also lost ambition for that idea.<p>I did spend $20 a couple months ago to get a latest-generation wifi chip for my laptop, which I&#x27;d recommend to anyone since it&#x27;s a trivial thing to upgrade and I never even realized the wifi chips were swapable. That improved my network speed by a factor of two I think.')
