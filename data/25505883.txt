The results are indeed nice. But, to be honest, I have a Logitech 920 webcam and some decent lighting and that handles even making video recordings pretty well. &quot;Can&#x27;t buy&quot; seems like a stretch.<p>And for anything I&#x27;m streaming I&#x27;m frankly more likely to have issues because my Internet upload sputters than anything to do with the camera. And with the Logitech webcam attached to my monitor, the whole thing &quot;just works.&quot; If I had a newer model of Canon, I might have tried it but as it is I&#x27;d need to buy a converter.')
