If I was eating the first lab-grown chicken burger, I think I&#x27;d want to try it as plain as possible first (i.e. bun and maybe not much else).<p>Either way I&#x27;m happy about the progress. Maybe lab grown meat will stand a better chance of eliminating factory farming than plant based meats.')
