The moves up to that point don&#x27;t matter. Only the current state of the board matters and you make the best move given the current position.<p>Since when is reality like a game of chess? Setting aside human history for a moment, just think about natural history (Levandowski mentioned dinosaurs and Neanderthals). Evolutionary biology is to a significant extent a historical discipline - it looks at the record and tries to come up with ways in which animals have changed over time under all sorts of pressures. Can that endeavor be done a-historically? How about even something like cosmology - the origins of the universe etc.?<p>The universe is not a Markov process. Thinking of it as such is incredibly limiting as an intellectual paradigm.<p>To be honest I&#x27;m not even sure I can think of a way you can completely ignore history and still be able to do useful work of any kind.')
