Unfortunately, he&#x27;s the only one in the organization with such a background. After he left, nobody could debug clustering problems.<p>Need source and proof for this one<p>Please don&#x27;t post ridiculous opinions about things you are not familiar with, both Kubernetes and Orleans.<p>I have built successful products by  Orleans &amp; Kubernetes since two years ago, and now Orleans get better integration for Kubernetes than that time<p>edit: formatting &amp; typo')
