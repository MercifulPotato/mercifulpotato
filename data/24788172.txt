I became convinced that you could watch her whole YouTube channel and conclude that everyone around you is a narcissist.  This isn&#x27;t to say that she hasn&#x27;t made lots of good and valid content, but I find it ironic that she uses her own apparent charisma to exploit a topic and turn it into a catch-all for describing any cancerous individual.  I wouldn&#x27;t have much objection to this in isolation, except I presume her channel is monetized, which inherently changes my perception of her intention.<p>By contrast, Dr. Grande&#x27;s channel has more varied psychological content and comes off as more neutral than Ramani.  Although recently he&#x27;s been doing a lot more analyses of individuals than of broader subjects.<p>Someone who wants to understand narcissistic personality disorder should probably look up its commonly accepted definition, then watch Dr. Ramani&#x27;s videos and decide which ones matter and which ones really don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s just my opinion.')
