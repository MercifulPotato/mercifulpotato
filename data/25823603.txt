This is similar to the current debate about the second amendment.  The right to bare arms doesn&#x27;t mean we give everyone an M60.  The freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t mean that we should give everyone an unlimited megaphone to the world.  Licenses for the use of powerful technologies have been pretty effective in limiting the damages they can cause in untrained hands.  Maybe the solution to your troubles is a license to broadcast media on the internet.')
