You seem to forget that.<p>Maybe you just don&#x27;t have much experience, or don&#x27;t realize the vague descriptions police will use to bring folks in. Systematic racism makes this more likely if you aren&#x27;t white. Systematic racism is a big issue.<p>You can be arrested for being homeless or stealing food if you are starving (not everywhere has available shelters nor food pantries to go to, nor do shelters provide safe places for a family). I don&#x27;t think this is being deviant. They&#x27;ll sure charge you bail, though. And again, sometimes it is just a mistake. Live in a legal state and forget to take those joints out of the care before going to an illegal state? Well, now you have a drug charge. You can&#x27;t teach nor be a pharmacist now.<p>People get arrested for &quot;drugs&quot; that aren&#x27;t all the time (leaves, candy, etc), but I&#x27;m guessing you haven&#x27;t spent much time around the sort of person that gets stopped for this sort of thing (generally, just young and alternative-looking with a crappier-than-average car). Some of them go to jail waiting on the stuff to be tested.<p>Your experience isn&#x27;t broad enough. Just because you haven&#x27;t seen these things in your corner of the world doesn&#x27;t mean it is false.')
