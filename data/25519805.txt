I usually start my Spotify day by just playing the playlist (Liked Songs) so it goes\njust play the music on whats on top and go down to the first song I fav&#x27;ed.<p>- You are 2% basic. Oh wow The Contes and Crown Jewels! Your taste is so obscure that&#x27;s so cool I bet you&#x27;re super interesting..<p>This one got me :) I really like &quot;The Contes&quot; and &quot;Crown Jewels&quot;<p>-  You&#x27;re stuck in the early 2010s.<p>Hmm...
