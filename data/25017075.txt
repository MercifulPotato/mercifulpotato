My general advice prior to switching to Linux is: use open source applications under your existing operating system first and ensure the distribution works by testing it on the installation media prior to installing it.<p>The diving in head first approach has two big drawbacks.  You are learning everything at once.  That can be a painful process, particularly for people who know how to use a particular piece of software and have never generalized their skills.  The second problem is that Linux (or particular Linux distributions) doesn&#x27;t work well with some hardware.  It is easier to shrug that off if you find that out prior to installing and spending hours troubleshooting.<p>Two other thoughts: choose Linux for what it is rather than choosing it for what it isn&#x27;t.  If you&#x27;re switching to Linux because it is more performant on older hardware is good.  Switching to Linux because your old operating system is slow is setting a mindset to hate Linux.  Also keep in mind that switching to Linux is a personal decision and it&#x27;s okay to say that Linux is not for you.  No one is forcing the switch: not the old vendor you dislike and not the enthusiastic advocates.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this rubs some people the wrong way, but I believe that most of these articles are setting people up to hate Linux rather than embrace it.  That is saddening since it is a great operating system that makes life so much easier if you approach it with an open mind.')
