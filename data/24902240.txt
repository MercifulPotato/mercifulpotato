Cutting 30 sec to 15 helps little and the acceleration of compilation can&#x27;t catch up with the growth of packages in the long run. Also, multi-threaded precompilation sounds a bad idea on managed clusters where resource usage should be controlled. I wonder how much Julia devs have done on caching precompiled binaries. That, though non-trivial to implement properly, is the ultimate solution to slow compilation.')
