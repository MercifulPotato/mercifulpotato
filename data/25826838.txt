Like increase X by Y. That&#x27;s because it can guide your decision process of what you&#x27;ll spend your time on and what you won&#x27;t. It can also push for focused innovation around a particular area.<p>But I think OP meant what if you asked the sales team: How much time will it take you to close the deal with X? Would they be able to estimate that? Which is different from asking them: &quot;Try and close X Y% faster than it took us to close Z last time.&quot; The former would be asking for an estimate, the latter would be setting a goal.')
