When I first joined, he was 6 months late delivering his own project, which was eventually a year late, and that was the reason.  He was a drag on the entire team.  Rather than stand ups being a way of learning what everyone else was doing and offering help later, it turned it into guarded, cryptic, monosyllabic updates, lasting seconds.  He&#x27;d spend half an hour at someone&#x27;s desk after the stand up, trying to get up to speed on 3-6 months in 25 minutes to knock out a 5 minute solution that never worked.  He was asked to leave and productivity soared.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be a Mark&quot; is still a phrase in our company.')
