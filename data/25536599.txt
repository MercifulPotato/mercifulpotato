This gets you either 70% × 30% or 30% × 70%, both of which are 0.21. That’s only 84% of the expected 0.25. In general, longer sequences of heads or tails are too rare with this method (e.g. for four flips: 70% × 30% × 70% × 30% is 0.0441; only 70.56% of the expected 0.0625. The probability of 6 consecutive heads or tails is less than 60% of what it should be, etc.)')
