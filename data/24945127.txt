It reminds me of the different js frameworks fads.\nWhy would you use that in production, with no decent level of certainties about the status of the project long term?<p>Web is high level scripting, and lower level languages can be used by those high level languages to provide the required speed. The performance of those languages do increase over time with new hardware and discoveries. You can hardly do better than the concise syntax of php or python, depending on your preferences, in terms of performance vs code length.<p>To me programming has always been about obeying the KISS principle. Does using rust for the web corresponds to that principle? I&#x27;m unconvinced. Compare rust code to php code. php might be slower to process big operations, but big operations shouldn&#x27;t be left to php anyway. php is a high level scripting language. Contribute to php and writing an extension would be a better way to go in my opinion. This or another scripting language.')
