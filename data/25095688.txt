Thanks for the great comment.<p>This made me laugh: &quot;I sat in the same building while these things were going on.&quot;<p>I agree with you that starting point matters, and that context matters - such as sometimes doubling AWS costs would be better.<p>The nature of the advice is the science - using numbers factually works better. The nature of your feedback is the art - the types of accomplishments you choose to demonstrate reveals a lot about you as a professional.<p>To take our example of the doubling AWS costs to make better decisions. Well, how can you quantify those were better decisions. If it&#x27;s just by the feels, that&#x27;s not as effective. If you can quantify it - Helped team make decisions that led to x% improvement through database normalization - that is more persuasive than simply saying &quot;Improved team&#x27;s decision making through database normalization.&quot;<p>Hope that makes sense!')
