I never really quite got why Slack dev was not able to at least close the gap to Teams in this area. The video call feature is still buggy and lacks important features, such as inviting externals (by calendar invite) or sharing screen AND video, not to mention a whiteboard. If Slack had been a bit more ambitious in this respect, Teams would never have been an option.')
