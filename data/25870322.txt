Item(by='timvdalen', descendants=None, kids=[25872231], score=None, time=1611311238, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870285, text='Yes, this is what I used to to, but it has drawbacks.<p>If you only join from your phone, you can&#x27;t really see other participants (unless you use your front cam, and in that case your screen is obviously still very small) and you won&#x27;t be able to screen share.<p>If you join on both, you will be in the meeting twice (which can look weird to other people).\nIn my case, I want to use a dedicated microphone, not my phone&#x27;s microphone that might be blocked by the arm that is holding it in place.\nThat results in a weird AV delay since the audio is coming from a different user in the call (and it means your video is not highlighted when you speak).<p>In short - my current setup hides the implementation details and makes it all work transparently without bothering people I&#x27;m in a call with.')
