Moreover, English supports that order: it&#x27;s just not the canonical one. So it is not that alien. &quot;Yoda speak&quot; appears in sentences like &quot;In god we trust&quot;.<p>Japanese also deviates from its canonical order at times, by the way. For instance, sometimes the topic is extraposed to the end of the sentence, even after a supposedly sentence-ending particle like よ. E.g. &quot;ばかだよ私は&quot;.  Sometimes that can be because the speaker realizes mid-sentence that it requires a topic to be clear, and you can tell when this is the case when the topic is preceded by a pause. But it has a nuance of its own, so it is used deliberately, even in writing.')
