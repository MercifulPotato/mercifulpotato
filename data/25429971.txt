They basically never get the implementation of the latest thing correct, so you don&#x27;t want to wind up using it. I have the option to bring my own modem, so I just get a cheaper and slightly older modem and use that.<p>The prevailing issue is the way the US regulates ISPs leading to a lack of competition, giving them little incentive to do anything other than raise prices on a regular basis. While I have at least talked to technical support people who understand the concept of a cable modem being supported or not, there is no one available you can talk to who understands signal levels, etc. The only diagnostic they can perform is &quot;does speedtest show the advertised speeds&quot;.<p>There is still some sort of issue with the cable modem getting &quot;stuck&quot; in a bad state. I have a USB controlled relay that is used each morning to interrupt the DC power to the cable modem. This basically fixes it. I&#x27;m not awake when the modem resets so it is a non issue to me.')
