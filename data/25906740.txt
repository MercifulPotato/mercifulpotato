Worked ridiculously well, I never encountered even any rudeness from anyone and I had a few great partners. Aside from that I really do enjoy going to tech talks and stuff, talking about array functions and all that good stuff.<p>What I have noticed, and I completely blame the social media age for this is how rare it is for spontaneous conversations to happen. I was elated when a young man saw me writing python on my computer and asked what I was working on, a few years back. And I gave him some career advice he was a recent graduate.<p>A chance encounter like that can give him his first job.
