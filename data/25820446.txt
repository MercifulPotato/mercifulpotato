This is compounded by the fact that some instances host certain porn others instances don&#x27;t even want to cache, and many instances have block lists against the very permissive instances (not surprising, going by the Scott Alexander quote up thread as a testament to the kind of &#x27;witches&#x27; in these instances).<p>There&#x27;s some intelligent content on Fedi. Most of the content is just as vapid as regular social media, but written by a different group of people.')
