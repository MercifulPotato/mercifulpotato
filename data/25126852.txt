The have had numerous misfires on diversifying revenue, and they have been challenged on how to do that for a long time, but MoCo (Mozilla Corporation) has been profitable for quite some time due to the business deals with Google.  That funds Firefox and many other related projects.<p>The other thing that Mozilla needs is relevance, and over and above the presence of Firefox, MoFo (Mozilla Foundation) has played an activist role across many different initiatives, standards bodies, and lobbying.  That requires money, and because of the legal manoeuvring that Mozilla has done in structuring MoFo and MoCo it requires that Mozilla Foundation be largely self-funding.<p>Donations help with that, and pay for relevance in a way that Firefox alone can&#x27;t.  Please rethink the hostility towards donating to Mozilla Foundation.')
