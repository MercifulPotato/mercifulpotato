It is so nice to stop taking them and feel cozy and rest for a few days. The best description I have for it is that it feels like when you get home from a hard days work and are tired and go sit down in your sofa and just relax. Just that the feeling lasts for days! Awesome, right?<p>I hate being on the meds and I never take them when I don&#x27;t work, but I have to take them to do any kind of work requiring focus like for example filling out a form.')
