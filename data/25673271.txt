Item(by='bjtitus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610037647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672558, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not surprising that police don&#x27;t side with Democrats who vilify them for defending themselves<p>I honestly don&#x27;t disagree with this. However, I think it&#x27;s possible to believe that police are abdicating their duty instead of handling it like proper authority figures while simultaneously believing that the harsh rhetoric of some reformists isn&#x27;t helping the situation.<p>This cuts both ways since, as your comment indicates, we always blame &quot;Democrats&quot; or &quot;Republicans&quot; instead of identifying actual problematic behavior. &quot;Democrats&quot; are no more to blame for this than &quot;Republicans&quot; with their &quot;thin blue line&quot; which quite obviously pits the police against some underworld of crime (or, at this point, the &quot;radical left&quot;) instead of presenting the reality that police work for and with the community.<p>&gt; Consider the killing of Walter Wallace, one of the &quot;psychiatric incidents&quot; you&#x27;re talking about<p>Cases like this are a very real concern amongst police, EMS and fire in many jurisdictions. I don&#x27;t think it should be swept under the rug. On the other hand, police, in particular, have vast amounts of leeway and are often not held accountable (certainly not criminally) in many cases that go the opposite direction of the one you describe. This is evident to everyone reading this, I&#x27;m sure.<p>There are no easy solutions but I&#x27;m tired of police departments acting entitled. Refusing to perform your job and acting like the legislature + the reform minded public is your enemy does not help anyone. Responsibility lies in police chiefs, police unions&#x2F;brotherhoods, and the executive and legislative bodies of our local governments to work together.')
