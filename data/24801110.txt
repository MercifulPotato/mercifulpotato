The generations after the Baby Boomers have not saved terribly much, and as they begin to age and retire the social pressure to support them will get higher and higher (which is good: one doesn&#x27;t want folks to be indigent).  But ultimately that is likely to mean legalised raids on the retirement accounts of those who <i>did</i> spend.<p>Why save today if it will just be confiscated in a couple of decades?  Might as well spend today and enjoy whatever one buys.  Or buy portable wealth â€¦')
