May sound snarky, excuse me, but this is related to the grandparent mentioning new challenges. Maybe you&#x27;ve taken a recipe to life, instead of living it. Maybe your put in an effort to follow (your own) rationalizations (like money), seeded by dominant patterns, instead of relating to what&#x27;s good, socializing with what&#x27;s good, finding out what&#x27;s good and empowering what&#x27;s good. Which would, partly, mean starting from scratch.<p>Note that you can&#x27;t buy the answers to these questions with money. They may also turn out to be so elusive, as society has seemingly no use for them, that you&#x27;ll end up going back to the job, kinda defeated, but with a new appreciation of purpose.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m just suggesting things here, and you should ignore me and watch the [best movie on the topic](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P9-FCC6I7u0?t=79" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;P9-FCC6I7u0?t=79</a>) and explore the insanity on display. Sorry.')
