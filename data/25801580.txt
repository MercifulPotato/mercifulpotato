I struggled through rewrites of JS from jQuery -&gt; Backbone -&gt; Vue -&gt; Webpacker + Vue until the &quot;head of IT&quot; went off to do marketing where he was better suited. Now that I have the reigns, we&#x27;ve been slowly removing as much JS as makes sense and we&#x27;ve never been happier, more productive and relatively bug-free.<p>But we still have the requirement of &quot;near instant&quot; front-end for certain things. And this is precisely the sort of thing that a team of RoR devs can really get behind and do well. Rather than try and cram yet another JS paradigm and DSL into their heads only to be forgotten when the next one rolls into town.<p>Personally I&#x27;m a Phoenix&#x2F;LiveView champion, but we&#x27;re a Rails shop and I know better than attempt The Big Rewrite. So this really fits the bill.')
