I actually think making a comparison like that would be interesting and constructive.<p>Because it’s difficult to compare the events of this summer (a spontaneous response to the murder of George Floyd,choked to death under the neck of a police officer for over three minutes, on video, I’ll remind you) to the armed mob that invaded the Capital, threatening to kill or take hostage the entire Congress and the Vice-President, killed a Capital police officer, and planted pipe bombs in the Capital.<p>I think it would be easier to compare that event, since it’s a singular event, to another singular event, rather than a long series of events as I said.<p>What do you think?<p>[EDIT: Oh yeah the mob was also attempting to stop the process of certifying the results of the Presidential election. So much wrongness to have to remember.]')
