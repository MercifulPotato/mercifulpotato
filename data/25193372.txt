According to anybody who&#x27;s not blinded by partisanship.  The objective reality is that there is no path to a Trump victory.  That ship sailed weeks ago.  All that&#x27;s left is Trump desperately trying to somehow prevent the inevitable, and looking hopeless, desperate, and delusional in the process.  That&#x27;s the reality.<p>And Biden isn&#x27;t &quot;my&quot; guy.  I don&#x27;t particularly want him.  (Didn&#x27;t want Trump, either, and I got them both, one after the other.)<p>And:  &quot;win&quot;?  Biden won.  No &quot;quotes&quot; about it.')
