And on top of that, most of the engineers I hire will either be of worse quality than FAANG or I&#x27;m going to have to pay them more than FAANG. While this is great for the employees, it&#x27;s really hard to fit into the budget for many startups and the tradeoff becomes existential when the cost of your engineers starts adding up but you haven&#x27;t found market fit yet. And the ever-increasing wages being used to draw people from one company to another just keeps making the Bay Area more and more unaffordable so the problem keeps compounding.<p>It works nicely when there&#x27;s just one or two big companies to draw employees from, but there&#x27;s just so many big SV companies now with billions of dollars in their pockets, I don&#x27;t see how any true startup could possibly compete. If you don&#x27;t like Google, you go to Uber. Or Facebook. Or Splunk. Or Airbnb. Or Yelp. Or Twitter. Or Facebook. Or Salesforce. Or Workday. Or Juniper. Or Autodesk. Or Nvidia. Or Palo Alto Networks. Or...<p>There&#x27;s just too much competition from the billion-dollar companies. Sure innovation and entrepreneurship still happens in SV, but I&#x27;d argue it would be better for the area if it were easier for smaller startups to compete.')
