I used a lot of “if” statements and “for example” and future tense, and “as a result of the recent election” (so not relating to this summer’s unrest). I even used so many weasel words like “whether or not that’s his intention” and “true or not” and “what people are seeing”. None of that in any way implies a genuine belief or does it imply I’m speaking about something that actually happened in the past.<p>I then linked to an article that shows this hypothetical future situation <i>has actually happened</i> in the recent past, billionaires fleeing to safety while their employees suffer and die. If that’s “QAnon levels” of “conspiracy madness” then holy fuck we’re screwed because this <i>has actually happened</i>, and <i>recently</i>, as shown in the article I linked to. And the fact that it actually happened is the reason people assume that’s what he’s doing now... because the same thing actually happened earlier this year with other billionaires.<p>I mean, I went <i>way</i> out of my way to explicitly avoid comments like this and it seems like you just ignored all of that and read exactly what you wanted to read. That’s not the level of discourse I expect from HN.')
