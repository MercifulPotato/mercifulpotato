As a kid, we did an experiment where a cigarette was &quot;smoked&quot; by attaching a tube to the cigarette filter, the tube exited at the bottom of a flask filled with water, and a pump would suck the air from the top of the flask.<p>It didn&#x27;t take long before the water would turn black.<p>Quite a turnoff for wannabee smokers, which was the obvious point of the experiment.<p>It&#x27;s the same idea as the Rainbow vacuum cleaner, which uses a tank of water as its filter.')
