Many on the right saw the Obama years as chaotic and flawed, acquiescing to foreign powers, allowing immigration that lead to terror attacks, etc.<p>One thing we can &quot;post mortem&quot; about this election is that people on the left such as yourself are not able to conceptualize other viewpoints.  Other political viewpoints you describe as chaos and flawed and you want to &quot;engineer&quot; the goverment to prevent other viewpoints, and thus other political parties.<p>Another thing on the left is that censorship has been fully embraced by the left in a dishonest way.  While its true people are banned for violating communtiy guidelines, there is also weasel censorship such as hiding comments under the guise they might offend so that if users want to see alternative viewpoints they have to click &#x27;show more comments&#x27;.  Deplatforming and shadow banning non-leftist ideas has also taken root.<p>Both of these things eagerly adopted and used in this campaign cycle are Unamerican and dangerous.  Your road to good intentions clearly leads to hell, and you are unable to recognize it.')
