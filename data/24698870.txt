Isn&#x27;t the point of Classic to keep it in a certain period of time? When many people started the game and thought it was at its &quot;peak&quot;?<p>On a side-note: would it be interesting to have a second branch of the game, maybe not called Classic, that would follow the main-line of the game, but would be a large chunk of expansions behind? That way people could relive those old expansions as if they were the latest one released. Personally, I think I would be much more on board with that since the game would actually <i>change</i> over time.')
