I say this coming from the Ag side because farm labour is grossly underpaid and exploitative. But we can’t raise the cost of food because raising cost of food to pay for labour means more people will find food dear.<p>It’s wages chasing price chasing wages. And we need more and more food for exponentially increasing population with a smaller work force and lesser land. Only solution is to eliminate such jobs and automate field Ag.<p>And grow indoors as much as possible. Indoor Ag can increase productivity, use less land and water and also can employ workers from an educated pool because automation requires some skill. So we are also tackling unemployment instead of exploiting poor undocumented immigrants and paying them slave wages.<p>I see amazon warehouse jobs with low pay the same as farm workers doing repetitive manual work. Automate. Automate. Automate.')
