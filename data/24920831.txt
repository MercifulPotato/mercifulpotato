I was planing on writing compiler (first reading more about compilers) maybe it would be simpler than I thought.<p>But still I think that `((. console log) &quot;hello&quot;)` is not as nice as `(console.log &quot;hello&quot;)` as in LIPS. My old code was using the same syntax but I&#x27;ve changed the interpreter and you now can use dot notation on any JavaScript objects.')
