I&#x27;ve been thinking of an idea that for us knowledge sharing resembles neuron connections, based on my limited knowledge of that topic. Each of us watches a few channels of information and makes a choice to forward&#x2F;retweet a piece of information so your subscribers would see it, ignore it or block a channel if it sends you bogus data. Every time we do this, we adjust the rating of the source. So I&#x27;ve been thinking that if we could set up such a network in a more formal way, and if the network would grow to at least a few thousand &quot;neurons&quot; (that are people), would it exhibit some unexpected higher level effects?')
