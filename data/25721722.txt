Nothing is more irritating than someone&#x27;s (or your own) poor connection that makes people ask each other to repeat, watch participants freeze, wait, waste time trying to reconnect etc. etc.<p>Can it be solved? Degrade the quality, compress more but deliver the human speech as nicely as possible, on time. I feel not all options have been tried in this area yet.')
