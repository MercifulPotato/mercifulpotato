I think he said it was &quot;20cm&quot;. He was showing anyone interested Jupiter and Saturn, which I remember appearing about outstretched-finger-width.<p>Later, we somehow attached my camera to the telescope -- it must have just screwed on to the front, as you would attach a filter, since it&#x27;s not a DSLR with a removable lens. It does have an excessively long zoom (600mm, it&#x27;s a Sony RX10 Mk IV).<p>It took some fiddling to get the two devices to work together.  We had to realign the telescope by finding stars on the camera&#x27;s screen, work out where to manually focus the camera, and what settings (noise reduction etc, as well as ISO, aperture, shutter speed and so on) to use.<p>Combined, we were able to take these photographs of some nebulae[2-3] and a galaxy[4].  I don&#x27;t remember, but I think the point was that these were not visible just by looking through the telescope.<p>It&#x27;s a reasonably expensive camera, but gave noticeably better results than the astronomer&#x27;s own Canon EOS 760D.  If you don&#x27;t have something similar, try borrowing a friend who likes wildlife &#x2F; bird &#x2F; sport photography or similar.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;13.jpg?w=2400&amp;h=1800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;13.jpg?...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;12.jpg?w=2400&amp;h=1800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;12.jpg?...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;17.jpg?w=2400&amp;h=1800" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matt.blissett.me.uk&#x2F;photos&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2018-09-04-1&#x2F;17.jpg?...</a><p>(All are 30s exposures at f4 with ISO 8000.
