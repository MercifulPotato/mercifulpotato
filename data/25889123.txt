Hard to imagine going back to worse performance.<p>And it takes less time overall too.<p>Total win!<p>I do go to the office when physical things have to happen.  Our business is a mix of software, hardware, service.<p>And I time shift physical stuff to o&#x27;dark 30 in the morning, so there is some overlap, but not much.  And sometimes a whole day is needed, or a long one.<p>Frankly, I no longer care because most days are home days and I have a nice place to work setup just the way I like it.<p>The biggest benefit, outside the commute savings and other easy items mentioned here is no longer worrying about an emergency or crunch of some kind.<p>Shit happens.  Ok fine.  We all just step right up and deal.  Whatever it takes.  And we are ready for it, nicely charged up, ready to nail it.<p>On the social front, a bunch of us in my industry ended up on Zoom. We miss all the shows and some of us miss the travel (I don&#x27;t and was high travel), but we connect now more than ever!<p>SMS, Skype, Zoom, email just work!<p>Frankly, I know my industry peers way better than I did before and things like mentoring or being mentored, help finding everyone a gig, all are improved.<p>Like I said, net win for my niche.  I rather doubt there will be much of a discussion about a return to before, other than travel.<p>And on that front, I poured a lot of time into eliminating the need for it.  It will prove to be a killer investment and the time freed up made doing it possible without also cutting into home life.<p>And the little things matter.  We have a young one in our home again.  One of my kids fell into drugs. Sucks.  I am raising my grandchild.<p>Normally, I would find that depressing, but I can interact a lot more, be present, and those things do not take much time, but also may need to happen at the right time.<p>Which 10 minutes can have a huge impact!  At best, it all is a modest time shift and or longer work day when needed and balance is good otherwise.<p>Count me as a fan.  Who knew!  I went into this pandemic very critical and a bit depressed and worried.  Many shut down.<p>We have thrived.  It is good.')
