More so if critical.<p>I even treat my own gmail account with resignation these days.<p>My Picasa, my rss, my google chat.<p>Am i wrong to have never touched these cloud services?<p>I prefer dedicated servers even over AWS, too.<p>Edit: spellink<p>Edit2: people downvoting me to hell .. i have to defend my internet points a bit here ..<p>How should i treat these google services if not with this nihilism? Amazon isn&#x27;t killing products.<p>Ill admit to liking kube, but mostly because its open source and “out there” where no one can kill it.
