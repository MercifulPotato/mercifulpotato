The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small. Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.&quot;<p>Personally speaking I went a competitive college where many of my classmates were from such H.S., they really were a cut above in terms of math and science. Of course I don&#x27;t think STEM is the end-all-be-all, and I don&#x27;t think getting rid of TJHSST is going to solve the country-wide equity problem due to race.<p>But if there&#x27;s sports magnet schools like Montverde and Sierra Canyon, then maybe there could a be a place like TJHSST and such?')
