You might find that surprising, but you shouldn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; unlikely to impress<p>It was a straightforward rundown of why it was unsound to push the argument you were pushing and your failure to acknowledge that, even after having already pointed it out once before.  I truly do not give a goddamn about impressing you.  (Although it&#x27;d be nice if you reflected on how annoying it has been to carry out this conversation in this way.)  This will be my last reply.<p>&gt; The specific comment I replied to (not the main discussion topic as you assumed)<p>As _I_ <i>assumed</i>?  Who&#x27;s setting the stage for discourse?  It&#x27;s not you.<p>&gt; you could politely respond with<p>Oh, gee.  My apologies for inconveniencing you while you&#x27;re barraging me with a thousand hypothetical tangents that <i>could</i> be true instead of demonstrating the &quot;common sense and ordinary charity&quot;[1] of a &quot;good faith correspondent&quot;.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s how informal language works<p>And during the barrage, where your justification for it focuses on the particular way that I worded a restatement of the premise <i>n</i> comments deep, but where I failed to sufficiently qualify it by exhaustively restating all the constraints to affirm that they are, in fact, relevant and in play, you think you&#x27;re in a position to hand out lessons about &quot;how informal language works&quot;.  Great.<p>&gt; You hand-waved vaguely about &quot;Netscape&quot; and &quot;lessons&quot;<p>Nope.  That comes from the comment where I referenced Netscape&#x27;s triage process for the very first time.  It&#x27;s called an allusion at that point—I didn&#x27;t make a claim about it, get pushback on it from you, and then <i>handwave</i> it away.  And if at that point you want more detail about the thing alluded to, then, yeah, you can ask for it, <i>but</i> if you go on to be as discourteous as to derail with another annoying strawman—after having already been called on it once—then you shouldn&#x27;t expect me to respond as if I&#x27;m dealing with anything other than a <i>bad faith</i> correspondent wasting my energy with the level of tedium you&#x27;re dragging me into.  So, given that, and given how excruciating this has been, I&#x27;m not going to deliver those details, nor wrap it in a bow.<p>Here&#x27;s some stuff that you can Google if you actually do give a shit about any of this and weren&#x27;t just looking for some avenue to throw away time as part of a vaguely social activity:<p>&quot;Life Cycle of a Bug&quot;, UNCONFIRMED, INVALID, INCOMPLETE<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pchiusano.github.io&#x2F;2014-10-11&#x2F;defensive-writing.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pchiusano.github.io&#x2F;2014-10-11&#x2F;defensive-writing.htm...</a>')
