Math equations are much more complex, with more symbols, 2D placement. So we need to &#x27;mark up&#x27; the normal texts to provide enough information for a proper math equation.<p>Current machine learning can help translate hand-written equations into the one computer can understand, I think this can help a lot. However, if we want to use keyboard only, it still seems very hard to design a system that can input math as smooth as texts without &#x27;mark up&#x27; or GUI.')
