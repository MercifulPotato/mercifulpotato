Software people could talk about ASICs and CPU instructions, and the hardware people understood the software stack. Every aspect of what it takes to make a computer work was represented in one building: analog hardware, chip design, motherboard design, compiler design (objective C), loader, operating system, windowing system, application layer, and applications. Where other companies had engineering teams, NeXT would have a single individual.<p>This is in stark contrast to most of today&#x27;s companies, where you have front-end engineers who don&#x27;t know anything about the backend they are interacting with, backend engineers who don&#x27;t care about the frontend they are serving data to, database engineers who care about neither, etc.<p>And that&#x27;s just software. The hardware might as well be a black box for the vast majority of software engineers working at your average software company today.<p>Where did we go so wrong?')
