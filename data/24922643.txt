Buzzard says a little bit about this in the blog post I linked, which is a highly compressed version of what I&#x27;d write; if you&#x27;re curious, maybe read that.<p>I&#x27;ve talked to more than &quot;a few people,&quot; about this, and I think it&#x27;s clear I&#x27;ve thought more about the sociology of this issue than just chatting with Tom Scanlon or whoever over a beer one night. I stand by what I said about that earlier, along with my comment that you ought to talk to a wider variety of mathematicians if you think there&#x27;s some broad consensus that HoTT is important. (Start with the PDE and numerical analysis people, for example.)<p>Anyway, sticking purely to objective metrics, how many young mathematicians (postdocs) who work primarily on HoTT have ever been hired by R1 universities to tenure-track positions? Surely if this were seen as an important area, departments would want to snatch people in that field up, right? (I&#x27;d even accept examples of postdocs at these schools working on HoTT, though this represents a far less serious commitment by the department.)<p>This is (in principle â€“ you&#x27;d have to collect it) publicly available information, which anyone reading this exchange can check on. (Look for assistant profs at schools listed as R1 on Wikipedia.) Maybe I&#x27;m forgetting someone, or not knowledgeable enough, but I can&#x27;t really think of any.<p>(ER at Johns Hopkins was the first name that popped into my head, but she doesn&#x27;t count because she has only a single HoTT paper among dozens, and it was written after she was hired.)<p>Another metric: how many HoTT papers are there in top mathematics journals? Annals, Inventiones, etc.?')
