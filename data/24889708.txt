If you were better moderators I might take your guidelines more seriously.<p>My thread with counter-arguments is detached and languishing at the bottom of the page, meanwhile all of the misinformation dominates the conversation comfortably from the top. This is a gross failure of the moderation on HN. Are you a human script, enforcing the guidelines with blinders on? Or are you a moderator, helping to craft thoughtful and good faith discussions, and to combat misinformation and propaganda?')
