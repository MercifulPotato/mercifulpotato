Unfortunately for this person, the program’s rules don’t let it send back out the kind of currency he added. It’s like if you tried to drop off Euros at an American bank and instead of telling you they don’t accept Euros, they put it in the cash register and, when you asked for it back, told you they can’t give out Euros. The question is whether someone can figure out how to modify the program to accept more currencies (even though the program was designed to be immutable).')
