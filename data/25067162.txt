My friends asking me for advice when buying a new computer, they care about the price, not speed. They assume that anything at 300 or 400 Euro will be good enough for their needs and they&#x27;re right. Only one of them ever asked me about a Mac but went back to looking at some low end Windows laptop after I gave them the link to the page with the price of the Macs. It&#x27;s not that all of them cannot afford a Mac, they can&#x27;t just see what they gain for the extra cost.')
