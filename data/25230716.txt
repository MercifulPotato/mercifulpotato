That&#x27;s over half! And that&#x27;s only the people with the fortitude or optimism to talk to HR (HR is notoriously useless at many companies). That&#x27;s a complete disaster. 15 of that 20 quit! Why wasn&#x27;t that treated as an emergency?<p>*At the end the article says at the end of 2019 there&#x27;s 31 Black employees of 1000. At the beginning of the article about the beginning of 2019 it&#x27;s about 20 of 600 before 15 Black employees quit.')
