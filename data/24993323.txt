We should also encourage mail&#x2F;absentee ballots for everyone in every state.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;how-to&#x2F;how-to-track-your-absentee-ballot-by-state" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcmag.com&#x2F;how-to&#x2F;how-to-track-your-absentee-ball...</a> (How to Track Your Absentee Ballot by State)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Estonian_identity_card" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Estonian_identity_card</a>')
