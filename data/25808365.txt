What we <i>can</i> determine is that matrix.org on its own has &gt;10 million accounts [2] (search for &quot;global visible accounts&quot; in the link).<p>&gt; Hosting an own server is not possible on a small root server you can get for 5 EUR&#x2F;USD a month, it requires signifcant [sic] resources<p>A direct example of setting up Matrix is shown here [3], using a $20USD&#x2F;month Digital Ocean droplet. It&#x27;s a reasonable approximation, though inexact, as we don&#x27;t know how many users this server will be supporting. This example is thrown further off, as it&#x27;s the Matrix project lead setting up the server. He&#x27;s likely in many rooms with high user counts and, as high user counts dramatically increase resource needs, likely needs more RAM and CPU than someone setting up a server for a group of friends.<p>I think it&#x27;s gotten much easier to stand up a matrix-synapse server than when you last tried, and suspect you left with a bad taste after joining popular rooms that (due to how many users they have) lag much more than you&#x27;d typically experience. Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong and you did everything right just last week and still don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;d encourage more people to see for themselves :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;26&#x2F;matrix-and-riot-confirmed...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;element.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bwmessenger-goes-live-for-bundeswehr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;element.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bwmessenger-goes-live-for-bundeswehr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dDddKmdLEdg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dDddKmdLEdg</a>')
