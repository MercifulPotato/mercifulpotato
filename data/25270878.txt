Problem: your new asset has 0 liquidity. Right? Because there isn&#x27;t a market for it. If you get it listed somewhere, there still won&#x27;t be a market until people start placing buy and sell orders. So, can ethereum fix this? Yes! With an automatic market maker like uniswap. Put your 1M fresh tokens in a pool alongside some ETH. We&#x27;ll say this pool will obey the law x<i>y=k, x and y being the two tokens. We&#x27;ll also say that the exchange rate shall be x&#x2F;y.<p>Now anyone can come along and transact with you and the liquidity is already there! No order book is required. The price is quoted and tokens are added&#x2F;removed from pool in accordance with x</i>y=k. You get a fee for being nice enough to supply the liquidity. Oh, and anyone can supply their own tokens and split the fees with you. Wa-la.')
