Someone&#x27;s bound to do this again<p>The part about whether they should have been born or not, which was the ethical thing is what tears at me.<p>Is it right to create something that may be similar to us and then not even give it a chance to live?<p>I mean whether creating such a being is right or not in general i&#x27;m sure is up for debate.<p>I&#x27;m not religious, but if we&#x27;re going to play god, shouldn&#x27;t we take responsibility for the results of our creation?<p>I dunno, I find a lot of genetic engineering research to be a bit unsettling. We&#x27;re playing with things we barely understand that could have consequences we can&#x27;t even imagine.<p>Nature took a long long time to get to this point where life has come to a sort of balance.
