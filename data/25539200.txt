Indexes would likely remain the very fastest strategy.<p>An optimization theoretically exists which <i>could</i> make tuple splitting as fast as index accounting (representing split results as slices&#x2F;views into the original tuple), but I do not believe python does that, as it would cause unexpected memory growth in some situations, unless accompanied by a very specialized garbage collection scheme.')
