Item(by='mabbo', descendants=None, kids=[25302774], score=None, time=1607092486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302128, text='Luxembourg has some laws like this already, or so I&#x27;ve been told.<p>I worked for a little while on a project with a team based out of the Luxembourg office (Amazon). They mentioned casually that it&#x27;s illegal for them to be paged from like 10pm to 6am. Not that the company policy forbids it, that the LAW forbids it and the company would be in serious trouble.<p>If the company needs an overnight on-call operator, they have to hire one (or, in Amazon&#x27;s case, just have a team in Seattle, 9 hours offset, handle night on-call).')
