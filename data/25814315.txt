Item(by='kdbg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610913460, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813728, text='This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but there are two serious issues with this article and a lot of advice about getting into the offensive side of the security industry.<p>1. Certifications do not matter anywhere near as much. Also its clear the author didn&#x27;t do their research since OSCE is no longer a cert you can get, and it has basically always had a bad reputation by anyone actually aware of its content. It just tended to get included on job listings because its from OffSec. Its not that certifications hurt you, though they are not all that important either, not necessary by any stretch of the imagination.<p>2. Cybersecurity is a much wider field than just offensive network security aka network penetration testing. The advice here is central to pentesting, the defensive side of the industry is a different beast so it makes sense to talk about them separately but I wish they&#x27;ve make it clear what they are talking about. Kinda related to this is the idea that the only &quot;offensive&quot; job is in network security, there is the whole &quot;application security&quot; side of the offensive security industry. And, a lot of people fall into pentesting thinking they&#x27;ll eventually reach the point of getting to dsicover their own 0days and such, and nope...thats application security for the most part. AppSec guys assess specific applications for issues, Netsec guys test the entire network for issues, generally spending a couple weeks discovering an 0day in some software that company didn&#x27;t write would be frowned upon because its basically just free testing for that other company and only indirectly helps the company that hired. The advice here generally isn&#x27;t too useful if you want to go for appsec, and I wish more people would talk about the difference instead of assuming everyone wants to do netsec.<p>--------<p>So with that rant out of the way, the single best thing you can do is just &quot;get good&quot;. Seriously, you can split the types of jobs available into three categories, internal teams, external contractors&#x2F;consultants, and research teams. Internal teams tend to be the most competitive hiring. Not because they are the best jobs, but because they are usually limited positions. Maybe hiring for one or two slots at a time, so they need to choose the least-risky person. So, certifications help you to not get filtered out as does experience. These places often mean you&#x27;re a &quot;cost-center&quot; within the wider company, so its not actually that desirable of a job to hold but there are fair reasons to go that route but because of the limited slots being filled, its harder to start there. There are a ton of consultancies though, where the security guys are actively making the company money (so treated pretty well) and because of that they are more willing to take a risk on a new hire. Many consultancies (and there are a lot of small ones) have hiring paths for people without the formal education and experience. Generally in the form of a take-home challenge which allows someone who would otherwise be rejected to demonstrate they know how to do the job and get the same interview anyone else would. Pass the interview, get the job. Its usually not heavily limited in terms of slots, so when someone competent comes along they get an offer. Its really one of the awesome things about offensive security imo, its a &quot;direct entry&quot; position. If you have the skill its pretty likely you can get a job doing it.<p>(disclaimer: bit of self-promotion incoming) I recent got fed up with the content I was seeing out there and recorded a discussion video talking about various aspects of getting into the industry with a friend who has also been involved with hiring. We recorded nearly two and a half hours just talking about different aspects, I split it up into four separate discussion on youtube. Not the greatest format to get the information across I&#x27;ll admit, but it was the easiest to capture a lot of relevant information from:<p>- About the jobs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eJ96cH-U4ag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=eJ96cH-U4ag</a> [45 minutes]<p>- About Formal Qualifications (certs and education): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hxGNSGY09Q8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hxGNSGY09Q8</a> [20 minutes]<p>- About Less-Formal qualifications (projects and such): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8Y3h0Kbuh1o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8Y3h0Kbuh1o</a> [30 minutes]<p>- About the actual hiring process: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7n5we_VtMSM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7n5we_VtMSM</a> [45 minutes]<p>Obviously I&#x27;m pretty biased about my own content, but honestly I ended up in security by accident, I had always heard how hard the security industry was to break into, and it actually motivated me to not even try. While my time as a developer certainly wasn&#x27;t wasted, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought into that and had focused on improving my security skills sooner because its difficult to break in if you don&#x27;t have the skill, there are very few junior positions, but there is such a need for skilled people that if you are able to do it, the jobs are available.')
