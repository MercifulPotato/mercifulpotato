If necessary, I can look at the disassembled code, because it&#x27;s reasonably feasible to map assembly language to C++ constructs.<p>I currently write more C++ then python. I&#x27;m primarily a C++ programmer. This was not the case for most of my career it is now, so I have enough experience from both perspectives.<p>The python debugger can display the stack and you don&#x27;t have to compile it in debug mode. The pycharm debugger is excellent, but even if you don&#x27;t use that pdb libraries can drop the app itself straight into a debug console with one line of code...<p><pre><code>   pdb.set_trace()\n</code></pre>\nAs for low level debugging of assembly, in general programmers on the web stack who work at a higher level of abstraction... demarcation is so solid that in my entire career I never had to even know what assembly language was to do my job. That&#x27;s the point of an abstraction, if you find yourself digging into assembly that means it&#x27;s a leaky abstraction. Which is basically what C++ is...')
