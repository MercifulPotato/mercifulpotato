The only things that are dangerous are when people actually act or are explicit and then we deal with them.  This isnt Minority Report.  Free speech is meant to be nearly absolute and protect unpopular opinions.  The only restrictions are explicit threats (someone is literally saying they are going to kill someone and names said person) Today the interpretation has morphed into whatever is unpopular or is 3 steps away from being an actual threat.')
