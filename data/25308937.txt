Item(by='describe24', descendants=None, kids=[25309441], score=None, time=1607120060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302463, text='Most people aren&#x27;t responding because they&#x27;re defending the actions of a &quot;large corporate entity&quot;. They&#x27;re relating to the people, such as Jeff Dean, that made that decision. A decision that definitely wasn&#x27;t taken lightly. The people that had to work closely with her, with whom she has publicly ridiculed on Twitter.<p>She&#x27;s even tweeted that she suspects there was a team of people behind the decision to accept her resignation. All those people don&#x27;t put Google first. The hard truth is that she was probably extremely unpleasant to work with it (this is my reading of the above link and from what I&#x27;ve witnessed on Twitter) and they had just reached their limits. Not Google, but the people that had to work with her (I&#x27;m clearly not referring to her subordinates who are all apparently &quot;indebted&quot; to her which is a whole other issue onto itself). She comes across as very entitled and quite frankly, although I hate to say it as it&#x27;s a bit of a cliche at this point, narcissistic.<p>These are all based on what I&#x27;ve been able to find online. I&#x27;ve never met her in person. I&#x27;m trying very hard to not see her negatively but it&#x27;s also hard finding evidence that&#x27;s she&#x27;s not hostile to those that don&#x27;t 100% accept and agree with her. I&#x27;m definitely open to seeing her in a different light if anyone wants to share links. However, just because you research ethics doesn&#x27;t mean you practice what you preach nor that you&#x27;re a saint who can do no wrong.')
