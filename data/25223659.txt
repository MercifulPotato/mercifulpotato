One of the guys is a former historican who spends his free time investigating lost&#x2F;unknown trenches.\nDuring those trips we walk across the many farm fields and forrests. He uses various maps and letters to understand were original battles took place. Everywhere you can find artifacts. Bullets, shells and other metal. There are also abandoned concrete bases still containing all the equipment to operate cannons.\nNone of these areas are closed for public. Most are in fact just farm fields or public forrests. Accidents are not that frequent anymore. But not long ago each year someone died from an accident with unexploded grenates or shells.\nAnd it is still dangerous at some places. I know places where you will still find live explosives lying everywhere. Those areas are still a moonlike landscape with craters just everywhere. Unimaginable amount of shells were shot at the same place. I have a few interesting artifacts which I found during those trips. A bayonet of a french rifle. Completely intact gun clips from German, British and French rifles. An intact flask. Belts.\nShells and their detonation devices (little clocks). Hundreds of copper balls from explosives.')
