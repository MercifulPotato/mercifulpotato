But that isn&#x27;t what the title says. It is saying that a mask with a valve doesn&#x27;t slow the spread of covid.<p>Obviously, one of us wearing a mask is better than neither of us wearing a mask.<p>I think maybe the implication is that if the person wearing the mask already has covid, it isn&#x27;t going to slow the spread to others. Which makes sense. But if you at least wear a valved mask, you will be less likely to catch covid in the first place.')
