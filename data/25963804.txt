I will never put my money in a hedge fund. Just the way they spend money to boost the sense of self importance, etc. is nauseating. I once Fedex-ed a ream of printer paper from NYC to a partner on vacation in Miami because he was too entitled to drive to the nearest office supply store. I literally found a store like 10 minutes away but was told to just Fedex the paper. Then there were the allegations of PIPE and various other SEC investigations that always end up settling without any admission of guilt.<p>There are quite a few genuinely good people in finance so don&#x27;t be surprised to find good people doing good things who also work in finance but finance also attracts a lot of people who are amoral at best. I shake my head at the memory of one of the partners screaming at someone over the phone, &quot;This isn&#x27;t even illegal! How is it immoral!?&quot;')
