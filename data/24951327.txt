Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604151141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951128, text='First - it&#x27;s not &#x27;speculative&#x27; - we know what &#x27;monopolies&#x27; are, and if a Guild or Union has a monopoly over a chunk of the economy, we understand at least some of the implications.<p>Second - in this case, it&#x27;s obvious that Unions are not &#x27;about a decent wage&#x27; - rather &#x27;2-3x&#x27; the market wage for a given job.<p>Is it going to work out if the guy at the 7&#x2F;11 is getting paid $100K as well?<p>Third - this isn&#x27;t about &#x27;Unions&#x27; (it never is) it&#x27;s about power. I actually support most unions wherein they are trying to form, usually there&#x27;s good reason for a union when it&#x27;s trying to come into formation - but when Unions have more power over time, they are literally the &#x27;owning and controlling entity that can extract most of the wealth&#x27; in a system.<p>With respect to Electricity and other public utilities - these Guilds&#x2F;Unions are actually the most powerful artifact in the equation, and to contemplate &#x27;how to improve the system&#x27; without dealing with this issue is not going to work.<p>The &#x27;carrier cost&#x27; is now the primary charge on most electricity bills, i.e. you&#x27;re paying for the transport fees as much as the the power itself - those charges will increase to offset any of the gains in cheaper electricity. Electricity could drop to 6 cents a Kw&#x2F;h tommorow but the carrier fees will rise considerably - why? Because they can do that - it&#x27;s a function of the &#x27;market power&#x27; of the Guild.<p>One of the interesting and not of talked about revolutions which may be on the horizon is the possibility of a &#x27;gridless&#x27; future for electricity - or rather - considerable less dependency on grids.<p>Certainly with Hydrogen as a fuel source, or even less dependency on &#x27;local grids&#x27; whereby you can talk your &#x27;Household batteries&#x27; to a charging station every so often as opposed to having lines right to the house.<p>This might make for a more efficient system which incentivizes truly competitive pricing on electricity and moves a monopolizing entity towards having less power.<p>The gird is a &#x27;single point of access&#x27; and it&#x27;s therefore a very potent means for entities to extract all sorts of wealth wether it&#x27;s private, public, Unions etc. so we should seek to avoid those dynamics.')
