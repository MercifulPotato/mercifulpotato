You&#x27;ve assumed H (halting problem is decidable), prove B (beauty decidable), then say &quot;but actually !H, therefore !B&quot;. All you&#x27;ve proven is that H =&gt; B. An actual argument from contradiction is &quot;assume H, using H we can prove an obviously false statement, therefore not-H&quot;. And indeed, you have assumed something false (H), and shown a contradiction (various proofs for !H), so your original assumption was wrong (!H).<p>A concrete example: say Beauty(R,D) is trivially decidable (say it returns (popcount(R)+popcount(D))%2. Your argument &quot;proves&quot; this property is undecidable, but it&#x27;s definitely decidable. So some step in your argument is wrong.<p>Another concrete example: Assume the halting problem is decidable. I would like a cookie. But the halting problem is not decidable. Therefore I would not like a cookie.')
