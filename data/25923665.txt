Not being rational about  the effects of advertisement is the whole point of these product placements. It is not information, but manipulation.<p>&gt; Do you feel people should volunteer their time gratis to entertain you?<p>No. They can do as they please. I&#x27;d prefer them to do it for the sake of it, or charge in a  direct matter like a subscription model. However they should not, never, try to manipulate me for their profit.<p>I merely said the  scene dominated by enthusiasts&#x2F;hobbyists changed to a predominantly revenue-focused environment. You see the same dynamic at play, which made youtube the signal:noise hell it is today.<p>Mind you, the German and American podcast scene were very different in that regard, as in America monetization of  every possible creation seems to be much more common.
