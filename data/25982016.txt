The paper is about &quot;US Immigration Restrictions&quot; and it&#x27;s about knowledge workers, that is normal legal immigrants with visas (e.g. H1B, etc...).<p>The term &quot;migrant&quot; is generally used to refer to unskilled workers entering the country to follow jobs in temporary or seasonal industries.  Very often this therefore becomes a euphemism for &quot;illegal immigrant&quot;.  That&#x27;s not what this paper is studying.')
