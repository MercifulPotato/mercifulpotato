How can Google claim they benefit from the traffic? Of course, the website will probably be promoted the most by its algorithm. But for example, if I want to read the new york times, I just type in nytimes.com and it opens up for me. For many people who similarly want to read the articles of Le Monde, they can completely circumvent Google and just straight go to the site and I&#x27;m confident they won&#x27;t lose a lot of traffic.')
