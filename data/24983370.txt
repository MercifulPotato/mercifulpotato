That makes new phones pretty much useless for me. I always record calls, so that I can go back to them if I forget something or that nobody can claim they said something when they didn&#x27;t (most recently insurance salesperson told me I will have option X if I take their insurance and they once I bought it, there was no such option. Once I pulled the &quot;I have recorded your salesman lying to me&quot;, I got a prompt refund and apologies).')
