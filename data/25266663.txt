When accessed in a TLB friendly way (not TLB thrashing) the M1 manages 30ns which is excellent.<p>Even more impressively is that the random cacheline throughput is also excellent.  So if all 8 cores have a cache miss the M1 memory system is very good at keeping multiple pending requests in flight to achieve surprisingly good throughput.  Granted this isn&#x27;t pure latency, so I call it throughput.  Getting a random cacheline per 12ns is quite good, especially for a cheap low power system.  Normally getting more than 2 memory channels on a desktop requires something exotic like an AMD threadripper.')
