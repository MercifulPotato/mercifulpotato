I&#x27;m amazed at how bad (undeserved imho) reputation Commons Clause license got. The new Redis tools&#x27; license is basically the same, just less clear. The same with MongoDB and MariaDB&#x27;s licenses. In effect, they all forbid selling to 3rd parties - and yet, being less clear, they are deemed &#x27;OK&#x27; while Commons Clause, clear and to the point, is frowned upon.<p>I firmly believe that both proprietary and FOSS licenses are extremes and that a new batch of &quot;cloud protection licenses&quot; will help develop software that will protect core users&#x27; freedoms and still allow maintainers to work on in fulltime. Commons Clause was simply ahead of its time - I&#x27;m waiting for its descendants to prosper.')
