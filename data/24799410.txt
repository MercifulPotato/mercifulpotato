I have a large cooker hood that I built into an alcove. Works fine, except my wife and children can&#x27;t reach the buttons. I soldered wires to the button circuit board and connected a Sonoff 4CH Pro (basically 4 wifi connected relays) and a Sonoff remote control.<p>Not only can I operate the cooker hood with the remote control, through Home Assistant I also made an automation where I just shout &#x27;Hey Google let&#x27;s cook&#x27;, which turns on all the lights in the kitchen and dining room and turns on the fan.')
