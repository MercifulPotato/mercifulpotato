My first-ever submission[0] reached the #8 slot, bringing my blog 10x as many readers as anything I&#x27;d ever written before.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve continued sharing posts on HN and became more actively involved in the community here. I&#x27;ve discovered tons of interesting blog posts and services through HN that I wouldn&#x27;t have found otherwise.<p>When I talk to other bloggers, they&#x27;re often discouraged that HN ignores everything they submit. I look at their posts and often see fixable mistakes. For example, they&#x27;re submitting tutorials, not realizing that those rarely get traction on HN. Or they fill their posts with jargon that makes the content hard for most readers to follow. Often, they&#x27;re expressing an interesting idea, but they don&#x27;t know how to articulate it well to the HN audience.<p>One of the challenges of sharing your content on HN is that the results are binary. You either make it to the front page, or you don&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s difficult to learn from your mistakes.<p>I realized that in four years of participating in HN, I&#x27;ve accrued tons of institutional knowledge that wasn&#x27;t documented anywhere. I&#x27;ve never created a video course before, so this seemed like a good opportunity to teach everything I&#x27;ve learned about writing for a technical audience and sharing content on HN.<p>I hope that others find the material useful and interesting. I&#x27;m happy to take any questions or feedback about the course.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14568558" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14568558</a>')
