Itanium is one attempt 20 years ago, it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> try to rewrite the world (compatibility with standard C code is a huge crutch; GPUs couldn&#x27;t exist in that environment for example), and the design sucked. And for 20 years since it has been sufficient to invoke the name to scare away any attempt of actually trying something new, even when they don&#x27;t make the same mistakes, or even work anything like Itanium.<p>&gt; Transmeta<p>It&#x27;s in the name: the most significant part of the design was all the effort spent on compatibility with the dominant paradigm, running stock x86 code! That hugely limits what you can do.')
