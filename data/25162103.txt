However, enthusiasts spend so much time fiddling with external storage options and cobbling together messes of powered USB hubs, cables, external enclosures, and fiddling with kernel issues (USB attached SCSI) that a Raspberry Pi with built-in eMMC would be a breath of fresh air.<p>They could even keep costs down by adding a connector for an eMMC submodule, similar to what ODROID has done with their boards.')
