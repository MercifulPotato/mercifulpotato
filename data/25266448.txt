The link is weak because the op put hardly any effort into explaining the (possible) connection to these two particular undergraduates and their work. I am not claiming that math and deep learning are unrelated. Please read the rest of my response for context.<p>BTW, I am not using &#x27;hottest buzzword of the decade&#x27; to denigrate the field of deep learning. I am using it to emphasize the op&#x27;s shallow reference to the field.')
