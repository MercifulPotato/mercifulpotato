Item(by='Mvandenbergh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602540009, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759414, text='&gt;So we&#x27;d need electric utility companies to share the live data of how many kwh of solar and wind people are selling back to the grid in order to get an accurate regional comparison of real-time carbon intensity?<p>You actually need production numbers for what&#x27;s used &quot;behind the meter&quot; which by its nature is not directly available live or otherwise and has to be estimated.<p>&gt;Which customers (e.g. data centers, mining firms) would take advantage of retail intraday rates?<p>Loads! In the UK you can get half-hourly priced electricity even at a domestic level (with a smart meter) and if you have loads that can be be re-scheduled (mainly EV charging but if you had an electric storage heater that would work as ell) you can save quite a lot of money.<p>Heavy industrial users definitely move usage around both to avoid expensive wholesale charges but also to reduce their transmission connection charges which (in the UK) are based on their usage during the most congested periods of the year. Water companies will vary pump operations for this reason and water pumping and treatment alone is 2% of electricity use.<p>Data centers definitely pay on a half-hourly settled basis but tend not to shift their workloads around to take advantage, some data centers will run their cooling systems in such a way as to reduce usage during the most expensive few half hours though. I have heard that larger users like Amazon, FB, Google, will automatically load balance between global centers to reduce electricity bills and carbon footprint.')
