There are <i>thousands</i> of games to explore here made by people from all walks of life. Most of these will see zero to minor financial success, but people are still making them because they are inspired to share some experience.<p>Even on the major platforms, you&#x27;ll find stuff like Umurangi Generation, a game about taking photographs in a surreal autocratic environment. That game is not a &#x27;winner only&#x27;, but it&#x27;s fascinating and only exists because people who want to make that experience had access to tools they could understand and use.<p>Democratic processes and tools are tools that are widely available to the public. It&#x27;s not only AAA studios making games, everyone around the world is making games.')
