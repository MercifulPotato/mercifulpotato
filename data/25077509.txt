I believe in particular some essays by Brutus arguing for a bill of rights were emphasized. What wasn&#x27;t really mentioned in my school, at least, is a specific body of work called &quot;The Anti-Federalist Papers&quot;. That might be because the collection and name is of fairly recent origin, dating only to the 1960s. The essays themselves are of course much older, but collecting them into a numbered series of essays mirroring the way the Federalist Papers are numbered is more recent.')
