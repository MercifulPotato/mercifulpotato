I <i>guess</i> it would? But in the next 5 years?<p>Remember that anything Qualcomm makes will be optimized for mobile phones and only mobile phones. They won&#x27;t waste any die-area at all on anything that isn&#x27;t required by the Android phone market. The Android phone market is the only market for these chips that sells enough units to pay for their design, and it&#x27;s fiercely competitive.<p>Especially with ARM&#x27;s own designs improving so much and Samsung abandoning their own under-performing designs in favour of ARM&#x27;s, Qualcomm is going to get a lot more competition in the next few years.<p>Anything they put on those chips that makes them more expensive or use more power than competitive chips is going to cost them design wins. No way will they sacrifice 10% of their mobile market for some pie-in-the-sky, maybe-maybe-not ARM laptop market that doesn&#x27;t exist and will depend on lots of theoretical buy-in from Microsoft&#x2F;Redhat&#x2F;Canonical&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Lenovo&#x2F;Dell&#x2F;etc.<p><i>The legacy support of closed source software windows has is working against them atm.</i><p>That&#x27;s pretty outlandish. Try saying that to someone who uses Excel or After Effects or Photoshop for their work. A performance linux-based arm64 laptop has everything working against it that a windows arm64 laptop does, and arguably even more.')
