Like don&#x27;t trust the wearing facial mask is not only helpful for others but also yourself &quot;misinformation&quot;? So you see, the problem is, who decide what&#x27;s &quot;misinformation&quot;? And what if they are wrong, like they did so many times, but in a time no other voice is allowed? Think about it')
