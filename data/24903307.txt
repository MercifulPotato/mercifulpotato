I settled on it because it allowed me to easily import notes from the previous apps and they are stored as simple markdown files. Which means I can access them using vi if I&#x27;m on a system that doesn&#x27;t have Obsidian installed.<p>While I enjoy VSCode, most of my development is done in Visual Studio. And occasionally vi&#x2F;vim for smaller applications.')
