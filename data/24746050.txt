The argument he makes is that there are more people who have succeed more than once. (success defined here as a multi billion business)<p><i>It is certainly possible to beat index funds, many do so, some of them are mostly lucky, some of them are mostly skillful.</i> - That is the trick ain&#x27;t it? The hole point is that there is no way to distinguish between the two (a priori) and no way to deduct if it will lead to future success (posteriori).')
