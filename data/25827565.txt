The status quo is indoctrination, and in this case, the psychiatrist wasn&#x27;t even willing to use actual research based data to improve the treatment of their patients - even referencing that they won&#x27;t make anymore money because the patient won&#x27;t come back more often or refer more patients because of it. This is abhorrent unprofessional behaviour - but it&#x27;s likely the attitude of 90%+ of the field.<p>Edit to add: if you think a practitioner putting their own revenue&#x2F;profits above providing quality care, then something&#x27;s wrong with you.')
