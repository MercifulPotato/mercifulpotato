Twice I have done 12 hours of pretty much solid walking, although some of it was pretty slow (fairly steep + around 11,500&#x27; and of course I had my pack) and my Fitbit says I haven&#x27;t broken 50k.  I gathered nothing, stopped only to eat or because I had to catch my breath (5000&#x27; of climb).')
