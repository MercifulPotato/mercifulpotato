Those parts manufacturers would have to pay per connector-part produced in such a scheme. Those businesses 1. operate on razor-thin margins such that there’s no margin to extract there, and 2. don’t have nearly the tight logistics pipelines that consumer-electronics companies do, so there’d likely be huge bins of USB-C connectors laying around awaiting an order, where they’d have to eat the licensing fees <i>in advance</i> of receiving payment for the parts (which puts a big hole in their cashflow.)<p>Much better to go after the high-margin device manufacturers and OEM integrators. But you can’t really pursue <i>them</i> for infringing on the part; they didn’t make it, they just bought it. They’d tell you to go chase the people they bought it from. (And, as said above, you don’t want to do that.) Instead, you have to pursue them for something <i>they’re</i> doing. Such as adding the USB logo to their product.')
