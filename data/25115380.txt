I believe this is more a question of possibly poorly-incentivized sales people rather than an intentional strategy on behalf of Yelp. I think this is backed up by a number of lawsuits that haven&#x27;t gone anywhere. I might be mistaken; if there is a source showing this is really systemic, I&#x27;d be very interested.<p>Either way, Google now does many of the same things that Yelp does (reviews, photos, metadata management) - but it doesn&#x27;t really care about the space, apart from being good enough to beat its competition. While today maybe they&#x27;re motivated to build better products to compete with Yelp for eyeballs, overtime I think this means the reviews space will stagnate. That&#x27;s unfortunate.<p>I think this is the core Google problem: They have so much top-of-funnel traffic that they just have to do things &quot;good enough&quot; to crush entire industries of competition. The bar to be sufficiently better enough than &quot;good enough&quot; to build a meaningful competitor to G in any vertical is so high it stops many potential competitors from even trying. The only companies that manage it are ones that have entirely different &amp; massive profitable business models like Apple.<p>Everywhere Google is, the sector stagnates: Search! RSS readers (with a bit of a renaissance since Google Reader died). Email. Calendars. News lists. Increasingly, reviews. Fortunately MSFT pushes them in docs and hopefully Apple continues to do so in Maps and browsers.')
