I&#x27;m interested in startups: companies that at least try to grow huge. Whereas the &quot;small ISVs&quot; he writes about are just ordinary small businesses that happen to write software.

Just look at anything related to computer graphics, geophysics, CAD, data compression etc. Not to mention that a lot of the unicorns are just technically bland web pages that happen to grow huge for reasons unrelated to technical difficulty (see Facebook, Whatsapp etc.). So maybe these unicorns need business brilliance, but I don&#x27;t think they need technical brilliance all that much.')
