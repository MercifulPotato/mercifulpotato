No, you don&#x27;t need frameworks for a programming language to gain popularity.<p>I could use SQL and Emacs Lisp as examples (of languages doing fine with no frameworks). Still, you&#x27;d probably say something like: &quot;I meant in the context of general-purpose languages&quot;.<p>Python has not become popular solely because of Django, or Java because of Spring, or Javascript due to  Angular, or C# because of ASP.Net.  Rails leading to broader adoption of Ruby is rather an aberration than normalcy.<p>What is a framework but the collection of prescriptive &quot;recipes&quot; that are not always so easily compatible with other frameworks?<p>There aren&#x27;t many Clojure frameworks because the Clojure ecosystem itself is a framework with many interchangeable parts. Nothing is stopping you, for example, from incorporating both, Fulcro and Re-frame in the same app. Or using Integrant, Trapperkeeper, and Mount - all in one project. But have you ever tried using both, Angular and React in the same Javascript app? It&#x27;s a glorious nightmare.<p>Everyone is biased; people who trained to write in Rails would want to see &quot;a framework&quot;; those who come from Racket perhaps would wish for a better macro system, those who like static-type systems may argue that Clojure needs one, some want better error messages, some proper tail-recursion, etc.<p>There&#x27;s no tool, library, framework, or language with no deficiencies, and Clojure is not an exemption. It just goes to personal preference, and there are many, many programmers who absolutely love building things with Clojure. I think the language has passed the threshold of &quot;critical mass&quot;, there&#x27;s way too many people and companies invested heavily in it; it&#x27;s not going away anytime soon. It may not expand rapidly and gain wide adoption and that&#x27;s fine. It steadily, slowly keeps growing.')
