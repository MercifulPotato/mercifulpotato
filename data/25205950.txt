The increased speeds of 5G are basically irrelevant if you get throttled after downloading 50 GB in a month. This is a problem that cell providers <i>could</i> solve pretty easily -- but they&#x27;ve had that option for years, and it seems like they&#x27;d rather not.<p>Starlink is density-limited. There&#x27;s a finite amount of satellite capacity available to any amount of ground, and they can&#x27;t target upgrades to specific geographic regions.
