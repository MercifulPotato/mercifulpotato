Commits are units of change, but the unit of work and review is almost always a series of related changes.  Just because the changes are individually atomic (testable, cherry-pickable, etc) doesn&#x27;t mean that I want to review them that way.  The typical flow is for an engineer to produce a cluster of inter-related changes that motivate and rationalize each other.<p>Reviewing such a chunk in Gerrit is a PITA.  It breaks up the flow of discussion and encourages a myopic perspective on the work.')
