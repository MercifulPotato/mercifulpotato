Maybe there could be a representative link aggregator where annual elections determined who was allowed to vote on links.<p>A variation on representative democracy would be to have a recommender system identify demographics, and then to weight each demographic equally. So, for example, the votes from the &quot;blogspam fan&quot; demographic would be normalized to one, to fairly compete for representation with the much smaller &quot;long thinkpiece fan&quot; demographic.<p>Another solution would be quadratic voting, where you can vote once for free, but the nth vote would cost (n-1)^2 reputation points. That would allow established community members to express their intense dislike of certain content, to balance out the larger population&#x27;s mild preferences.<p>It would be pretty cool if there was Reddit, but each subreddit could implement a different voting system. We might see a lot of progress and experimentation.')
