The exact loses are probably exactly how much it would cost to pay to continue to use Travis (and collecting some of that money is precisely why Travis stopped offering a free service). If it wasn&#x27;t significant, Travis wouldn&#x27;t have made the change.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s worth anyone&#x27;s time to litigate.<p>As a footnote, the traditional way to handle something like this is to continue to provide a free service, but to make it worse and worse and worse. Travis could satisfice the promise by keeping an insecure Raspberry Pi under someone&#x27;s desk running old code as the &quot;server farm&quot; for open source. Courts don&#x27;t necessarily consider satisificing to be following through on a promise, but costs of litigation go way up when there are open legal questions like that. At that point, it&#x27;s usually almost definitely not worth anyone&#x27;s time to litigate.')
