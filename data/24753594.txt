The only area where you can even have indentifiably top performers is in sports, [...] You found a 10x guy, good for you. Now with the 999 other people you have 1009 people&#x27;s worth of productivity.</i><p>I disagree and think superstars also exist in software programming and can be identified.  A 3-sigma[1] subset of top performers can exist in both athletic and intellectual endeavors.<p>IMO, I think the following are not just examples of 10x programmers but more like 100x or 1000x.  It&#x27;s not just because they&#x27;re &quot;faster and more productive&quot; but because they can also <i>solve problems most others can&#x27;t</i>:  John Carmack (Doom, Oculus), Fabrice Bellard, Linus Torvalds, Charles Simonyi (MS Word &amp; Excel), Dave Cutler (Windows NT kernel), Jeff Dean (Google mapreduce and later AI with Google Brain).<p>Whether or not future programmers of their abilities will trend towards using talent agents to negotiate like Brad Pitt remains to be seen.  I&#x27;m guessing they won&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Normal_distribution#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Standard_deviation_diagram.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Normal_distribution#&#x2F;media&#x2F;Fil...</a>')
