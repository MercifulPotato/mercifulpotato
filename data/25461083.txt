Most components were pretty fairly priced but I paid way more than expected for a Ryzen CPU with the integrated Radeon graphics near the price point I wanted to keep the build at. It&#x27;s still a great build compared to what I&#x27;m replacing but that CPU markup was a shock, and I&#x27;m happy to not have to add a GPU to the mix.')
