Seriously we are all on the same side. It&#x27;s not competition.<p>I&#x27;ve been running matrix instance for probably 6 years from times even before Vector.<p>The constant popups happening and mysterious verification fails gotten pretty annoying.

Signal can&#x27;t do chatrooms &#x2F; more people well and it will probably never will.
