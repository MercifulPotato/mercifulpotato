I don&#x27;t see a reason why IT services shouldn&#x27;t, given that the market is in a dead-end situation. Regulation can cover professional IT services (VMs&#x2F;pods) as well as social (portability of social accounts, similar to mobile number portability), in addition to DNS, mail-, and web-spaces which are already de-facto regulated. Goal, among other things, is to break verticals, platforms, network effects, similar to net neutrality principles.')
