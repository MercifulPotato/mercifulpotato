I&#x27;d also say it depends a lot on the buyer. For example - first time buyer, I&#x27;d always encourage them to do an inspection as they are going to learn a lot about being a homeowner from the experience. Someone who has a number of investment properties and knows houses inside and out? They might be able to get all the info they need with just a walk-through.<p>As I understand it, in competitive urban markets it has become common for sellers to do a pre-inspection and then sell &#x2F; provide that info for interested parties. This potentially makes for a faster sale and may create a more competitive situation if more potential buyers see less risk in the condition of the house and are willing to make an offer. But, at least in my state, anything a seller learns about the condition of their home must be disclosed so this could also backfire.<p>Any time you can remove a contingency in a competitive situation it will be a potential advantage, but caveat emptor all day long - sellers seldom have a complete understanding of their home and property so it is to the buyer&#x27;s best interest to do everything they can to inform themselves before completing the purchase.')
