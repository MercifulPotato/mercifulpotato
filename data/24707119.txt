This happens more naturally in person because conversations start &#x27;automatically&#x27; e.g. around the watercooler, and the content that fills those conversations is the exchange of information and opinions that builds relationships.<p>The challenge with remote is that there is no automatic way for those conversations to start. Instead you have to consciously plan them, but the content of the conversation should be as natural as it would be otherwise.<p>There is some cynicism in that you&#x27;ll benefit from actively building a relationship with the seniors and maybe you put more work in to that than would come naturally but that is again exactly as true in person as remotely.')
