There&#x27;s no amount of obfuscation that will defeat watermarking if they algorithm&#x2F;key is unknown and a huge amount of data needs to be released.<p>That is, maybe you can use video and audio filtering&#x2F;manipulation to push the watermark bandwidth down to one bit of watermark per 1 GB of data, but with 100 participants and 7 GB of data, 7 bits is enough to identify the leaker.')
