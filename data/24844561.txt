And AJA the other end of the budget spectrum, only cheaper than BMD if you have any kind of obligatory work flow or more than a weekend project. Color space transformation so you can watch on wide colour gamut panels in anything close to captured quality comes to mind for what you leave AJA to manage but need to research and invent a new work flow for if using BMD.')
