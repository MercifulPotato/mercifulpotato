There is something akin to an entire LISP inside gcc. And it uses its own host of deps, which themselves have deps... <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packages.gentoo.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;sys-devel&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;dependencies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packages.gentoo.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;sys-devel&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;dependenc...</a>. It&#x27;s not like these compilers are large for no reason, there&#x27;s definitely code in them.<p>What do you consider the preprocessor if not bloat? CMake or ninja or whatever Google&#x27;s build system is, is that bloat?<p>Maybe you just haven&#x27;t seen a fun enough pipeline. But the web is sufficiently complex that you need a sufficiently complex set of developer tools to build for it in an optimal way. You can try and skip steps there but you&#x27;ll likely just end up reinventing what others have built.<p>If you know the leftpad class or issues is gone, why bring it up? Why not just start with the &quot;other modes of attack&quot;? Why do your priorities, whatever they are, matter?<p>I&#x27;m not the one giving others a hard time here, the people who maintain that it is fun and trendy to hate on a technology they think is &quot;bloated&quot; (whatever that means) are giving me the hard time.')
