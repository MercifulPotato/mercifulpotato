It&#x27;s just about as obtuse to use as a tool as gdb, but you&#x27;ll see exactly what it does. Chrome dev tools has automatic formatting of the code, maybe firefox too. But you&#x27;ll be stuck with shitty variable names if they been mangled. Although you could try <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsnice.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jsnice.org&#x2F;</a>, I had variable luck with using it.<p>It would be interesting to have a browser tool that is like strace and you could filter by calls, so you can see exactly where window.navigator is being used for example, or localStorage.setItem. For now best you can do is searching for &quot;navigator&quot; which works, but can be minified&#x2F;hidden away by coder as well.')
