A few coworkers attended classes of his and a spouse worked with mchurch for a period of time, so he&#x27;s well known here.<p>While I agree with a lot of his goals, I very much disagree with his approach.  His writing is very acidic and his past behavior is questionable.  I also believe in incremental change whereas he seems to want revolutionary change.  The problem with revolution is you never really know what you are going to get on the other side.  Most revolutions end like Syria, not Tunisia.<p>So I very much disagree with this approach even though we mostly want the same thing.')
