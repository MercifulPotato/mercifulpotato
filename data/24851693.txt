I think I&#x27;ll make changes to allow comma separated files to be used as well. The reason I&#x27;ve avoided it so far is because some countries use commas as the decimal separator but there are ways around that. I was also thinking it&#x27;s easier to just paste from Excel as that makes iterating through updates easier.<p>I&#x27;d also be interested in what normalization issues you had because I can probably make some changes to make that easier as well.<p>Here is an example of a page that used geolocation for tracking birds. The size of the circles represent the height (you can literally see them pulsing as the sleep each night and fly during the day). You can open up this link, download the data, modify it and paste it back in. You can&#x27;t overwrite someone else&#x27;s page but you can then save it as your own:\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;fall_migration_of_white_storks_in_2014.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;u&#x2F;drdave&#x2F;fall_migration_of_white_sto...</a><p>If you don&#x27;t want to go into detail in this forum feel free to reach out via the contact page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;contact_us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapipedia.com&#x2F;contact_us</a>')
