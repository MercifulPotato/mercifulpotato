Like, if I&#x27;m playing something through a bluetooth speaker, and my wife wanders into range while listening to a podcast on her phone, it will automatically connect to the speaker and boot me off.  How does it make sense to auto-connect when another device is already using the speaker?  Similarly, I&#x27;ll be listening to my bluetooth headphones, and my wife starts her car in the garage below meâ€”suddenly my phone disconnects from the headphones and connects to the car instead.  If I&#x27;m already playing through one bluetooth device, I probably don&#x27;t want to automatically switch to a different one - especially one with a far weaker signal&#x2F;likely farther away.<p>I get that these aren&#x27;t trivial problems to solve, but they certainly seem <i>possible</i> to improve on, given the maturity of bluetooth at this point.  Also perhaps they aren&#x27;t the fault of the protocol at all, but just the choices made in programming phone OS&#x27;s.  Regardless, it&#x27;s annoying!')
