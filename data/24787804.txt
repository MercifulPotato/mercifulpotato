Personally, I find it both hard to argue against and at the same time <i>extremely dehumanizing</i>.<p>Related to this is the phenomenon of turning everything into service. Why would you own things and accept responsibility for maintaining them, if you could just throw money at the service provider and have the thing be present when it&#x27;s needed? Of course the thing will be extremely limited in what you can do with it, subject to Terms&amp;Conditions, but why would you want to do anything non-standard with stuff? There&#x27;s always another service you can throw money at to solve the same problem.<p>What&#x27;s the end-game here? That we specialize into sub-species of humans, forever stuck in one role, with zero autonomy? No longer building wealth, we&#x27;ll only be allocating the flow of money - from what Society gives us in reward for our work, straight to Services of said Society? Will we become specialized cells of the meta-multicellular organism Society becomes?<p>I can see how we&#x27;re on the path towards that reality, and I absolutely <i>hate it</i>.')
