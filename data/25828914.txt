That&#x27;s only true for hydrocarbons which don&#x27;t contain oxygen atoms.  The energy comes from the O2 consumed.  Sugar contains oxygen atoms, but those don&#x27;t contribute to the energy released because burning sugar consumes less O2 per unit mass than burning hydrocarbons.<p>In your example, 9 moles of ethanol produces the same heat as 2 moles of isooctane, but the combustion products are substantially higher:<p>Ethanol: 9C2H5OH+27O2→18CO2+27H2O<p>Isooctane: 2C8H18+27O2→16CO2+18H2O')
