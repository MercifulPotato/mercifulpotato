It&#x27;s very quick, and I can run it across both my desktop and laptop, so if I want to go work in the living room I can get up and get to work immediately on whatever was open in the workspace.<p>The only downside is that the difference between extensions installed on the remote and locally is a little confusing, but the extension ecosystem in VS Code has satisfied all of my use cases. I&#x27;ve also run into some occasional ssh hangups on weak connections, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that isuse in a few months.<p>For years I was a linux guy, and now I see no reason to go back, because I can just remotely access a linux environment from whatever system I&#x27;m already on. Less time spent swapping between operating systems to work on projects, and a consistent environment, are both huge features.')
