Are we talking about the utterly hopeless or those who might only have an attitude problem?<p>Those categories aren&#x27;t necessarily disjoint. There can be many aspects, many of which are described in the paper. But in my experience, one of the more pernicious combinations is the sincere belief that one already knows nearly everything worth knowing, coupled with a complete lack of curiosity (or perhaps it was merely utter laziness).<p>When that happens, a person stagnates. In the case I saw, a person with decades of experience was effectively performing only marginally better than someone who had just begun their career. The major difference being that a person who has just started is often well aware that they have a lot to learn. Or even if they&#x27;re not, if they&#x27;re curious then there&#x27;s at least a good chance that they will figure that out in time.')
