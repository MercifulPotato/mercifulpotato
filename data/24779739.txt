It&#x27;s a major current issue.<p>It&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> difficult to produce useful proteins from random DNA chains. As in, if I took all of the atoms in our galaxy, paired each with random DNA, and allowed you to pick just one (blindfolded), only one of those DNA strands would contain the DNA necessary to produce a valid&#x2F;useful protein. Literally every other atom has garbage DNA&#x2F;proteins. The human body contains between 80,000 and 400,000 proteins.<p>DNA looks far more like &quot;information&quot; than it does like random bits written to disk. It&#x27;s analogous to trying to find an x86 program of at least 160 instructions that computes a valid mathematical function by randomly splatting 1s and 0s to disk and then &quot;running&quot; the &quot;code&quot;. Eh, maybe it&#x27;ll eventually happen, but you can see how hard it actually is in practice. Heat-death-of-the-Universe hard.<p>Give a long enough timeframe, even unlikely things will happen. However, the Universe isn&#x27;t very oldâ€”which is why it&#x27;s a major current issue.')
