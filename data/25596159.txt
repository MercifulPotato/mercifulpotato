And even then, if your button within a form is semantically submit buttons (as the Create button here is), the semantically-best technique is instead to leave the button as a submit button, and instead of using a click handler on the button, to use a submit handler on the form and do event.preventDefault() within it.<p>(b) That buttons don’t wrap externally is a feature, not a bug. Links should wrap. Buttons should not. The point here is that it <i>is</i> a button, so it should use &lt;button&gt;, and this is just one of the reasons why.<p>(c) &lt;button&gt; not supporting `display: flex` was Firefox-specific and fixed almost four years ago in Firefox 52. I believe the last fiddly alignment corner cases were fixed over two years ago also. So you can safely forget about that limitation now.<p>(d) You shouldn’t <i>want</i> to put a div inside a button, any sort of button (whether &lt;button&gt; or any other technique). That’s not what buttons are.')
