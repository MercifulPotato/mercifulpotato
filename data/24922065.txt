Between miles traveled and not being able to use any mains power tools.<p>Current and last generation cordless power tools can be pretty sweet, and the ads always show professionals using them (don&#x27;t you want to play dress-up like the real adults?), but I&#x27;m never clear how deep that market penetration is.<p>For the batteries, that&#x27;s pretty terrestrial, so cords aren&#x27;t that big of a problem, unless there&#x27;s no power grid. I could see the solar guys being largely cordless though. I don&#x27;t want to die because I tripped over your power&#x2F;pneumatic lines.<p>(also how much of this would be solved if Tesla started using their own truck for construction?)')
