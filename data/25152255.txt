Item(by='watermelon59', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605808855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25143623, text='I feel like I&#x27;m in your friend&#x27;s position right now. I absolutely hate working on services. Hate having to muck around with AWS and Kubernetes. I like writing code, period (that excludes Terraform and YAML in my definition). I also have an interest (though nil actual experience) in embedded systems. It&#x27;s what I play with in my free time to keep my brain working and not going totally insane.<p>I stay because the company where I work at pays me a handsome salary, RSUs, and has great benefits. Somehow my team likes me. Somehow I made it to a high position... though I suspect I&#x27;ve been promoted to the level of my incompetence and the next perf review won&#x27;t be great.<p>The problem is that I&#x27;m so burned out right now that no job at all sounds appealing.')
