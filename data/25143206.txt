First off, this visualization is not for real particles, but virtual ones. We are trying to describe the quantum vacuum, but these are not actual particles that you can scoop up or collide with. <i>The particle-antiparticle pairs from quantum field theory are calculational tools only, not physically observable entities.</i> Second, <i>the Hawking radiation that leaves a black hole is almost exclusively photons</i>, not matter or antimatter particles. And third, <i>most of the Hawking radiation</i> doesn&#x27;t come from the edge of the event horizon, but <i>from a very large region surrounding the black hole</i>.&quot;<p>Additionally, the article also writes enough to explain the whole context and gives enough details for those who are interested to learn more.')
