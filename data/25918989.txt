If we could get to something on a 2-year or 5-year time horizon we may just start giving it to everyone preventatively, the way we do tetanus shots.  The larger volume might mean enough total profits at a price scale that makes it affordable for the pharma company to do that at a price point that makes sense for the buyer.  If we get to a universal treatment that we can apply globally, we may see AIDS become a thing of the past in a few generations.  Given unequal access to care that may be substantially challenging in regions with poor health care and we may need an outright vaccine that lasts permanently to successfully treat it globally. But this seems to be a step along that pathway even if new technologies are needed to complete it.')
