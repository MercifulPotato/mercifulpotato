You would get assigned to the A or B shift and rotate weekly, so one week I would go to school in the morning at 8am and the next one in the afternoon at 2pm. Even though it was harder to wake up for the 8am classes, I think it was better than staying until 7pm in school when it&#x27;s already dark and there is no day left for play. It was torture waking up early, esp. in the cold winters, but having to walk (often run) 2 or 3 km to school to come just in time would stimulate the wake-up.')
