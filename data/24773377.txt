There are six supervisor seats up for election this year, as there are every even year. Ronen is running unopposed, which is a bit odd. The other five seats have at least 3 candidates each. I don&#x27;t pay too much attention to Supervisor elections outside my district (which isn&#x27;t up this cycle), but from glancing at websites and endorsements it looks like there&#x27;s at least a few non-delusional competitors. And I recall D6 in particular was <i>extremely</i> competitive last time around, since it was a vacant seat after Jane Kim got term-limited out.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfelections.sfgov.org&#x2F;candidates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfelections.sfgov.org&#x2F;candidates</a><p>EDIT: The Board of Supervisors also has a two-term limit, so even if you think incumbents are automatic winners (which they usually are - not usually unopposed, but, like most incumbents, I don&#x27;t think they usually have to sweat it too much), there&#x27;s going to be a competitive open-seat race at least once a decade.')
