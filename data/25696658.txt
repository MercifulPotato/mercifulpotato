On the other one, it&#x27;s significantly more moderate but with some opposing viewpoints from either extreme thrown in. It all depends on who someone friends or follows and what the filter chooses to show.<p>Of course, this ignores what &quot;liberal bias&quot; is, which is a subjective determination that varies according to the bias of whomever makes such a determination.<p>Although, this is a distraction from the question raised early in this thread. of whether some coordination happened behind the scenes or if these bans are a result of distinct actions in response to the same circumstances.')
