For regular checkups and maintenance, go for a private clinic. Yearly checkups, cleaning, occasional minor patching cost me around 200-300 â‚¬ (edit: if you shop around you can likely find cheaper; I didn&#x27;t), and I&#x27;ve been much more happier with the whole process. Never got that &quot;we haven&#x27;t opened our next year&#x27;s calendar yet, try calling us again in 3 months&quot; from them I got used to at the public side.<p>For something more expensive, go to a private clinic for diagnosis and get a referral to a specialist at the public side (never had to, but I hear it works).')
