The mask policy was a governance error. Having N95 masks as preppers did is as far off the mark from &quot;cotton mask&quot; as not wearing a mask at all, preppers would still run out of N95s, they&#x27;d still use a cotton mask, N95s were still overkill.<p>Besides masks, was there anything the public really needed that it could not get but could have stored inside their basement? Toilet paper? That&#x27;s what you will summon as, &quot;Preppers averted a life crisis.&quot;<p>How are you going to doomsday prep &quot;elective surgeries&quot; and &quot;ICU beds?&quot; That&#x27;s what there were real shortages of. It&#x27;s ridiculous.')
