I&#x27;m an engineer&#x2F;developer and a high end gamer. I have an Alienware laptop (in addition to a Macbook Pro), with an RTX 2070 in it. It never overheats. I take it traveling with me. The M1 has a fillrate 10x slower, and I highly doubt it&#x27;s competitive on Compute Shader performance either.  Even if my RTX laptop were thermally down clocked, it&#x27;s still got plenty of headroom over the M1 GPU wise.<p>The only time I worry about heat is if I have to have the laptop in my lap.<p>On top of all this, AMD&#x27;s 6nm Rembrandt coming out next year is likely to have a model in the 20W range, which is on par with the M1&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot; mode, but with much greater GPU performance.<p>I think the epitaph being written for x86 is a little premature, maybe for Intel, but AMD just delivered 20% IPC improvement, and a huge gfx architecture improvement, with a scalable chiplet architecture going forward.<p>It would be unwise to count them out.')
