Item(by='lacker', descendants=None, kids=[25261571, 25260654, 25262228], score=None, time=1606779339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25243764, text='I felt like this article did not clarify the problem for me, because it bounced between several different aspects of lithium production without really quantifying anything.<p>So here&#x27;s my summary. From googling around, So lithium costs about $13,000 a ton. Hard rock mining releases 15 tons of CO2 for every ton of lithium. Carbon offsets cost about $8 a ton, using the numbers for Stripe&#x27;s cheapest carbon offset program. So even if the CO2 was fully offset, that would be adding $120 per ton or about 1% to the cost of lithium. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a very big deal.<p>For water consumption, that same ton of lithium takes 170 cubic meters, which is about 2 person-months of urban Chilean water consumption. I don&#x27;t have a specific price or tradeoff to put on it, but it seems unlikely that the cost would amount to as much as the carbon dioxide.<p>I think what&#x27;s really going on here is that the current methods of producing lithium are really not very environmentally harmful. IMO this proposed lithium production facility in the UK would be nice, but supporting it by saying that the current methods of lithium production are environmentally unsound doesn&#x27;t seem right to me. This seems like a case of two different groups of environmentalists shooting each other in the foot, when the best thing for the environment is focusing on getting off fossil fuels instead of preemptively minimizing the small impact of lithium mining.')
