Splitting it up into 3 &#x27;areas&#x27; (for want of a better word) makes a lot of sense and makes those notes a lot more useful, thanks!<p>I think a few commenters are missing the point or just skimming over the post. It&#x27;s not about memorising a &#x27;book&#x27; or subject by rote, it&#x27;s about being able to consume, rearrange and remember the subject in a way that&#x27;s more suitable to how you remember or think about things. \nIt not only clears your thoughts as you study (allowing you to move through the material quicker) but aids in recollection with better organised note taking.\nCheers')
