For unlimited usage in deploying and consuming static&#x2F;generated&#x2F;rendered content and APIs.<p>iiuc, vercel runs on aws. Isn&#x27;t the math fundamentally flawed on this kind of a business model if it isn&#x27;t backed by owning the compute&#x2F;network substrate first? Egress charges would be brutal. Targetting gross margins of 60-70% sounds like it would be hard.<p>Would love to hear from VC&#x2F;founders with their insights, esp for building dev tools businesses and &quot;monetizing&quot; frameworks which isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s happened too often (or happened at all recently?)')
