Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604991958, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039623, text='The interrobang only dates back to 1962, didn&#x27;t actually appear in a typeface until 1965, and from what I&#x27;ve been able to find, it didn&#x27;t start routinely appearing in typefaces as a distinct character until it become part of Unicode. So don&#x27;t blame old typesetters -- blame the internet. :)<p>I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with the interrobang, although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go out of my way to use it, simply because it calls rather undue attention to itself. I wouldn&#x27;t say that about most other ligatures, even some relatively uncommon ones; I&#x27;m sure that most people read text in set in Chaparral, for instance, without ever noticing that &quot;Th&quot; is a ligature in that typeface, because it looks optically correct in the same way the near-universal &quot;fi&quot; and &quot;fl&quot; ligatures do.<p>For the record, I can&#x27;t find any supporting evidence about the ordering of punctuation marks; both &quot;?!&quot; and &quot;!?&quot; are non-standard in formal English, and the advice I&#x27;ve seen online -- and in the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> I have on my bookshelf I just checked -- suggest that an &quot;exclamatory question&quot; just uses the exclamation point. It&#x27;s just that &quot;?!&quot; is more common when it gets used. (A question mark comes after an ellipsis not because of punctuation priority, but simply because the &quot;...&quot; indicates elided words, but doesn&#x27;t replace the terminating punctuation mark.)')
