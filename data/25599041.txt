One of the lessons I learned this year is that &quot;the system&quot; is nowhere near as good at helping people as an individual willing to give real help. (And also that &quot;the system&quot; in the US is mostly lip service. If you get evicted, and don&#x27;t have family or friends to stay with, you will be on the street. Homeless shelters are either closed or packed. This is a very tough time for those who are already on the edges.)')
