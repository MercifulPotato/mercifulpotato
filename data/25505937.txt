The dissemination of genocidal ideas and the inhumanity of the Jews to the masses laid the groundwork. A lot of people on the &quot;free speech at all costs&quot; side defend that there is no problem with that, we have to accept them as equals and fight them in the battleground of ideas, as if they played by the same rules and we just have to make good arguments against genocide in order to convince them.<p>So, that kind of free speech definitely drove a movement of people towards radicalism. The alternative is believing that millions of regular Germans had a little homicidal maniac inside of them just waiting to get out, and that Goebbles really had no part in getting them to hate so viciously. You can either: believe people are inherently evil and will support genocide at the first opportunity; or people can be influenced by pointed words from a group intent on manipulating them.')
