That tended to weed out the people who were mass bidding on tasks without reading, you want someone who&#x27;s read your task and thought about it a little.<p>For bigger tasks, I&#x27;ve had success with posting the full job details but then setting a small task, like wireframes or some design work for say $50 to a couple of upworkers, then picking one to carry on the rest of the work.  That worked really well, and spending $200 on selecting a freelancer when spending $5000 felt like a good payoff.<p>The person on here I hired after he posted an offer to make an mvp for a fixed price, and it worked out really well, delightful Chap, good work.<p>I&#x27;ve tried fiverr, but that seems better for smaller tasks.')
