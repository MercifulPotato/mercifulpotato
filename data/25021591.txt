Seems kinda steep if you have a large revenue but high costs. Apparently this would affect the likes of Gap, Levi&#x27;s, Wells Fargo, Square, Visa etc [2]. It&#x27;s not super easy to check who pays the Administrative Office Tax (payroll) and who currently pays the Gross Receipts Tax.<p>Assuming everyone is paying the gross receipts tax, however, the 0.1% more on gross receipts (0.2% if CEO is paid 200x the median, 0.3% if 300x etc up to 0.6%) can add up quick over a few years.<p>Visa isn&#x27;t HQ&#x27;d in SF (so they would be paying the Gross Receipts Tax?), but their revenue was 23 billion last year. 0.1% of that is $23 million. If that is true, do they just shutter the SF offices? Can they still do business in SF?<p>Wells Fargo has $85 billion of revenue last year, so 0.1% would be $85 million. They are HQ&#x27;d in SF, so they would be paying the payroll part. I don&#x27;t have the numbers handy there but I bet it&#x27;s not cheap either.<p>Since this applies to public and private companies alike, it seems like a no-brainer that more companies will follow in Stripe&#x27;s footsteps and move their headquarters to other places in the Bay Area (or Colorado like Palantir lol, though they were never in SF).<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;San_Francisco,_California,_Proposition_L,_Business_Tax_(November_2020)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;San_Francisco,_California,_Propositi...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmatters.org&#x2F;california-divide&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;san-francisco-overpaid-ceo-tax&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calmatters.org&#x2F;california-divide&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;san-francis...</a>')
