On the other hand Equifax collects the data through partnerships and data-sharing arrangements that (whilst opaque to essentially all consumers) is generally well-regulated.<p>GDPR, the APPs and CCPA may curtail another Equifax incident but outright-illegal data collection needs a different solution.')
