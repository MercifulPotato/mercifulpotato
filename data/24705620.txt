Its just how it is. US work opportunity is very expensive&#x2F;valuable for us third world people(in my case India). <i>Its like 70 rupees for a single dollar!!!</i>. Time and opportunities are 70 times more expensive. Every minute, and every purchase matters. You have to make a dent every time you hit.<p>Its like the most important period of your life. There is little time for non-serious stuff.<p>You likely won&#x27;t get a chance again. Even if you do office politics and get visas, you still need to beat the lottery and visa interview.
