Item(by='nrmitchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611807458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937788, text='The world is an extremely complex place, and valuing things is extremely hard. There are way to many factors that contribute. The &quot;correct&quot; value will vary based on both factors in the world, as well as individual-specific factors[0].<p>The next-best alternative is one of them. We are currently in an economic situation where money is literally being printed by the trillions, there has not been a offsetting set of funds going back to the government (thus increasing the money supply), and interest rates are 0 (and stated to stay there for the forseeable future). There is lots of money, that has to go to <i>something</i>, which raises the price of everything (or devalues the dollar, depending on how you look at it).<p>You ask &#x27;Is there any event that would cause the value to &quot;correct&quot;?&#x27;. As a definitely-not-economist, I would guess any event that modifies either of the aspects I mentioned above. Reducing the money supply (perhaps taxing capital gains more reasonably), or increasing interest rates.<p>[0] I want to point out here that each individual entity buying something will have a different &quot;correct price&quot; for them, based on individual factors, especially at scale. One of these is individual risk, and how the risk associated with a given stock correlates with other risk in your life. If you live in an oil town, investing in a correlated asset <i>should</i> require a better potential payoff, and thus a better entry point, than someone who has no other oil exposure (if the industry collapses, do you really want to lose both your job <i>and</i> your investments?)<p>PS:<p>&gt; It doesn&#x27;t make sense for TLSA<p>I never said, and would <i>never</i> make the argument, that TSLA is &quot;correctly&quot; valued. But I&#x27;m also not insane so am not going to try to short it.')
