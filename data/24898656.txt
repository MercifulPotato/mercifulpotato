One glance will confirm that I have typed my card number correctly, but you don’t have to be unusually impatient for your heart to sink, when you hear the inhumanly calm words, “I heard 4659 1234 1234 1234. Is that correct? Say yes or press one to confirm”.</i><p>This is the main reason I rarely use voice controls. Even if voice is faster than typing for most cases, typing never fails catastrophically like voice does.<p>I could use voice only when I&#x27;m confident it will work, but then there&#x27;s the mental load of making that prediction. It&#x27;s easier to just always go with typing.')
