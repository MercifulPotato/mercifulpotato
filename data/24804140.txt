I use teams every day at work, it eats insane amounts of ram, it leaks memory during video conferences, it&#x27;s practically unusable during a call, switching tabs from chat to teams takes anywhere from one to five seconds, push notifications simply do not work properly, so does motification badge - it also often takes seconds for teams to acknowledge that you&#x27;ve seen certain activity. Text input has such an insane latency that it&#x27;s uncomfortable to write, often eating characters from the next message after pressing return if you start typing too quickly. And this is just a tip of the iceberg. Almost all of few hundreads of people in our org hate the app as well and we&#x27;re almost purely a Microsoft shop. I liked Slack until it became incredibly bloated. But even now, it&#x27;s still in another league when compared to the abysmal experience that Teams offer.')
