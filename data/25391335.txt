You could kill tens of millions.<p>But both reactors experienced almost the worst possible operating failure and this is how low the casualties were. Fukushima is leaking into the ocean and still not expected to cause a single radiation-based death.<p>Vastly more people have been (&#x2F;will be) killed by runoff ponds of coal ash slurry rupturing and running into rivers than from radiation from power plants or spent fuel.<p>At 10k pollution deaths per week, for even just ten years, no. A nuclear reactor couldn&#x27;t meet that (5M deaths) even if you left the switch in &#x27;boom&#x27; mode and went home for the night.')
