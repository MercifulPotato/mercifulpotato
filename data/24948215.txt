I found many things in your story that are similar to my experience and it gives me hope.<p>I have a few questions I hope you don&#x27;t mind answering as I&#x27;m trying to change careers to work full-time on public cloud for a technology driven company.<p>A little backstory (feel free to skip):<p>I began my career working in a company that did structured cabling, PBX systems and rack and stacking data centers. I was rapidly taking on more responsibilities and was managing a team of 40 people within 2 years.<p>Things were steady but I felt like I was missing out on all the incredible things that were happening in tech (I spend a lot of time on HN). After discovering AWS I was blown away by the possibilities and decided Linux and cloud were what I wanted to focus on as a professional.<p>I resigned to start my own consultancy and got the pro level AWS SA certification (with mostly self practice and no real-world production experience) and approached many businesses to sell services as an &#x27;AWS certified&#x27; consultant. I got a few small wins but the sales cycle was longer than I expected and many potential clients would engage in long technical discussions but then cancel once they saw the TCO calculations.<p>The unstable cash-flow made things like paying rent on time very stressful so after two years I got a job at a small consultancy that provides mostly on-prem IT infrastructure services. I&#x27;ve learned quite a lot over the past two years and realized there were many holes in my knowledge. Yet, most of the clients&#x27; work was still on premise and now because of the pandemic many of them put their projects on hold or outright canceled them to cut costs. I&#x27;ve been furloughed without any income and right now I&#x27;m trying to survive by installing internet in homes and taking support calls while looking for a new job.<p>Many of the cloud related jobs - either solution architecture or Devops, require experience working in an agile software development environment, which is something I don&#x27;t have and I have a major case of imposter syndrome because of this.<p>Now for the questions:<p>1) Is it possible to learn enough about agile practices and development to be productive without real-world production experience?<p>2) When you were looking for a &#x27;real job&#x27; after running your own IT business, did you face any objections during the recruitment process on why you were looking for a job despite running your own business?<p>3) I was thinking of applying for &#x27;cloud support engineer&#x27; type of roles because I really want to work in this field, but would that be a negative signal to recruiters because I&#x27;m an experienced (albeit in other areas) candidate?<p>After all these years I started to question if it was possible to go from rack and stacking to cloud but since you&#x27;ve explained it in such detail I see a path now. Thanks!')
