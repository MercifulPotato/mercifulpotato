That is a separate hardware block outside of the CPUs. Apple refers to this feature as &quot;AMX&quot; in their marketing documentation.<p>While AMX could be used for deep learning in a pinch despite the lack of support for common formats like fp16 and int8, I suspect Apple had some other use cases in mind as well. For example, 64-bit float support is expensive and generally useless for ML. However, they are useful (though not necessarily required) in problems such as bundle adjustment that may appear in the context of frameworks like ARKit.')
