You just cannot see the bigger picture and connect the dots. Even though it’s right in front of your face.<p>If the British and Americans did not do what they did in the 1840s, then do you think someone like Mao would’ve come into power in the 1900s?<p>Were you also aware that China was under heavy sanctions from the United States, Australia, and the rest of the world after the CPC came into power?  They could not buy food from abroad, since the white countries wanted to starve them to death. They could not trade to make money from their commodities. The ultimate goal of the white western nations was to starve China (but let’s not talk about any of that, because that would disrupt our brainwashing of the masses).<p>The British subsequently killed more people than Mao, because they set into motion a series of disastrous events.<p>Did you even realize China had a civil war in the 1850s, because of the British?<p>But of course, let’s ignore everything else, and focus our attention on Mao, since he’s an easy target.
