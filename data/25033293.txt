Are you really able to buy all products for any meal - really, any meal - that they were not treated with pesticides?<p>Yes, absolutely.<p>It would really depend on what you consider &quot;a pesticide&quot; and if organic alternatives counted and if at that which ones, regardless it is still quite possible, you just have to understand where your food comes from.<p>&gt; Another interesting question: is it possible to buy anywhere (even on the Internet) non-GMO corn?<p>Say you&#x27;re a farmer in the midwest, here&#x27;s a place to buy non-GMO seed corn to grow on your farm:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alseed.com&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;corn&#x2F;viking-conventional-non-gmo-corn&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alseed.com&#x2F;product-category&#x2F;corn&#x2F;viking-conventi...</a><p>Non-GMO corn is common, the supply chain is very aware if the product is GMO or not.<p>&gt;You know, the original one, created by nature which were possible to have 200 years ago?<p>No such thing.
