And the money is there - Amazon, MS, Google, Nvidia and even AMD are not exactly paupers.<p>As I&#x27;ve said below Intel&#x27;s P&#x2F;E ratio is less than 10. That&#x27;s extraordinarily low for a company in this market with growing revenue and eps. Clearly the market agrees with me that Intel can&#x27;t sustain these earnings even over the medium term.')
