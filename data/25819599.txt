The primary reason is that the knifes size and shape allow you to anchor it on the cutting board while making the cut. Having an anchor point allows you to make fast, precise and safe cuts. Another important point: Use a sharp knife. Dull knifes require much more force and are much more likely to slip - the injury risk is significantly increased.')
