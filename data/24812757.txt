From the perspective of a company whose core business model is not software, there is little value in writing code.  A CEO sees danger in every major software implementation: they&#x27;re expensive, takes forever, often fail, expensive to maintain and may get him fired.  A CEO wants to customize a little as possible, so he can upgrade and maintain his very expensive capital expense.<p>On the other hand, from the perspective of consulting company or large software vendor, the consultant wants to lock-in his customer to a long term contract as long as possible.  This means he wants to implement a be-spoke customized solution with infinite levels of complexity that will make it easier for his customer to move mountains than switch to a different vendor.<p>If you are trying to determine which data technology you should specialize in, personally, I take great interest in the stock market valuation of those companies.  It&#x27;s not foolproof but I would argue is a better indicator than most.  For example, recently the Dow Jones industrial average replaced Exxon with Salesforce.  Salesforce is more than a CRM; it really is cloud platform that many business base their IT strategy on.  Similarly, Snowflake&#x27;s recent IPO of $3 billion was reported to be the largest ever for a software company.')
