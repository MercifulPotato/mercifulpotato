AMD&#x27;s Windows drivers also do some of that stuff (though not all).<p>Mesa does implement a lot of stuff but they do not take much advantage of what the higher level parts of the API allow to optimize rendering. From what i remember until AMD pushed some devs on it, they didn&#x27;t care about supporting the entire API at all.<p>Vulkan support is most likely good though.<p>(EDIT: yes, &quot;display lists are deprecated&quot;, but this is irrelevant, the API is there, available and works and works great on Nvidia and still very good on AMD Windows driver and a lot of applications use it - Khronos splitting the API to core&#x2F;compatibility was a mistake that made everything more complicated than necessary when what they should have done if they wanted a clean API would be to make something new like they eventually did with Vulkan and avoid messing up OpenGL )')
