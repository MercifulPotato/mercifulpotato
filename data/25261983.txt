However, I also am very excited about encrypted ZFS for one main reason: backups.<p>Okay two.  Snapshots and backups!<p>ZFS is absolutely amazing to use as a home NAS that does daily (or more) snapshots and then nightly differential syncs to a second location.  In the past I had to run all my own infrastructure to do this, as the data was in the clear.<p>Now my ZFS nerd friend and I can simply swap backup space and have &quot;zero knowledge&quot; of the others&#x27; files, while retaining the amazing features of ZFS snapshots+zfs send&#x2F;receive.<p>This also tickles the &quot;create an encrypted ZFS backups as a service&quot; service itch for me, but then I realize I&#x27;d be creating it for all 13 potential users of the service.
