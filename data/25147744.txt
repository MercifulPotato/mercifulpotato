(as waves!), which then radiate outward in space (undetectably, because they&#x27;re now multiple smaller&#x2F;higher-energy particle&#x2F;waves!) from the point at which they &quot;disappeared&quot; from!<p>If this crackpot theory is true (and let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, it is a completely crackpot theory! &lt;g&gt;) then NO INFORMATION would ever be lost to the Universe, ever, basically, the Universe would just be doing a whole lot of Fourier Transforms (and Reverse Fourier Transforms!) in the background, all the time, at all particle sizes, but at different time scales relative to that particle size!<p>In fact, if a particle goes out of scope (&quot;disappears&quot;) relative to a Fourier Transform, then perhaps Fourier Transforms are what also, equal-and-oppositely CREATE particles!<p>And all of this &quot;creation&quot; and &quot;destruction&quot; of particles -- would be at different beat FREQUENCIES relative to scale!<p>It also leads to a very weird question, which is:<p><i>What is the relationship of Gravity to the Fourier Transform</i>?<p>And, Is Gravity itself just a Fourier Transform -- just at a specific scale?<p>Also, if Black Holes are Fourier Transforms -- maybe Suns and Stars are too -- just reverse or &quot;Inverse&quot; Fourier Transforms...<p>?')
