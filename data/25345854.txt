What the RNA does inside the cell we know reasonably well (I&#x27;m simplifying a lot here ), but getting the RNA into the cells efficiently was the original problem to be solved.<p>So I don&#x27;t think those are really standard components, there are a lot of ways to create different systems here with different properties.<p>As a more general comment on this concern about additives, this is typically targeted at vaccines with adjuvants. Adjuvants are designed to create a stronger immune response, the lipids here are not adjuvants and as far as I understand the mRNA vaccines don&#x27;t contain any adjuvants. I don&#x27;t agree with the general concerns about adjuvants (though of course each vaccine has to prove safety in the studies on their own), but they are an additive with an inherently higher risk than something more inert. The immune system is extremely complex and highly dangerous.')
