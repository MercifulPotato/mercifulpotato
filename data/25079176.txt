The box pulled the ballot in with rollers, scanned it, and dropped it in the sealed translucent box underneath, where you could see it, blurred. So there was an immediate electronic tally, and paper ballots for re-counting.<p>Ballot printing was a big cost with that system, but the machines were cheap.')
