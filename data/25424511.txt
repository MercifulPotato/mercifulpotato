Most of train travels emissions are fixed emissions, marginal emissions being much lower. On the flipside, air travel has a much smaller fixed emissions amount but drastically higher marginal emissions.<p>Also, it is not my particular field of engineering but there is likely no scenario where fuel efficiency of planes is better than trains. That you can find sources for pretty easily.')
