Item(by='ecmascript', descendants=None, kids=[24993564], score=None, time=1604506044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24989881, text='&gt; The author of the article doesn&#x27;t say &quot;all websites including those that mimic native apps should work without CSS and JavaScript&quot; - that would be nonsense of course.<p>No but he does say and I&#x27;ll quote &quot;If they can&#x27;t produce something worthwhile without scripting, it&#x27;s probably not worthwhile at all.&quot; which to me means all sites that require javascript no matter of what the purpose is.<p>Sure, a information site with a few pictures and text doesn&#x27;t need javascript. But I am not building nor talking about such sites. These kind of sites are built with tools like wordpress today and I think many web devs like me who live on the edge of whats possible on the web try to push the boundaries even more. I write javascript heavy apps because they solve problems that hasn&#x27;t been solved on the web yet. Apps that previously wasn&#x27;t possible now are and that is where you can dig gold.<p>I don&#x27;t want to have to write a native app because I think the web platform is simply the best way of building apps since there is no other way to be in control and user don&#x27;t have to download anything else than javascript, which are downloaded and runs automatically. The author obviously doesn&#x27;t like javascript but as always he doesn&#x27;t provide a good answer to why.<p>If I can write a web based tool that people can link to, use and then don&#x27;t think about until next time they need it, it will probably get way, way more used than a tool that people need to download and install simply because the installation step is too much work for a lot of people.')
