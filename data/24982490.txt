Result: it didn&#x27;t happen.<p>This is extraordinarily common, in my experience, though only this particular person could do it this well.<p>The entire organization wanted something done except one guy who convinced everyone to let him have the power to stop it without anyone understanding what they were letting him do.<p>You may argue that this is an organization being unwilling to act via its own structure, and I would counter that this person was very skilled at this type of deception, and succeeded at this type of thing despite the organization above, below, and around him all being pretty much standard.')
