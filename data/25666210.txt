True by definition.<p>As to whether they have a <i>moral obligation</i>, that&#x27;s another question entirely, and a rather complex one, as one would have to define what is moral. I would say that a company that wishes to continue operating in a country is going to have to obey the laws of that country.<p>&gt; Or must they participate in every crime that their users engage in?<p>Well, that all depends on whether transmitting other people&#x27;s messages constitutes a crime. Realistically, no company is going to do things that would get it shut down (and if they did, they wouldn&#x27;t do so for long).')
