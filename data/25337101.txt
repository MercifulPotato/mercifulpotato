There are many VR games that don&#x27;t work at all even with Proton. There are many games that <i>do</i> work though.<p>The only game that doesn&#x27;t work that I truly miss is Planetside 2.<p>But your typical big name games <i>do</i> work, even ones that aren&#x27;t on Steam. Doom, Factorio, Kerbal Space Program, EVE Online -- these all work wonderfully. Space Engineers works &quot;okay&quot; -- it has an issue where the process threads will linger in the background even after you exit.<p>Blizzard&#x27;s Battle.net games also work great -- you just have to start it with Lutris and do some magic to enable Vulkan. WoW and Diablo III work beautifully.<p>If I have one complaint about Steam is that clicking the blue button to tell Steam to kill a game <i>doesn&#x27;t work</i>. Space Engineers and World of Warships both have to be manually killed sometimes and it would be real nice if Steam would do it so I don&#x27;t have to open a terminal and find the relevant Wine garbage to do it myself.')
