The only legit scenario in which that happens is when the user deletes the address, which is a rare event (pretty much always &lt;= 1 time in the lifetime of any address), and there shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong with treating that kind of situation the same as any soft error. If you&#x27;re wrong, your mail will just get rejected a few more times anyway, and you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s genuinely a dead end.<p>The underlying issue (wherever this occurs) seems to be lack of nuance regarding error codes when people try to implement robust systems. Different codes imply different things and shouldn&#x27;t all just fall back into generic buckets.')
