National debt is for the most part a good thing, since it&#x27;s a measure of the amount of a national currency is in circulation<p>Modern economic theory proposes that nations, with full control over their currency, have infinite spending power (aka can go into infinite debt) without any issues, as long as full-employment hasn&#x27;t been reached<p>This is of course not entirely possible for many EU countries, since being a member of the eurozone means the country does not have full control over its currency - which was a large contributor to, for instance, the Greek financial crisis')
