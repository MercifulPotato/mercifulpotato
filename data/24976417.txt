Confidence that doesn&#x27;t seem intuitively reasonable. I would say that few rational individuals would have taken a bet with 4 pays 1 odds that Biden would win on July 1. It would not be a very safe bet, because of the likelihood of unknown random events.<p>Therefore, what Nate&#x27;s model was predicting in July probably wasn&#x27;t the probability of Biden winning on November 3rd. That doesn&#x27;t mean the model&#x27;s not useful, but if it is trying to predict what you think it is, then it&#x27;s overconfident.<p>As a non-huge fan of Taleb, and as actually a big fan of Silver, I think Taleb is right here.')
