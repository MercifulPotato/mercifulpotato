Hence companies like Toyota that make EVs only when forced to by law. That does not describe GM.<p>GM sells &amp; markets the Bolt (and formerly the Volt) in all states and provinces of North America. Which is more than you can say for most manufacturers. It&#x27;s really just a family of Tesla, GM, and Nissan, and of those two only GM and Tesla have taken battery temp management and lifespans seriously.<p>GM&#x27;s EV engineering is up there with Tesla. They are not producing compliance cars.<p>Unlike Tesla they are responsible to their shareholders, and have to pay a dividend. So they make and sell what is profitable. The EV thing, they are limited by battery supplies and market demand, but they are well positioned to do better than the others once those obstacles are surmounted.<p>The Bolt is a good vehicle. It&#x27;s not in a form factor I love, but the tech in it is excellent.')
