Slack became too stagnated. They build a great product but didn&#x27;t evolve. \nThey didn&#x27;t seem to address the distraction part. It has created a culture of ASAP everything.<p>It just create too much anxiety with so much going on. It feels busy but not productive. It just seem the same product as it was 4 years ago. \nAlso, it never felt like that they cared about our work-life. Slack took away all the structure from our work and left fragmented chatter. It never felt like they cared for our work-life.<p>It&#x27;s UI is still limited and searching for something is painful even though search is it its name - SLACK. It started as chat but stayed as chat and did nothing to fix issues that comes with chat. With mail, you have one inbox. With slack, you have so many random inbox.<p>All messages are treated equally..from lunch chatter to some important announcement? How do I decide what to mute or unmute? Why can&#x27;t there be a better way? If it&#x27;s an FYI, don&#x27;t send me notification. If my response is needed on something make those messages different. I mean there has to be a better way then just a single chat only fit for picnic planning.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I just feel that slack could have become a huge independent company if they had cared more about the problems of users. Everything starts in a slack message but slack did nothing to helps us achieve it. Instead, it just became a mess of emojis and random time-sucking chatter.')
