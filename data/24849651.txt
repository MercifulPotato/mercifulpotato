During a `git bisect` run I thought I&#x27;d made a mistake as I saw duplicate messages pop up, until I realised there are an enormous amount of duplicate messages in the repo.<p>A lazy scan right now shows over a hundred &quot;make tests green again&quot;, a dozen &quot;fix(up|)&quot;,  handful of &quot;WIP&quot;, etc.  And beyond that a huge chunk are just &quot;update &lt;something&gt;&quot;.  Even with ~20k commits you can catch duplicates in a single unlucky bisect session.<p>I think I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that &#x2F;we&#x2F; in this subthread may be the problem though.  <i>Loads</i> of projects are like that, and hardly anybody else cares.  I suspect it just depends on how you are treating your VCS; I think it tells a story, others seem to think it just a snapshotting tool.')
