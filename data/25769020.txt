I don&#x27;t care about furniture, but I do need a bed, a couch, etc., so I just buy the cheapest reasonable pieces I can find at walmart or ikea. there&#x27;s a good chance I might move far away in the next few years. when&#x2F;if that happens, I&#x27;ll just sell or give away all my current furniture and buy new shitty versions wherever I end up. I&#x27;ll probably recoup a lot of the money by renting a smaller uhaul and not having to pay professional movers.')
