Just like a good organization is eager to share these goals, a good employee is eager to receive them. Whenever someone doesn&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s a big indicator to write them off.<p>#2 - Likewise, people have to give a shit and be critical. I used to run code reviews on my team like this - person A reviews person B&#x27;s code (together, in person) and I sit behind them, not to judge B&#x27;s code but to judge A&#x27;s review. It&#x27;s shocking to me how people want to give code &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; and don&#x27;t flag things unless they are truly egregious. It doesn&#x27;t help anyone when people hold back like this.')
