Item(by='tmsh', descendants=None, kids=[24853884, 24853687, 24853911], score=None, time=1603324601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852780, text='&gt; She&#x27;s a very good manager when it comes to taking a successful business and making it a lot more successful.<p>Bit of a leap to conclude that right just based on eBay?<p>eBay would&#x27;ve had astronomical growth under a dog as CEO. As you mentioned:<p>&gt; She definitely made eBay much bigger than it would have been without her, but it was already successful and growing when she joined.<p>And that&#x27;s her one success story. She&#x27;s had plenty of other opportunities to demonstrate management competency. I think there&#x27;s a cognitive fallacy where we assume someone is good because they were there and we lived through things with them.<p>But as others have said, just look at her wikipedia:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meg_Whitman" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meg_Whitman</a><p>I think we should challenge ourselves when defending people just because they were there and they didn&#x27;t fail.<p>I don&#x27;t care how brilliant she was at delegating to managers across categories, etc., the world needs space for better leaders than e.g. those who support Prop 8 (were anti-gay marriage) etc. Like if you don&#x27;t have empathy there, then it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;re going to be a better manager than, again, my dog.<p>A manager needs to be a leader. Perhaps she can delegate and she has an MBA from HBS and she&#x27;s well-connected in Silicon Valley (I remember her connections to Scott Cook at Intuit, etc. - so much bad shit happened under their watch though, poaching, etc.).<p>But I don&#x27;t think any of her behavior (unless you have concrete examples) makes her &quot;brilliant&quot; or a &quot;good manager&quot; - unless the standards are pretty out-of-date. We really should not be defending people who don&#x27;t evolve (and who are financially very taken care of and have every opportunity to earn trust again, but don&#x27;t).<p>UPDATE. I see some examples now in the other comments. Personally I&#x27;m not convinced. But that&#x27;s just me.')
