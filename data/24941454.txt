Even in a managed office environment, you&#x27;re not safe from all the rough edges.<p>- Drivers.  Why does this still feel so difficult?  Just define a public bytecode API (no, not PS) and be done with this already.<p>- Ink, paper, etc.  Even if you shell out $Texas for a laser printer, you still have to manage paper and then it&#x27;s probably not any good for photos (probably the only thing I want to print).<p>- Protocol&#x2F;tech stack straight out of the Old World.  Cloud Print seemed like the Dropbox to printing&#x27;s SMB.  Proprietary but less terrible.<p>- The waiting for anything to happen.  If I have to go to the trouble of using your proprietary driver to do anything, can&#x27;t the printer at least leverage more of the host computer to speed things up?<p>The whole process feels only slightly less finicky than using a 3D printer.')
