Of course when you don&#x27;t have a committee or a CoC however is in charge can still treat people arbitrarily, in fact much more so than when you actually have agreed on conduct and have a process to resolve things.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s a good piece called the Tyranny of Structurelessness about radical feminist movements, where wanting to ditch all formal rules actually lead to even worse informal treatment, because officially leaders don&#x27;t even exist, so there&#x27;s nobody to blame.<p>I actually think it&#x27;s the opposite: codes and committees make the structurelessness worse. The code creates the illusion that the rules are impartial and their application is a detail. The (usually secret) committee diffuses responsibility so that no-one&#x27;s actually accountable for their decisions. It gives the veneer of process and objectivity when actually there&#x27;s nothing of the sort.<p>Formalising the <i>process</i> - who makes the decisions, on what grounds, with what oversight - is important. Formalising the <i>code</i> without a good process is putting the cart before the horse.')
