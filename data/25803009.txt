Even if the error is explained. So in that, they have a point. A little related are overly elaborate efforts to be cute and cheer up the user on error. (This of course happens more in Web GUI than in command line.) These can be infuriating and make one wish someone expended all this effort and money to actually make the thing work, instead of lecturing me not to get mad, with pictures.<p>But I think terseness is an imperfect proxy for clarity. In the Google search example, repeating the search query to the user may be actually useful. They may have pasted something by accident and&#x2F;or heavily mistyped and not even have noticed. Do include important information, so the user can go directly to the place of fault. State what is wrong and try not to have the same message for many unrelated errors.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m still waiting for an &quot;Unreasonable effectiveness of X considered harmful&quot; article.')
