We need to work, because we made it in such way.\nWhere I live, the subway is packed with people that go to work, many of them, to office jobs that are not needed.<p>You claim that people do not need to attend Thanksgiving. I guess the same goes for Christmas, or most family and friends gathering during the worst times of the pandemic. But this incurs a huge toil on mental health. People suffer.<p>I&#x27;m not saying to ignore restrictions and put people&#x27;s will to meet above everything. But I think it&#x27;s important to see what are we prioritizing. How we are considering that 40h of work are irreplaceable, but we <i>must</i> avoid seeing family and friends.<p>And how long can you sustain this? Imagine this needs to last one more year. A position where I&#x27;m forced to work undesired jobs during 40h per week under the threat of unemployment, poverty and starving, at the same time that I&#x27;m refused many social activities it&#x27;s one where I&#x27;d rather kill myself.')
