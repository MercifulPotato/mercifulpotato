Almost all traditional Unix command do something sensible in response. &quot;mv -i&quot; for example, refrains from moving anything. The software I prefer to use to run your command has no provision for your command&#x27;s trying to engage me in a conversation.<p>If I am sufficiently motivated to run your command, I might choose to re-run your command in Terminal.app. For example,  I ran whatever command needed to install Command Line Tools in Terminal.app so that I could indicate my agreement to its terms and conditions by my typing &quot;y&quot;. But your command is probably not important enough for me to bother running it in Terminal.app.<p>If I use your command incorrectly (e.g., if I misspell a flag), and your command tells me so, then I am willing to issue a new, corrected command line, and in fact I have the patience to try a command over and over, varying the command&#x27;s arguments and the command&#x27;s environment variables till I get it right.<p>But I no longer have the patience for things like vim or mutt or lynx -- i.e., programs that have what one might call a terminal user interface. (What about pagers? Well, I set the environment  variable PAGER to cat. Similar to how Plan 9&#x27;s terminal works, the software I will use to invoke your command does not automatically scroll to the bottom of the process&#x27;s output: the window does not scroll unless I tell it to scroll, e.g., by hitting the page-down key.)<p>lynx was my primary browser for about 10 years, so it is not like I am ignorant of &quot;full screen&quot; terminal interfaces; I am just weary of them.')
