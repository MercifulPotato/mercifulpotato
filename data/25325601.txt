So all in all, as an outsider, it can be a bit difficult.<p>One possible way is to refer to SJR rankings by discipline: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scimagojr.com&#x2F;journalrank.php?category=2801" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scimagojr.com&#x2F;journalrank.php?category=2801</a><p>but this still fails for the extra specialized journals.<p>Another possibility is to look at what authors are publishing in the journal. Are they from major research Universities? etc.<p>But for a general rule of thumb: any journal with an impact over 2 is a legitimate journal, and any journal with an impact of 6 or more is a very solid journal, 9 up are considered top tier, 14 up are elite tiered.')
