If the other hotels were smart they would come out against this specific one and in support of civil reforms as a way to assure guests that they won’t do the same thing.<p>I also really want to commend TripAdvisor for sticking up to their corporate ideals and policies. They got their user out safely, and decided to avoid this issue in future by labeling the hotel as a possible threat. I think the hotel got exactly what they deserve in this case. If you want to risk your good name by jailing someone for bad review you kinda deserve to be run out of the hospitality business, and TripAdvisor should rightfully help people avoid your hotel.')
