I did eventually get one but had trouble getting access to the phone. The BBS sites I did connect to were often full, and many required you to upload something in order to download something. Starting in about 1991 I got access to the Internet at school, and spent most of the time in the lab there, leaving my Amiga behind when I left for college.')
