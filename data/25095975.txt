Zip files use a footer rather than a header, and python natively supports executing scripts out of them. The beginning of the file can have a shebang, allowing it to specify the interpreter to use. The only trick is that windows doesn&#x27;t support shebangs, and so you need to associate your chosen file extension with python on every system. Also, you need python installed obviously.<p>What that gives you is a stable entry point into python code. From there, you can run whatever platform specific code you want.')
