Back in the day it was very common to buy space in a local newspaper and print messages there. The newspaper could (and would!) deny publication of auch messages arbitraily.<p>Living in Germany with laws that ban you from displaying Nazi insignia or spouting certain phrases in public, I don&#x27;t really believe in the whole &quot;if we ban a certain thing there is a slippery slope and suddenly everyhing is banned&quot;. German society more or less collectively decided that tolerance for the intolerant is stupid and did something about it.<p>This might seem a little extrem from an US perspective, but just like that the prudeness of US society seems extreme to us Europeans. You talk about freedom of speech and censor every female nipple there is? Really?<p>What we will and won&#x27;t tolerate in public forums is a mirror of our respective societies and values. And there is <i>always</i> something we will have to ban or at least frown uppon. E.g. even in the US child molesters won&#x27;t be very able to talk about how their believes are okay etc.<p>And because all out free speech is destructive we have to strike a balance somewhere inbetween disincentivising people who use free speech to get rid of it and not turning into thought police.<p>Seen from a German perspective the US is so polarized that the polarization alone disencourages most people from leading a free and meaningful discourse.')
