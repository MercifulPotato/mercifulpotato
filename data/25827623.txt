In a rural location, indeed, even in many suburban locations, you also sort of have to make yourself go out for a walk&#x2F;run&#x2F;hike because you&#x27;re not going to just organically walk from place to place. (ADDED: Aside from house&#x2F;yard work&#x2F;farming&#x2F;etc.) I live in a semi-rural location (nothing like what we&#x27;re talking about here) and there is basically no reason that I <i>have</i> to do more than a minimum level of walking on a given day. (Leaving aside how big a difference that makes in the scheme of things.)')
