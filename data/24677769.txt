It’s interesting because on the whole that was the time I feel Firefox started a slow descent (with a few upticks here and there, like Quantum) . I have been an avid FF user since at least a decade.<p>I mean Firefox has been “there” , but it has and is on a knifes edge when it comes to capturing the hearts and minds of developers (now on chrom&#x2F;ium) and the regular user.<p>I remember a real buzz after the demise of IE and and uptick in the early part of the decade.<p>While I love the FF blogs and privacy work you’ve been doing, it’s hard to get the non user back into the fold.<p>What I hope to see is a more involved model like Blender. Developers are missing features with the devtools is what I hear most when they dont or can’t switch.<p>For users, it’s different, I have now installed FF for a lot of people, but they often don’t even know they have choice beyond what was installed (Safari, Chrome, Edge)\nA more incentive based campaign might be great here, show how FF does thing better in many ways.')
