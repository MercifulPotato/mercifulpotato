My girlfriend grew up in SFBA and went to high school in Palo Alto.<p>The difference in perspective is astounding. Even simple things like what you consider normal.<p>Like, I grew up knowing that The Boss is someone you hate and despise who makes your life miserable. Becoming the boss is villified. Rich people are bad. Everyone is out to screw you. That includes rich people, poor people, the government, the police. Everyone. It’s you against the world. The forgotten class everyone exploits and nobody helps. High taxes, no help.<p>Oh and teachers are all dumb. Otherwise they wouldn’t be teachers.<p>By comparison the normal for my girlfriend is “You invent google street view or cofound the next ebay, obviously. That’s just basics”. At the least you do well in school, get great grades, and climb a corporate hiwrarchy to near top. That’s the failure mode if nothing else works.<p>Learning the US corporate&#x2F;business culture has been imo my biggest challenge moving here.')
