Item(by='temac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607383891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25329876, text='3 years latter good commit messages are extremely useful, and most of the time very short ones and&#x2F;or giant commits are mostly useless.<p>I occasionally read back multiple pages commit message I wrote and wished I dumped <i>even more info</i> from my brain at the time.<p>If you work on small and short projects, you can do pretty much anything though.<p>Of course it can still be unreasonable, but that&#x27;s quite like anything else. But if in doubt, I would say write more; because if you really track your time in a detailed way, you will see that the marginal additional time is often shorter than you feel. And it taking 1&#x2F;3 of your time may even be justified in <i>some</i> cases (but maybe you should write some doc in another way then).<p>And I would not be so sure about it not magically making you better though: it is sometimes extremely useful to just write things down, quite like it is useful to explain a bug to a rubber duck.')
