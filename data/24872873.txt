The fact, that mapping all n^i to arctan(i) and i^n to arctan(i) + pi is somehow &quot;misleading&quot; is not making it theoretically impossible for RL algorithms from finding an optimal solution in that metric. If for a specific instance you&#x27;re saying n^1e300 is wrong because it is impractical, and 2^n would be preferred, you simply posed the original task incorrectly by asking for a wrong metric.')
