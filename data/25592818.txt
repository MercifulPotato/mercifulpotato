And killing flash without a replacement for the studio existing leaves a hole where it used to be. And it may be possible that Flash was a product of its time, and such a well integrated studio isn’t going to be made again for decades.<p>Which isn’t to say that Flash didn’t need to die. The security issues existed and I suspect that Adobe would have slowly killed it from neglect regardless. But HTML5 is not a replacement for what Flash was.')
