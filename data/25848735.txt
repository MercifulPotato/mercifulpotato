I wasn&#x27;t talking about a metaphorical hotdog, nor was I talking about the Elastic case.  The post makes no mention of it either, people on HN just assume it was about it because of the timing (and maybe it was, but I am talking about the general issue of free software). Personally I don&#x27;t care about companies like Elastic or Amazon, anyway, and I look at it from the point of view of a single programmer writing software.')
