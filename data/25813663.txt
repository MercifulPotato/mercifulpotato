It&#x27;s a 15&quot; laptop, it&#x27;s huge. And yet, they&#x27;ve gone and put Home and End under F11 and F12. Meanwhile, Printscreen is under F10, which no one needs, and NOTHING is under F9. Also, F5 is covered with the brightness key! I can either refresh or have brightness, while F9, which is used nowhere, is blank.<p>There used to be such a nice last column along the rightmost edge of the keyboard with Home, Page Up, Page Down and End. Bring them back! It&#x27;s stupid design to have.<p>The other thing, which I take is the same for the macbook, is that the trackpad is so huge that the edge of the keyboard digs into the forearms, causing pain for any reasonable length of use.')
