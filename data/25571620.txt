From what I see though, far more resources are spent attempting to fix symptoms of aging (cancer, heart disease, frailty), than on preventing those conditions from occurring in the first place.<p>If we cure cancer, at best we&#x27;re adding a few years to the average lifespan before something else kills you off. If we rejuvenate the immune system to that of a 20 year old, not only are those cancerous cells far more likely to be killed off at an earlier stage, but also prevent a ton of other age related diseases.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something that should just have a blank cheque written for it, but I think that governments should encourage young people to become researchers in the field and should spend far more resources on basic science. We can change the incentives for insurance companies to pay for preventing diabetes instead of treating it.<p>Climate change is solvable - it requires both research and effort to get us there. Many people are simply not willing to sacrifice to solve it since it won&#x27;t affect them. We also have tons of older people who go from producers to consumers, and are not contributing to fixing climate change. A 75 year old can be building windmills instead of hanging out on a golf cart in florida. A research scientist can continue their work instead of experiencing cognitive decline. We&#x27;d probably experience a short term increase in carbon emissions but I think the long term trend would be much lower since we&#x27;ll get past the technological hurtles quicker with more people working on the problem.')
