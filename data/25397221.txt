I block <i>all JavaScript</i> in my normal browser by default and turn it on selectively for web apps I use (think GitHub and others) but if your site has no interactive element that I care about it stays off. If I click an article and the text doesn&#x27;t load without JS, I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t care what you have to say.<p>I&#x27;ve been messing with Gemini and some of its browsers (I&#x27;m a big fan of Lagrange) and I have to say it is spectacular. The markup language for documents is great, the extremely limited functionality is great (although I&#x27;d like to see italics and bold text) and I really like the mostly thoughtful content. That latter one would probably change if it picks up a lot of steam, but so far I wish all websites who&#x27;s audience is just reading were Gemini documents.')
