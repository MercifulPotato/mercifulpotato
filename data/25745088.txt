I would like to move away from building apps in the browser but I&#x27;m only familiar with JavaScript and web-technologies.<p>Since Electron is frowned upon, what language or platform would be suitable?<p>Requirements:\n- Mature language\n- Mature ecosystem\n- Performance better than Electron or a fast website<p>A major plus:\n- Big community of quality tutorials \n- Big community of packages\n- It&#x27;s not too hard to learn for someone who knows JavaScript<p>-----<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the Rust eco-system, but most GUI libraries are not there yet.
