My manager trusts I will make up lost time after my doctor&#x27;s appointment, as they generally know if I&#x27;ve been falling behind work or not. We also give daily standup status updates so its obvious if work isn&#x27;t progressing after some time.<p>This also works in reverse. If I work on Sat&#x2F;Sun for some system maintenance then my manager tells me to swap time off during the week. But in my experience, What usually happens is I work my full week anyway because something important arose and I push that &quot;time off&quot; to the next week until I forget I had it.')
