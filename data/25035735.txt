I also live in south Louisiana.<p>The last 5 months have been extremely difficult to maintain focus because, for me at least, it&#x27;s really difficult for my brain to not check tropical forecasts every time I look at my phone.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that my productivity triples when there are no storms in the gulf due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to maintain my attention on engineering tasks. I&#x27;ve thought of setting up a second phone that I have with ONLY ping on it, but I feel that it&#x27;s the stress driving me to check the tropics, and if I took the time to create a &#x27;just ping&#x27; device my mind would find another way to compulsively check.')
