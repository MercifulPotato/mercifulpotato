If we had allowed the extra capacity to get used, instead of getting rid of it, the lockdowns wouldn&#x27;t have had to be as strict.  Less strict lockdowns means less economic problems, which means we could sustain them longer.<p>Which gets right back to my original point:  As it is now, people have ended up with more pressing concerns than the virus and so care less and less about following the lockdowns.<p>Also another quick aside, back on that original point - &quot;two weeks to slow the spread&quot;?  Lockdowns were sold to us specifically on slowing the spread <i>while we increased capacity</i>, to deal with the increase in patients.  There was always an understanding that as long as we don&#x27;t go past that capacity, no extra lives would be saved, they&#x27;d just be spread over a longer period.  That&#x27;s why the original slogan was &quot;two weeks&quot; - it was what we needed to build the extra capacity, then we could stop the lockdowns as long as we kept masks&#x2F;social distancing.')
