If you build a graphics editor or a text editor using Apple&#x27;s toolchain and most of your clients run Apple, porting is likely high priority and not super hard.<p>A lot of these things you are complaining about are just really hard problems.<p>Docker requires a hypervisor which wasn&#x27;t part of the A12Z processor they shipped in the DTK. It also depends on Go.<p>Go isn&#x27;t available because porting languages to a new processor is non-trivial.<p>Rust has the above issues, plus didn&#x27;t Mozilla lay off a huge chunk of the Rust team?')
