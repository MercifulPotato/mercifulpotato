Absolutely. Can it mean less when it’s coming from a corporation whose primary intention is to receive your money? Yes, I think so too. Is knowledge a requisite for kindness? I don’t know you @nicbou but I know you deserve kindness, because everyone does.<p>If I’m understanding you correctly, you’re saying false praise is not kind. I see how that can be true. Telling someone they’re the best ice skater in the world when they’re not, for example, could be detrimental to them because of the unrealistic dreams or expectations that might create. I’m being very careful in curating the content of the badges and I don’t believe any of it would fall in the category of false or misleading praise. If you see one though let me know and I’ll consider changing or removing it.')
