The UI is a train wreck.  It looks designed for touch and I have no idea why.  I guess Sidecar?<p>They changed a <i>ton</i> about the UI in Big Sur, none of it for the better as far as I can tell.  They took away even more choice, I can&#x27;t have a &quot;classic&quot; desktop experience.<p>My biggest frustration is that they were willing to make such drastic changes to the desktop UI at all.  I have to re-learn a ton of keyboard navigation now.  And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a coherent design to the workflows.<p>Such a drastic change seems to be an admission that they thought the previous design language was wrong but they seem to have replaced it with... no vision at all?<p>I am hopeful for the next generation of M1 MacBook Pros and whatever the next MacOS is.  Hopefully they get their design philosophy straight and stick with it.')
