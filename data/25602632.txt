Never mind adverse health and personal impacts -- does it actually work as a means to squeezing more output out of staff? I mean, you can definitely achieve a short temporary burst to meet a deadline by putting in long hours and maybe Miyamoto can boost his managerial output by sitting in meetings for 60 hours instead of 30. But I really have difficulty picturing programmers working on complex stuff like game engines being more productive with a 80 hour week than a 30 hour week for anything beyond a few days, let alone extended periods of time. And indeed all traditional studies of worker productivity (not necessarily in IT) I recall suggest that productivity falls off a cliff pretty soon as weekly hours a cranked up (see also  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;productivity-vs-annual-hours-worked?tab=chart&amp;country=&amp;region=World" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;productivity-vs-annual-ho...</a>, which suggests a general pattern between countries).<p>So I&#x27;m wondering -- is game industry crunch so popular (majority of game studios seem to be doing it) for reasons that having nothing to do with increasing individual worker output?<p>In the case of Japan in particular there is also a strong tradition of doing long but very unproductive work hours because presence is prized over productivity .<p>Or are games really &quot;special&quot; in some way (for example because there is some evidence that people can sustain normally unsustainable productivy&#x2F;weekly hours ratios for &quot;passion projects&quot;)?<p>Does anyone have any good studies or anectodal evidence from their own experience (focussed 30-50 hour week vs crunch for several weeks)?')
