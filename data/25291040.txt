So feudal lords weren&#x27;t driven by profit (profit didn&#x27;t really exist as a concept as it does today) but by other values like glory, etc. Not to say that they weren&#x27;t greedy, because they were indeed, but they certainly didn&#x27;t think about infinite growth or perpetually finding ways to make shareholders richer, like your corporate lord would today.')
