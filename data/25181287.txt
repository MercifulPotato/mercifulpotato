Empower the employees to participate in politics without the company taking a side itself?<p>IMHO it&#x27;s about power and the profits power leads to, and the desire of large companies to maintain their power and their profit.<p>IMHO on some level large corporations know that if they did this employees would get politically active and push more for their own interests to be represented in government over that of the large companies, resulting in less profit for said companies because government is investing in civil society and public infrastructure instead.<p>IMHO part of the reason the George Floyd protests were as big as they were is that folks had time on their hands, which is not the normal case for most folks in our system as it is today.')
