IBM&#x27;s Jalapeno&#x2F;JikesRVM has been a JVM implemented almost entirely in Java for decades.  It self-compiles by using the highest tier of its JIT on itself and then dumps the native code in memory to disk as an executable.  Though, as far as I know, JikesRVM doesn&#x27;t keep around its own bytecode (or an SSA representation of itself) for later dynamically re-optimizing itself or inlining parts of the JVM in user code hot spots.  Hopefully a Truffle&#x2F;Graal-based production JVM would be able to dynamically re-optimize&#x2F;inline almost all of the JVM into hot spots in user code.')
