I&#x27;d like to add a bit more though. Deplatforming is commonplace, by all parties with a platform, and its causes aren&#x27;t just written comments but also artwork and legal commercial goods.<p>More than the examples the other comment noted, though, I prefer the depressing&#x2F;amusing history of Gab as they stepped on just about every single centralized service rake and had it hit them in the face for things some of its user base typed. Going through its wiki history page, I&#x27;m even seeing some I missed. Here&#x27;s a list: Apple (iOS app store), Google (play store), Twitter (API), Asia Registry (domain name), Microsoft (Azure), Stripe, PayPal, GoDaddy, Medium, Joyent (hosting), Backblaze, Coinbase, Square, most Mastodon instances (federation won&#x27;t necessarily save you) and popular Mastodon mobile apps, Mozilla (Firefox addon), Google again (Chrome addon), Visa.<p>At the end of the day, yes, anyone can spin up Tor or I2P or Freenet or whatever to talk unhindered, they can participate in commerce with decentralized crypto-coins. And despite the struggles one can still find Gab&#x2F;4chan&#x2F;the others on the clearnet and participate in the subset of things that got them in trouble for hosting. It only takes a very moderate amount of active will, and you&#x27;ll have all you want. That it&#x27;s not exposed passively to people on other platforms is probably no great loss. Still I think it&#x27;s worth caring a bit about these things as indicators of changes in culture and, following culture, law, even if you like me don&#x27;t particularly care much if you&#x27;re reduced to keeping a private journal because no one will host any of your thoughts because of a subset of your thoughts at some point in time.')
