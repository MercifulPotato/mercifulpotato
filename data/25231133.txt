My H1B expires end of March 2021. Do I need to renew my H1B, or can I simply use the AOS application to maintain status while the green card comes through? I imagine after my H1B expires, if I don&#x27;t file for a renewal, I won&#x27;t be able to work, unless my EAD comes through on time?<p>Under normal circumstances I&#x27;d renew my H1B, but given the insane salary requirements due to recent changes to the program, I need to pay myself upwards of 250K, and I just don&#x27;t feel too good drawing that level of salary as a founder :)<p>Do you have any advice? Would USCIS relax the salary requirements for founders?')
