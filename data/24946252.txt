I have an offer to start as an SWE consultant at a small, but growing technical consulting company that has an office near my college (in NC), as well as offices in other states.<p>Things I like about the company&#x2F;offer:\n- Flat organizational structure\n- Supportive and collaborative culture (I&#x27;ve talked to 7 people at the company and had good impressions from all of them about this)\n- Better work-life balance compared to other consulting companies I know of\n- Opportunity for exposure to lots of technologies via different clients\n- Good starting pay ($72K)\n- Company pays for continuous learning opportunities (certifications + online courses)\n- Role is oriented around being a self-starter\n- Health insurance and 4 weeks PTO<p>Things I don&#x27;t like:\n- Perception (by others and myself) of settling, since this is my first offer\n- In an industry I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll stay in long-term. I&#x27;m interested in the idea of working on open source products at companies like Elastic and Canonical, but I&#x27;m not at the level of skill&#x2F;confidence yet where I can make significant contributions and&#x2F;or get into those companies.\n- Not sure if fast-paced nature of consulting aligns with how I learn best.\n- Nagging feeling that I should be doing something more &quot;risky&quot;<p>I have a good feeling about this company, and think the small, self-starter nature of it could provide lots of opportunities for me to learn, grow, and stand out if I put in the effort.<p>About me: I struggle with perfectionism. I love learning and the thrill of programming, but I&#x27;ve been in a chronically overwhelmed state in college. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I feel like I haven&#x27;t been able to truly _focus_ on learning in my later college years because of all the technical courses I am taking, and I really hate that feeling.')
