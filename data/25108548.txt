User-facing web apps just aren’t a core application target for most people who use Ocaml, and probably won’t ever be.  There are many perfectly good languages out there that address that need, so if ocaml doesn’t, so be it.<p>Maybe I’m just in the minority - I like the fact that there are lots of languages out there, some of which choose not to cater to every possible development scenario.  This is why I know lots of languages - instead of trying to apply one to every situation, I look at a situation presented to me and can go into my mental toolbox to pull the right language out for the job.  I don’t see language design&#x2F;implementation as a competition to acquire users.  Do a job, do it well, and some subset of people will be happy - those that aren’t can move along and continue browsing the catalog of languages until they find one that meets their needs.')
