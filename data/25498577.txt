They generally have pretty fast shutter speeds available for moving subjects. Dynamic range is not particularly important now that exposure blending works so well.<p>Diffraction all comes out in the wash. Smaller sensors allow wider apertures (and phones have some room to grow in terms of sensor size).<p>The resolution advantage is actually quite moderate (people are often mislead by comparing the number of pixels rather than its square root).')
