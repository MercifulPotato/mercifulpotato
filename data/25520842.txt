Publically funded research does not have the same issues as commercially funded research, full stop. A properly designed experiment (one capable of receiving public funds from the DOE, for example) will produce useful data regardless of the outcome. Not observing something vs observing something with a well-quantified uncertainty in either case are equally important results.<p>If a certain experimental result means the experiment is less worthy of publication, then it should not have been funded in the first place. Publically funded research must meet this standard, and in fact receiving funds from all the governmental sources im familiar with have reporting requirements attached.<p>Good research is interesting regardless of the result. This is the core concept the corporate world fails to grasp.')
