Is there not an argument to be made, particularly here where the focus is Section 230 and mostly just FB&#x2F;Twitter, that it&#x27;s such an issue because Congress allowed these tech companies unchecked growth and consolidation? Outside of more typical news (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc), what you see on the internet has come down to the whims of Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey. Even Instagram is still just Zuckerberg. There&#x27;s no room for competitors anymore and I think a large reason for that is Congress&#x27;s continued inaction.')
