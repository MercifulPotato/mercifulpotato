That&#x27;s partially why there is a &quot;TV accent&quot; that&#x27;s more or less regarded as the standard US accent.<p>As a non-native English speaker, I&#x27;ve found that the best way to make myself understandable is to enunciate the consonance clearly. It sounds weird sometimes, and clearly not native, but it&#x27;s always clear.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve trained myself to do is the control of rhythm and stresses. I got this idea from a book on poetry, which classified English as a stress-timed language. Coming from a mother tone of Chinese, I&#x27;m not used to grouping rhythm centered on <i>stress syllables</i>. For me, stresses used to live just within an English word, as notated by the dictionary.<p>When I started to pay attention to a sentence-level flow of stresses, I finally understand how English speaking people gloss over some syllables and emphasize on others. I&#x27;ve even noticed that many eloquent speakers naturally slip into a iambic pentameter when they talk.')
