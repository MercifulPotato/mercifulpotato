Learning curve is steep but I feel so much more productive.  The reward of learning something new can be massive.  I&#x27;ve spent tons of hours on learning Vim and tweaking its config file, and it has rewarded me with an editor that I feel comfortable using for a lifetime. I&#x27;ve also wanted to try Emacs because of its potential benefits.<p>Zettel* is not for everyone, just as GTD or Pomodoro or Agile&#x2F;Scrumm or Kanban. But when it works for those certain  people, it is like magic, and the productivity level just skyrockets. When GTD was popular a decade ago, it really revolutionized how I worked, and its biggest benefit was that it offloaded brain so I can really focus on what is essential, not having to constantly remember what I needed to do next.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason I use markdown, git, vim&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;vscode, etc.')
