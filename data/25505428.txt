Item(by='noisy_boy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608638408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504975, text='I recently had to write some Go code and coming from Java&#x2F;Scala world, actually the &quot;err != nil&quot; thing didn&#x27;t bother me as much as I thought it would. In fact I liked the explicitness of error handling. However, lack of enums really puzzled me; how is having to go through &quot;iota&quot; hoops simpler than &quot;enum Name { ... choices ... }&quot;? I did like the batteries included approach though - I could build the entire component purely using standard library - not having to deal with importing requests and creating virtualenv etc was refreshing.')
