I.e. this cant be that important unless the same bug shows also in non-asan Setjmp&#x2F;longjmp case. Setjmp&#x2F;longjmp are often a source of trouble for the register allocator or related optimization due to its unique properties. Often the optimizing compilers treat set&#x2F;longjmp as &quot;give up almost everything around those functions&quot; but maybe llvm is trying hard to model it precisely and failing. But I haven&#x27;t personally looked at the relevant code in llvm so this is mostly a speculation.')
