Your objectives are refreshing and this looks much more appealing than Wix or Squarespace.  For context, I am a non-coder who can cobble together basic HTML pages by mirroring tutorials but don&#x27;t know the actual basics.<p>I took a look at your site and have a few comments:\n- The &quot;How it works&quot; section is fantastic.  Thank you for including all the intermediate steps such as Github authorization&#x2F;linking.<p>- It was not clear to me exactly what role Mavo plays.  It appears as the in-browser editor but but looks to be much more capable than I was expecting.<p>- I like the Worklog - it&#x27;s interesting to get a peek behind the scenes.<p>- What sorts of topics are you planning for your tutorials? Will it get as direct as &quot;how to add a shopping cart to your website&quot; or focus on bigger picture topics?<p>- In the Limits section of the Pricing page, I recommend you make it more visible that Netlify, Render, and Vercel are under the Yax umbrella as hosting options.  I know you covered it in the &quot;i&quot; hover text but something like an additional table header would help.  Non-coders are not as familiar with these companies and how they fit into the larger system.')
