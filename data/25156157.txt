I hate Facebook discussions along with any other site that uses this nested comment + magical sorting algorithm format (e.g. Reddit, Hacker News).<p>It&#x27;s impossible to have a lengthy discussion about anything of substance on sites like this. The nested comment format immediately splinters every discussion into multiple &quot;mini-threads&quot; rather than a single coherent conversation. Each of those mini-threads splinters even further, making it impossible to follow anything.<p>Then the upvotes and algorithm fuck it up even more by pushing &quot;popular&quot; replies to the top while burying anything controversial.<p>Every thread is dead within hours, not just because discussions are fractured into a million pieces but because variety is prioritized over substance and the front page MUST have new content every time users visit the site.<p>On forums there were threads that would live for years, some have probably even spanned more than a decade at this point.')
