To make a change I decided to start walking nightly. Began taking my dogs with me for encouragement (perhaps the thing dogs are best at), and eventually settled on a route that covered almost exactly two miles with some good hills to get the heart rate up. Today the dogs no longer come with me because they have grown too old to keep up. My weight is down to 215 and my waist to 36&quot; and the nightly walk is such an ingrained habit that I feel like a complete slug if I can&#x27;t take it for some reason.')
