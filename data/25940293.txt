We do not communicate with the idea that our words have a unique, specific meaning.  This means that you can do things like quote my statements out of context in order to change their intent.<p>2) People are not perfect.  You can almost always find some &quot;fault&quot; in even the best people.  People should not be punished for a &quot;fault&quot; unless it does <i>measurable</i> harm to someone else.')
