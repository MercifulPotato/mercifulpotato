I started taking lessons with a pro jazz pianist (instead of a more typical classically-focused piano teacher), I gave up on sheet music altogether and started working off lead sheets instead (just chord symbols and a melody line).  I am so pleased I made that decision, it&#x27;s so much more satisfying playing a tune in your own way rather than just aiming for a note-for-note reproduction of what is written on a sheet.<p>I still have loads more to learn, but I&#x27;m fairly pleased with where I&#x27;ve got to so far.  I&#x27;ve got a few videos on youtube so you can judge for yourself if interested:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC_NWuVoCn-Oc1KIiHEhe7Eg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC_NWuVoCn-Oc1KIiHEhe7Eg</a><p>However, although I think I can play reasonably well now, my sight-reading is awful, and it does hold me back because it makes it a lot harder for me to learn new techniques from sheet music (which I am actually interested in doing, as opposed to simply learning the sheet music note for note).  I can do it just about, but it&#x27;s painfully slow, so I am usually too lazy to bother.<p>Given the choice of either playing with full sheet-music or learning chords&#x2F;voicings&#x2F;scales and how to put them together, I&#x27;d pick the latter no question, and that is what I recommend to other adults who are learning piano, but I do think it&#x27;s best to have both.  So I can definitely see the value in this, even if it doesn&#x27;t currently seem to teach the theory and improvisation that, in my opinion, is what really brings the joy into piano playing.  I might give it a proper go myself some time soon, to see if it can help me improve my rubbish sight reading.<p>I can also imagine this being very useful for a beginner...  Although I&#x27;m singing the praises of chord theory and improvisation I&#x27;m guessing most beginners might realistically do better starting with sheet music, for a while at least.<p>In summary: it might not teach everything, but it looks really useful nonetheless :)')
