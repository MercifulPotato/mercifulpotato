Yea, I built a whole kind of config api for another project a long time ago and used this technique. It worked well.<p>That said, I went a bit overboard on it because I wanted to load a json file as the &#x27;default&#x27; base and then be able to save it on the filesystem, update it via a http API and merge in changes over time to the saved version on disk. The reason was that this &#x27;agent&#x27; ran on thousands of little computers (litecoin mining machines) and needed to be configurable per miner.<p>This is the source if you want to take a look:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blockassets&#x2F;bam_agent&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;service&#x2F;agent&#x2F;config.go" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blockassets&#x2F;bam_agent&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;service...</a><p>It is all unit tested too.<p>For another more recent project that isn&#x27;t open source, I&#x27;ve since re-done it to be a lot simpler (and moved to packr2). It just reads the file. =)')
