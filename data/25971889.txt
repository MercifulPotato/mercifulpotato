I am European, we don&#x27;t even have Robinhood here, so I had a dead eToro account with 140 EUR on it and Interactive Brokers, which we all thought was synonymous with quality and respect. However, they folded first, along with Degiro, which was the other &quot;well-reputed&quot; option available to us. Everyone started running to XTB, which limited trading on Friday afternoon&#x2F;night.<p>In the US there is Webull, which went against their clients initially and then reversed. As an European - where should I go to? Binance&#x2F;Kraken seems the only reasonable option at this point, however crypto has ties to the real world only on macro-economic scale (although very relevant) and you cannot use your &quot;capital&quot; to influence the world around you in a good way.<p>P.S. I know that Fidelity and other well-reputed vendors didn&#x27;t turn coats, but I am not sure it is an option here.\nP.P.S.
