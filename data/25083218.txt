Also, as far as I can tell there isn’t really a laptop&#x2F;distribution pair that has a support experience like Apple or Microsoft hardware either.<p>Ubuntu or Arch on a thinkpad is pretty close, but trackpad support still isn’t close to apple or surfaces and if the OS becomes unstable you’re on your own.<p>I’d definitely consider a Linux laptop if it had a Retina-comparable display, aluminum body, excellent trackpad, weighed less than 5 lbs, half-decent speakers, and commercial support where I could walk in same-day and have my OS problems fixed.')
