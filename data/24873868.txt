(Earlier it was based on user presence AFAIK)<p>After updates are installed (auto or manual), Windows shows a notification saying this and that a restart has been scheduled (which you can snooze to a different time, or set active hours to make it auto-schedule a little better). As far as I know that notification doesn&#x27;t auto-dismiss. Some time before the scheduled restart -- IIRC it&#x27;s 30 minutes -- it pops up a fullscreen warning.')
