I obviously don&#x27;t know the particulars here, but I&#x27;ve learned that the attitude of the university teaching staff can be confusing because of non-obvious job reasons.<p>At my university, there was this PhD having labs with us who I liked - she seemed one of the smarter and wiser of the people I&#x27;ve dealt with up to that point. A year or two after those classes, we ended up having a discussion about upcoming changes in the curriculum. I asked if she&#x27;ll still be running the same labs she did with us, at which point she almost burst into tears and said something like, &quot;oh god I hope not&quot;. I was perplexed by it, until she explained to me that she never wanted these labs, she was forced by her superiors to run them, and they are completely unrelated to the domain of her research. That insight made me understand several other cases of PhDs and professors that seemed incompetent and&#x2F;or disinterested - it&#x27;s not that they were bad or stupid; it&#x27;s because the university mismanaged them into teaching things entirely outside their domain.')
