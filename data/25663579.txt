He and his enablers employ many of the tactics used by other cult-like organizations, such religious organizations (e.g. scientology), or otherwise (i.e. multilevel marketing schemes).  These organizations offer the opportunity to be apart of something &quot;great&quot; and &quot;historic&quot;, to teach you how to be strong, to transform yourself from &quot;zero to hero&quot;, and have fellowship with other like minded individuals who have the will and desire to improve their lives too.  In return they demand absolute, unquestioning, and unwavering fealty.<p>This has little to do with political orientation (left vs right) and everything to do with Donald Trump.  There is currently a &quot;civil war&quot; going on inside the GOP, and the most vicious attacks from the cult-of-MAGA tend to be aimed at members of the political right who voice even the slightest dissent and are thus deemed &quot;insufficiently loyal&quot; (i.e. counterrevolutionaries).')
