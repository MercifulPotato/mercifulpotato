Which is why the US Supreme Court has continually debated and weighed First Amendment tension against public safety.<p>To my knowledge, the Confederate battle flag has never flown in the US Capitol. Not in July, 1864, when the Confederate Army stared at it across 6 miles and lightly defended lines [0]. Not after 1939 when it was hoisted in film by <i>Gone with the Wind</i> with sanitized nostalgia for an antebellum past [1]. And certainly not in the 50s and 60s when it was appropriated by the reborn Ku Klux Klan to represent their racist beliefs [2].<p>But it has been present at all three instances of armed insurrection against the US government -- Civil War, first US terrorist organization, and modern, militant Trump supporters.<p>And ultimately, it&#x27;s those people&#x27;s <i>actions</i>, not their ideas or symbols, that are dangerous.<p>As Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote in Whitney v. California [3], by way of Jefferson&#x27;s views [4]:<p><i>&quot;[Those who won our independence] believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.<p>They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression; that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones.&quot;</i><p>To consign evil to the shadows is no victory, for there are always shadows.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;when-washington-dc-came-close-to-being-conquered-by-the-confederacy-180951994&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;when-washington-dc-ca...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qSEVyzKmlyU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qSEVyzKmlyU</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gettyimages.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-photo&#x2F;the-confederate-flag-flies-as-ku-klux-klan-members-gather-news-photo&#x2F;113917842" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gettyimages.com&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-photo&#x2F;the-confederat...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;supremecourt&#x2F;text&#x2F;274&#x2F;357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;supremecourt&#x2F;text&#x2F;274&#x2F;357</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu&#x2F;selected-documents&#x2F;elijah-boardman-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu&#x2F;selected-documents&#x2F;eli...</a>')
