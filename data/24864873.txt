I paid for and tried the initial version (Mark I?) a year or two ago, and, aside from a few manual settings and RAW capture it didn&#x27;t do a whole lot beyond what the stock photo app did, and Halide&#x27;s UI was a bit worse to boot. But whatever.<p>Now I re-download Halide (the version I paid for a year or two ago) to see what this new version is all about and I&#x27;m presented with a bewildering splash screen, prompting me to subscribe (for what now?) and I do everything I can to <i>not</i> subscribe, and then I&#x27;m taken to the permissions screen, and it&#x27;s asking for camera permissions (totally reasonable), photo library access (ok, but let&#x27;s hold on for a sec), and location access (no thank you), and I can&#x27;t get <i>anywhere</i> in the app that I paid for, without granting all three permissions.<p>Having location access a <i>hard requirement</i> for a photo app is just ridiculous. What product owner made this decision? IMO it&#x27;s completely out of touch and user hostile.<p>Edit: turns out the hard constraint was access to the photo library. Which, how was I to know that? The UI seemed to indicate that I couldn&#x27;t proceed until all the boxes were checked.<p>Look, I get that this is a specialized app and I understand the complexity and nuance related to app permissions. Which means the app developer has to be <i>super clear</i> about what the requirements are from the start.')
