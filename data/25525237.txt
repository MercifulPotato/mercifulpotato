Item(by='jcrites', descendants=None, kids=[25529902], score=None, time=1608787001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519718, text='I&#x27;ve found that if you are transparent as recruiters and treat them as partners , sharing the offers you&#x27;ve gotten at other companies, they will reciprocate. At one of the Big Tech companies where I interviewed and they ultimately decided not to give me an offer (it was a near thing and I had other offers), the recruiter gave me tips about what other companies she was aware of that were paying well in my area (that I wasn&#x27;t aware of).<p>Your relationship with recruiters is more complicated and nuanced than the game-theory relationship would lead you to be believe. Maybe I could have gotten slightly better offers if I had used classic hardball negotiating tactics, but from colleagues, other recruiters, and other data sources, it looks like being transparent resulted in me getting top-of-market offers for my job role at the companies where I was interviewing and got offers.<p>My philosophy is to interact with everyone as if I&#x27;m planning to join their team from the beginning, almost as if I&#x27;m already a team member. That entails among other things that if you&#x27;re going to join someone&#x27;s team then you&#x27;ll interact with them with transparency and vice versa.<p>During my recent round of interviews, I shared the ballpark details about all the offers I got and all the companies I was interviewing with with every company I was working with, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Recruiters would give me tips like &quot;Competitor X&#x27;s offer is likely to offer the highest compensation, but here are some reasons you should consider us&quot;, or &quot;Offer Y from &lt;other company&gt; is a very good offer&quot;, all from recruiters at other companies. If I had been cagey I don&#x27;t think I would have built relationships with recruiters where they&#x27;d share tips like that with me.<p>I think a no-bullshit approach is refreshing and worth considering. The trick is being high demand as talent -- having multiple offers and being a desirable candidate for employers to hire.<p>The recruiters that I recently worked with at all the big tech companies, pre-IPO tech companies, and startups were all very professional and I think I only benefited from treating them as partners in the profess of finding the best next job -- because the company and employee are looking for a mutual fit, after all. This resulted in me having a number of great offers (a few where I don&#x27;t have details yet) that I&#x27;m currently in the process of deciding between.<p>There might be really good negotiators who could do even better, but simply showing that you&#x27;re high demand in the market was enough for me to get good offers from the companies I was working with who made them.')
