I love auto-racing. I love the noise, the personalities, and most importantly the cars.<p>I can&#x27;t answer your question, really. If there isn&#x27;t any draw to watch it, you probably just don&#x27;t enjoy it. No shame in that.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand why people watch football&#x2F;basketball&#x2F;soccer; but I understand why I don&#x27;t <i>get it</i> -- I have no interest in the sports.<p>My father watches the Tour de France every year. He was an extremely in-depth established cyclist for years and years.<p>When I watch the Tour with him, I fall asleep. He falls asleep if I put him through auto-racing.<p>I think it&#x27;s the same kind of thing.<p>If it&#x27;s any consolation : your problem is a widespread one. The FIA is trying to make it more spectator-interesting next year by establishing a big wall of rule changes.')
