Disclosure: I&#x27;m the author of DomTerm (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org</a>) which does that.  Having a multiplexer emulate a terminal on top of a terminal emulator is wrong in multiple ways.  Most obviously you&#x27;re limited to the functionality that is common to both the multiplexer and the underlying terminal.  The user interface is restricted: You can&#x27;t re-arrange sub-windows with the mouse (drag).  Menus aren&#x27;t integrated.  You have to use a special command-key that applications may not use.  (With an integrated multiplexer you can use a command-key that applications can&#x27;t use because it doesn&#x27;t send an xterm escape sequence.) Different sub-windows can connect (and detach&#x2F;re-attach) to different remote servers without explicitly running nested remote multiplexers etc.<p>I believe DomTerm can conceptually do everything that GNU screen or tmux can do, in a more integrated way. I say &quot;conceptually&quot;: It has the major features but is missing some polish and minor features because it is less mature.  (Help welcomed.) I&#x27;m current working on polishing &quot;copy&#x2F;view mode&quot;. The way DomTerm handles remote connections (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org&#x2F;Remoting-over-ssh.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;domterm.org&#x2F;Remoting-over-ssh.html</a>) is mostly done and if-I-say-so-myself quite elegant and user-friendly.')
