It seems people are conflating insider trading (which has nothing to do with the $GME short squeeze unless you’re wearing a tinfoil hat) and market manipulation. I would be surprised if the SEC went after redditors (this time, at least) but there is no “we did it openly and conspicuously” safe harbor or defense when it comes to charges of market manipulation or securities fraud.<p>There’s a reason market commentary comes with a whole bunch of disclaimers in the footnotes with language like “not intended as investment advice” and “references to specific securities and issuers are not intended to be, and should not be interpreted as, recommendations to purchase or sell securities”.')
