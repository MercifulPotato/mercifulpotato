But if they haven&#x27;t, we can&#x27;t ban them just for being anachronistic dinosaurs.<p>There must be a clear line between banning radicalized groups that pose a threat to society and political parties that, in spite of their outdated ideology, haven&#x27;t posed any threats against society.<p>Unless Facebook wanted to give an example of how their policies stand above all parties and ban a left-wing page after banning a bunch of right-wing pages. But that&#x27;s a quite weak argument.')
