Both staging and committed loops were mixed down to output. You could re-record over staging area as many times as you wanted until you were satisfied, then you could mix it down to commited loop. It&#x27;s like stack but only top-most loop is changeable. That model provided infinite loop overdubs, ability to undo mistake, and used only x2 memory.<p>Regarding your delay effect, I was quite fascinated by how analog delay pedals allowed live-changing of loop length and the resulting effect it would produce [2]. I researched into the bucket brigade IC, quite interesting stuff. I think in digital you&#x27;d have all kinds of nasty glitches if you tried to do it with simple pointer modifications.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmiskovic&#x2F;DSPedal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmiskovic&#x2F;DSPedal&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xJPde-C28iU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xJPde-C28iU</a>')
