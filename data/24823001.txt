It reminds me that about 2001, I purchased a medium quality Serta bed from Mancini&#x27;s Sleepworld (in CA) that arrived in a sealed plastic bag. The mattress stunk with a chemical odor (assuming it was FR&#x27;s) for 2 months. IIRC I returned it because it wasn&#x27;t going away. The factory workers likely applied far too much FR. A different mattress solved the problem.<p>Also, btw, yellowing plastic: that&#x27;s often bromine FR compounds leeching out of the plastic. Dilute bleach w&#x2F; a surfactant is a good cleaner for that.')
