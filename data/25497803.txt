That I am cooking <i>for people</i> is part of my intrinsic motivation.<p>I feel the same way about software. I definitely also enjoy tinkering. But a lot of the motivation for me is in creating things <i>for people</i> to use. So I make sure to take jobs where the mission is one I can get behind and where I can develop empathy for the audience. I also find teamwork intrinsically motivating.<p>For me that makes for a pretty clear separation between intrinsically motivated coding on the job and intrinsically motivated coding at home. If I&#x27;m just fucking around with something cool to explore it, that&#x27;s hobby time, because I&#x27;m not looking to help users or my team. But my days are still full of intrinsically motivated work because I&#x27;m there to fight for the users.')
