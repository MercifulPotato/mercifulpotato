Similarly, a plane is a sphere with an infinite radius. A rotation is can be represented using two reflections along lines or planes. Etc...<p>This makes some algorithms much more elegant, by removing conditional &quot;if&quot; statements. This matters when interpolating, which is the most common practical application of GA: game engines and robotic control often have problems with interpolating arbitrary rotations. With GA, there&#x27;s no problem.')
