But yes, not experience beyond the L4&#x2F;L5 tier.<p>It is true that the IBM type structure isn&#x27;t the same, and yes, Google is fine with you staying around L5 forever (well, L4 now). But the matrix of things to get beyond L4 really is, in the grand scheme of things, about moving beyond development and into delegation, or at least ownership. It&#x27;s not management, but it is about leadership&#x2F;cross-team collaboration and &quot;demonstrating impact&quot; to others. So, like I said elsewhere, small-p political.<p>At least that&#x27;s my experience from seeing the L4 to L5 transition. But it may also be a product of my smaller office, where the number of projects is smaller, team size is smaller, and larger technical contributions of impact are harder to find.<p>EDIT: Also I&#x27;ve seen a lot of change in the 9 years, in terms of how the organization as a whole behaves, and it is becoming more and more like a traditional BigCorp. I just checked percent&#x2F; and within engineering 86.43473% full-time employees are newer than me. And a lot more if you count non-engineering. It is a way larger company than I started in.<p>EDIT2: I should underline, that the perf&#x2F;promo process obviously works for a large, perhaps the majority, number of people. But it doesn&#x27;t for all. It requires adapting to an organizational model that not everybody accords with. And I think that&#x27;s in the spirit of the original topic: organizational structures &#x2F; procedures that become your career goals may not make you happy, so find a company whose process matches what you want to get out of life.
