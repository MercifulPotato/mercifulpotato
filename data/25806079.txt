But hey. Maybe M1 will change their minds. Maybe something more powerful will. A 27” iMac that can play FPS games at 60fps&#x2F;5K&#x2F;HDR with virtual Atmos surround out of the box? Near-effortless console porting to a future Silicon AppleTV, with gameplay compatibility across both devices? They’ll realize what they’re missing out on eventually :) But they’re not going to code M1 assembler until they do, and it’s easier for them to use Apple’s frameworks than play games with the CPU.<p>(Yes, ffmpeg will probably do this. Good for them! And I’m sure Adobe will give it serious consideration - and then reject it, since it would get their apps rejected from the app stores and harm their relationship with Apple.)')
