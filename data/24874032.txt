I use credit cards and have a car loan. If we, as engineers, present the problem as &quot;You can have what you want now, but you will incur Technical Debt&quot; then any sane person will say &quot;Sure! Good deal!&quot; Ask yourself, how many times a manager or business owner has asked &quot;What is the interest rate?&quot; Zero times.<p>Second Objection: It&#x27;s not debt.<p>Debt would be if someone said &quot;I need to build a bridge across here that can handle an Army, and I&#x27;ve got $1m&quot;, we engineers reply &quot;It will take $2m&quot;, and they respond &quot;Ok, I will borrow $1m so you can build the bridge I need&quot;.<p>Instead what happens is they say &quot;Well, build what you can for $1m&quot;, and you say &quot;Ok, we can make &#x27;a bridge&#x27; for that&quot;, and then either (a) your infantry can cross, but the tanks have to get diverted 20 miles out of the way, or (b) the tanks end up in the river along with the bridge. Since (b) is bad, you then have to spend a lot of time planning the routes for the tanks, and making sure the tanks have the right air cover, etc etc, i.e. doing more work.<p>It&#x27;s not debt. It&#x27;s just (at best) an incomplete solution or (at worst) a bad solution that fails at the worst possible moment - e.g. database collapses during registration for the largest event of the year.<p>Ah, but surely, if you build the lightweight solution for $1m, and acknowledge the increased costs of managing the problems that it doesn&#x27;t solve, then thats fine? Sure, but that&#x27;s not technical debt either! That is scoping: we (engineers + business) identify a workable solution that provides some business value. And then we do that well.')
