But that has no historical reality. Chrome, is, of course, the brainchild of Sundar Pichai, prior to which was in charge of the <i>Google Toolbar</i>, a pack-in that Google paid Adobe and other companies to inject into their software installers to change the search provider on IE to Google.<p>Chrome was developed out of a (not unfounded) fear that Microsoft would intervene and block the Google Toolbar from IE. (Microsoft hesitated solely because they themselves were pretty scared of getting hit with antitrust violations again.)<p>The Google Toolbar, and it&#x27;s direct successor, Chrome, came explicitly and exclusively out of a desire to set people&#x27;s search provider to Google and to enable collecting user browsing data, which of course, leads to ads. Glowing biographies of Sundar Pichai that came out around when he became CEO all testify to this.<p>An example is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketrealist.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;a-history-of-googles-visionary-ceo-sundar-pichai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketrealist.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;a-history-of-googles-visio...</a>')
