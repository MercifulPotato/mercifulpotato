Each state has measures in place to ensure a fair election takes place including, canvassing, the recourse of requesting a recount or pursuing litigation.<p>All these things already happened and it was proven over and over that there was no substantial proof of widespread fraud. If your fellow citizens cannot discern the difference between social media and reality then this does not create an obligation for the opposing side that scales upwards towards infinity with their level of insanity.<p>Its deeply ironic that before the election around 2&#x2F;3 of republicans believed our elections were free and fair and now instead of concluding that their objections are grounded in bad faith you believe that the democrats didn&#x27;t do enough to prove to their opponents that they didn&#x27;t cheat. You have reversed the burden of proof and I reject your assertion. The burden of proof always lies with he would would assert a crime has been done not upon the accused to prove a negative. The alternative is utter nonsense.<p>Incidentally if we look at an actual source<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;form&#x2F;tracking-voter-trust-in-elections&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;form&#x2F;tracking-voter-trust-in-elec...</a><p>10% of democrats believe we didn&#x27;t have a fair election, 44% of independents, and a whopping 78% of republicans. On the overall ~2&#x2F;3 of Americans trust our election was free and fair. The 1&#x2F;3 will more or less be convinced by nothing as their feelings aren&#x27;t based on reality.<p>These people will by and large just have to go through the next 4-16 years of Democratic control thinking the Democrats, the women, and the minorities are stealing their country.')
