My son has a shop, and makes it by his own process (surface polishing, forge welding, custom 50-ton press, cut and repeat) and provides it to boutique knife makers. He can create blanks as necessary. And sometimes do a deal where he takes a cut of the knife sale, to enable smaller makers to use this premium quality product.')
