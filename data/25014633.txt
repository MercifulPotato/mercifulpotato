Item(by='johnchristopher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604751150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014522, text='Then just close the comment section for Gimp release because what more can be said apart from &#x27;thanks&#x27; then if critics aren&#x27;t welcome&#x2F;tolerated or interpreted as &quot;you are shitting on people&#x27;s work&quot;.<p>The question is: can Gimp be criticized ? Obviously, from all the Gimp thread I saw, HN isn&#x27;t the place to have a conversation about it.<p>edit: now that I think about it it seems to me that Firefox is taking way more heat when a release is announced.<p>edit2: to be fair, I do agree the parent could have worded things like &quot;Still no non-destructive filtering but it&#x27;s on the roadmap&quot; or something like that. I am certainly not shitting on Gimp but I tend to react to people who claim it&#x27;s a 1-1 photoshop replacement, it&#x27;s simply not true. It doesn&#x27;t mean Gimp hasn&#x27;t huge advantages over Photoshop. Every photographer I know and who use it prefer it to Photoshop after some time, same when you need to automate or need some custom plugin to manipulate images.')
