It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s often easy to tell when another individual here knows less than yourself or has a less matured knowledge on a topic, but recognizing another player just means that they can speak at the same level as yourself. You make the distinction based on the contents of their words and not their identity which gets back to benefits of being anonymous: The only thing that matters is the contents of the discussion.<p>An interesting way to see this in action is to take a look at any conversation here debating different viewpoints. You&#x27;ll often have conversations that could coherently be read as between two individuals but every post could have a different author that contributes to the conversation in a way that it doesn&#x27;t matter who they are. What is said matters much more than who says it.')
