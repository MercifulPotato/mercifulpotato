Item(by='saagarjha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603264512, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839294, text='&gt; If enough people said to Apple &quot;hey, this stuff is not acceptable and we won&#x27;t pay for it&quot; and then they actually did follow through, Apple would stop.<p>“The market will price this out” doesn’t actually work because it assumes that 1. Apple’s product strategy is done to match market desires perfectly and 2. The decision to buy is solely predicated on this particular thing. The first is false because nobody can do that and the second is because people buy Apple products for other reasons than just that. I personally know many people (although this sample is of course unbiased) that buy Apple devices for a number of reasons (they work well, they look nice, they have good support) but hate that they can’t do thing on them. But their purchase decision doesn’t reflect their opinions on this particular issue.')
