But also Objective-C++. In that case, the Cocoa is usually restricted to just one (or a few) .m files in a largely C++ codebase, to get a C++ engine running on iOS.<p>It&#x27;s impressive how Objective-C really first took off at NeXT and almost died in obscurity, only to come roaring back at Apple with Mac OS X, and then take over a huge chunk of the world through the iPhone, iOS, and the App Store. An impressive legacy.')
