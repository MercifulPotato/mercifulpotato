People I know who&#x27;ve become acclimated to Jira that I know would happily respond &quot;we have no problems&quot; while the people below them who have to use Jira 10x more often (multiple times per hour, vs a daily look at progress, for example) would happily say &quot;this is slow as molasses (and that&#x27;s a problem)&quot;.')
