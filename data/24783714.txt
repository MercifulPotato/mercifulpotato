I’d consider it a great shame if there were no place for you here.<p>But this attack on dang misses the mark badly.<p>PG and Sama have always been fully supportive of the way he runs HN (PG hand-picked him to take it over, Sama was YC CEO for most of the time since, and they both repeatedly support him and his HN work publicly).<p>I’d argue that dang’s approach to moderation makes it much more conducive to free speech, as, unlike on Twitter, it allows difficult&#x2F;complex topics to be discussed without being derailed by personal insults.<p>We don’t need to attack people here - we have the downvote button and flag link for when people are being assholes, otherwise we can just focus on presenting persuasive arguments.')
