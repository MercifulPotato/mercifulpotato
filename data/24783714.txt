I’d consider it a great shame if there were no place for you here.<p>But this attack on dang misses the mark badly.<p>pg and sama have always been fully supportive of the way he runs HN (pg hand-picked him to take it over, sama was YC CEO for most of the time since, and they&#x27;ve both repeatedly endorsed him and his HN work publicly [1], including recently in pg&#x27;s case [2]).<p>dang’s approach to moderation makes it more conducive to free speech, as, unlike on Twitter, it allows difficult&#x2F;complex topics to be discussed without being derailed by personal insults.<p>We don’t need to attack people here; we have the downvote arrow and flag link for when people are being assholes, otherwise we can just focus on presenting persuasive arguments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;two-hn-announcements&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.ycombinator.com&#x2F;two-hn-announcements&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282055086433284103" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282055086433284103</a>')
