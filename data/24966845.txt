The year isn&#x27;t finished, and for the first 3 months the spread of covid was only starting.<p>Currently, around 5k to 7k people die per day from covid, and that number is expected to go up since the daily new cases are increasing (from around 300k per day end of September, to around 450k per day end of October)<p>Comparing it to an unusually strong flu variant is drastically underplaying the severity.<p>All of these numbers are <i>despite</i> international lockdowns and efforts to stop the spread. The numbers would be far, far higher if no measures had been taken.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6815659&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6815659&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;#countries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;#countries</a>')
