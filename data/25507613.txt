There are countless decent communities on reddit that have issues with the vast majority of the website outside their niche interest. If each of these small communities will have their own little place to discuss and share ideas without having the Damocles sword of the larger reddit assholery and bad design over their heads, I feel like there&#x27;s a chance they&#x27;ll move to a different platform.<p>I am planning such an alternative to reddit that targets these small communities. I hope it will actually be useful to people.')
