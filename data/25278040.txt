That&#x27;s what&#x27;s fascinating. At least in the US, over 95% of fatalities are people over 55. We&#x27;re at 200k ~ 300k deaths for the year in the US (and I think there is reason to believe this is an overestimate, not an underestimate). That&#x27;s lower than heart disease and cancer (500~600k yearly). I doubt we&#x27;ll even approach those numbers by March.<p>Science is slow because it needs to be right. We&#x27;re no longer in a time 185 years ago when Jenner could just stab people with puss he pulled off of a Horsepox infected cow. Remember that 500 years ago, the Chinese were blowing smallbox puss into people&#x27;s noses (infections in the nose were typically not bad and people recovered faster) and isolated them. Many of them survived fine, but some died.<p>Do you want to return to that world where we just experiment on humans without regards to what that means?<p>This vaccine should be a choice. I&#x27;m under 40 and not in a high risk group. I&#x27;m fine with people volunteering to take this vaccine. Maybe I&#x27;ll take it in 5 years. But I don&#x27;t want to see this become mandatory for going to work or being able to enter a music venue.<p>You can quote the Jacobson decision all you want, but that SCOTUS decision only said Jacobson had to pay the $5 fine, he never was forced to take the vaccine. Furthermore Jacobson lead to the Buck decision (forced sterilization) and the SCOTUS decision that led to the WW2 Japanese internment camps. It&#x27;s bad law that&#x27;s bread a poisoned well of bad law.')
