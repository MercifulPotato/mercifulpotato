Seems to me the ability to ban unwanted users would enable a decent degree of moderation without direct control over what&#x27;s posted. It wouldn&#x27;t have to be all-or-nothing, you could always give an offending poster the opportunity edit or remove a post to avoid a ban. Would that be a viable way to moderate a community?')
