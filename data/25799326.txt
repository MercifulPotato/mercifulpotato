They just want to see a familiar tool name and some checklists.<p>There are zero kinds of compliance auditors who will ever find an actual vulnerability, and I’d be surprised if they can even explain common basic attacks like SSRF.<p>The reason is simple. That work is so boring, that if you had any skills at all, you’d be doing more interesting security work.')
