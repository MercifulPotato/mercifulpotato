Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=[25667131, 25666637, 25666928, 25667996], score=None, time=1609984951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665819, text='&gt; I can obviously not cover every single one, but just seeing a random van and claiming it&#x27;s full of fake ballots doesn&#x27;t make it true. In many of these states, the entire counting was livestreamed.<p>I&#x27;d like to have the VA thumb drive handoff and the GA under-the-table ballot stash explained please.<p>&gt; In many of these states, the entire counting was livestreamed.<p>Some of these videos purportedly show poll workers scanning the same ballot multiple times.<p>&gt; Anyone can give statements, but election fraud requires more than just hearsay.<p>There are lots of sworn first-person statements, which aren&#x27;t hearsay. Also fraud requires evidence of intent. Its much easier to show that serious, legitimate questions can be raised about enough ballots to sway the outcome than to prove <i>why</i> observers were prevented from observing.<p>&gt; Numbers are easy to play with, see p-Hacking. In the majority of the cases, if you apply the same calculations to previous elections, or hell, even red counties in this very same election, you get very similar strange looking results.<p>Can you link me to those majority of cases? Quality of the statistical arguments varies widely and only the non persuasive arguments seem to have been responded to.<p>&gt; Just because you&#x27;ve been told that it wasn&#x27;t taken seriously doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>In a situation like this, demonstrating that the concerns are being taken seriously is <i>more important</i> than actually taking them seriously. The apparent legitimacy of the President is likely to have more of an effect on everything than who the president is, at this point. When these allegations aren&#x27;t seen to be taken seriously it creates the appearance of illegitimacy, regardless of the facts.<p>&gt; Courts have gone through the evidence for 2 months and none of it went anywhere.<p>Actually many of these cases never reached the stage of preventing evidence. And 2 months ago there hadn&#x27;t been enough time to investigate and we were already being told that it had been debunked. So its not enough to do whatever they have done, it is necessary for it to be known that they have done what is correct.<p>&gt; But for some people, being proved wrong means not being taken seriously.<p>Can you show me some of these claims &quot;being proved wrong&quot;? Thats a stronger claim than there not being evidence and if you could substantiate this it might help reach some people.')
