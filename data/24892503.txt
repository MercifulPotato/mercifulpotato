Item(by='saalweachter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603681585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891930, text='Yeah -- individual orchard bees are significantly more efficient, but an individual honeybee hive crams in tens of thousands of bees; you make it up on scale.<p>Honeybees also work well with mono-cropping because you can easily pick up and move the entire hive from massive field to massive field just in time for pollination.  If you are relying on a wild bee population they&#x27;ll do better when they have lots of plants in bloom across a wide spectrum of time so they have a chance to build up their population before the major blooms eg the orchard you want pollinated.  Otherwise you run the risk of only have a small bee population that can&#x27;t fully take advantage of (and pollinate) the suddenly massive resource glut of several square miles of orchards suddenly in bloom at once.')
