It&#x27;s what you want, I think, and it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to get unless people like me can win the argument that we ought to turn back before its too late. I doubt we will. Your inability to even acknowledge what I am saying, instead of trying to prove that I am condemning your tribe unfairly, at the very least should be something you, I beg you, try to understand.<p>When cities burn, people loot, and innocent people are killed in violence, it unlocks doors for others to then walk through, particularly if those acts are argued as now being just given the right motive. This isn&#x27;t an opinion, nor is it blame. It&#x27;s an observation based upon history. At some point, we need to stop walking through doors and unlocking the next one for the other side to walk through. The only way that happens is through leadership or a recognition that the next door will be one too far for anyone to accept.')
