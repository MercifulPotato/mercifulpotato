From personal experience and the teams I&#x27;ve been on, women have always been in the minority, along the lines of 8-10 men for every two women.  However, I am not in Silicon Valley.<p>We need more studies in this area. I&#x27;d also like to see studies that include other possible sources of discrimination (gender identity, age) that are known to exist in some areas. Without those other sources included in the data it&#x27;s possible those sources could be skewing the data.<p>One scenario might be that most of the women were young (20s-early 30s), while many of the men were older (late 30s to early 50s). Just one possible scenario, I&#x27;m not saying that was the case. But in that scenario the bias could be against older candidates rather than for female ones.')
