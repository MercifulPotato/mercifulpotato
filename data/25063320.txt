I was able to replace 4 software tools with one (Sketch, Zeplin, InVision, Box). It doesn&#x27;t do everything as well as the others, but it does them well enough.  I have been managing co-located design teams since before Covid. The mix of visibility into my design teams work, the capabilities of sharing components and libraries, and the ability to easily share work across product and engineering has made a huge impact. My team&#x27;s work is more transparent, up to date, and we can iterate together more easily.')
