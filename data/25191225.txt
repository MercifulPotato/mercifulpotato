No matter what, I still always get my vaccines and make sure that I am up to date and never late on any of them.<p>Sure, having Guillain-Barre is scary, but it is something that you can make a full recovery from.<p>It is never an excuse NOT to get a vaccine, unless you actually know that you got Guillain-Barre Syndrome from a vaccine. That is a discussion between that particular patient and their neuromuscular neurologist. In that case, you do not get the flu vaccine any longer because it can cause you to experience Guillain-Barre Syndrome again.<p>But, this really is an isolated situation that can be categorized as very rare and the general public should always get their vaccines.<p>If you catch the flu, it can absolutely trigger Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and would be far more likely to trigger Guillain-Barre Syndrome than the flu vaccine itself. If you get the flu and had the flu vaccination, it typically makes the flu illness less worse, making you less likely to get something like Guillain-Barre Syndrome.<p>There are lots of infectious agents that can trigger Guillain-Barre Syndrome, so it is wise to get your vaccines to prevent them as much as possible. They prevent serious infections, at minimum, which would help prevent Guillain-Barre Syndrome.<p>I also have the long term variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, known as Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, which is in pharmaceutical remission due to me taking subcutaneous immunoglobulin twice a week for 3 hours each time.<p>What I am saying is that while all of this sounds rare and devastating, it’s treatable. Not only that, you’re more likely to get Guillain-Barre Syndrome from a bad case of the flu than from a flu shot.')
