In fact, their organization is not focused on California, but on draining &quot;the swamp&quot; and is basically doxxing public servants.<p>From my point of view, this guy is basically paid to support the Republican party by attacking the incomes of public servants who largely donate to Democratic candidates. Hence the absense of any real analysis of what drives costs and a focus on &#x27;unfunded pension liabilities&#x27; and big numbers designed to incite rather than inform.')
