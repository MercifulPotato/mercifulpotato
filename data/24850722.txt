Most algorithms that build profiles and look for combinations of features that are unique. The best way to hide your fingerprint is to be as similar to everyone as possible.<p>So that means use as much of the standards as possible that comes with the OS. Do not use anything that would not be considered mainstream (e.g. don&#x27;t be the only person from Guatemala on Opera, Linux, DVORAK Keyboard using an odd screen resolution.)<p>The absolute hardest thing to create a browser fingerprint on is corporate laptops as they have identical setups!')
