Sorry, it was a death trap. I have no idea how we survived several trips across the US in it.<p>1. no seat belts in the back, no headrests<p>2. poor brakes (especially if you were seduced by the size of the cargo area and loaded a bunch of weight in it)<p>3. inadequate power (could barely to 65)<p>4. would tip over if turned too sharply<p>5. don&#x27;t even think about hitting anything head on, just a bit of sheetmetal there<p>6. highly susceptible to cross-winds<p>On the plus side, it was inexpensive to maintain and ran for decades. I finally sold it for my dad, and he asked me if I was nostalgic for it. I said no, I was just happy we never had an accident in it. My dad gets the credit for that, he was an unusually careful driver. Never hit anything in 70 years of driving.<p>I know times have changed, and what was acceptable in the 60&#x27;s wrt car safety has changed a lot, but still...')
