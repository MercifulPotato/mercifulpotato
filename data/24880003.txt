The only thing that helped me to remember algos and derivations was to use them on some practical problem. I am as much as kinesthetic as visual learner, I think mainly because it keeps my brain from going into zombie repetition land. Don&#x27;t even try to teach me something by just babbling about it in front of a class room. I need to experience the learning in some fashion.
