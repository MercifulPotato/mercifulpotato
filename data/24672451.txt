All we really need is the measures of the orbits and their distances. This would allow calculations for travel between planets. If keeping track of the mass, thrust, trajectory, and any external influences (impact of space debris), then determining one&#x27;s position should be fairly accurate.<p>Google Sky has intricate models of the stars from the perspective of earth. Just something I found to be cool and thought I&#x27;d mention it.')
