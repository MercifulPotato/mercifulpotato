Not exactly the same product, of course. (But in the US, Evernote costs $96&#x2F;year.)<p>I think that Evernote&#x27;s more or less elimination of the free plan will kill the company. There&#x27;s no reason in 2020 for new users to starting paying money to Evernote. They seem to know they can&#x27;t compete for new users any longer, so they&#x27;re going to force as many current users as possible to upgrade from the free plan.')
