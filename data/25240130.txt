In this case you have to think illogically on purpose in order to have any chance at succeeding.<p>But that kind of belief doesn&#x27;t foster the mindset of &quot;if I fail, that&#x27;s just life and I will move forward.&quot; Having that much confidence in accomplishing something means staking my self-worth on it, because this is a test of my own effort and nobody else&#x27;s. The results begin and end with my actions only, and the things I want are too important to me to not take seriously. If those things are what I ultimately want to spend my time on Earth succeeding in before I die, then not succeeding is devastating to my mental health.<p>I don&#x27;t understand how not to think like this, because every real success I&#x27;ve fought for and won came as a result of believing my life was over if I didn&#x27;t succeed. In some cases I really would become poor or have no future if I didn&#x27;t succeed, so it grants too much legitimacy to the method.')
