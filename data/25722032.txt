He never says anything to the effect of &quot;you can&#x27;t prove a negative&quot;.  Or &quot;we scoured everything and could find no evidence whatsoever, but still doesn&#x27;t mean that there might have been something he dud&quot;.<p>No, immediately following the statement about &quot;we would have said so&quot;, he goes into -- &quot;a current president can not be charged with a federal crime ...&quot;.  He then goes on to say that he was bound by this property.  That&#x27;s an odd next statement for someone you think is innocent, but just can&#x27;t prove a negative.<p>With a new attorney general and Trump about to no longer be an an active President, we may revisit this.')
