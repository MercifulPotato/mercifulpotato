No need for that. Even the FBI shows than in drastic situations like home invasions, the average number of shots fired is 3. The zombies are not coming. We are not going to end up in a Walking Dead situation. I know enough preppers and have listened to enough to know a lot of what they write is coded and has meaning. Zombies are not real, even though they use this term in their writings. They are referring to inner-city people or city dwellers (or even the unprepared) who may attack during a protracted emergency like a hurricane that removes power for weeks and people start looting to survive.\nI based my preps on water purification, medical (wife has doctor after her name), and calories. As a guy who has carried a 65# ruck for hours on end for days, I can assure you, you don&#x27;t need as much as you think. While the military does have a supply chain for soldiers in the field, there have been times when that wasn&#x27;t a reality for a week or more and you had to make do with what was in your ruck.<p>The military sends troops into harm&#x27;s way with 180 rounds of ammunition for rifles, and 45 rounds of ammunition for handguns. That&#x27;s it.<p>I focused on water purification, caloric intake, regulating body temperature, medical, and have two solar chargers. Have two of everything (two is one, one is none). I&#x27;m not worried about a protracted battle with anyone. Smart preppers will avoid any fight because it&#x27;s just plain dumb as hell to get into it with anyone when there is no medical help around. To the people that have amassed thousands of rounds of ammunition, I laugh. Why? Military experience. I often ask these people when they brag about their &quot;warehouse full of preps&quot;, &quot;How many gunfights do you reasonably expect to survive?&quot; What if someone launched flaming arrows into your home in a protracted situation? How will you carry your stash? Do you have children? Any babies? If so, your job is to protect your family by fleeing. Not trying to pretend you&#x27;re a warrior. Discretion is ALWAYS the better part of valor.<p>Good preps:\n- Light tent for your family. Waterproof. In warm regions, two light tarps.\n- Water purification tablets for a year. Takes up no space. Also water purification straws, pref. the 25,000 gallon variety. Again, light and no space.\n- Revolver with 200 rounds of quality ammunition. One for each adult.\n- High-quality light rucksack with waterproof cover.\n- Two folding solar panels.\n- Two full medical kits.\n- Steel canteens and canteen cups for cooking and water purification.\n- 1000&#x27; of 550 paracord.\n- Two fixed blade knives and two folding knives.\n- Light thermal technical clothing.\n- Hand warmers and space blankets.\n- Lighters and matches along with ferro rod for fire.\n- Compass x2 (learn how to use it. Most people fail land navigation, even basics, because they think using a compass is easy. Get grid maps for your area and learn the difference between grid, true, and magnetic north (declination). Learn the declination for your area and program your compass with the correct settings. At even a mile, the wrong declination will send you off by hundreds of yards.\n- Safety goggles, shemaghs, and expanding toilet paper wipes (light, 250 take up the space of a can of soda)\n- Pack according to your weight, height, and abilities. Children should carry their own clothes and water and nothing more. Adults should limit it to 35#.\n- Firearms should always be out of sight.')
