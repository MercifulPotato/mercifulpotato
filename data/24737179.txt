Item(by='reitzensteinm', descendants=None, kids=[24738736, 24739967], score=None, time=1602314347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737095, text='Right, that&#x27;s the wrong figure to use in the context of the linked debate. It&#x27;s the cost to operate the plant, including buying power at market rates.<p>The &quot;spilled wind&quot; costs are the cost of the plant itself used in the manner described, which equals $1400&#x2F;kW - actually, this is probably where you got the number originally - or $233&#x2F;kWh. However, this is over the lifetime of the plant, meaning the storage is closer to $12&#x2F;kWh per year.<p>That&#x27;s not exactly cheap. You have to overbuild renewables to have the extra energy to store in it, and it&#x27;s probably only going to cycle a few dozen times a year. Plus the $12&#x2F;kWh figure likely represents (the study does not specify) the energy of the gas before conversion back to electricity which is lossy.<p>But adding extra storage is cheap compared to adding extra power, so unlike with lithium ion batteries you can actually feasibly build weeks worth of storage in to the system.<p>So, I&#x27;m not trying to say the numbers are great. I&#x27;m not saying this is what we should do. But there&#x27;s a vast gap between the $1400 you quoted and the $12 figure which - at least I believe - is the correct number to use for this discussion.<p>There are absolutely tons of people (especially on HN) that trivialize the problems around rolling out renewables. Probably the majority of my posts on the topic have actually been on the other side, pointing out issues or complaining about subsidies instead of carbon taxes.<p>But I really think you&#x27;ve gone 180 degrees in the other direction and the numbers you use make it seem an order of magnitude harder than it is. I think even more extreme than using the worst Western nuclear cost overruns as representative of the intrinsic cost of nuclear.')
