No one: “I was going to use foam, until I realized that, for just a little more money I could put carpet in the walls.”<p>I used closed cell foam in one room that I tore back to the studs. It’s easily the most comfortable room in the house, so I like the product, but comparing the price of non-substitute goods seems not useful. Compare foam to other insulation products.')
