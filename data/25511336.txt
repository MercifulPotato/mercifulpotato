It’s part of white privilege which is tangible.<p>On the other hand, however less often people in a privileged class are realistically impacted by discrimination, it’s still &gt; 0.0%. Since it usually costs nothing more to include everyone it seems useful.<p>But I think the biggest reason it’s important to care about discrimination wherever it shows up and not let people off the hook is that it’s unifying.<p>There’s a story out of Buddhism that suggests it’s important to think equally kindly about rich people, kind of similar in that they’re a privileged class.<p>I know it’s a hard sell. I don’t do it justice here. However  a powerful argument can be made that not disparaging privileged classes, actually helps us all in the long run&#x2F;big picture.<p>If I get down voted I understand, that’s ok. If it makes a difference I don’t mean to minimize the 10,000 year history of pain suffered by any humans due to discrimination.')
