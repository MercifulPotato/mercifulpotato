Viruses are to a large extent playing a zero-sum game. If they get better at one thing, it almost <i>has</i> to come at the cost of something else, because they&#x27;ve already got all the knobs cranked up as high as they will go just to survive and they don&#x27;t have a spare energy budget just lying around to put into other things without taking away from something else.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i> that some mutation was made that made it more infectious <i>and</i> more deadly... but it&#x27;s a long enough shot that I&#x27;d consider the likelihood of incomplete early information and incentives that some parties have to amp up the danger in the presence of such uncertainty higher. Viruses do not routinely become more infectious <i>and</i> more deadly. If they did, we&#x27;d all be long dead. The evolution gradient tilts <i>strongly</i> away from that.')
