The most famous example is Doom: it&#x27;s open source but the game is shareware.<p>Many people believe that modern software places too many unreasonable restrictions on end-users. I should be able to modify any of the software running on personal devices for my own purposes, at the very least. It&#x27;s frustrating that I would typically have to use a disassembler instead of getting to directly tweak the source code.<p>Going back to the artist example: it&#x27;s akin to buying a poster which says that it must be placed on a wall facing a specific direction, at a specific height, with a specific axial tilt, and that it only be illuminated by natural sunlight. But I just want the poster because I really love a specific section. Once I get home, my scissors go to town on the poster, allowing me to only retain the parts I loved. Then I glue it to a circular sheet of metal and I hang it from the ceiling! I&#x27;m quite content to recognize the artist&#x27;s work in crafting the poster and compensate him fairly. But find his list of restrictions on how it should be used to be utterly absurd, and since it&#x27;s my poster I do whatever I want with it at home.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing: given all the restrictions which you place on your app, it absolutely has to justify its price tag because, even if they have the knowledge and skills to do so, the end-user can&#x27;t fix the bugs you missed nor tweak it to suit their specific needs. Even if you manage to get 95% of the way there with your app, if that final 5% is really crucial and the end-user has no way of closing the gap, then it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to invest one&#x27;s limited capital on something that leaves their problem unresolved.<p>I&#x27;ve bought open source software in the past and will continue to do so in the future.')
