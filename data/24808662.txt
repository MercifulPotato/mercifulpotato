It&#x27;s easy to remember your own past as more nuanced, more substantial than the present, but is that really true? I can never tell.<p>In this case, were people really more well-read and less ignorant in Sagan&#x27;s past than they were in the mid nineties, or was he simply surrounded more by well-read, nuanced people when he was younger than when he was older? Or maybe both are the case? He complains about dumb TV shows in exactly the same way people these days complain about dumb Youtubers. Wouldn&#x27;t there have been equally dumb things in Sagan&#x27;s past that just happened to be easier for him to ignore?<p>I&#x27;ve read quotes with a very similar vibe but focused on other (perceived) societal changes, such as changing sexual mores, immigration, and so on. It&#x27;s basically the standard template &quot;things were better in the past than they are now, wrt $TOPIC-that-I-care-about, so I worry about the future&quot;. In Sagan&#x27;s case, obviously, $TOPIC is science, but you could swap it out for nearly anything and write a similar story and it&#x27;ll ring true to people with similar values as yours.<p>Basically, I think all I&#x27;m asking is, is society really dumbing down? Or are we simply confronted with it more?')
