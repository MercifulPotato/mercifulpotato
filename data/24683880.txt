Not including the money they made. Apple believes this act damaged them. The connection is laughably obvious. Unless Apple shipped unsecured private or proprietary information on these devices to the recycling company, I don&#x27;t know what other possibility you can think of. Your counterargument is a resale market entirely controlled by them wherein they can pick and choose every item.')
