I think racism probably is a major root cause, but think it&#x27;s intellectually lazy because identifying it doesn&#x27;t help much.<p>Racial disparities exist in virtually every important measure of health (and I only say &quot;virtually&quot; because I don&#x27;t know them all off the top of my head).  Genetics plays a part in some, but the root cause of many is the current or lingering effects of racism: families that never accrued much wealth, communities who had much worse professional prospects so education wasn&#x27;t as valued, &quot;bad&quot; neighborhoods where towns invested less in public transportation or sanitation.  A bunch of ways racism shapes communities.<p>However, pointing out the racism root is only useful for long-term sociological planning.  You also need to focus on the immediate causes.  Systemic racism is actually a perfect example of this: even if a system becomes &quot;race blind,&quot; the effect of past racism means non-white people are at a disadvantage.')
