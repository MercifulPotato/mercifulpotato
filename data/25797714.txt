Item(by='TheDong', descendants=None, kids=[25798221, 25797801, 25798185], score=None, time=1610751717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797475, text='These patents sound like they loosely describe a worse version of ssl&#x2F;tls.<p>They talk about the client having a whitelist of IPs to form secure channels to, and using a combination of a dns proxy and cooperating client to form secure communication layers.<p>The actual described thing sounds a little different (i.e. &#x27;requests for 192.168&#x2F;24 have a transparently encrypted link&#x27; rather than tls handshakes), but not different enough that it&#x27;s not obvious.<p>From the existence of SSL, dns, and a VPN, this idea seems quite obvious to me. In 1998, all of those things existed. The existence of SSL (in 1995), should have by itself invalidated this patent entirely IMO.<p>From the case filings, it sounds like the supposedly infringing part of Apple&#x27;s tech is &quot;VPN On Demand&quot; and &quot;FaceTime&quot;.<p>I am not a patent lawyer, I likely don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about.')
