I think the reaction that your hard-earned material wealth is rightfully yours is completely fair. However, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that other people may also work hard and still live in poverty. Poverty can be systemic, in that things you&#x27;re born into can limit your opportunity. Further, people are sometimes faced with unexpected situations such as health problems or pandemics that can make them unable to work. Many people have proposed plans that pay to distribute more wealth to these people by taxing corporate profits and the super wealthy. Some people will make a personal sacrifice to do this, but these people may actually have a better life experience if the majority of those around them are suffering less.<p>&gt; What rights are being denied to minorities ?\nUntil recently, the right to get married or adopt children, among other things. I see your point though: people of all skin colors are theoretically equal in the law. If by &quot;dividing people&quot; by &quot;race and gender&quot; you mean movements for criminal justice reform or to end police brutality toward minorities, I disagree that these movements should be divisive. They become divisive when non-minorities take offense at them, which can happen due to poor messaging from particular individuals. It can happen due to a lack of clarity about the actual goals of the movement. Some more extreme leftists might simply have views that I would also disagree with. But ultimately, &quot;the left&quot; doesn&#x27;t hate non-minorities. When a movement is focused on minorities, it is to reaffirm that they suffer discrimination which they should not under the law. These movements focus on minorities not to say that others don&#x27;t struggle too, but to bring attention to societal issues that continue to affect some types of people just because of their &quot;immutable characteristics&quot;.')
