Trailing closure syntax is basically &#x27;you can remove the parens if there are trailing closures&#x27;. Which, if you apply that to multiple closures, you get the syntax that also looks like Smalltalk. Which is understandable, since Swift keyword calling syntax was always &#x27;keyword followed with a colon&#x27; since Swift 1, which was inspired by Objective-C, which was inspired by Smalltalk. But then that&#x27;s not adding Smalltalk syntax in a later stage, it was baked into the language since day 1. That multiple trailing closure syntax - that syntax can come out from anyone knowing Swift without any Smalltalk knowledge, it&#x27;s a logical next step. So it feels a bit weird to call it &#x27;adopting Smalltalk syntax&#x27; since I don&#x27;t think Smalltalk influenced that syntax any more than other parts of the language.')
