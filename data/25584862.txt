HN is one of the last larger forums to properly dissect topics, ask questions (even difficult ones), and try to understand root causes &amp; effects, second-level effects and so forth.<p>Unfortunately lately it seems the twitter&#x2F;reddit culture has taken a bit of a foothold - cheap, popularity-seeking comments void of any substance are spammed into anything remotely relating to politics or breaking news. And questions&#x2F;comments like ours are vehemently downvoted. Let&#x27;s hope the trend breaks down rather than grows.')
