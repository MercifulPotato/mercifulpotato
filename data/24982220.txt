Some states put a large weighting on lifestyle costs. So even if Jill is making tons of money, she probably won&#x27;t be required to pay anything if she has been spending it on a BMW and other expensive things. Even if that were not the case, most states would not require alimony if Bill is still working. Also, some states would consider the education costs a gift and it would not entitle Bill to anything.')
