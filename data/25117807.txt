Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605565216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115836, text='&gt; Accidental non-repudiability can have negative consequences itself. For one, relying on the kind of poor man&#x27;s non-repudiability that DKIM gives you leaves powerful central entities with the ability to forge email while convincing almost everyone that it is legitimate.<p>I fully agree.<p>&gt; From reading everything that you wrote, I think that your thesis is that email, specifically, ought to be non-repudiable. That might be a worthwhile idea, but it should be presented as such at the forefront. If others agree that this is a valid and useful concept, then a non-repudiability mechanism could be added to email explicitly, just as DKIM was added. But don&#x27;t use DKIM for this, since it is a poor substitute.<p>If the choice was between &quot;DKIM for non-repudiability&quot; and &quot;a better mechanism for non-repudiability&quot;, of course I would support the better mechanism. But that&#x27;s not the choice here. The proposal here is to remove this accidental, partial non-repudiability mechanism that currently exists, and replace it with nothing. That would leave the world worse off, not better. DKIM protects innocent people from being framed for saying horrible things, and DKIM protects innocent people from guilty people who do horrible things. And sure, sometimes DKIM might be used against innocent people in some way, but the balance seems heavily in favor of DKIM (from the perspective of innocent people).')
