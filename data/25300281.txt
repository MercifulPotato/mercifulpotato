It&#x27;s just a problem that should be solved. Linguists made a lot of formalizations about language. There are rules, there are known lists of exceptions, there are dictionaries. You just have to implement those things carefully with lots of edge-cases, implement it for every language, but it&#x27;s just mundane engineering work, nothing that requires breakthrough.<p>Currently spell checking just checks words from a dictionary. Its 1% of work. Or even less.<p>Microsoft Word used to have awesome spell checking, grammar checking, etc back in 2000 for Russian language. It seems to be degraded since then. But the fact is, this problem was solved. It checked for spelling, for grammar, for punctuation. I would expect that kind of functionality working in every OS textbox by now.')
