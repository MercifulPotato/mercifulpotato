On HN the Nietzschean viewpoint of &quot;Will to Power&quot; is usually more prevalent, entrepreneurialism and &quot;startup hustle mentality&quot; are all about imposing your will on the world to gain power and success. I think that this overabundance of Nietsches standpoint makes the Stoic standpoints stand out more. In contrast, some of the more Stoic forums become somewhat sedate and then a &quot;you can change the world&quot; type of post will contrast much more. (As an example, a lot of FIRE and permaculture forums can be very (maybe overly) Stoic)<p>Both viewpoints have merit but it depends on the circumstances of the person reading it which has more value for their particular situation.')
