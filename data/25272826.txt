You can do that without going into debt slavery via college loans. Instead of learning from a professor, watch some guy on youtube. Practice a lot. Make stuff. Join the literally endless communities that do the stuff you&#x27;re doing.<p>The reason kids go to college is to get a good paying job. I hate to say it but if you&#x27;re a kid who does not have affluent parents or don&#x27;t live in an area where there actually are legitimate jobs in that field, it&#x27;s 100% on you for doing that. I mean the opinion that those jobs don&#x27;t exists isn&#x27;t a stereotype for a reason. Students can get those jobs, but there most definitely aren&#x27;t where they went to college typically. If you live in LA, Chicago, NYC; sure those could very well be viable career paths. In the middle of Idaho? Maybe you should reconsider who in Idaho is going to hire an artist outside of the small town that is their capital.<p>Sometimes reality needs to bite people who are incapable of making goals long term.')
