Excerpt from paper[1]:<p><i>&gt; To date, there is no way to permanently deactivate automatic conversion to dates in MS Excel and other spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Apache OpenOffice Calc. We note, however, that the spreadsheet program Google Sheets did not convert any gene names to dates or numbers when typed or pasted; notably, when these sheets were later reopened with Excel, LibreOffice Calc or OpenOffice Calc, gene symbols such as SEPT1 and MARCH1 were protected from date conversion.</i><p>There are several Excel behaviors that alternative software don&#x27;t copy.  But for some reason, the leading zero removal in csv import has stuck as a default <i>even though it has repeated complaints</i> and generates very similar Q&amp;A in other software packages.  (Why copy a behavior that makes you have to answer identical frustrated questions from users wanting to preserve leading zeros?!?  Do programmers of LibreOffice&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Pandas all like inflicting pain on their users?!?)<p>Maybe another reason is that other industries or workflows depend on leading zero removal but we never hear from them praising it.  Therefore, we&#x27;re distorted by a biased subset that only complains loudly about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genomebiology.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s13059-016-1044-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;genomebiology.biomedcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.1186&#x2F;s13...</a>')
