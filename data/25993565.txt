Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=[25995944], score=None, time=1612211988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25993438, text='&gt; <i>Would you say the same if I encouraged a depressed person to do their best to get diagnosed and get on &#x27;anti-depressants&#x27;? I am doubtful.</i><p>Don&#x27;t be: many studies have shown CBT to be equally as effective for depression (for most people) as medication.  If you are equally likely to cure your issues with a book on CBT versus a pill, that is something you should consider, even if you do end up deciding for the pill.<p>I encourage people to evaluate the costs and benefits of ALL their options before seeking any specific treatment for issues that involve neurochemistry.  My entire thrust is &quot;medication is not a panacea and you should not bias toward using it, over any other option, as a solution&quot;.<p>For some it may be the best choice. For many it is not. Don&#x27;t bias toward it (as you advocate). Evaluate, don&#x27;t just go get pills because some random person on the internet said it worked for them\nthat one time.<p>If you put the wrong thing in your body, you can fuck yourself up for a very long time.  I am speaking from direct personal experience.')
