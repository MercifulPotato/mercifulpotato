There are a lot of whiny, cheapskate employers trying to scam the government, or to convince programmers that they have it &quot;so good right now&quot; so they aren&#x27;t able to see the exploitative nature of capitalism.<p>Programmer salaries were amazing in the 1980s and &#x27;90s, if you were any good. The numbers were the same as now, but adjusted for inflation, $300-500k (in today&#x27;s dollars) wasn&#x27;t unusual... not for middle management or PM bullshitters but actual, honest-to-God, knew-what-they-were-doing programmers. You could actually get rich by working. Today, your only shot at reaching that comp level is playing politics and climbing a management ladder, or a &quot;technical ladder&quot; that is calibrated to be approximately 50 times as hard as the management one to create the impression that all these MBA-toting Directors and VPs are actually good at something.<p>Also, recruiters have existed forever and most of them are optimizing for churn, but if you think that you can hire &quot;an agent&quot; as a programmer and not be laughed out of the interview... sorry. They&#x27;ll say &quot;It was great to meet you&quot; and then hire an &quot;unagented&quot; H1-B.')
