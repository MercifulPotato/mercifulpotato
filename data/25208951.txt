If you&#x27;ve been there 1 year longer, your opinion is more valued. Not because you&#x27;re more knowledgeable, but because you happened to have graduated residency one year sooner. Medicine is about as far away from meritocracy as you can get while still somewhat feigning support for it.<p>Should we be trusting the experienced folks that say mainframes are fine and editing the DOM directly with jQuery is good enough?
