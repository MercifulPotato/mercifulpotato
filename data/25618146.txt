Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25618797], score=None, time=1609633994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616580, text='&gt; I totally agree that <i>if</i> you have committed some kind of crime, then this could be part of overcharging you.<p>There is no <i>if</i>. Everybody is committing a crime all the time. There are laws that prohibit doing things that other laws mandate. There are more pages of laws on the books than anyone could read in a lifetime, so there is no feasible way to know that a given action isn&#x27;t illegal.<p>Businesses are engaged in risk management. They try to avoid knowingly breaking the law. Making that process consume more resources, increases compliance costs.')
