I spent over 8 hours on it unsuccessfully; I asked for help from a friend at Google who worked on TF and he couldn&#x27;t figure it out either. I emailed the original author of the code and he acknowledged that he didn&#x27;t know how to do it either, and he had an old notebook he could dig up that kinda would work with a lot of fixes.')
