An AC unit can only be on or off, so you need a window, hysteresis, to keep from toggling on and off constantly. If you can input an analog signal, like control how much power goes into the heating coil in a BBQ, the PID is applicable. PID, if tuned properly, will find the right amount of power to feed the heating element to keep the oven at the desired temperature. This is not possible if you can only turn the AC on&#x2F;off with significant lag, so you need hystereiys.')
