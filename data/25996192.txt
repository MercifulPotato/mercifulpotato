Wow, cool to hear you followed along with Kod. It did ship and was used by a bunch of people. Its code is open source and still up on the github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rsms&#x2F;kod" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rsms&#x2F;kod</a><p>More importantly Kod was a side project I did for fun during an extended vacation. I remember publishing the first version on a December evening while visting my Mom on the countryside of Sweden. The next morning the program had been downloaded 25000 times and I was like &quot;wat?!&quot; A really fun little side project.<p>Playbit is something quite different to me. It is an _idea_ more so than a _solution_, it is a concept and path to a new alternative for software creating and sharing which I deeply believe in. Playbit is the beginning of a materialization of years of discussions, thoughts, experiences and research. I hope that I will have something more concrete to share soon. We have gotten so used to quick quick quick low-end web apps turning things around in a few months that I fear expectations on all software has been affected; Playbit is a long-term project and not something that will be &quot;done&quot; in a few months.<p>Then again, I might screw this up and it might die as a concept and some half-written code. I guess we will see :â€“)')
