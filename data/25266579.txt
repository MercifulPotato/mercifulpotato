I have the exact thoughts you did. It is amazing because in my experience KDE was one of -if not the- slowest desktop in Linux when I tried it. I&#x27;m guessing it was KDE 4. Gnome was way better and faster back then for me, both in Ubuntu and Debian. Great to hear it has become faster. Not so great that KDE users would downvote someone for speaking the truth.')
