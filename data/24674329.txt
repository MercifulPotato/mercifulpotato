Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24674595], score=None, time=1601755455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24671672, text='&gt; if you let someone else carry the flame from now on<p>Ha!<p>For a lot of open source maintainers and projects, that&#x27;s not an option because there isn&#x27;t someone else.<p>A number of articles about how to run healthy open source projects talk about the importance and difficulty of getting sufficient interested volunteers to keep it going, and how most projects don&#x27;t succeed at that.<p>It is often difficult or untenable to &quot;step aside&quot; and pass along the baton because there&#x27;s nobody seriously available to take it on.<p>Or they&#x27;re offering for the status (Github stars, résumé-driven development etc), and you can sadly tell it&#x27;s bad for the project if you just hand it over.  At least, you need to on-board people like this in stages, find out which ones are serious maintainers and which aren&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s also very common to have drive-by &quot;this should do $X&quot; type comments, or &quot;someone should do $X&quot;, but nobody is willing to help in a realistic or useful way with $X, or at all.<p>That&#x27;s why some places respond with &quot;patches welcome!&quot;.  Or &quot;you are welcome to fix this yourself&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s not maintainers being unwilling to step aside.<p>There&#x27;s also an awkward problem where people are willing to help, but their help creates more work than if they weren&#x27;t helping.  For example low quality patches, things which add a high maintenance burden, things that add more bugs or break other features.<p>Or more reasonably, which just clash with the design direction of the project.<p>The same happens in the real world (non-computer) non-profit volunteer projects.<p>A large burden ends up on a small number of shoulders, and people may &quot;armchair comment&quot; while being full of it, out loud in public, that the people doing the work aren&#x27;t &quot;letting&quot; others do the work or &quot;stepping aside&quot;.  When in reality, there is so much less volunteering on offer than people think from the talk, and much of what&#x27;s genuinely available creates more additional work than it saves.  But talk is cheap, fun for some, and it sways views, while doing actual work means you don&#x27;t have the time to talk as much, but you&#x27;re under pressure to talk anyway to counter prevailing armchair views if you don&#x27;t.')
