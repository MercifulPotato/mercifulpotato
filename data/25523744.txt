Item(by='bsanr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608768209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522490, text='&gt;In colloquial language<p>Further, if you go into the definitions of median, mean, and mode on Merriam Webster&#x27;s, only &quot;mean&quot; actually mentions the word &quot;average.&quot; It shows up in the &quot;synonyms&quot; section for median, hilariously, but not in the definition itself. It is then probably least incorrect to assume that average refers to the mean unless there is some previous understanding that it doesn&#x27;t (and since you presented the other meanings within a hypothetical, obviously there was no such understanding).<p>In any case, since <i>I</i> brought up the word &quot;average&quot; in the first place, and in all reasonability <i>meant</i> it to refer to the mean, I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re still arguing with me about this. You read an marginal meaning into my text to make a pedantic point and have wasted both our times.')
