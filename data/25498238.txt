I am seeking alpha testers.<p>* Fully remote; BYO video conf (works over Zoom, Skype, Teams, Google Meet - anything that enables screenshare + audio)<p>* Teams between 2 and 8 (although haven&#x27;t tried different sizes much)<p>* You&#x27;ll need to understand code, maybe write some code, hack a bit (needs a real computer, not a smart device)<p>* Currently planning a few manual test sessions, with me sitting in<p>Basic idea: for dev teams, coding together is something that is actually enjoyable.\nGet some satisfaction and build some team cameraderie without, y&#x27;know, meetings and JIRA and,\nwell, clients&#x2F;customers. Especially with covid-imposed remoteness, I see dev teams needing a bit of levity, a bit of (cringe) team building - I wanted to try a way that&#x27;s not online drinking or a straight-up quiz.<p>Each player will be asked for a couple of things (player name, simple stuff), then the team is\ndropped together into the escape room.  Swarm over the puzzles, pair up or spread out (up to you) -\npuzzle&#x2F;code&#x2F;hack your way out together, finish the endgame and then reflect on the fun \nyou had on the way.  Heavily influenced by Advent of Code, Project Euler.<p>I would like to charge for this eventually.  The main challenges as I see it are content and game dynamics.  I would like to learn from the first few teams that play.  Getting the puzzle difficulty right, making hints available to the players at the right times, witnessing first-hand how different teams handle and react to the UX.  That kind of thing.<p>As soon as there is a self-serve option I might do a &quot;Show HN&quot;.  For now, I&#x27;d love to hear people&#x27;s initial reactions, ideas and feedback.')
