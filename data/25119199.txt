They had to spend roughly the same amount (600 million) to support 30% less revenue<p>That&#x27;s not surprising to me at all. I&#x27;m sure their support and operations teams have been working insane hours during Covid dealing with cancellations, unclear lockdown&#x2F;quarantine policies, more guest&#x2F;host disputes, etc.')
