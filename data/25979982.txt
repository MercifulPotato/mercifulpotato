Detroit could continue thriving for centuries, revising its 20th-century land-use patterns to suit new populations.</i><p>“Our cities” is also the wrong word to use considering I can’t purchase a home in or around my city without 70 competing bids tens of thousands of dollars over asking price at the moment. And we’ve got hefty property taxes.')
