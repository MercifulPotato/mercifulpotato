Black people are disproportionately killed by police for their population, but almost exactly in proportion to the rate of violent crime broken down by race.<p>Obviously every &quot;unjustified&quot; death, especially deaths by the police (who are trained and held to higher expectations given their position) is a tragedy. The riots and protests led to far more deaths, far more injuries, and far more damage (including causing the second wave as cases were decreasing) than seems at all justified even considering these tragic police shootings.<p>In other words, while police brutality is a genuine problem, the response was completely disproportionate, misinformed, and morally wrong.')
