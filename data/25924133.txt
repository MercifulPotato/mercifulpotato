I see no reason to call these claims anything other than misinformation.<p>Given the incentives for each party after the initial vote tally of the election, there happened to be a lot more examples of #2 than anything else. But the exact same logic applies to #4, esp. in authoritarian countries where that kind of misinformation is more common.<p>Edit: typo')
