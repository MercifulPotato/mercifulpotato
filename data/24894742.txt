Item(by='chrisin2d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603709585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891210, text='As a UX designer, I agree on the point that cities need a UX designer (or several...) to make civic information visible, legible, and navigable.<p>I lived in the Chicago area, same as the author. In Chicago, parking signs read as if&#x2F;else-if&#x2F;else-if&#x2F;else sequences that are annoying to parse while driving. The &#x27;design process&#x27; (or whatever process manifested these signs) clearly had city processes but not users in mind.<p>In downtown Chicago, you can find yourself endlessly circling blocks in your car looking for a free spot, attempting to interpret contradicting parking signs, while some driver closely tails behind you impatiently. The street parking experience is very user-hostile.<p>The author points out a confusing spot between 1100N and 1166N State Street that has three signs on one pole. Such is a common occurrence.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;do93fXNdTnb1driQ7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;maps&#x2F;do93fXNdTnb1driQ7</a>\nHere, on the same pole there are two seemingly contradicting signs: one with a green circled P and another with a red crossed-out P, both with small arrows pointing in the same direction. There&#x27;s a pay box and another pay to park sign. You the driver have 1–3 seconds to react and decide: do you risk it (it says tow zone... but it also says pay to park and there&#x27;s a pay box right there!) or do you try the next street over (but this is already your 5th block and you&#x27;re running late for your appointment)?<p>You could have sign wombo-combos that go like:<p>1. &quot;Pay to park, 7 days a week&quot; — okay, seems like you can park<p>2. &quot;No stopping, no standing [A]am-[B]am, [C]pm-[D]pm, Mon-Fri&quot; — oh, what time is it exactly? And today is a Monday, right?<p>3. &quot;Street Cleaning, 1st Monday of the Month, [X]am-[Y]am, 1 Oct-1 Apr&quot; — and which Monday of the month is today?<p>and so on.
