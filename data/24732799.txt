There was a demonstration in the center of Paris, riot cops in full gear. \nIt was hot and one had his vest open, showing a &quot;LONSDALE&quot; brand t-shirt where conveniently, the center part of the word that remains visible with a vest says &quot;NSDA&quot;.\nIf you are clued up on this you will know NSDA can stand for National Sozialistische Deutsch Arbeitspartei, ie. the forebear of the Nazi party. It&#x27;s a know thing among certain wrongheaded folks.\nConsider this a public service announcement. I have not gone back.')
