The x modifier fixes both.<p>What you traditionally see with a complex RE for a complex pattern is the same as what you traditionally see with someone writing complex SQL statements on a single line.  Stop trying to treat it like a black box, and treat it as a programming language in its own right.  Use whitespace, indentation, and comments (when necessary) to communicate intent as well as just to make it do its job.<p>Other than that, regular expressions say what they mean and mean what they say very concisely directly.  Particularly the PCRE variants of the language.  I consider that conciseness and directness a virtue.')
