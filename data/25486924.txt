(At this level, as above, we couldn&#x27;t distinguish and animal from a rock; nor, I imagine, basically any physical process from any other.)<p>Organic systems grow in response to interaction with their environments, acquiring novel physical structure and causal properties. Neurological intelligence allows for theory-formulation on single-example cases (eg., a child burning their hand <i>once</i> is sufficient to build a theory of their immediate environment).<p>The list goes on.<p>The capacities of these systems do not obtain in the machine case, and likewise, the machine cases has no functional analogues at the relevant level of distinction.<p>This dumb form of statistics called, &quot;approximate associative modelling over 1tn cases&quot;, ie., Machine Learning, has nothing new to say about intelligence, biology or neurology.<p>We have been doing non-linear regression and optimisation since the victorian era.')
