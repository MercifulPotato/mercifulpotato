On about any decent microwave made in the last 10 year, pushing 1-6 gives a cook time of 1-6 minutes, respectively. Pushing start again after cooking has started will add 30 seconds. For longer cook times, press &quot;time cook.&quot; Maybe this sounds a bit complicated, but it&#x27;s efficient and all written down <i>on the keypad</i>. Mechanical timers really don&#x27;t work well for less than 5 minutes. Good microwaves with a dial use a rotary encoder and increase time logarithmically. It sure looks elegant on the builtin over your stove, but log scaling really isn&#x27;t intuitive outside volume controls, and probably more fiddly than buttons.<p>If there is a gripe to be had about microwave numpads, it&#x27;s the useless popcorn setting. The microwave popcorn bag tells you not to use the popcorn setting. It&#x27;s like something out of bad standup. &#x2F;rant')
