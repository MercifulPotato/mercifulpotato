Soldiers have direct contact with the enemy(code), but generals were once soldiers and have risen to deal with the complexity of huge structures of code, that is to marshal diverse resources to deal with the overall plan. At the top are the 5 star people who run the code warriors of Oracle and   Microsoft et al. Linux has a lot of soldiers, some 1-2 stars and it looks like a single 5 star.\nThis is why Linux has not won the war, but has  won many small battles.\nI had hopes that Canonical would empower Linux to win the war.')
