I definitely feel like I completed a part of my life.\nThere is still some drive - and it&#x27;s focused at creating enough value to pay all my expenses: food, entertainment, private school for the kids.<p>After that is done, I will spend my days working out, growing my kids, cooking, gardening, travelling.<p>I know society sells the lie you should be working yourself off (possibly for some giant evil corporation), hoarding as much money as possible until you die - but I couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>Removing economic incentives would see a steady decline of value creation in society. Stakhanovism was most likely Stalin propaganda.')
