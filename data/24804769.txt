However, any manual action (choosing trusted posters, maintained database) is bad for adoption. Facebook and twitter take care of it, you should too.<p>Perhaps you should use karma and comment interactions to automatically attest the people you interact with. Add a &quot;report&quot; button to disavow certain users. Now there is a positive and negative feedback loop to reduce the workload of attestation.<p>Caveat: attestation must be stabilized. The existing hierarchies of admin&#x2F;(super-)moderator work well as trusted posters. On the other hand, picking and choosing your moderator(s) is interesting and will birth new flame-wars and division.<p>Caveat (2): Adding more crypto explodes the amount of data which must be handled. Especially when every comment and upvote is signed.')
