I don&#x27;t think the author of this post has really done that.<p>The way these systems should work, and appear to work in Facebook&#x27;s case, is that the amount of information revealed depends on risk analysis.<p>For example, I just tried recovery from an IP I&#x27;ve used Facebook from, and from a fresh IP from a low reputation hosting provider located in a country unrelated to the account. The first case reveals the user&#x27;s name, but that&#x27;s pretty reasonable since the request has a decent amount of affinity for the account. The risky looking recovey does <i>not</i> reveal the name,<p>Both logins show the first letter of the local part of the email address, which is basically no information leakage at all. (Though honestly, if you show just one letter even for non-risky recovery attempts, why bother? It can&#x27;t possibly be of any significant help to the users.)<p>I can&#x27;t tell whether the profile picture changes based on the risk analysis outcome or not, since I don&#x27;t have a test account with one.<p>(It&#x27;s still possible that this is a bad implementation; e.g. if it were to be revealing my username for any recovery attempt from the correct country, that&#x27;d be unreasonable since it&#x27;s trivial to figure out the country from the phone number. But even so one should still establish what the relevant parameters are, so that we can figure out whether the behavior is reasonable.)')
