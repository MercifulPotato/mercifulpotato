In any case, if you aren&#x27;t using git and don&#x27;t know how to at least back things up you really should be asking yourself if a tech company is right for you, as a one man&#x2F;woman operation. There are countless other ways to make money online. Etsy, Craigslist, Shopify, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this was to intended to directed at me, but all of the tools mentioned imply using them with git or other version control, hence Github actions &#x2F; CI.
