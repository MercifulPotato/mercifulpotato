On a C64, you boot into bare basic and can immediately start playing with sprites and lines and stuff. With a modern computer you have BIOS, 80 bazillion lines of Windows or Linux, your Python installation and about 90 layers in between. It&#x27;s simply not possible to fully understand a modern computer. Just take a look at all the lines of code in Windows and Python that lets you play with turtle graphics (forget about the other million lines of other code I don&#x27;t even know about). Then, compare that sum with the amount of code in the C64. See the difference? Sure a modern computer does a lot more, but it&#x27;s also a black-hole&#x2F; accretion disk of bad design glued together.')
