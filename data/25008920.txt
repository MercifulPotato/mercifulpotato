If you are from a rich country or have elite qualifications, the world is your oyster. If you are at the other spectrum and come from an impoverished, war-torn country you could get asylum if you play your cards well. It&#x27;s an incredibly shitty situation of course, but there is some chance. If you are from a poor, but mostly peaceful country and you have skills but not Ivy League&#x2F;SV  brand-recognition level, you are pretty much &quot;screwed&quot;.')
