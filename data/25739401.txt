Are you suggesting we shut down FB, Twitter, etc. entirely? Or, are you suggesting we moderate lie-spreading? Because according to the logic you&#x27;ve laid out, that will just feed into the victim hood mentality<p>To be frank, I&#x27;m coming into this in good faith. I actually have waffled and entertained the thoughts you&#x27;re suggesting over the last couple of days and while they&#x27;re worth considering, I don&#x27;t think they are acceptable solutions.')
