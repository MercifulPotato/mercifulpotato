That is separate(ish) from the importing of messages from WhatsApp.<p>So, no, they&#x27;re not interested in WhatsApp import (per the closed ticket liked by the parent).<p>Additionally, the statement from signal is just PR spew. It boils down to &quot;Nah, we won&#x27;t make a way to do that.&quot;. The &quot;privacy preserving&quot; bit is nonsense because they have an export&#x2F;import to a file on android.')
