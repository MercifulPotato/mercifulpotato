The problem is that there are too many dollars for the price of gold to stay low. The devaluation has already happened regardless of whether a run has occurred; there is no way to <i>realize</i> the value of your &quot;national &#x27;savings&#x27;&quot; without performing the run and dropping the value.<p>The only way for this concern to make sense is if<p>(1) You are committed to never spending your &quot;savings&quot;, no matter what; but also<p>(2) You need the paper value of your &quot;savings&quot; to be a particular number, even though you will never do anything with that number other than look at it.')
