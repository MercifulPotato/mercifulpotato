Right, I know. I don&#x27;t expect other people to do work for me. I just need them to let me do the work myself.<p>The massive advantage of the OSS route isn&#x27;t that you can ask the community to build a tool for you; it&#x27;s that when you inevitably have a corner case or some behaviour you want to encode, you can just make RenesPostgres connector and copy in the Postgres connector and fix it.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why anyone keeps their source all closed. Even one of those &quot;you can&#x27;t release this but you can edit it&quot; licenses is better.<p>Half of why I use Kong as an API Gateway is that I can just edit the source code of their plugins. Thank fuck for that.')
