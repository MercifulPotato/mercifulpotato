It is not &quot;profitable&quot; in any standard metric.<p>Look at how many things are excluded in contribution profits:<p>&quot;We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. &quot;<p>So basically if you don&#x27;t count any indirect COGS, you don&#x27;t count the RSUs you&#x27;re paying the engineers and you don&#x27;t count the capitalized costs of your infrastructure, you can eek out an operating profit.  In my view, that&#x27;s not a &quot;profit.&quot;')
