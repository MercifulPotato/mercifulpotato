If it has a &quot;Do not edit&quot; comment in it, it&#x27;s probably a symlink to some file that&#x27;s dynamically managed (most likely to automatically use or fallback to the DNS server advertised on the network, as needed for e.g. captive portals). Just replace the symlink with a text file with your prefered DNS server in there.')
