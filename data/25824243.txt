Some people can, because they were visualizing the scene, some people won&#x27;t unless prompted, since they were constructing the scene.&quot;<p>- this is exactly it. I seem to be unable to visualize things in my mind. If someone asks me to visualize a beach, I can create a description of a beach and know what exists on the beach, I am able to give an verbal explanation of it. However I do not at any moment see it, nor do I have insight into the beach that I didn&#x27;t construct. I don&#x27;t notice that there is a hotel in the distance, but I can think about it and add it in the description. I feel this is very different to what apparently majority of people can do.')
