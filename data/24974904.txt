I didn&#x27;t know this was happening (I always decline mailing lists etc). Got my 2 instances already and they will replace one VC1S which was hard to upgrade at this point (it&#x27;s an old type instance which is no longer offered and was too heavy for my use anyway - it was way out of date and upgrades failed because they were running custom kernel boot images, but I kept it running because they never raised the price on it like they did with the newer ones :P ).<p>Only thing I do miss is that their console doesn&#x27;t work on Firefox :( But I just use chrome in those edge cases where I need it.')
