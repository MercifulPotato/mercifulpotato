What do they have in common? They handle sparse graphs (using CSR representations).<p>Having a graph with several million nodes isn&#x27;t just some edge case, social graph for instance grow way faster than anyone could expect. \nSo I do totally agree that there is a gap between popular graph libs which handle very small graphs and real life libs which need to handle way bigger graphs.<p>Btw, thanks for the work you&#x27;ve done with &#x27;nodevectors&#x27;.<p>PS: I&#x27;m not criticizing either networkx which is very handy and quite good when prototyping a solution.')
