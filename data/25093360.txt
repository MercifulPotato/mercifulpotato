Item(by='derefr', descendants=None, kids=[25094062], score=None, time=1605371864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25092538, text='You’d think there’d be a very simple solution to this—one that I believe Google <i>already used</i> for a long time, but just never generalized.<p>That approach: “proof of human work.” Google owns ReCAPTCHA, and every time you do a ReCAPTCHA for Google, you’re doing a little one-time proof-of-humanity for them. But it’s also a proof-of-work; and proofs-of-work <i>that cannot be automated</i> are aggregatable.<p>In other words, the fact that someone with Google account X solved a ReCAPTCHA, doesn’t just tell you something about who that account is <i>lately</i>. It <i>should</i> add to a sort of “human-proof credit score” for the account, where Google’s systems are more willing to put faith in the user because of <i>all</i> the times they’ve proven themselves human already.<p>And, for <i>some</i> scenarios, Google <i>does</i> use the aggregate proof ReCAPTCHA represents this way. This is why you’ll never see the Google Search “stop searching so fast” message when accessing Search through Chrome synced to a well-used Google account; why you’ll get a ReCAPTCHA portal from them instead if you’re not logged in (you’re being asked to build the credit score of your IP&#x2F;session); and why you’ll be denied upfront if you perform botlike behavior through Tor (where there’s nothing that can be correlated to give you a persistent credit score.)<p>Now, such a “highly-proven” Google account <i>could</i> still be heuristically detected elsewhere in Google’s systems as being responsible for botlike behavior (e.g. spamming); <i>but</i>, when such a highly-proven account is flagged, it <i>should</i> go in for manual review. Because — as you say — this is incredibly rare! So this process doesn’t <i>need</i> to scale through automation, the way regular Google processes do. It <i>can</i> be high-touch.<p>But right now, it’s not. (Or they’re just not even using the high-proof-of-humanity metadata on the account during this determination.) Either way, that’s kind of silly.')
