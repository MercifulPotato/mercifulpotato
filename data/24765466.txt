Practically every aspect of the site is designed to be as impractical and user-hostile as possible. The only reason I use Facebook (which happens increasingly less often) is because it&#x27;s my only way of contacting certain people. I&#x27;d LOVE to delete my account but I can&#x27;t because I still need it for random little things occasionally. I&#x27;m not their user - I&#x27;m their hostage.<p>And that&#x27;s without even getting into any of FB&#x27;s terrible practices around data collection and privacy, none of which need to be repeated here.<p>Facebook is cancer.')
