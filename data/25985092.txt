I’ve never seen photographs that can capture the detail in brush strokes that you will see when examining a painting.  Street View is also a bit crude in the ability to position, so you are also never going to be able to look at a work from multiple angles, exactly how you wish.<p>You should also check out the Cleveland Museum of Art when the pandemic allows - they have a really massive touch screen where you can interact with the pieces in their collection.  It’s so large that many people can use it at the same time!')
