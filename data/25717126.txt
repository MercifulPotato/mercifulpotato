I wasn&#x27;t meeting at people&#x27;s houses or in some dark alley, I was in the Kroger (grocery store) parking lot or even inside Kroger or the Mall. I don&#x27;t disagree with your point that fiat-&gt;crypto is not as easy as some people pretend it is but I just wanted to push back a little bit on the second part of your statement.')
