The whole damn thing is fuel.<p>analogizing a house, the purpose of which is to store and house human occupants, ran by non-professionals, to a dock store-house that houses hazardous compounds and is staffed by employees is pretty useless.<p>Yes, most everything is fuel.<p>Storing large amounts of explosive chemicals is <i>beyond the scope</i> of purpose behind a household.<p>Dock storehouses routinely deal with hazardous&#x2F;dangerous goods. They are built to do so with the premise that the staff that run them will follow strict (and in most cases clearly written) guidelines.<p>In other words : I don&#x27;t need to demonstrate explosion-readiness as a strict rule before home ownership -- but most countries require groups that house and manipulate explosive or combustible goods to demonstrate both their skill in manipulation, and their disaster planning in the worst case.')
