Most of the time, you don&#x27;t really want complete ambient noise elimination, as human speech appearing from dead silence sounds unnatural. Moreover, most noise reduction software is considerably less effective in reducing noise <i>during</i> a person speaking, either removing too much, producing degraded speech sound (worst case) or too little. If it&#x27;s possible, always start adding your noise reduction gradually, stop when it sounds good to your ear and then back up a bit.<p>If you&#x27;re doing voice recording&#x2F;streaming, please, get to know Expanding and Compression first, and only after configuring your sound processing chain add noise reduction in.<p>On of the serious offenders is OBS studio, which recently added RNNoise filter, but provides no means of mixing processed sound with the dry one (in other words, filter is always 100% on). Wet&#x2F;Dry mix knob is heavily needed for most filters there.<p>I&#x27;m very saddened by the state of sound quality in lots of amazing videos people have been producing lately and now I&#x27;m considering writing a guide for voice processing for streams&#x2F;conferences&#x2F;etc for the techy people, if anyone&#x27;s interested.')
