Keep in mind that a car with DRL and ABS will be an &quot;old car&quot; a few years from now. 10+ year old cars have ABS today because at some point it was mandated on all new cars.<p>It&#x27;s a reasonable compromise to let people buy and use the old cars as they are (or anything that uses old, outdated tech - lead based solder in electronics?) but demand that new ones constantly integrate new tech.')
