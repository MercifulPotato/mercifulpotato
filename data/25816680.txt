A historian doesn&#x27;t cite Mein Kampf to give context to what they&#x27;re saying, the historian uses Mein Kampf as data. For a historian, Mein Kampf is perfectly valid data. On the other hand, Mein Kampf 2: Meiner Kampfer is not valid data, and any paper citing it as if it were should be immediately considered suspect. A scientist citing a retracted paper is like a historian citing a forgery: fine if it&#x27;s a harmless aside, catastrophic if their claims hinge upon its reliability.')
