And the local web server options are immature.<p>Running a whole web server just to use _git (lfs)_ seems absurd to me.<p>The pattern is clearly intended to be used with the big centralized players - and the idea of normal git patterns, like git lfs in a local fs or git lfs over SSH were secondary concerns.<p><i>well, not even secondary concerns really - it&#x27;s not at all supported.</i> To me, this is the core use case for Git.
