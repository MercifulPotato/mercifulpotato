Dropbox also dropped support for xfs filesystems on Linux (which they later brought back, but not after infuriating Linux users). That&#x27;s when I stopped using both. I then moved to Google Drive (which is half the price of Dropbox), and moved to using markdown note apps sync with Google Drive (which is free!)<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a single example of a company where &gt;90% of their userbase if free, and they succeed after making the free user experience worse.\nThey&#x27;re thinking in terms of money (or reducing costs), but the other view is that they&#x27;re making the experience for &gt;90% of customers worse.<p>What dropbox seems to forger is that many of their enterprise contracts happened precisely because the decision makers used dropbox personally, and liked it. By screwing over your free customers, you are actually only hurting future sales.')
