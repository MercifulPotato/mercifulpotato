I think the rule is often instated for reasons really involving low-quality content and spam (but with more exterior objectivity), but it hurts the already-disadvantaged in the process. The only good thing that may come from it is having to focus on features and benefits of the product more since you can&#x27;t just dump the link to the product, but again already-famous people&#x2F;companies don&#x27;t have to deal with that.')
