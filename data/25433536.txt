In short - they have to be competitive. There’s no reason they can’t do this while also being good to employees.<p>A lot of the complaints I see come across as sour grapes and trying to legislate their existence rather than just being better and caring about what customers want.<p>At its best capitalism is a force for aligning value and interests between provider and customer. On net this leads to more efficient distribution and better outcomes for the most people.<p>At its worst it’s rent seeking and leveraging local power over people without choice. Small businesses often fall on that side of the spectrum to me.')
