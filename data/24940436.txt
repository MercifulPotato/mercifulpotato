But arguably that&#x27;s just being pedantic. The air gets in the way of the object moving through it and slows it down, but energy is conserved, as always, so the energy ends up as heat. Knowing that the correct term is &quot;air resistance&quot; rather than &quot;friction&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any insight into what&#x27;s happening, so I don&#x27;t understand the obsession with correcting people online who call it &quot;friction&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been told you can bring water to the boil with a food mixer and a bit of patience.
