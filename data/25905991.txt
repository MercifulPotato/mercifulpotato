You are referring to assets. I&#x27;m referring to things like lessons learned and new systems developed. Proprietary organization is one of the simplest forms this takes. Reinventing even that is a waste of time.<p>I can also tell some of this is getting into specific case territory. :-) For example, sure, I might not bother referencing a simple component. But that&#x27;s more like &quot;just Google it&quot; territory. No depth. I have lots of master frameworks that are very deep that I&#x27;d never want to repeat. DRY is a life saver there. Those files are also more likely to stay put...<p>For your moving links scenario, I use search alongside my organization hierarchy and the links double as search prompts. So that&#x27;s not a problem. I think this is another case where the specifics matter.')
