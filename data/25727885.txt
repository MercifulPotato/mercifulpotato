Up to &quot;3.2 Gen 2x1&quot; they have 8 wires, but &quot;3.2 Gen2x2&quot; has 12 wires.  There&#x27;s two pairs of RX and TX each, i.e. RX1- RX1+ RX2- RX2+ TX1- TX1+ TX2- TX2+ D- D+ PWR GND = 12.<p>And... that&#x27;s still not correct: USB-C to USB-C cables have an additional CC line which carries the Type-C extra negotiation (e.g. alt mode switch, power levels.)<p>And just to fuck users over even more, there is a difference between a 13-pin full-function &quot;USB 3.2 Gen2x2&quot; cable and a 13-pin full-function Thunderbolt cable:  the Thunderbolt cable reports an extra &quot;vendor descriptor&quot; on the Type-C negotiation channel, indicating support for TB.  The cables are otherwise physically identical, but these extra bits come with a ~$15 markdown.<p>(Oh and the PWR&#x2F;GND lines can be 3A or 5A, but at this point...)<p>The article is, however, correct in its conclusion: a &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; cable will always work for all USB standards.  The only free variable on a TB cable is whether it does 3A or 5A for power.')
