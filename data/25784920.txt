That’s a lot of money down the drain for both the companies and me (opportunity cost).<p>We’re very close to releasing something, so if you would like to learn more or try it out early, please email me. I’d love to show what we’ve built, and to hear your thoughts. (I think you’ll find our tool helpful if your team has &gt;10 people, but I’d love to chat even if that’s not the case.)')
