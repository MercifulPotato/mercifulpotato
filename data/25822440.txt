I, too, wish more people were trauma informed.  We live in a &quot;just suck it up&quot; society, but kiddos in care, because of the trauma they&#x27;ve experienced, have brains that have developed physically different to kiddos who&#x27;ve grown up in a nurturing and caring environment. They can&#x27;t &quot;just suck it up&quot;.<p>I think we have to be careful when we say &quot;be financially stable before having kids&quot; though.  Not that we shouldn&#x27;t be, but we can&#x27;t just let certain classes of people have kids.  Also, those who are stable now are one accident or emergency or job loss, etc. away from being unstable.<p>Edit: I think what I said might be unclear.  IOW, having kids should NOT be dependent on your financial state.')
