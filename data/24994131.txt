But you can&#x27;t really do that with something psycho active, at least not ethically.<p>There are no ethical barriers to including a control group.<p>The idea that double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are impossible with psychoactive medication is a strawman argument, because obviously we can still have a control group.<p>The control group doesn&#x27;t even need to receive placebo. In a study like this one, they could have easily and ethically had one group receive therapy and a second group receive therapy plus mushrooms. Or the first group could have received therapy plus traditional SSRIs.<p>The placebo response rate in antidepressant studies is extraordinarily high. There is no good reason to omit a control group in studies like these, other than perhaps if the researchers were too underfunded to make it work.')
