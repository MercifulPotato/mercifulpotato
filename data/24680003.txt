On the other hand, introduce revenue streams &amp; you start focusing on optimizing the revenue stream instead of solving the problem.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a different way to make the costs felt that isn&#x27;t directly revenue to align incentives. Like slow down or fail queries for zones who&#x27;s authoritative servers don&#x27;t implement the features needed to keep scaling under control. Then make sure that there&#x27;s revenue to the root servers from non-root servers based on load so that costs are tracked &amp; managed.')
