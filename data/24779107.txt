Item(by='meowface', descendants=None, kids=[24781472], score=None, time=1602696018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775271, text='I&#x27;m definitely very far from a physics expert, but if I&#x27;m not mistaken wouldn&#x27;t this just be the perspective of a far-away observer watching you fall in? I think from your own perspective, time would pass as you expect both near and beyond the event horizon.<p>Depending on the size of the black hole, once you&#x27;re past the event horizon you&#x27;d eventually be stretched&#x2F;torn apart by the tidal forces. But if you could somehow survive this and escape back to Earth (survival long past the horizon is maybe theoretically possible for some entity, though escape isn&#x27;t), or if you merely get near an extremely gravitationally strong horizon and escape back to Earth, then Earth would indeed have aged perhaps thousands or millions or billions of years, but you still would have aged at a normal rate and would have experienced the passage of time normally, just like you would if you had returned from a trip in a near-light speed spacecraft.<p>This is demonstrated in Interstellar. When they&#x27;re near the black hole for a few hours and return, they see their crewmate aged decades despite them aging and experiencing the passage of time normally from their perspective (just those few hours).<p>If you had a nearby black hole or a fast enough vehicle, you could skip through Earth centuries&#x2F;millennia in a few hours or days from your perspective, in hopes that a cure would have been developed during that time. Maybe in the distant future, if space travel tech somehow manages to rapidly outpace medical tech, this could be a last resort option for terminally ill people. Kind of like &quot;time travel cryonics&quot;. You might return to find Earth blown to smithereens or uninhabitable due to a nanobot war, but if you&#x27;re terminally ill you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose anyway, so might as well take the risk.')
