Enums in Rust are more than enums are in C. So this conversation is something like:<p>Them: I like sandwiches.<p>You: I get sandwiches from McDonalds, they&#x27;re great.<p>Them: Yes, but those are burgers. (The implication being that there are also other kinds of sandwiches.)<p>You: Yes, burgers are good.<p>You&#x27;re not <i>wrong</i>, but you&#x27;re kind of missing what they&#x27;re saying.<p>Enums in Rust <i>can be</i> like enums in C, but they can also be tagged unions. Furthermore, Rust won&#x27;t automatically cast an enum to an int, so it is a bit harder to make mistakes, even if you&#x27;re using the C-like ones. That&#x27;s the advantages they&#x27;re speaking about. Enums are good and useful in C, it&#x27;s true. That&#x27;s why Rust added stuff to make them even more useful.')
