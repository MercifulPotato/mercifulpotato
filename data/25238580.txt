Sure, in the cold, social Darwin paradigm, those without ability have no worth - but this is not how things SHOULD be.<p>I think it’s important for people to know that they have value, regardless of their abilities.  This doesn’t mean that people should not be encouraged to succeed.  I think self esteem and achievement can go hand in hand. For me personally, I think believing that I was special helped motivate me to achieve more!  After all, If you’re not special, what chance do you have competing against the other 7billion people in the world?<p>Anecdotally, I was raised by two very people-self esteem parents, and have become fairly successful compared to my peer group.  I also remember the first time I heard someone say that self esteem was bad.  It came from the evangelical, objectivist parents of a kid I knew in early high school.  That kid ended up failing college and getting addicted to opioids.')
