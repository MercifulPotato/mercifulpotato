(It&#x27;s because you have accepted the truth of the Bible as a foundational assumption.  From this, the idea that modern cosmology is not science is a logically valid conclusion.)  Instead, the first thing I&#x27;m going to do at this point is to ask you why you are trying to conceal it.<p>Also, if you are a YEC, I would be interested to know if you were surprised that I was able to correctly guess this.')
