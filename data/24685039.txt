Talent wants the freedom to move around.<p>Part of the reason why the no-poach agreements between Apple and Adobe and others was so disgusting was because that was collusion by multi-billion dollar companies to prevent employee mobility. And the companies were sanctioned heavily for this as a result.<p>Because in other states, something as egregious as a company trying to sell off its employees (after rejecting an acquihire agreement), and then suing one of the employees who decided to jump off the sinking ship and join a company that actually wanted to compensate him and where he might actually have a future, might be successful.<p>Take the recent Amazon situation here in Seattle [1] where the company attempted to enforce a non-compete on an employee it wasn’t going to promote and whose hiring-manager assured that the non-compete was “boiler plate” and that the company would not exercise. When the employee’s boss (that same hiring manager), left for a job at Oracle, and wasn’t sued, he took that as a sign he could seek outside employment. The employee took a job at Google, took steps to make sure he wouldn’t be infringing on any sensitive information, and HR congratulated him. Then Amazon sued him and got an injunction on letting him work on PowerPoints at his new job. This was ultimately settled but the fact that Amazon did this — and did this not to an engineer but a marketing professional — should worry any Amazon employee in the state of Washington. (The more senior employee who took a job at Oracle was based in California).<p>Washington State’s non-compete laws are good for low-level employees, but the salary cap of $100,000 makes it worthless for virtually any person employed by a tech company (or a place like Boeing), though the existence of those kinds of non-competes varies from company to company.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;amazon-settles-lawsuit-former-aws-marketing-vp-joined-google-cloud&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geekwire.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;amazon-settles-lawsuit-former-...</a>')
