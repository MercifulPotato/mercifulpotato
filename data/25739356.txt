Just because Republicans complain about how CNN chooses to run its newsroom doesn’t mean they want a government takeover of CNN. You can say that something private actors are doing is bad or risky without there being an implication that the government should stop that bad behavior.<p>I mean you can flip this around just as easily? Where are all the Fairness Doctrine liberals?<p>For the other: quite a few Republicans, especially the folks Trump brought in, are economically quite liberal. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;mbTycKP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;mbTycKP</a> Trump took changes to social security and Medicare off the table during his campaign. The laissez-faire economic libertarian wing long held the advantage within the coalition, but a bunch of them have become Democrats over the last couple of decades, especially with the rise of Trump.')
