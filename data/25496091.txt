I also was able to find a person on similar position who makes more than me. There also was a person who made less than me. This isn&#x27;t anti woman behavior just typical HR stuff and cost optimization. &quot;Pay as little as possible&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t play the woman or the race card. IT job market is very fluid. If her skills are valuable enough she will get the pay she deserves. Her blog post is less credible than Giulani&#x27;s polling witness Mellisa Carone. This is not &quot;women and minorities asking for fair treatment&quot;. This is a &quot;women and minorities demanding privileged treatment under the threat of making an internet sensation and ruining someone&#x27;s life with false accusations&quot;.')
