Consider a regular, straight-ish coast: the water volume difference between low tide and high tide may seem massive, but divided by the cross-section of an imaginary divider between coastal waters and off-shore waters the stream (meters cubed for tidal delta volume divided by meters squared for the cross section that the delta has to pass through) will be rather negligible.<p>It would be very cool to have fully developed tidal generator products ready to deploy in the few places where geographic features force the delta through a tight bottleneck (anything from small bays and fjords in high tidal delta areas to the massive bottleneck of Gibraltar straight) but that&#x27;s a pretty hard limited market that makes development investments rather unattractive when there are more universally applicable renewable energy sources untapped, like e.g. offshore wind.')
