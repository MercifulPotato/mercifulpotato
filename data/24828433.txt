Item(by='ColinWright', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603127402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827836, text='&gt; At what &#x27;level&#x27; of maths or understanding do you reckon someone has to be in order to make sense of your introductory paragraph?<p>It varies from country to country, curriculum to curriculum.  I would expect any student studying A-Level in the UK (the last year of secondary school) would know most of this, but not necessarily all the connections between them<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;I find that the most elegant way to understand exponential-related things&quot;...<p>&gt; Okay, I know what exponential increase means. Something grows by an exponent of something. 2, 4, 16, ...<p>For something to increase exponentially means that at each step it is multiplied by a factor (usually greater than 1).  In your example the factor is 2.<p>So yes, you have a handle on what it means for something to grow exponentially.<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;is by defining the exponential as the function satisfying f&#x27;=f (with suitable normalization)&quot;...<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know what an exponential is.<p>There is more than one way to define an exponential, and in part that&#x27;s what makes them so important.  they turn up in multiple contexts, and being able to think of them in different ways is valuable.<p>&gt;  A function, to me, is something I call as part of code, so I am not sure if I might be confusing the programmer and mathematician-definition of &#x27;function&#x27;.<p>In mathematics a function is a &quot;thing&quot; that takes a value from some domain and returns a value in some (possibly the same, but not necessarily) domain.  So &quot;log&quot; is a function that takes positive real numbers and returns a real number (although it&#x27;s also defined in other contexts such as complex numbers and abstract groups).<p>Polynomials are functions, usually we think of them as taking a real number and returning a real number: y=4x^3-x+5.  Polynomials can also take other &quot;types&quot; such as complex numbers, matrices, group elements, etc.<p>But basically a function takes a value and returns a value.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t really know how to interpret f&#x27;=f in any way.<p>The notation f&#x27; is used (in some contexts) to refer to the derivative of the function f.  Given a function f we can ask: At this location, how quickly is it changing?  That defines another function, which we call the derivative.  This is differential calculus.<p>Given a function y=f(x) the derivative is often written as dx&#x2F;dy.<p>&gt; I also don&#x27;t really know how normalization plays into it. For me, normalization is something related to homogenising a series of things. Sometimes it can be related to normalising the volume of a bunch of mp3 files, or in other cases it can be turning a bunch of badly formatted phone numbers into a common format for a database.<p>So the exponential function y=e^x, where e is the constant 2.71828..., is the unique function with the property that its derivative is the function itself.  But the function y=2^x has <i>nearly</i> the same property once you permit multiplication by an appropriate other constant.  That&#x27;s the re-normalisation.<p>So an exponential is a function which, up to multiplication by a constant, is its own derivative.  Hence f&#x27;=f up to normalisation.<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;In other words, it is the &quot;eigenfunction&quot; of the derivative, which is a linear operator. This is a very natural thing to ask when studying derivatives, ODEs, etc.&quot;<p>&gt; I have often heard terms like &quot;eigen&quot;-something, but this always causes me trouble, because I end up parsing it in German (&quot;eigen&quot; means &quot;self&quot; in German). So now it is the &quot;self&quot;-function of something?<p>When you have a transformation, often it does different complicated things in different directions.  But sometimes you can find a direction where the transformation is especially simple, such as just a scaling.<p>Take a square and stretch, rotate, and sheer it.  When you&#x27;ve done so there will be a direction where the result is a simple scaling.  That&#x27;s called an eigen-vector, and the amount of scaling is the associated eigen-value.  By knowing the eigen-vectors and eigen-values of a transformation you can know nearly everything about the transformation as a whole.<p>(Note: a rotation has to eigen-vectors when you limit yourself to the real plane, but does have complex eigen-values.)<p>&gt; Okay, of the &#x27;derivative&#x27;. Is a derivative the mathematician&#x27;s way of saying &quot;figuring out something you don&#x27;t know by using a bunch of other things you do know&quot;?<p>No.  As mentioned earlier, the derivative of a function is the measure of how fast it&#x27;s changing.  Example: if y=x^2-3x+1, then at location x the function is changing at rate 2x-3.  If you plot y against x, then at any point the slope of the curve will depond on x, but is given by the function dy&#x2F;dx = 2x-3.<p>&gt; I do not know what a linear operator is at all.<p>A &quot;Linear Operator&quot; is a thing L that transforms Xs into Yx, but has the properties that<p>* L(x0+x1) = L(x0) + L(x1)<p>* L(c.x) = c.L(X)<p>where c is any suitable constant, and x, x0, and x1 are the things that L transforms.  Linear operators are the basis of all machine learning (and many other things)<p>&gt; I also do not know what ODEs are.<p>Ordinary Differential Equation.  These are equations where you express a relationship between a function and its derivatives.  So the equation earlier : f&#x27; = f : is an ODE.  It says that the function f is equal to its own derivative.<p>ODEs are important in fluid dynamics, because the way a fluid flows depends on pressure changes, which are expressed as derivatives.<p>The ODE f&quot;=c.f is used to describe Simple Harmonic Motion.<p>I hope that helps, but you have no contact details in your profile, so I can&#x27;t contact you to offer more information.')
