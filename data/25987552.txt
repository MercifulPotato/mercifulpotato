A loan word is still a word. Ketchup and tycoon are English words, garage is an English word, schadenfreude is an English word. The fact that these are also words in other languages doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>That said I can sympathize with wanting to preserve language, but it ultimately can&#x27;t be controlled without buy-in from the people. On that vein I wonder how effective the French Academy is at combating anglicization.')
