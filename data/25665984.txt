But the major difference (other than the list of countries they have treaties with) is if you insult the US government, nothing would happen, if you insulted the ccp, they would make up some false accusations to extradite you and throw you in jail, like whats happening already with Hong Kong.<p>So you&#x27;re definitely safer with the US than you are with china.')
