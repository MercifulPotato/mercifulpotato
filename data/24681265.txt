Not only do you need to have an account to use these speakers, but there&#x27;s no way to run them without using the built in app, and there&#x27;s no way to avoid getting on the upgrade treadmill with the app.<p>I had a sonos setup I was very happy with, until I was forced to upgrade my laptop app because it wouldn&#x27;t let me play any music without upgrading. And then guess what? My laptop was too old (circa 2010 17&quot; macbook pro) for tne new app, and when I complained on their forums, was told to upgrade my laptop because the os was no longer supported and it was a &quot;security risk to run old operating systems&quot;.<p>Goodwill was very happy to receive those speakers that week,  and sonos is now on my list of companies I will never buy from, and on the list of companies I will take time out of my day to make sure my friends (irl and internet strangers) hear about their practices.')
