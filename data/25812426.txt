Item(by='linuxftw', descendants=None, kids=[25813632, 25813581], score=None, time=1610903408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810948, text='Boeing and the FAA did a bang up job hiding the details of their unsafe system behind vague language such as this:<p>&gt; Specifically, just before stall entry, and well below any normally encountered airspeed, control column pitch forces became lighter when they are required by certification rules to become heavier.<p>&quot;[not] normally encountered&quot; could mean, once every 10 flights.  Maybe once every 1000 flights.  1 out of 10 scenarios for a given flight.  Who knows?  Certainly not the FAA, because they didn&#x27;t collect or publish this data in their report.  They used similarly vague language most likely provided by Boeing.<p>This report walks through the stall scenario with MCAS working, and it walks through an entirely different scenario with MCAS malfunctioning.  It does not walk through the stall scenario with MCAS malfunctioning.  Boeing and the FAA still have not released data on how often MCAS was operating (erroneously or otherwise) prior to grounding, and how safe it might be for pilots to operator aircraft with MCAS disabled.<p>It sounds like the pilot here is on the take.  Such a glaring omission in the simulator is damning in my eyes, and I trust Boeing and the FAA less than I did after the crashes.')
