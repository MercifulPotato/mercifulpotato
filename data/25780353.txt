Not sure how you work around that.<p>As for Internet connection, there was another recent action by an ISP which blocked access to Twitter. So you&#x27;re not necessarily safe with your ISP either.<p>I think the only story I haven&#x27;t heard yet is a landlord evicting its tenants for hosting objectionable content. But without any of the above services, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s still possible to stay accessible even if your content isn&#x27;t legal. The important point is that legal but broadly unacceptable content is <i>never</i> safe. You can be kicked out by any provider at any layer, and getting kicked out once serves as a signal to all the other providers at that layer that they are expected to do the same.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like living in a small town 150 years ago. The &quot;people&quot; of the town are the few giant service providers in the country. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what the law says, if the town consensus is that you are not welcome, then they can make it very hard or impossible to live there. They don&#x27;t need law enforcement on their side, they&#x27;ll run you out all the same.')
