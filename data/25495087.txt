And most of these laws are suspended for college students, simply because if they were enforced for students, then the out of state students would suddenly be candidates for in-state tuition.<p>My wife and I plan to travel extensively in retirement. We have traveled a lot so far in life, but only one week here, two weeks there, limited by vacation time. When we travel in  retirement, we plan to stay two to four weeks in each place we visit, away from home for months at a time. Except that if you are in your home state for less than six months plus one day, residency becomes and issue (in almost every state) and can have tax implications. Most people never have to face that situation, but I have one close acquaintance that has dealt with this issue for the last five years as a resident of Florida. He says that if the state suspects that you are skirting the edge of your residency requirements, they can request your non-specific state-based cell phone data for the calendar year, and it will be provided to the state. It won&#x27;t be fine grained location data, but it will say how many days you were in that state.')
