I think one thing programmers underestimate is how many scientists and academics are using Python. It&#x27;s not just ML, it&#x27;s pretty much every kind of scientist and tons of non-science academics too. The fact that it&#x27;s a great &quot;casual&quot; or part-time language is huge for these people. They aren&#x27;t full time (or even self-identifying) programmers, but their programs are non-trivial. The readability, portability, tooling, and massive package ecosystem is huge for them. In that world, being somewhat comfortable in R and Python is becoming table stakes for really large swathes of academia.<p>Personally I believe this is exactly why Python is dominant in ML now. We are harvesting after 20 years of academics happily writing libraries and tools for academic work in Python. :-)<p>So I have no idea how the article got their numbers, but I&#x27;m not at all surprised to see the sheer number of people programming in Python exploding.')
