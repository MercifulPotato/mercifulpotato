Have you been dissatisfied with the classic search + recommendation approach to finding new communities?  I was too so made this map!<p>In this map each node is a subreddit with its size proportional to its number of subscribers.  You&#x27;ll find that each cluster will usually have a few &#x27;hubs&#x27; of its most common theme.  Each subreddits color is determined by its closest neighbors in terms of audience.  That means, for example, most people that participate in &#x2F;r&#x2F;plants also participate in &#x2F;r&#x2F;flowers.  Those relationships aren&#x27;t exclusive though as each subreddit could be connected to many clusters.  Use the search function to find your favorite community and explore from there.<p>If you have any comments, questions, or feedback I would love to hear what you think!')
