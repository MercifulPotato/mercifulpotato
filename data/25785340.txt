Look at the ingredients for any premade foods, even the ones that bill themselves as healthy, they are mostly sugars and carbs and sauces containing HFCS. Also, the caloric density is insane, one &quot;meal&quot; can be upwards of 1500 or 2000 calories if you ignore their &quot;suggested serving&quot; which is unrealistic to what people eat.<p>Also, exercise accounts for maybe a hundred or two calories a day for the average person who isn&#x27;t into marathons or something, so the only true way to lose weight is to decrease what you eat.<p>It&#x27;s not lack of exercise, that&#x27;s the way these corporations try to blame you for being lazy so you forget their food is garbage that&#x27;s making you fat.')
