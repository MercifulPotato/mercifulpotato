The DX are also in demand again: not so long ago I bought a TX7 for around $75, now they sell for $350. The DX100&#x2F;DX27 is also desired by quite a few, it seems.<p>There are multiple reasons, I think:\n- analog got popular again because bands started using it again when the prices dropped (due to digital tech, of course)\n- classic synths are vulnerable, making them decent investement objects, thus pushing the price, and making them more coveted than they deserve\n- that left only cheap digital synths for players bands without money, much like the 303, 808 and 909 back in the day (speaking of synths that changed music...)\n- which makes them desirable for the trend-followers, like analog 10 years ago.\n- the DX series fits better in modern music than something like the early Roland romplers with their super-cheesy sound.')
