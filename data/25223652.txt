In my opinion, both of those are probably a part of it, there&#x27;s a lot of people in a country, not everyone will justify their feelings the same way. It&#x27;s very possible some are opposed due to puritanism, and some are due to impact on social productivity, and some on both, and some others on completely other basis.<p>We could have some survey based study that tries to ask respondent questions whose answer could maybe begin to give us a little understanding of how much each of these angle might be at play in a given population. That would already avoid a lot of this &quot;I think&quot; &quot;You think&quot; debate.')
