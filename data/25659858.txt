A lot of &quot;people problems&quot; seem to come from fighting over which stack to use. (and most people fight for whichever stack they are best at, to maximize their own personal contribution). I always spend a lot of time asking people what technology they would use to solve a particular problem, what technology they really don&#x27;t like, etc. It saves a lot of trouble fighting over things if you get a team that is willing to go with a particular technical approach and is more important than most &quot;cultural fit&quot; issues.')
