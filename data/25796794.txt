What&#x27;s the message in that case?<p>What&#x27;s nice about Python&#x27;s message is how compositional or &quot;orthogonal&quot; it is, which means that the errors can easily be handled in a program. Does Lua have anything like that? From the manual<p>&gt; If you need to handle errors in Lua, you should use the pcall function (protected call) to encapsulate your code.<p>This actually helps me understand a bit the dichotomy between &quot;configuration&quot; and &quot;program&quot;, and why Lua is so good for the former. As another comment put it, it&#x27;s good when you need to &quot;describe stuff&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to describe something that handles errors in its own description, which motivates relegating error handling to specific contexts.')
