So what you were watching as time went on was large tranches of mail-in ballots that took forever to count coming in from D-heavy areas (or from areas where Biden outperformed Clinton, and where the mail returns were, like everywhere, more D than the election day returns).<p>So if I understand correctly, you&#x27;re saying that there&#x27;s a gradual (in PA) or not-so-gradual-at-first-but-then-gradual (in MI) shift from in-person ballots to mail-in ballots, which explains these trends? That does seem possible.<p>Another possibility is that the USPS processed the mail-in ballots from big cities differently from those from towns with smaller mail volume.')
