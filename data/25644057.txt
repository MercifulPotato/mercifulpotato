In the most basic design, you&#x27;d wait for the entire instruction to complete, for who knows how many tens of cycles more. You could also just cancel the instruction and retry it after servicing the interrupt, wasting some work. Or let it still run, but only stall when the interrupt code wants to access the same vector registers. Which is going to happen eventually anyway if you&#x27;re doing a context switch (barring some lazy state dump&#x2F;restore optimization).')
