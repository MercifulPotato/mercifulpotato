Many unconscious states are characterized by reduced activity throughout the brain. The thalamus, being connected to practically every area of cortex, is well positioned to push the cortex into a more active state. And note that there are loops everywhere! The thalamus connects to the cortex, the cortex connects to the basal ganglia, which connects back to the thalamus. And there are many more feedback loops between these structures. So it could be that you simply need to “kickstart” the system, as this article is suggesting, and once a baseline level of excitability is reached, all of these loops do the job of keeping the system at a functioning, stable state of excitability. To what extent this leads to the repair of damaged brain areas is less clear, but we know that lack of activity causes atrophy, so pushing the system back into an excited state could in principle prevent further damage.')
