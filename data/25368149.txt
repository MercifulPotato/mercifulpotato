I don&#x27;t think buying Instagram for $1bn was a particularly visionary move but rather just... cautious. Facebook also bought Gowalla, Lightbox.com, Friendly, TBH and tried to buy Snapchat, Musically (since merged into TikTok), Houseparty, etc. All these are&#x2F;were competitors and threats. Some were small, some were big. Some worked out and grew, others didn&#x27;t.<p>The Instagram acquisition happened fairly early on, so it makes sense that it was worth a lot of money to Facebook. Now that Facebook is huge it can get turned down by a company like Snapchat, and it&#x27;ll just go ahead and copy&#x2F;improve its features with its much-larger team, capital, and user-base. Back then, buying the competitor was the best option since Facebook didn&#x27;t have as many resources or reasons to believe they could compete as effectively.<p>Moreover, I&#x27;d argue the reason Instagram worked out so well is precisely because it got acquired by Facebook. Had Instagram had to figure out its own monetization strategy, find its own clients, compete with the established players, build its own infrastructure, etc. it probably wouldn&#x27;t have been able to grow as much or as quickly.')
