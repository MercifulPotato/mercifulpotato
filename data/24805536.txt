So &quot;Excel&quot; skills aren&#x27;t very helpful&#x2F;transferable; it leverages Microsoft&#x27;s M language[2] instead of Excel functions, and the usage paradigm is far more natural for someone with a programming background than an Excel background.<p>But as someone else mentioned in another comment, Alteryx is anything but cheap. PowerQuery is already widely distributed and available to anyone with Excel installed[3]. So for anyone looking for this type of operational discipline around data, it&#x27;s a handy tool to pick up. Bonus points that PowerQuery&#x2F;M-code is portable between a variety of Microsoft tools (SQL Server, PowerBI, Excel, and a variety of Azure&#x27;s data services).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;power-query-overview-and-learning-ed614c81-4b00-4291-bd3a-55d80767f81d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;office&#x2F;power-query-overv...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powerquery-m&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powerquery-m&#x2F;</a><p>[3] Traditionally only available for Windows, but the base tech has recently been added to Excel for Mac and is being brought up to parity.')
