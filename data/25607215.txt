Item(by='chiph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609535615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606733, text='&gt; or a facility&#x2F;premises designed by the governor<p>Interpreting this in the worst light -- this could be a jail or prison if the governor has designated such to be where people charged with violating this law are to be confined. But it does go on to mention home confinement - not sure what the standard is.<p>What I&#x27;m not seeing is mention of compensation to people wrongly forcibly quarantined under this law. Or any reference to how they will be treated while quarantined (Will you be fed a Maricopa county jail peanut-butter sandwich, a military ration, or take-out from local restaurants?)<p>From a language perspective - I really dislike the word &quot;Removal&quot; used in the bill. Perhaps it&#x27;s standard for NY laws, but it&#x27;s too Orwellian in my opinion. And quarantine isn&#x27;t mentioned until the last page. Really, it&#x27;s just sloppily written, perhaps intentionally so - so that the legislator can prove to his constituents that he&#x27;s doing something while on their dime.')
