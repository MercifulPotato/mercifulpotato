Which is why I wrote a utility to allow writing scripts in-between pipes [1].<p>The basic idea is to call this tool anytime you would be setting up a complex chain of unix pipes, and instead do the scripting in a an interactive environment that allows you to see output as you type. It&#x27;s just a toy implementation right now and only supports python, but could eventually support any scripting environment (even bash).<p>I don&#x27;t really see this as a serious tool, but it can be useful for the odd shell job. Or just for those who like immediate evaluation on every key stroke ;)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CalebJohn&#x2F;shell-coupler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CalebJohn&#x2F;shell-coupler</a>')
