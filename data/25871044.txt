Because we did not want more people to move to CentOS 8 during the holidays. The programs weren&#x27;t ready and we felt it was important to get the CentOS Linux announcement out as soon as possible. We had many long discussions about this in the Red Hat internal memolist when CentOS news were announced. Please search the internet for Red Hat&#x27;s memolist. It takes a lot of time to come up with free programs like this, thats the simple truth. You can choose not to believe this and wait for few years to see how these turns out. It is not about immediate revenue growth but how to make RHEL evolve as the next generation OS. If RHEL does not change it will be become obsolete sooner or later.')
