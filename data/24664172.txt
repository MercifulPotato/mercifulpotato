You might want to explain it a bit more in the README.<p>For example, taking this line from the first example:<p><pre><code>    this.peek = +(this.a: this.b:)\n</code></pre>\nIf I replace this by:<p><pre><code>    this.peek = +(this.a: this.b:\n</code></pre>\n(note the dropped closing parenthesis) and leave everything else as is, that will not be a syntax error?<p>I know that Forth is &quot;loose syntax&quot; in that Forth code is just a sequence of white-space separated words, so your comment and mine are both syntactically valid Forth, but without meaningful semantics. But Forth does <i>not</i> use parenthesized function calls the way Copper does.')
