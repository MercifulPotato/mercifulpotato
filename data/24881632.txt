Aka how many people are within 1 mile of each other on average.<p>As such nationwide population density isn’t that important, but local population density can be a very useful metric.  Norway has 5,432,580 people and Óslo Norway is by far the the most populous city has 952,000 people or 17.5% of the population in the urban area at 8,500&#x2F;square mile.<p>London has 8,961,989 people out of 63,182,000 (14.2%) in the Uk at 14,670&#x2F;sq mile.  And Birmingham at 1,141,816 people at 11,040&#x2F;sq mi and you see the UK might have similar rates of urbanization, but it’s significantly more densely packed.<p>As to Stockholm Sweden, again the largest city out of 10,367,232 people in Sweden  1,605,030 million (15.5%), are living at 11,000&#x2F;sq mi.<p>Of course this is still just an approximation.  1,000 people in a single apartment building sharing elevators adds a risk of transmission those same people living in duplex housing doesn’t.')
