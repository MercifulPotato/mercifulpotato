Certificate Authorities that doesn&#x27;t prove much, because after all you <i>could</i> manually cause issuance of anything. But the fun thing about Let&#x27;s Encrypt is they&#x27;ve insisted almost to a fault upon only using their ACME API. After all, if you really believe in everybody else using automation it&#x27;s hypocritical to have manual systems for your own stuff.<p>[ I say almost to a fault because there can be situations where for compliance you need to demonstrate something and it seemed (I may be wrong and Seth will correct me) as though Let&#x27;s Encrypt always chose to just let nature take its course instead. Want to see an expired certificate? We&#x27;ll put one of our auto-generated certificates on a server, and then just wait ninety days for it to expire. ]<p>So as a result helloworld.letsencrypt.org isn&#x27;t just a proof that they could issue such certificates, it means logically that&#x27;s what all the certificates looked like at that time.')
