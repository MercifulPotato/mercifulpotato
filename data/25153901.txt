As a simple example, suppose you find that the death rate for people 0-64 is X% and 65+ is Y% in 2019.<p>These rates change in 2020, but the proportion of the population in these age groups changes, too. So you set a baseline proportion (maybe equal to 2019), compute the per-age-group death rates in 2020, and rescale the total death rate so that the age proportions are the same as the 2019 baseline.<p>The ultimate goal is to correct for the effects of changing age demographics in computing the death rate. You&#x27;d use it if want to look at changes that are corrected for, for example, the population as a whole aging.')
