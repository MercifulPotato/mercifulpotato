And from there everything goes down the hill. Here are some facts to navigate easier this subject:<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; Anger is a primary emotion; its opposite is Fear.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; Ager is triggered by &quot;an obstacle to the satisfaction of needs&quot; - not feeling Anger when you encounter an obstacle is problematic, your chances of survival decrease.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; we experience Anger in many forms, depending on intensity - from mild annoyance to red hot rage<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; the behavioural response to Anger can be productive or not for us: if you hit back the table corner you just hit, there is nothing productive in that<p>&#x2F;&#x2F;&gt; the big problem with Anger is the type of behavioural response we use: intrinsic&#x2F;instinctual - that is usually violent - or intentional - such as setting limits, being firm, withdrawing, etc.<p>The whole point of justice in society stems from this intentional management of Anger at scale.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s disappointing to see a psychology subject tackled by a philosopher where from the first sentences is clear that they are not familiar with the subject. But that doesn&#x27;t stop them from talking about it. But I guess knowing something and thinking that you know something feels the same.')
