And then Android code is in Java + Rust. On the server&#x2F;web side, we use Go to process the data and TypeScript for the web app.<p>We&#x27;re looking for one more engineer with deep knowledge of iOS to help us continue iterating and improving.<p>As one of my co-workers put it:<p>&gt; Work on state-of-the-art recording of iOS apps to provide a rich, privacy-respecting analytics experience. Reverse engineer iOS frameworks to learn how they work and how they can be used efficiently. Use low level capabilities of the Objective-C runtime to solve problems unique to iOS.<p>You can also see our team manager&#x27;s post from a couple of months back for another take on things: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24969524" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24969524</a><p>I&#x27;m one of the engineers on the team; if you have any question, feel free to comment here or email me directly: nathan@[company site]. If you&#x27;d just like to apply, please use the link below.<p>The company as a whole is awesome. Hands-down my favorite job in my ~15 year career. Smart, humble people. A focus on empathy, clarity, and &quot;bionics&quot; (e.g. automation, but more than just that). Competitive pay[1], and solid benefits (Anthem insurance, Vanguard 401k, etc.) paired with a great work-life balance. And more than just &quot;remote friendly&quot;, FullStory strives to be &quot;remote equal&quot;. (We were about 20% remote last year, it&#x27;s more like 80-90% now.)

I made about double that TC at my last job, but I&#x27;m so much happier here.<p>We also have quite a few other roles open in IT, Design, Finance, Legal, Marketing, Recruiting, Engineering, Product Management, and Sales.
