It was replaced by renewables. (This was super-stupid since we have a stable government, no enemies close by and basically no natural disasters [0] that would threaten our power plants.) We should have shut down coal plants instead but dwelling on what we should have done does not help. The bright side of this is that our emissions are decreasing <i>despite</i> still running coal plants. Once we shut these down, they will drop even more and this hopefully as early as possible. I hope it is going happen because of economic reasons, i.e. when coal becomes too expensive compared to other sources of energy because that would mean it would already happen before the scheduled phase-out.<p>[0] If you are from elsewhere in the world, it might be hard to imagine how few threats of natural disasters we have in central Europe: there are basically no earthquakes, no tsunamis, no bush fires, no (real) hurricans (we call them &#x27;storms&#x27;), no real tornadoes (it is such a rare thing that it usually makes it to national news if there is one), no (terrible) floods (well, every few decades there is a large flood somewhere here but that&#x27;s it).')
