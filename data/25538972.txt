You stream games, and yet you have to... <i>buy</i> them?<p>There are some free games included, of course, but I didn&#x27;t find anything I was interested in playing there.<p>What I want is something like Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass, where you pay a fixed price per month to play the full library of games, with nothing else on top of that. A Netflix for games, if you will. I don&#x27;t want to shell out $60 for Cyberpunk 2077.<p>(The absence of an easy way to trial games on consoles is problematic, in my opinion. I purchased Cyberpunk on my Xbox One before I realized how bad it performs on that console, and fortunately I was able to get a refund.)<p>Unfortunately, Xbox Game Pass is predictably hobbled by a very limited library (and they keep removing good stuff), and the fact that the games are tied to the platform they&#x27;ve been developed for.<p>What I&#x27;d like is basically Game Pass + Stadia.')
