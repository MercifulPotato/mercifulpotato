Epidemiologists probably don&#x27;t know the English-Chinese translation for the million species in China.<p>This is not really spoofing, this is just plain fraud, right?<p>When they fill papers full of jargon, data that doesn&#x27;t make sense, crazy political posturing so that the paper reads as something fantastical - and it gets by - that&#x27;s a problem.<p>But this seems to be merely a real concern that it&#x27;s quite a bit of work to reproduce scientific results and that someone doing a quick review of a paper has no material way of validating &#x27;everything&#x27;.<p>The paper &#x27;looked promising&#x27; because it was promising, assuming those sending it in weren&#x27;t completely making everything up.<p>You could make a fake passport that might fool a lot of people, that doesn&#x27;t mean the system is broken.<p>Science maybe has problems but I&#x27;m not sure this one strikes at it very well.')
