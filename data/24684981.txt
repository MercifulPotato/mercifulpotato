Thanks for not going there, I appreciate it.<p>I&#x27;m someone who enjoys riding a motorcycle fast (on a racetrack, wearing leathers, because I don&#x27;t want to die and because I like tickets). I can tell you that I very much wish my bike was quieter, even silent. I hate that it bothers the neighbors when I start it early in the morning on a weekend, I hate that it annoys others when I ride on the street.<p>I used to think the noise was part of what made it fun or cool, now I think it&#x27;s just an unfortunate side effect of one the things that make it fun and cool[0]. Unfortunately electric motorcycles have too many downsides right now to be a viable alternative.')
