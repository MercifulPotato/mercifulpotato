Item(by='theptip', descendants=None, kids=[25924051], score=None, time=1611718564, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920770, text='Agreed, this is the problem with Gitlab&#x27;s bloat; the more features they add, the harder it is to justify a cheap price-point like the old $5&#x2F;month -- and everybody&#x27;s idea of what should go into the $20&#x2F;month tier is going to be different. You can&#x27;t disaggregate the offerings to pay for just the pieces you are interested in.<p>If they are focusing more on the Enterprise side of things, I could see it being a good idea for them to split out the licensing and billing for different offerings; see Datadog for an example of the opposite extreme, where every service is optional, and you pay (handsomely) for whatever you use.<p>If Gitlab split their offerings into a few packages, say $10&#x2F;mo for k8s integration, $10&#x2F;mo for security, $10&#x2F;mo for the Jira replacement that I&#x27;ve never touched, and so on, they could potentially get more stickiness - users would be using the top-tier functionality for the modules that they care about, instead of missing a few killer features that are stashed away in the gold tier. I&#x27;m not paying $100&#x2F;mo for a Gitlab seat, but I would have considered $20-30&#x2F;mo extra for the k8s&#x2F;prometheus CD integration without having to pay for all the rest of the top-tier features I&#x27;m not interested in.<p>This might help Gitlab to focus a bit more, too, as they would be able to see exactly what product lines are bringing in the most revenue, and focus on making those better.')
