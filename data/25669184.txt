We know what the options are, we know what the trade-offs are, we can make guesses on what we think the impacts will be. It&#x27;s a &quot;known known&quot; problem, with usually enough time to research it fully. Implementing it properly can be difficult, but that&#x27;s the kind of thing that can be iterated if necessary - we don&#x27;t have to get that right first time.<p>There are lots of management and people problems where none of this is true and it&#x27;s very much a &quot;known unknown&quot; that has to be got right on the first try, without knowing all the possible tradeoffs or consequences, and under time pressure.')
