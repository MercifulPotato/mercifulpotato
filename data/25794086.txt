The same is true, although with decreasing necessity, in more localized communities.<p>Facebook and Twitter have massively altered the way that people engage with other people, businesses, even the government. They took public discourse and monetized it. That&#x27;s fine, but they now have to deal with the implications of being the keepers of public discourse, and I think a reasonable stipulation for allowing them to monetize that is that they cannot bar someone from participating without a very good justification that isn&#x27;t &quot;lol our ToS allows us to cut you off whenever we want, and take your first born child&quot;.<p>&gt; speaking economically when these large platforms boot people off it actually increases competition and decreases their dominance because it creates a market opportunity for competitors, exactly like what happened with Parler. Suddenly, nobody seems to care that a conservative competitor to AWS is getting a huge account, shouldn&#x27;t that be pereceived as a good thing?<p>Sure, and what happened to them? It&#x27;s a little ironic to argue that booting people off of their platform increases competition and then mention their new competitor that was immediately wiped off the face of the internet.<p>I think Parler attracted a lot of extremists. That&#x27;s partially their own fault with their poor moderation, but it&#x27;s also a reflection that Twitter has so dominated the marketplace that your only customers as a new social media site are going to be nutjobs. It has strong anti-competitive effects. The community is a huge part of a social media site. Crazy users poison the community, ensuring that the brand is tainted and not a threat to Twitter.<p>&gt; Why are the people who get banned so insistent on using services they claim are inherently unfair to them? Why not support companies that share your values?<p>Because you&#x27;d be better off writing it on bathroom stalls.<p>Because there is no meaningful competitor. Even Parler was tiny by social media standards, and it&#x27;s probably dead now.<p>Because your friends and family want to use Twitter, and probably won&#x27;t switch, so you have to use Twitter and Facebook.<p>Because Facebook and Twitter have spent so long maximizing engagement that people barely bother looking for other sources of news and information.<p>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Parler or the way it was run.  It does seem damning that the only app that threatened to take some of Twitter&#x27;s market share was immediately scrubbed off the internet. I don&#x27;t think ISIS material gets completely wiped off the face of the internet that fast.')
