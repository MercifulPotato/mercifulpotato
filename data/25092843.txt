It&#x27;s a double edge sword; it&#x27;s easier to get hired at places that really push the edge and want really motivated people. But not having more than 3 years at a single place does make it difficult when trying to find new jobs. At the same time, I&#x27;m paid at market value, where if I stayed at one place 10 years, I&#x27;d likely be at least 1&#x2F;3 under market.')
