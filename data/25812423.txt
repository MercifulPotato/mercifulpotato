Then take the wholesalers (Equinix, Digital Realty, etc) - some of who count some cloud vendors as customers. Then take tens of thousand of collocation and dedicated providers that own their own data centers (PhoenixNap, HE, OVH, Hetzner, Softlayer, ...). Then take the VPS providers (Linode, DO, Vultr, ....). Then take the shared hosting (GoDaddy, ..). Then take the government agencies and companies that have their own private data centers (e.g, banks).<p>Cloud vendors are growing, but it&#x27;s still a very small part of the market. What they&#x27;re really good at is sales and marketing (and making much better margins.)')
