Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[24760696], score=None, time=1602540872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759575, text='&gt; your style of argument comes across to me as deep diving on points where you can be correct, or changing the subject.<p>There&#x27;s only so much that can be said in a HN comment. I&#x27;m trying to avoid writing a whole treatise.<p>&gt; Stage fright is real, and it is unavoidable in an interview i.e. even if coding quizzes were removed then the problem still exists, so arguing just against quizzes is silly IMHO.<p>The conclusion doesn&#x27;t follow. The problem still exists, yes, but I think everyone would acknowledge that casual chatting is easier than coding quizzes? Thus, if you tend to experience performance anxiety, then tasks that are more difficult to perform are more strongly negatively affected by performance anxiety. Compare with other issues that affect performance, e.g., drunkenness. Being drunk will affect your speech, but it <i>severely</i> affects your ability to more complex tasks such as driving a car.<p>&gt; Interviews are by definition systematically discriminatory: one is trying to select one person.<p>That&#x27;s not what systematic discrimination means. It means discriminating against a certain class of people who all share the same characteristic. Some examples are gender, race, and age, but that&#x27;s not an exhaustive list.<p>&gt; You have not suggested any improvement that detects incompetence.<p>I fundamentally disagree that this should be the main purpose and focus of hiring and interviews. I think rampant, exaggerated paranoia is one of the reasons that tech hiring is so messed up. The irrational fear of the &quot;bad hire&quot;. Few other industries are so afraid of this. The reality is that it&#x27;s impossible to avoid bad hires, and trying to be perfect in this respect will distort the whole process. Professional sports spend vastly more time and money on talent evaluation and acquisition than tech, but still they make &quot;bad hires&quot; all the time. Wasted #1 draft picks. Multi-million-dollar contracts for busts. It&#x27;s just expected, a cost of doing business. They shrug it off and move on, and keep making mistakes too, because perfection is unattainable.<p>&quot;How can we drop coding tests... while still being ultra-paranoid?&quot; is not a question I can answer. My answer is to not be so paranoid, and just accept the inevitable mistakes, a more relaxed process which also allows you to find the &quot;diamonds in the rough&quot;.<p>&gt; I can also cherry pick a quote further up-thread: “To many people, the coding interviews is a chance to break the traditional mold and land a job that would have been out of reach otherwise.”<p>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s cherry picking to restate the original context into which I first replied in this thread. In any case, I already replied to that quote too.')
