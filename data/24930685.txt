The team is 4 65+ year olds, a 25 year old and me at 31 (there have been some younger interns too.) The 65+ crowd don&#x27;t care to learn new things (ie git, using json with javascript, ORM frameworks, any type of bash commands) they&#x27;re just skating into retirement copying&#x2F;pasting the same train of thought for the past decade.
