The thought that games can only be fun is a relic from video games&#x27;s infancy stage much the same as once upon a time when films&#x2F;movies were new and there were only short slapstick flicks. The medium film matured to where a film can be about utterly horrible things&#x2F;ideas but it&#x27;s still seen as a good piece of media because it was &quot;engaging&quot; on some level.')
