First play-through was main quests only basically, second is a few main and then every single non-main quest I can get at and only then main quests. It is <i>by far</i> the best made open-world game I have ever played and while there are a lot of bugs it is nowhere near &quot;Bethesda level buginess&quot;. Fallout and Elder scrolls -some of my favorite games- was worse than this even after the first 5-10 updates, since at least 90% of the bugs I saw was game breaking, same-game-corrupting or crash-to-desktop stuff.<p>I have had zero crashes and zero bugs that required me to reload. 100% of bugs have been cars floating a few centimeter above ground, a weapon falling a few centimeters below ground (but I can still pick it up), the GPS not taking the fastest route, etc. Basically not a single bug that is cause for all the yelling and shouting I&#x27;m seeing. In a few patches it is everything GTA could only dream of and I&#x27;m sure this will be a cash-cow. A cash-cow for the only anti-DRM and customer-friendly big developer out there is a huge win.<p>That I can play it at high settings (using Digital Foundry&#x27;s recommended settings) at my not at all brand new PC is just icing on the cake.')
