I think news like this might also encourage more people to program encrypted messaging and file transfer applications. I mean, who in here hasn&#x27;t at least made a small cryptographic test with widely known libraries? The irony is that the more technology like this is outlawed, the more valuable it becomes to those who might find it useful, the flipside being that the less encrypted traffic there is, the easier it becomes to find those who use it. The only antidote to that, is more encrytped traffic.')
