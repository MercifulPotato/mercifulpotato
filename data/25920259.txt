It&#x27;s difficult to explore using languages requiring a lot of ceremony.<p>But then, that&#x27;s when the time and funding constraints come in and prevent rewriting in more type sound languages. Which is why we end up with buggy python (if speed not an issue) or buggy C (if speed is an issue).<p>There are alternate paths. For example, APL tries to be terse enough that you can have the whole thing on a single screen. That&#x27;s another attempt at bug prevention.<p>For example, I do my data wrangling in J.')
