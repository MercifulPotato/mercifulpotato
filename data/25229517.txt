For example, if I rejected english and made my own language that would probably be a long-shot. For a while, I wasn&#x27;t interested in using math formulas until I could prove them, in hindsight maybe I&#x27;d say spend that energy getting better at people skills.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find 90% of things are done the right way, and if you deviate you&#x27;re probably doing worse for it.
