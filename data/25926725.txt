Native Slack is pretty good. Web Google Docs&#x2F;Sheets is pretty good. VSCode is almost the same regardless of where you run it. But equally, Sketch and Ableton Live are also pretty good. Native Teams and Zoom are travesties of usability and stability.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t see consistent patterns of good or bad between web and native apps to justify your comment that &quot;apps are better at being apps than a web browser&quot;.<p>Most GUI apps, native or otherwise, get associated with a brand. Especially the good ones. I&#x27;d buy Ableton swag, I love the brand that much.<p>The VAST bulk of web apps are NOT browser version specific. It&#x27;s largely only bespoke, internal corporate apps that are tied to one version of a browser.')
