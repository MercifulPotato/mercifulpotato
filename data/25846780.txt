When I first encountered 0-based languages, I was annoyed by them, especially because I knew how Fortran compilers are implemented and I was familiar with all the tricks that are used by compilers to minimize the extra operations that are required to work with 1-based arrays.<p>So my initial naive thought was that maybe the implementers of C were not competent enough. However, after many extra years of experience, I believe that all the tricks for the efficient implementation of 1-based arrays are not worthwhile, because even for programmers it is more efficient to think using 0-based indices.<p>So now I really consider 0, 1, 2, 3 ... as a more &quot;natural&quot; counting sequence, unlike when I was a child.')
