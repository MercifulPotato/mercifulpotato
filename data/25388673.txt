I&#x27;ve noticed it too, and it reminds me of nothing more than Android-Apple threads in the early 2010s.<p>I doubt this is a complete explanation, but a lot of the nonsensical comments I&#x27;ve seen come from Firefox fans who can&#x27;t deal with a browser neutralizing one of the most compelling arguments against Chrome (privacy), so they have to pretend that Brave&#x27;s odd business model (which is totally worthy of criticism!) has flaws that it doesn&#x27;t, particularly as experienced by the user.')
