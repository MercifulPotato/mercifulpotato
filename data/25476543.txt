If anything, the PhD is a direct career boost: it&#x27;s a recognised, high-level qualification that is known the world over (and, incidentally, if you go outside the US, you can probably get it done an awful lot quicker...). If you love the subject -- and you <i>have</i> to love the subject -- do it. It&#x27;s like being paid to play.<p>Going from PhD to Prof though, is a difficult, unlikely path of awkward postings: for every 100 PhDs expect ~1 successful academic. Oh, and once you <i>are</i> a professor, expect a salary....less than that you&#x27;d get in a starting job straight out of your PhD.')
