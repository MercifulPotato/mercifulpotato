It didn&#x27;t have\nto be this way! There are great low-to-no-code tools that have much more usable interfaces, like Scratch.<p>I had no idea what Duplos was so I had to Google it, but I can&#x27;t imagine that for a complete non-programmer, the Scratch UI would be more clear than littler sticking giant building blocks together without issue. It sounds like the author simply fell out\nof the target market for IFTTT, rather than IFTTT becoming _worse_.<p>FWIW, that Scratch UI screenshot was so hard to mentally parse. I would not expect a non-programmer to look at that and feel more secure in their understanding of the product at all.')
