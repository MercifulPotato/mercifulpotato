This meant that their memory fabs were practically free (i.e. they were building them for CPU business anyway), which helped them compete on price in memory.<p>I&#x27;m sure they still find some use for their no-longer-brand-new fabs, but this kind of examination of each business line in isolation doesn&#x27;t take into account synergies like that.  I can easily imagine Intel doing one &quot;makes good business sense&quot; decision after another, until they are no longer able to manufacture competitively at all.<p>Oh, wait, maybe that already happened a couple years ago...')
