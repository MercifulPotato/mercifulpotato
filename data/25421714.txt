Including stuff like &quot;don&#x27;t rely on hydraulics: use jackstands.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d advise finding one, even if it&#x27;s for the wrong car, since a lot of the basic stuff is the same. I started with that, a Haynes manual, and then found the complete Factory Service Manual for sale somewhere.<p>BTW: I have a set of 25+ year-old Harbor Freight jackstands that are fine. The bad ones IIRC, are from a specific batch a few years ago.<p>A long time ago I realized that the main difference between professional mechanics and myself is that they had the experience to (usually?) get something right the first time and the knowledge to do some things faster. But there&#x27;s nothing they know that I can&#x27;t learn; it&#x27;ll just take me longer.<p>The first time I needed to change a flat, I had to ask for help because I had absolutely no idea what to do.
