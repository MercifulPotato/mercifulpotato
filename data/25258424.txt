Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606767530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258253, text='&gt; iMacs are only an option if you want the monitor Apple happens to have paired with it, and that monitor addition isn&#x27;t cheap, either. The Mini is still the only non-ridiculously priced &quot;desktop&quot; that Apple offers.<p>I agree! (well mostly) That&#x27;s why I said Apple has a giant hole in the middle of their desktop lineup!<p>For a machine that has a really good quality 5k display integrated, the iMac is a well priced system. If you don&#x27;t want that 5k display, you fall into that giant hole I talked about.<p>IMO the big problem with Apple&#x27;s lineup for some time isn&#x27;t the price on the things they sell, it&#x27;s the fairly big holes in between those products. So you end up<p>&gt; But I think the OP was referring to the stagnation of the general desktop space<p>Looking back, it does make sense that way.<p>I expect this will shake things up a bit.')
