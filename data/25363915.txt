Doing that is a choice; there are other measures they could&#x27;ve taken to improve privacy to the same level while keeping granular blocking intact.<p>For example, they could have chosen a system where privacy-sensitive information like visited URLs are fed into a part of the extension which is a side-effect free function returning limited information. As they already have capability-based extension permissions, this would not be terribly hard to add <i>if</i> they would set their mind to it.<p>More manual reviewing of valuable extensions would also be a path. They don&#x27;t need to allow all extensions this permissions, and there doesn&#x27;t need to be a level playing field for extensions here. It&#x27;s just that Google doesn&#x27;t see effective ad blocking as valuable, but rather the opposite.')
