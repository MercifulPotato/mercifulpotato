This spiked a fear of fascism growing in America.<p>In response instead of addressing this growing anti-american anti-democratic minority, instead the news decided to associate anti-fascism with riots, protestors, and other scary negative fear based topics.  Now the second anyone raises a concern about fascism, supporters will unconsciously turn a blind eye.  I&#x27;m surprised such word smithing like that works, and frankly I&#x27;m scared it does work. I&#x27;m terrified that different conservative groups rallied behind not only fascist movements, but invented a boogyman term for it like antifa as a way to make the topic of fascism partisan and questionable. If that&#x27;s not anti-democratic and unamerican I don&#x27;t know what is.')
