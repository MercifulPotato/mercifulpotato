A third party then came along and asked users for the information which their friends gave them access to. The users gave the third party the data.<p>I&#x27;m not missing anything here, right?<p>If the third party should not have access to the data, then neither should the friends who gave it to them. Facebook is responsible for allowing the users access to the data.<p>If users <i>should</i> have access to the data, then it&#x27;s the friends&#x27; fault for agreeing to be Facebook friends with those users in the first place.  Alternatively, it&#x27;s Facebooks fault for not making it clear what data is made available to friends.<p>Either way, I don&#x27;t see how this is a problem with thr research group.<p>I guess you could argue that the data was still technically owned by the friends and therefore the users had no right to give it away. In which case the fault belongs to the users.')
