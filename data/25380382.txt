I already incurred around $100 fee. I imagine if I made some looping&#x2F;recursion bug I could&#x27;ve easily incurred a cost of $10,000 or frankly, infinite cost. How easy would it have been for me to get this pardoned? And at the very moment I would discover that I just lost $100,000 - would I know in advance that they are definitely going to forgive this because I&#x27;d be full panic mode? It was very scary for me to use cloud in this case.<p>I didn&#x27;t even have any customers at that point.')
