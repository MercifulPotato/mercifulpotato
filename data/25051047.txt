I used to do a lot of Cadence Virtuoso work in Windows (now I&#x27;ve moved to Linux) but that fact that is was running on Windows only mattered once, when I setup the tool.   From then on I was full screen in the CAD tool and my day to day was basically identical to my flow now.   I imagine for a lot of professionals, like myself, it&#x27;s the application suite that matters, not the OS.')
