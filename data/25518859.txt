Most talk up the merits of their work and the general importance of their field.  The idea&#x27;s to be constructive, always looking for avenues of improvement.  For example, if you test a new medical treatment and it&#x27;s not great, you don&#x27;t trash it as a failure but rather focus on how it can be improved to get more positive results.<p>Though I&#x27;m starting to get the impression that you&#x27;re reading &quot;<i>striking a positive tone</i>&quot; as meaning something other than what I&#x27;m seeing in those words.  So to avoid talking past each other, what exactly are you seeing?  And do you find it somehow problematic?')
