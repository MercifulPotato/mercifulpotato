A, B, then C if D is okay and humane. It is weak base libraries that expose and require you to control the irrelevant junk have to improve&#x2F;vanish. Your basic app, be it web, desktop or mobile, is full of bs and boilerplate of methodologies (not even of just code) to the level that one has to <i>learn</i> to create cruds and component designs. You create and secure endpoints, validate dtos, etc over and over again. For what? Why not have an orm&#x2F;db system that easily spans server, client and b2b? Why not have a default global message bus that connects directly to user? And so on, depending on business requirements.<p>Instead we have to spend a week or more to learn and remember how e.g. to make “webpush” work and how to serialize an xhr form. Meanwhile our libraries brag about yet another cross-platform #flatten() crap that helps no one but those who dig into this bs deeper than their peers to call themselves a senior. Of course normal people consider <i>that</i> hard, as we wallow in this madness and try to look smart.')
