We have build profiles for various system configurations that are entirely reproducible on a binary level. It made sense since we have many similar or identical systems globally and need access to the latest kernel versions.<p>I installed it on all my personal systems to force myself to learn how to use it. I ran Arch on everything previously. Then I went and did something stupid - I fell in love with Gentoo&#x27;s package management system. As someone who writes a lot of code on my own time as well, I found Gentoo&#x27;s package manager (portage) to be the least headache inducing of all the ones I&#x27;d used (deb, rpm, PKGBUILD). This is my own subjective opinion obviously.')
