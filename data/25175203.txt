There are plenty of pieces that demand the player move their hand pretty far without much opportunity to feel for placement. Eric Satie&#x27;s Gymnopedie No.1 comes to mind. I find that fixed seating tends to make this a non-issue.<p>Even so, we could add nubs. There isn&#x27;t a law against it.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a feature not a bug that a b minor feels different in my hand than an a minor<p>But <i>should</i> it? After all, they are both the same Aeolian mode. They sound the same, excepting only that they are in different keys. Shouldn&#x27;t they feel that way, too?<p>&gt; Makes it easier to look over one&#x27;s shoulder and know exactly what chord they&#x27;re playing too!<p>Does it?<p>It&#x27;s pretty trivial to tell what chord a guitar player is playing, even if it&#x27;s a bar. I don&#x27;t see any reason it would be more difficult with a homogeneous piano&#x2F;keyboard layout.')
