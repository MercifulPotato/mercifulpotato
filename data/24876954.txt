Works like google music did, has android auto, sonos integrations, works from a browser, all the things. Except now I can keep everything in flac, stream on the LAN in lossless, and transcode to whatever while I&#x27;m away from home.<p>The most annoying part is I&#x27;ve had to start buying CDs again for obscure stuff that I can&#x27;t find online in a lossless format. But they&#x27;re easy enough to rip and throw in the music folder for plex.')
