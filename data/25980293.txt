Yes, it shows why they still had the ability to execute Sells. But the question most people have is: If you are forced to halt Buys, isn&#x27;t it fairest to also halt Sells?<p>Now, I can see the counterargument: if you halt Sells, you are effectively preventing people from withdrawing their money from Robinhood. But, by allowing Sells (which are being bought by another party somewhere) you likely to influence the price, and you&#x27;re putting your customers in a strange position relative to clients of other institutions who can still buy, and indeed, buy from Robinhood customers. I still haven&#x27;t seen this question properly addressed. What are the precedents? When forced to restrict trading because of regulatory obligations in the past, has the normal response been to halt all trading or only one side?')
