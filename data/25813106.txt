I love Emacs, the uniform keybindings and especially Magit, I thought I could never use anything else until I started working with TypeScript React in my current job, which Emacs has very bad support for.<p>The funny thing is: I don&#x27;t even consider VSCode a superior text editor, it&#x27;s just that Emacs is _so slow_. I used Emacs back then because compared to many other editors and IDE it allowed me to work faster, but VSCode despite all its shortcomings has done the very same thing Emacs did for me previously.<p>I still use Emacs every day at work just for Magit, but whenever Emacs freeze just for a few seconds every time I perform a big merge I just feel like finishing up the task in VSCode')
