Blinding a million children wouldn&#x27;t go from unacceptable to acceptable just because the level of insects swarming around a restaurant increased by a factor of 10.  The harm stands alone, and there is a level of harm which could not be justified by <i>any</i> amount of boring spambot influx.')
