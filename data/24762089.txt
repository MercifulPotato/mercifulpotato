That doesn&#x27;t mean the CAD isn&#x27;t riddled with errors.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in traditional construction and the plans are never accurate with hundreds of omissions&#x2F;errors&#x2F;interferences. Those can be corrected in real time when something is field built, but are nearly impossible when the house ships wrong but nearly finished.<p>I can see it working with cookie cutter housing - first ~5 will be garbage as they find bugs then slap a thousand identical copies up cheaply. For custom it&#x27;s a mess.')
