Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=[25787153], score=None, time=1610684621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785367, text='The intercept can decline to publish, that&#x27;s their right. Greenwald had a contract where if they did decline a piece he could publish elswhere, that was his contractual right. He insisted on it as a founder so that he could not be silenced by an editorial board. Great. They don&#x27;t want it, he publishes elsewhere life goes on.<p>But that didn&#x27;t happen. They wanted to supress it. They tried to stop Greenwald from publishing it everywhere. He thinks the editors of the interecept did this because they had preferences on who should win the then upcoming US presidential election. I&#x27;m inclined to agree with him when you look at the correspondance. It&#x27;s all been published by Greenwald at substack. His approach and his responnse all look extremely reasonable to me.<p>&gt; but it still makes him a bitter man who can&#x27;t handle the hit to his ego.<p>Can&#x27;t disagree with that take on it enough. Makes him look like he has principles that he stands up for, to me. Indeed precisely that reputation is what got him the scoops and all those Journalism awards like say, the Pulitzer Prize.')
