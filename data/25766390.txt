Your startup is your baby. It&#x27;s fun. It&#x27;s challenging. It&#x27;s rewarding.<p>And when you&#x27;re young I think it&#x27;s great to dedicate to work. You accelerate your learning. You make more money. You meet smart people. I don&#x27;t know anyone very knowledgeable and skilled for their age that did a work&#x2F;life balance route.<p>If you are a workaholic but <i>also</i> a learnaholic, then I don&#x27;t buy that as this toxic thing that can drive mental and physical health issues. Ok, maybe sleep issues.<p>I have a few businesses and I&#x27;d rather work on them than spend time on social media like my non-workaholic friends.<p>It&#x27;s ok for people to say &quot;you work too much&quot;, but I don&#x27;t tell my friends &quot;you spend too much time on Facebook&quot;. Maybe I should though?<p>I do agree that it can be a big problem though. Many dedicate themselves to their work because they are escaping something or avoiding other important obligations.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t apply, then go get it!<p>Life is a hell of a lot more enjoyable when you don&#x27;t have to worry about finances.<p>My parents told me &quot;you care too much about money&quot;. No I care infinitely about NOT worrying about money. There&#x27;s a difference.<p>You can care about money a lot, be focused on financial freedom and not be a Scrooge and accumulating for no reason.')
