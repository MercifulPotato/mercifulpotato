Wouldn&#x27;t the perfect framework&#x2F;language make it hard[er] to screw things up regardless of the lack of dev skill?  For a big multi-year project it often strikes me that the best tools are those which are old, boring, and unlikely to change.<p>That being said, huge-multi-year development in _any_ js framework seems terrifying to me because of the churn in the general js&#x2F;browser environment.<p>Also: I think the author doesn&#x27;t cover this a lot, but it sounds like they REALLY saved their bacon by doing the boring due-diligence of carefully documenting the decision process behind all the choices they made.  They probably would have had slowdowns and surprises and roadblocks no matter what, but someone&#x27;s still got a job because they took time to get it in writing.')
