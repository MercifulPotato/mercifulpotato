For those that don’t know, 1971 was when the gold standard was abandoned by Nixon.  I don’t know if the graphs are cherry-picked and I hope they were honestly since the US is never going back to the gold standard and it seems to have far-reaching negative effects in every aspect of human life.<p>To answer your .25 cent milk question it seems to have not been a problem in history and health of the country before 1971.  The profits and benefits of the rapidly growing economy have pretty much all gone to the ultra wealthy that are nearest to and in control of the money printer.')
