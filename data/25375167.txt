If there&#x27;s a double-vote detected, they pull that envelope to the side to investigate more, before they open it and count the vote.<p>Also, I really think you don&#x27;t get the point of my first question to you.<p>How many false positives and false negatives do you think signature analysis would result in?<p>Because if you&#x27;re trying to detect a fraudulent signature, and you have false positives, and you then don&#x27;t count that vote, you have disenfranchised someone.<p>Perhaps you just mean that those envelopes should be pulled aside, and the state should go and track down the person and ask them if its really their signature?')
