They are back up now.<p>As far as working &quot;fine&quot; offline, I have another gripe about my Nest thermostats:  Why is the sample rate on the temperature so damn slow?  One of my zones is a small (~500 sq&#x2F;ft) room and the HVAC can move the temperature there rather quickly.  What always happens is the heat&#x2F;cool usually stays on well beyond the desired set point.  This is because the device does not sample the temperature often enough.  If the mode is set to heat &amp; cool, the heat and AC will both oscillate on and off forever unless the min and max are more than 5 degrees apart.  It&#x27;s not a matter of the Nest sensor lagging because of its heat capacity because I have tried a heat gun and freeze spray to observe the sample rate.  It really sucks.')
