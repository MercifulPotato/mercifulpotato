Read this:<p><pre><code>  Hey.\n</code></pre>\nOr this exchange:<p><pre><code>  Statement: We got the tickets for tonight!\n  Response: Yay.\n</code></pre>\nIt comes off as very flat or dry. Unenthused. A plain &quot;Yay&quot; with no punctuation would be better here. I wonder if this is the context that we&#x27;re missing and others aren&#x27;t providing, because I almost <i>always</i> use punctuation, including periods, in my messages. No one has ever complained. But with short messages, like these, I would never use a period. For full sentences, however, I can&#x27;t think of any occasion outside being rushed where I wouldn&#x27;t end it with a period.')
