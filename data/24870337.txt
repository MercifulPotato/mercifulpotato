Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603466111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869389, text='&quot;The Cold Equations&quot; is pretty much the sole story on a list of SF shorts I&#x27;m finishing writing up that I don&#x27;t actually like and am pretty much just including because it&#x27;s on so many lists--possibly for the same reason :-)<p>And not only is it completely unrealistic in order to make the point of the title but everything about the characters is so 1950s feeling that it feels incredibly dated.')
