Plentyâ„¢, for example, does arugula and kale, but their stories say &quot;veggies&quot; in a way that leads you to believe it&#x27;s working for a much broader set of &quot;veggies&quot;.<p>Verticalfield, featured in this story, has pictures of tomatoes, and mentions mushrooms and strawberries.  But on their website, the FAQ says &quot;<i>&quot;Vertical Field can grow up to 200 varieties of crops, such as leafy greens, herbs, and lettuces&quot;</i>.  Again, arugula, kale, some herbs, etc.')
