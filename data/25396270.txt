If this organization is so smart and right, they should have no trouble finding a way to convince people without coercion<p>Even, if they are smarter than me, are they perfect? Is it impossible for them to be wrong? Of course not. That&#x27;s why we need multiple sources. Nobody is right about everything all the time. All of this talk about &quot;misinformation&quot; ignores the possibility that <i>you</i> might one day be a source of misinformation, so it is vitally important that people be able to disagree with you.')
