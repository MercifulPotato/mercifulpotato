You don&#x27;t need to be as heavy handed as &quot;community voting&quot;, you could just have each client nominate a moderator who is able to append instructions to ignore content that the client would follow.<p>Under this model, every user (or project) can choose their own moderators, which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about other parts of the community having different ideas for ideal moderation - each project&#x2F;user can subscribe to the moderation feeds that they like, and ensure that they get a clean experience.<p>This type of moderation is actually an upgrade from centralized systems, because it is much easier to nominate new moderators if you don&#x27;t like what the old moderators are doing.')
