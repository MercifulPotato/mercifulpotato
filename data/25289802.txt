On the &quot;battle-tested&quot; note in particular, I am not confident in my ability to evaluate the trustworthiness and technical competence of most of the libraries out there. And while something like this[0] provides algorithm recommendations that I trust, there are no specific implementations referenced. &quot;Good ol&#x27; bcrypt&quot; is widely referenced enough that I feel comfortable using it, and I would also feel comfortable using node&#x27;s built-in scrypt, except for the shortcomings in its api that you and I have already mentioned (aka &quot;things that I do not want to concern my employer with once my contract is finished&quot;).<p>I think it&#x27;s fine enough if I stick with bcrypt, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m planning to do, but I saw this was on the front page, so I opportunistically made the comment hoping that someone with experience in this area (e.g. tptacek) might see the question and jump in :)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.micro.blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;cryptographic-right-answers.html#password-handling" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.micro.blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;cryptographic-right-a...</a>')
