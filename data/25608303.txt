There seems to be dearth of high quality video material. You have big-budget high quality videos, big-budget garbage, and then lots and lots of low-budget garbage: i.e. all the stuff &quot;influencers&quot; and &quot;YouTube personas&quot; create to live off ad revenue.<p>There is a small and somewhat obscure but relatively stable middle - low-budget, high-quality videos. I attribute its survival to two things: some live off Patreon donations and occasional sponsorship deals, others live because the creators have an actual dayjob, and they do YouTube as a hobby.
