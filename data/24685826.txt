It&#x27;s like looking for fossil structures in crude oil - crude oil is remnants of life but is mainly long carbon chains. Very little if any structure remains.<p>Analogy #2: your great-great-...-great grandparents of 10,000 years ago unquestionably existed, but show me any direct evidence they did. You can&#x27;t. All signal is gone.')
