One of the key people was Ancel Keys. He falsified data and excluded significant data from his studies in order to push a narrative that saturated fats were bad for you. That eating plants was the only healthy way forward. Then the governments around the world pushed out their food pyramids that reinforced this idea.<p>We then had obvious paradoxes where in neighbours like France and Italy were the complete opposite reality. France with high fat had very low coronary heart disease and Italy which was low fat had high coronary heart disease.<p>There was no paradox, the science was fraudulent. Over the last several decades they have debunked and disproven this several times.<p>The fix for bad science is better science. this is over. We know all the health risks are from carbohydrates. This has been a fact for decades. Yet we sit here and grocery stores are 90% carbs. If we eliminate carbs from society, the food industry collapses &gt;90%. Millions upon millions of jobs are headed to unemployment. worse yet, the majority of these people have no other skills.<p>We as a society basically cannot afford to stop eating carbs. Nobody will be cutting carbs out of their diet.')
