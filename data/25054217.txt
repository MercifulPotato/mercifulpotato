In the first 20% of the vote Trump was doing better than the Gop candidates on the ticket.<p>Comes to the conclusion that an algorithm is syphoning votes from Trump to Biden. In a predictable linear fashion after the first 20% of the vote is counted. And flips more votes in more republican counties in an almost perfect linear way.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense because Trump was polling better than the Gop candidates before the election, and was popular with republican voters.<p>The tallying software has a weighted vote feature. Where votes can be weighted for example 2:1 for one candidate over the other. Thinks that this was kicked in after 20% of the vote was in. Which would produce a linear drop that the graphs show.')
