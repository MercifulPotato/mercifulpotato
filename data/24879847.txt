How would I feel about someone borrowing a book from a library and then photocopying it to keep a local copy?<p>If you&#x27;re photocopying a library book <i>in order to avoid buying your own copy</i>, I  don&#x27;t feel great about that—we need to support authors. Yes, everyone&#x27;s financial situation is different, and not every under-the-table photocopy is a lost sale, but there has to be some incentive to actually go to the bookstore.<p>But here’s the thing—for 99% of Youtube videos, there is no bookstore. There is no other way for me to acquire an unencumbered video file, regardless of how much I&#x27;m willing to pay.<p>And to stretch the photocopy analogy a bit, there are a lot of other reasons someone may want to photocopy a book:<p>• If the book has small print, you may want to enlarge the text.<p>• If you prefer listening over reading, you may want to OCR the pages and use text-to-speech.<p>• If you&#x27;re doing research, you may want to OCR the pages so the text can be digitally indexed and searched.<p>• If you have an eReader, you may want to digitize the book so you don&#x27;t have to carry around a paper copy.<p>And, sure, in some cases it may be possible to buy an official audiobook, or an eBook, or a large print edition. But in other cases, that might not be an option.<p>Downloading a Youtube video affords similar freedoms, allowing you to experience the content in the way that makes sense for you.')
