That said, if it&#x27;s crappy or doesn&#x27;t work well from angles or whatever then that&#x27;s not good either.<p>But let&#x27;s not get confused in arguing about &#x27;what a <i>real</i> hologram is&#x27; - because that&#x27;s now what we really want, what we want is the 3D there may be other ways to achieve it.')
