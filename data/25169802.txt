RAM runs $5-$10 for 4GB, $20 for a 2.5&quot; SATA SSD. They boot much faster than a Pi, idle around 7w, and run fine in my &quot;network closet&quot; that gets over 100F in summer.<p>Those exact systems aren&#x27;t plentiful on eBay any more but there are tons of NUC-alikes, actual NUCs, and Thin Clients in the $40-$75 range with low-TDP CPUs of comparable performance.')
