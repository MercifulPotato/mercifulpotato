These people are in a world of hurt when you have WSB spinning stories and encouraging reckless behavior, where some are throwing their last $20,000 into it, which will eventually disappear to $100 unless they passed the buck to some other chump before it all blows up. RH could genuinely believe that the sooner the GME pump stops, the less damage is done to these extremely naive retail investors, because the future naive bagholders flooding in are prevented from throwing their little savings at it.<p>Brokerage execution halting or not, this story has an incredibly obvious ending, and it&#x27;s that some WSB pumpers will profit huge, some hedge funds will lose huge, but the majority of WSB will lose immensely.')
