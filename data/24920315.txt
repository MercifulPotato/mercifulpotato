When you&#x27;re travelling at speed down a road, you need to know that the surface is flat and clear with achievable turn radius out to your stopping distance.<p>Guide wires don&#x27;t tell you whether the surface is flat. The surface could be damaged&#x2F;potholed, and the guide wires would still be there.<p>The guide wires don&#x27;t tell you whether the surface is clear. For that, you need to have vision, to tell you whether cars, pedestrians, obstructions, and toddlers about to run out into the road are there.<p>The guide wires don&#x27;t tell you what the turn radius in the road is ahead - it only tells you where the road is right here. Although technically this could be achieved, it would make it much more complicated.<p>Ultimately, the car needs to build its own picture of where it is safe to drive that is reasonably resilient to adverse conditions and even malicious attack. Trusting road infrastructure for that I think is not resilient enough.')
