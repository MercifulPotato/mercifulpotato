Occasionally they force people to buy earbuds or a watch. What an evil corporation, all those happy bouncy ads they run on TV, it&#x27;s outrageous. Evil personified. Nuke Cupertino before they nuke us first. Who are they to tell me to think different? Who knows what they&#x27;ll force us to buy next. I&#x27;m personally invoking NATO&#x27;s Article 5, we&#x27;ve been attacked, they&#x27;ve weaponized an app store by setting their fees too high for developers.')
