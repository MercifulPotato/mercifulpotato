I meant &quot;faithful to the original language&quot; (OCaml natively compiled and Scala on the JVM).<p>You are of course right about the type systems. (I believe many soundness holes are fixed in Scala 3.)<p>&gt; &gt; Using `undefined` to represent `None` means that you cannot tell the difference between `None` and `Some(None)`\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#x27;t know where you get the impression, of course they are different in ReScript.<p>I get that impression from the document linked above, which says that `None` is represented as `undefined` and `Some(x)` is represented as `x`, so `Some(None)` must be represented as `undefined` as well. Oh and `()` too. Do at run-time you can&#x27;t tell which is which.<p>&gt; One thing missed is that ReScript compiler may be 100 times faster than Scala.js (I am not kidding)<p>Yes, I believe that&#x27;s true. It is often mentioned as the biggest weakness is Scala, by advocates and detractors alike.')
