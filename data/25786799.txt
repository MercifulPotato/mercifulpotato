Taking action is what makes someone a good citizen &#x2F; person. As an individual you cannot solve every problem and focus on every issue at once. It&#x27;s impossible. So focusing on the problems you are working on and letting go of the others is the right way to make a meaningful impact on the world through greater focus.<p>On a more practical level most news is infotainment to a degree &#x2F; opinion at this point. You can stay informed without buying into the 24&#x2F;7 news cycle and being constantly anxious. Checking in once a week or so is a perfectly reasonable stance to hold.')
