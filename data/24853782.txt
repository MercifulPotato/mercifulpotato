But youtube.com wasn&#x27;t that big when they bought it.  In fact by definition most of the things they bought (like maps.google.com) weren&#x27;t big.  The obvious corollary is Google is very good buy scaling something up while keeping it rock solid.<p>And, they are.  Examples of original things that did come out of Google are Kubernetes, the Site Reliability Engineering Handbook, and pulling off something I thought was impossible: Spanner, a global distributed ACID database.  From what I can tell they have constructed the fastest, most reliable distributed computing platform on the planet.<p>They are the Toyota&#x27;s of the computing landscape: nothing particularly outstanding in any particular model of car, the secret sauce is the infrastructure and processes they&#x27;ve developed to manufacture those cars that ensures they are both cheap and reliable.  And so it is with Google.  They aren&#x27;t particularly good at coming up with new products.  In fact they often buy them.  But then those products get moved onto best computing infrastructure on the planet.  If the products are any good, they seemingly grow without effort to become a dominant player.')
