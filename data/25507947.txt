But unsurprisingly, I wasn&#x27;t happier. Worse, it became harder and harder to leave a job (or leave this IT career) because the idea of financial setback was bigger with each job.<p>By no means am I rich. In fact, other life things erased my financial gains; so I&#x27;m left with less time in my life and few achievements or memories (work related) worth remembering.<p>And while family and children are some of the best things in life, they also tend to be in conflict with hard career work and success.  Some people pull it off, but most of us don&#x27;t.<p>My advice is to try to recognize when one&#x27;s career is no longer fulfilling; save a little money along the way, and pivot hard in search of work&#x2F;life satisfaction even if it means a big downgrade in income. And start a family ideally after you have explored the world and some of your dreams.')
