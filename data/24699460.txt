It detected everything and is deploying but one thing I noticed is that deployment is kinda slow. My GitHub Actions pipeline to build the Jekyll site and deploy to Cloudflare takes less than 2 minutes (latest run took 1m 43s). DigitalOcean took 6 minutes in comparison. Sure, its not crazy, but 3x the time still seems excessive.<p>It seems the bulk of the time was from installing ruby gems for Jekyll. Maybe GitHub Actions mirrors them or something so it can run faster?<p>Besides that, it works great. Actual live performance seems as snappy as one would expect from a static site and setting it up was almost one click. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking into this in more detail.<p>First impressions are good and I may well migrate over for static site and API server (API server is currently running on a droplet as a single docker container, so seems like a nice way to lower the effort I have to put in). Everything else is running on AWS for.. reasons.. so this looks like a nice way to simplify my non-AWS stuff. I&#x27;ll be experimenting with it over the coming days! The bandwidth limits are the biggest concern.')
