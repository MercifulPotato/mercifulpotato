What exactly is wasteful? You eating anything that isn&#x27;t absolutely required, maybe just some IVs, is that not wasteful? The USAs entire meat chain, is that not wasteful? Transportation when online meetings are fine, is that not wasteful? The universe itself burning out one day, is that not wasteful to existence? Wasteful is not an argument at the end of the day.')
