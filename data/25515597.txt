If you can&#x27;t afford to buy lunch&#x2F;dinner daily, obviously don&#x27;t do it. But I think the point that the parent was trying to make was that if you don&#x27;t feel like cooking one day, it&#x27;s totally OK to go out for food.<p>During my holiday this month, I&#x27;ve made it a point to go for a nice lunch every few days. Yes, it costs me money, money that I could save for my future (although I don&#x27;t know what I would do with the extra money), but it&#x27;s enjoyable, relaxing and the food is great.')
