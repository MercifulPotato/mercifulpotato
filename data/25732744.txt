The US prison systems, as a general rule, don&#x27;t rehabilitate; they punish. There is no reason to trust that a person who spent time in prison is more safe after than they were before. In many cases, it&#x27;s common for people to become more dangerous because of stay in prison.<p>We need to work towards the prisons rehabilitating before we can trust the people coming out of them are &quot;safe&quot; (understand that a lot of people that get sent to prison _are_ safe... the term has a vague meaning the way I&#x27;m using it).')
