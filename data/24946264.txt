Twitter and Facebook are not close to the only means of publishing information.  I don&#x27;t think that people deserve any particular audience for their speech, so the ability to substitute other publishing methods alleviates concerns about censorship on my part.<p>On the other hand, its much more difficult to switch ISPs, so I would be very concerned about censorship at that level.  Things like search engines which are substitute-able but held by few hands and difficult to replicate privately are more of a grey area in my opinion.')
