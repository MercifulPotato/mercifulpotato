Really, really slow.<p>Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#x27;re optimising for something that matters to <i>someone</i>, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:<p>1) Can I use it <i>at all</i>? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#x27;ll never know. And it&#x27;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#x27;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be <i>even slower</i>.<p>(Incidentally, there&#x27;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#x27;t mind a few more features, but it&#x27;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)')
