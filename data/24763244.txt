In light of this, I&#x27;m increasingly of the opinion that if misinformation and conspiracy theories are like viruses, then we should be practicing &quot;political distancing,&quot; if you will. This doesn&#x27;t mean being politically ignorant, but rather engaging in the minimum amount of political content you need to and no more. This would slow the spread of misinformation, since it simply doesn&#x27;t have as many people to &quot;infect&quot; as quickly. While this may appear to go against the democratic spirit of maximum political engagement, democracy has worked before Facebook (and would probably be a lot better with less use of it). I think people&#x27;s &quot;default&quot; political beliefs are generally less insane than many of the conspiracy theories (and if your beliefs already are that crazy then going on Facebook will only make them worse), so reducing engagement with political content should be something positive. This isn&#x27;t something the journalists will recommend since their careers depend on clicks, but I think it&#x27;s in everyone&#x27;s best interest for people to back off the scrolling through the feed all day and take a break.')
