For example, the stigma of being a &quot;druggie&quot;, before it become more widely accepted in the recent years, could definitely lend itself to users building that identity around themselves. After building this identity that could further their likelihood of aligning with other &quot;illicit&quot; activities. TLDR not sold on this study.')
