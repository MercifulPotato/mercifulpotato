I attribute it to a lack of education around business.<p>One of my good friends is a highly-paid engineer at a tech company, and he told me, &quot;Businesses want to keep people poor, so they have cheap labor.&quot; Which is about as sensible as saying consumers want businesses to be poor, so we get cheaper products. This is actually a pervasive myth believed by many intelligent people.<p>Of course businesses <i>want</i> to pay as little as they can for labor, the same way literally anyone paying for anything wants to pay as little as possible. But other concerns obviously come into play as well, e.g. the quality of the people you hire, the affluence of the customers you can sell to, your top-level revenue numbers, etc. This should have been obvious to my friend, who works at a tech company that&#x27;s happy to pay him and others $200k+.<p>The reality is that businesses actually <i>prefer</i> wealthy societies with wealthy customers who can buy more things. It&#x27;s a chronic problem that poor communities are <i>under-served</i> by businesses, because poverty makes it harder to profit.<p>And yet the myth that businesses want people to be poor persists.<p>As does the myth that you can only make large sums of money through cheating, scamming, lying, stealing, etc.')
