You&#x27;d have to do repeated follow-up of all participants with frequent testing. When you have 40,000 participants, that&#x27;s a significant concern. Trials like these are called &quot;large, simple trials&quot; since at that scale it&#x27;s impractical to have a complicated study design at that scale. In addition to the pure expense, it&#x27;s difficult to comply consistently with the protocol if it&#x27;s complicated and you need to implement it at dozens or hundreds of sites. And recruiting people becomes harder and harder as you need additional follow-up, and attrition is higher (and likely biased: you&#x27;re more likely to take your test if you think you might be sick).<p>So it&#x27;s entirely reasonable to just study symptomatic cases in these trials.')
