The only conclusion that seems rational to me is as follows:<p>Everyone tries to push their burden of moderation on people below them, because <i>no one</i> can actually keep up with it. And if the moderation is not enforced, they risk being taken down by someone above them. That would explain why everyone is so trigger happy when it comes to censorship. When the WallStreetBets people were taken down by Facebook and Discord, they didn&#x27;t ban the individuals who were actually violating the policy, but the entire community.<p>It&#x27;s also worth to note, that the takedowns can be enforced selectively, as we see here - Google obviously won&#x27;t take down their own browser or email client, that also allows to access abusive content - assuming that&#x27;s what Element was taken down for. It&#x27;s probably selectively enforced on the social media too, but I&#x27;m out of the loop on what actually goes on there, so to be fair, I cannot prove it.<p>If this is actually what is happening, the only solution as far as I see it, is to extend the First Amendment to social media. Another solution could be to convince the people and the media to stop pressuring companies into deplatforming other people, but that&#x27;s in my opinion definitely not going to happen. So it&#x27;s either applying the protections of 1A to the internet or the censorship will get worse and worse.')
