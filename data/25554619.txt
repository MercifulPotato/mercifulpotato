Basically something I felt safe and comfortable using while in the leftmost lane, where there were no exits. It helped maintain the set speed subject to the constraint of maintaining a distance to the next vehicle. It also did lane keeping pretty well.<p>But it’s not a perfect system and it’s important not to trust your life to it:<p>* once, when on the right lane of two lane I5, it veered towards an exit ramp while going 60 mph+. I had looked away to grab a French fry.<p>* the detection of the car ahead of it isn’t perfect, I’ve had cars merge into my lane, which weren’t detected immediately, and distance wasn’t added until the system self corrected eventually.<p>* false positives on obstacle detection. It’s happened a few times, where hard sun lighting on the highway, combined with shadows on the payment from bridges&#x2F;trees&#x2F;other seem to make it pick up an obstacle and make the vehicle start to break hard.<p>* I get the sense that the control system doesn’t account for the physics of the car. For example, it’ll take highway turns at high speeds, because that’s the set speed. But we humans know to slow down as we enter such turns. They need to add a bit of fear of the unknown to this thing hah.<p>All in all it’s a neat system that makes highway driving fun. But one needs to closely monitor it or it’ll lead to a new class of accidents.<p>For city driving the only time I might consider using it is for bumper to bumper really slow traffic. Again with close supervision. But there hasn’t been much city driving during pandemic.')
