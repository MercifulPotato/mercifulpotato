You can usually find a local mycological club to go foraging with. You don&#x27;t even have to eat the mushrooms if you don&#x27;t want to. You can go and learn about finding them, cooking them, interesting forms&#x2F;traits, etc. It&#x27;s a great way to have a common interest and get out hiking with a purpose. Being outdoors is also a great low risk (from a covid perspective) way to gather with others. The only downside right now is that, depending on your location, winter doesn&#x27;t offer as many foraging opportunities as the other seasons.')
