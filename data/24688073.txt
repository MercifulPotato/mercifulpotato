Sleep is also important.<p>In general, taking care of yourself physically (beyond sleep and exercise this includes things like taking showers, brushing teeth, etc., which can be difficult during a slump) makes it easier to take care of yourself mentally since you have more energy and don&#x27;t need to deal with body problems.<p>In my experience this stuff is helpful, but not a silver bullet.')
