And one of the problems with e.g. MOOCs (for the most part) is they &quot;solved&quot; the problem of video lectures--which was not actually much of a problem. And everything else, with a few partial exceptions, didn&#x27;t really work very well. And it&#x27;s the same problem with online learning generally beyond low (maybe 10 people or so?) scale.
