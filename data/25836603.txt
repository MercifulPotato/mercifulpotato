It also seems comparatively easy not to dismiss concerns about how trade policy has invested in other nations to the neglect of many everyday Americans (to cite some examples).<p>What is not so easy <i>not to dismiss</i> is the concern about the conspiracy of cannibalistic pedophiles.<p>I say this not to say we <i>should</i> dismiss anyone’s concerns, but to elaborate on what the challenge seems to have become.')
