In a democratic society, it is the <i>responsibility</i> of every citizen <i>and corporation</i> to act in accordance with democratic values.<p>At the end of the day, democracies aren&#x27;t built out of laws written on paper -- they&#x27;re built on the everyday decisions people take such as voting, arguing over issues, and condemning non-democratic bad actors.<p>Just as people can protest in the streets against undemocratic abuses of power, so corporate entities can and should deplatform people and organizations that explicitly, violently threaten our democracy.<p>It&#x27;s up to every person and corporation to be their own arbiter. That&#x27;s the ultimate safeguard of democracy.<p>If AWS waited for a court order, it could very well be too late.')
