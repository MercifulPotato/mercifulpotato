All those bloated text fields.<p>HTTP is so inefficient. All those newline-deliminated case-varying strings.<p>Logs are so inefficient. Error codes are so much shorter and precise.<p>Computers are here to make humans&#x27; lives easier. But it&#x27;s not easier if we&#x27;re forced to use tools that communicate in obscure ways we can&#x27;t understand and later need translators for. If a human has to debug it, either it has to be translated into a human-language-like form, or it can just stay that way to begin with and save us the trouble of having to build translators into anything that outputs, extracts, transforms, or loads data.<p>JSON is actually a wonderful general-purpose data format. It&#x27;s <i>somewhat</i> simple (compared to the alternatives), it&#x27;s grokable, it&#x27;s ubiquitous, and you can `cat` it and not destroy your terminal. But of course it shouldn&#x27;t be used for <i>everything</i>. Actually one of the only things I find distasteful about JSON is the lack of a version indicator to allow extending it. But maybe this was its saving grace.<p>If &quot;blowing CPU on JSON marshaling&quot; is your big problem, boy, your business must be <i>thriving</i>.')
