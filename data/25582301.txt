Item(by='shatnersbassoon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609341116, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582300, text='Classical Page is an email notification service for classical music concerts. You add the works and composers you want to hear, and Classical Page will email you when it&#x27;s going to be played in your city.<p>I made it because I got frustrated leafing through pages and pages of websites for venues trying to find concerts that I&#x27;m interested in. With Classical Page you just set your preferences, and it will let you know as soon as a new concert is listed, along with reminders 6 months out, 1 month and 1 week.<p>I made Classical Page using Google Cloud Platform, in particular Cloud Storage, Big Query, Cloud Functions and Neo4J. The frontend is a Svelte SPA hosted on Cloud Run. Emails via mailgun.<p>Launching in London and New York, with more cities to come very soon.<p>More info here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classical.page&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classical.page&#x2F;about</a>\nand\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classical.page&#x2F;blog&#x2F;blastoff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.classical.page&#x2F;blog&#x2F;blastoff</a>')
