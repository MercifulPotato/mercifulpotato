Given Biden&#x27;s political connections I think getting videos of his kid smoking crack would be considered very valuable compared to what it would cost to have some party pal take the video.<p>Think about how well it works for a scenario like this.  Using real videos to legitimize fake emails is an easy win, especially if you don&#x27;t release either.  No on can disprove the legitimacy of the emails and if Biden says they&#x27;re total BS you release the real videos to add more legitimacy and give the whole thing another news cycle.  Then you claim victory and go silent.')
