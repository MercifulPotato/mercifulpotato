In fact it was used to treat morphine addiction.<p>Heroin was also initially used as a treatment for morphine addiction.<p>The methadone came around, and was used to treat heroin addiction.  But, surprise!  It turns out that just like heroin and cocaine, methadone itself can be addictive.<p>Marijuana was widely hyped as completely harmless, but it turns out that some people can get (psychologically) addicted to it, abuse it, and suffer negative effects.<p>Anything (whether drug, activity, object, or food) that is highly desirable can be abused.')
