The very first sentence is already wrong: &quot;It could lead to net zero emissions for air travel.&quot;<p>No, it can&#x27;t. Aviation has a variety of emission sources, which include not only CO2, but also others like nitrous oxides and water vapour, which creates contrains and impacts cloud formation. There&#x27;s huge uncertainty how large these effects are, but they&#x27;re significant.<p>It&#x27;s not particularly surprising that you can turn CO2 into jet fuel. The issue is: It&#x27;s not a complete fix for aviation&#x27;s climate problem and the efficiency is extremely low. The amount of electricity needed is enormous.<p>Worthy read (title is about hydrogen, but it also covers e-fuels quite a bit): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleansky.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;hydrogen-powered-aviation-preparing-for-take-off" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cleansky.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;hydrogen-powered-aviation-prepa...</a><p>Key takeaways: Aviation CO2 emissions are 2%, but overall emissions are somewhere between 3 and 7%. And using E-Fuels to power future aviation (with current growth projections) requires more electricity than all the electricity that is genreated today.')
