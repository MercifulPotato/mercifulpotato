America can cause $$$ to instantly evaporate off Korea just by looking at it the wrong way.  You think Korea is keeping Iran&#x27;s 7 billion dollars just because we like to be a jerk?<p>I don&#x27;t want to complain too much, because the arrangement is usually mutually beneficial (after all, if you <i>have</i> to keep thousands of foreign soldiers on your own soil, better to be a part of team America than team Iran or team China) - I just think it would be better if we talk about practicality instead of moral outrages.')
