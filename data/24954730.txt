And how well you are educated depends upon how you well educated your parents are, your accessibility to education and your financial status. And the marginalized communities are behind in these factors because of hundreds of years of descrimation. And it makes total sense to give them additional support. You should also keep in mind that marginalized communities make the major chunk of population. And I think the reservation % is also similar to their population %. Probably even lesser. I don&#x27;t see the issue then? Students in general category get to compete with other students in general category who had a similar upbringing compared to marginalized communities( of course, there are a lot of exceptions). And students in marginalized communities compete with students with other marginalized students. And the top percentile students make it to college from each section. Sounds reasonable to me. I don&#x27;t think anyone who are reasonable and knows history would have any issue with this system.<p>&gt; The way they are indoctrinated in these colleges creates a superior mentality in students and if your classmate scored less than you and got into college, you would also extend that superior mentality to him&#x2F;her as well.<p>That&#x27;s just a sign of our poor education system. I don&#x27;t think anyone who is well educated would have superior mentality over someone else. So we should work on improving our education system.')
