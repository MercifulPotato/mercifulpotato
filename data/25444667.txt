Let the govts of the world, especially the Paris Climate Accords signatories, collectively own the Amazon and put it all into a nature preserve that canâ€™t be mowed down and turned into farmland?<p>It would still be under Brazilian jurisdiction and law, of course, and the Brazilian govt would likely be contracted to run such a preserve.  But the property rights would be owned by an international group of govts who do not allow destruction of the forests on their property.')
