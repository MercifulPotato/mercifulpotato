The spirit of the Apache license is explicitly - &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you succeed with my code wildly beyond what i achieve, more power to you, just credit me in the byline&quot;. I license my own code in Apache usually because that&#x27;s precisely my position.<p>There are other licenses implying a different spirit if you want to take a different position - but complaining about AWS because they chose Apache is not a great look. They&#x27;re certain to lose community developers.')
