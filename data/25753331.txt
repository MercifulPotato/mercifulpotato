Item(by='Alex3917', descendants=None, kids=[25753764], score=None, time=1610484302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752975, text='&gt; After a archive-worthy discussion in email, you forward the thread to &quot;archivebot@my-company-domain.com&quot;. The script will parse the email chain and generate a static web page hosted on a local server.<p>Unfortunately there isn&#x27;t any such thing as &quot;forwarding an email thread&quot;, at least not currently. If you hit the forward button in your email client it will only forward the last email in the thread, which sometimes contains the entire thread as quoted reply text, but only in situations where each person has only replied to the most recent email in the thread. Some email clients also truncated the quoted reply text after a certain number of messages, and it&#x27;s not generally parsable.<p>Our email archival product uses a G Suite add-on for this reason, which provides the same benefits as OAuth but works on a thread-by-thread basis. I think Outlook extensions work the same way, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure on that.<p>Actually technically Gmail does have a little known &quot;forward thread&quot; button that&#x27;s hidden in one of the dropdowns, but it doesn&#x27;t work that well. (Which you&#x27;ll see if you try it on any longer thread.)')
