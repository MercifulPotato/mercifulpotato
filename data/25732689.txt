So you also have to offer those pragmatic reasons to people, because those reasons are also important after all.<p>I know TBL was more or less on the &quot;hippie&quot; side of the web standards and it was very important to the web&#x27;s core and foundation on the right track.<p>But i was not because of the HTML standard was great as a piece of technology, but the energy and the people that formed around it made it happen through the patient iteration over browsers, until browsers became a thing no one could avoid.<p>I&#x27;m saying this as somebody working more or less on the same problem, but who have taken a different approach..<p>The problem is hard because the state-of-the-art now is very sophisticated. You will have to compete with browsers and app platforms for mindshare, and i think you only can do it if you propose a new platform where people understand it as a better approach.<p>And i must say, the web alone as it is, is a broken foundation to lay out this sort of thing, for a lot of reasons.<p>So we need a new sort of browser, one that&#x27;s so different that you actually wont even be able to call it a browser anymore.<p>This is what i&#x27;m trying to do. Trying to solve the same sort of problems, but with a different take than Solid.<p>But i must say its pretty hard, because you also have to offer, at least as a starting point, what browsers and application platforms already offer to developer. Along with this, there&#x27;s a need for a incentive on the part of the user, the ultimate consumer of the thing. And this is also a hard problem, because you will need to offer something people want and dont have already..<p>I think i got this, but only time will tell. And even if the thing is somehow &quot;right&quot;, even than you might suffer from lack of adoption as the incentives might not be enough and that &#x27;killer app&#x27; that will make the platform boom never shows up.')
