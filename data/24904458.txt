I can not think of a company of this size and yet has only one product&#x2F;service. <i>Why do we need so many people?</i><p>I&#x27;ve always wondered what would happen if <i>every</i> company&#x2F;corporation had a hard cap on its size and could not have more than 150 (a.k.a Dunbar&#x27;s number) of people. Forget subsidiaries, conglomerates, etc. No individual could sit on the board of more than one incorporated entity, and any entity could not exert control over any other.<p>What would happen when a company started reaching this size? Would it start to focus on increasing productivity of the existing employees, or would they outsource absolutely everything that is not part of their core profit center and keep itself as lean as possible? How many layers of management would it have? What would happen with investment in R&amp;D? Would this lead to companies being ultra-competitive for local markets or would competing companies form cartels and balkanize its customers in order to guarantee mutual survival?<p>Would tech companies still be able to follow the strategy of &quot;grow first, find out how to make money later.&quot; My guess is they wouldn&#x27;t, but would that be a bad thing?')
