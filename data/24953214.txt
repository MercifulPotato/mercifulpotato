This is only an issue because EEOC is only followed when it is useful to their leftist management.  Otherwise, in the name of D&amp;I, we get companies in the US mainland that are 97% Indian nationals on H1B.  That can&#x27;t happen in a fully functional US corporation that is following the law where laws are enforced.  So it is really pointless to point out caste discrimination when US corporations are lawless and the US government is powerless.')
