Official numbers for flu are about 10,000 to 20,000 deaths each year. Official numbers for covid-19 are currently about 60,000.<p>Already we can see covid-19 is much more lethal. But this ignores differences in counting.<p>If we count flu using the same methods we&#x27;re currently using for covid we see only a couple of hundred, fewer than 1000, deaths to flu each year.<p>If we count covid using the same methods we use to count flu deaths we&#x27;d see at least 140,000 covid deaths.<p>&gt; Where is the focus on public health interventions<p>We have internationally coordinated programmes of work to monitor which flu strains are active, then develop vaccines to target these, then to vaccinate as many vulnerable people as possible.')
