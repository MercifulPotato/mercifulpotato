Like I mentioned, it&#x27;s the first website I&#x27;ve ever built, so I ran into some problems that I&#x27;m sure would have been easier to deal with had there been a bigger community and more tutorials available. I was fixated on it being as fast as possible, which is perhaps quite ironic with the amount of images it&#x27;s downloading - not lazily.<p>I have to admit now that I&#x27;m thinking about building a second project, that my technology stack will also be governed by what employers are looking for. I&#x27;m currently working in a non-tech industry, but I&#x27;m starting to think about trying to transition.<p>Another thing that came to mind was that I&#x27;d try to remove some of the monotonous tasks that made it such a grind, like manually compressing all of the images and trying to find the right size. That was a huge ordeal, and I would&#x27;ve been better off with implementing lazy loading and just running the images through some compression automatically or not compressing them at all. I really should have done that.<p>I&#x27;d also probably try to advertise it a bit more. This is the only time I&#x27;ve mentioned the project, and it&#x27;s almost a year old. I was just hoping people would magically stumble into it.. I&#x27;m sure even a dollar or two from it would have given me the motivation to at least complete the parts I&#x27;d planned out for and actually found interesting myself.<p>Thanks again for the compliment and happy New Year&#x27;s!')
