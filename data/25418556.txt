Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25418750, 25418593], score=None, time=1607959443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418473, text='<i>&gt; Software people not philosophers promulgated the nonsense idea that &quot;algorithms can&#x27;t be biased&quot;, so I think software people need plenty of help understanding what an algorithm is, with help from philosophy and humanity.</i><p>(E: throwaway894345&#x27;s comment is of much higher quality than mine.)<p>Very few serious software engineers -- and virtually zero computer scientists -- have ever held this opinion. It&#x27;s an extreme minority view. And, I know a few philosophers who also repeat this nonsense.<p>Those that do hold this view IME are almost always folks who are invested in a personal politics that is congruent with dismissing concerns about bias. Without exception, IME, they&#x27;re also knee-jerk antagonistic toward other ideas about bias that don&#x27;t involve computers (eg they&#x27;re the first ones to complain about implicit bias training). These people also tend to be the annoyingly pedantic type (&quot;bias has a technical meaning in statistics!&quot; sort of thing).<p>In other words, they&#x27;re politically invested, and no amount of input from philosophers -- or technicians&#x2F;scientists -- is going to change their strongly held personal politic beliefs.<p>Again, anyone who has spent a moment around philosophers knows that they are just humans who are not immune from the exact same problem.')
