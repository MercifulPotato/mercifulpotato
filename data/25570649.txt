Like puppies they seem to be testing limits to rough play.<p>What surprised me is what happened when I didn&#x27;t intervene: a few times the older one completely dominated and got his way. But more often than not the older one displayed empathy and tried to  apologize and give kisses and give the younger one additional toys.<p>Maybe this is an unoriginal idea but it bears repeating: I think kids have more ability to self regulate than we typically treat them as having.')
