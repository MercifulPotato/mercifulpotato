The differences between ethnic groups starts early in childhood. It&#x27;s about the role models kids have. It&#x27;s about how much time their parents spend with them and how much they nag on them to study. It is totally fixable if we generally focus on promoting independent thinking, long-term planning and delayed gratification. Everyone can do this, it&#x27;s hard but absolutely possible. But instead, our society is trying to erase these values by penalizing those who were raised with them.<p>2. Like it or not, there are behavioral differences between men and women. I&#x27;m not saying one is better than the other, but there are differences, especially when it comes to risk-taking and multitasking. A trivial example would be traffic accidents where denting the bumper on a parking lot would be a &quot;typically female&quot; thing, and totalling the car while doing 40mph over the speed limit would be a &quot;typically male&quot; thing. Again, nobody is trying to pinpoint specific risk-taking strategies that statistically give you better returns, and convince people to use them. Instead we are penalizing those who are likely to use these strategies.<p>And if you are looking for a motive, look how the economy used to be cyclical. Corporations would grow big and inefficient, so new lean risk-taking players would take their place, bringing innovation. This happened in 80s with Microsoft, this happened around Y2K with Google. Behind each of these companies was a well-educated risk-taking founder, and each of these companies brought innovation to the table. Except now they have reached the &quot;inefficient behemoth&quot; stage and are ready to be disrupted. Except, they learned from the history and are heavily investing in stigmatizing the qualities associated with previously known disruptors.<p>That said, you cannot stop the progress. The cutting edge of the innovation will move to China or whatever, and the U.S. will become the new Old World...')
