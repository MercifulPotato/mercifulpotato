The game could almost not be simpler: you hit a golf ball into a hole, then the view shifts to show you the next hole. Repeat. Forever.<p>There&#x27;s no interface, no objectives or awards, and no story. Shot power and ball spin are the only controls. The landscape is randomly generated and has enough features (water, sand, cacti, etc.) to keep things interesting.<p>Calling it a &quot;small&quot; game seems like an exaggeration. &quot;Micro&quot; might be a better word. It sounds like it would get boring after a bit, but honestly that might be the best part? You can kind of zone out and play for bit. It&#x27;s almost meditative.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captaingames.itch.io&#x2F;golf-on-mars" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captaingames.itch.io&#x2F;golf-on-mars</a>')
