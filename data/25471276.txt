Back then, if you wanted to share digital information with someone else, you had to save that information to a hard disk (or similar) and physically transport it to their location.<p>Then we invented the internet and now you can transmit digital information between digital computers over wires &#x2F; EM signals.<p>Quantum teleportation &#x2F; entanglement does the same but for quantum state rather than just digital state, which allows quantum computers to communicate with each other. Without this technology, quantum computers would not be able to communicate with each other over a network. So you still need to use wires &#x2F; EM waves in order to transmit the data, but the data you are transmitting is quantum.<p>Technically you&#x27;re not actually sending qubits over the wire though, you&#x27;re sending 2 classical bits per quibit which are able to tell the other system what each qubit in the target system is supposed to look like, but effectively you can pretend you&#x27;re sending qubits over the wire.')
