I left out “to you” but I thought the HN community was a bit smarter than that. Even if you had said “it’s easier to me. Full stop,” I still would have written the same reply...<p>All you said was “it’s easier” in your original point. You obviously felt the need to clarify yourself in your most recent comment. So clearly your first comment was lacking information. There was no reason to downvote me just because you felt my original comment made you look stupid.<p>FWIW, even though “easy” is subjective, there’s still a consensus to be considered. For example, finding piercing your skin with a needle to be an asthetically-pleasing act does not fit that consensus...<p>Something that _does_ fit the consensus is that taking a pill every day is a hassle.<p>Stop being facetious just to prove a point.')
