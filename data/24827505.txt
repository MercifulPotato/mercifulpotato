Remember that context matters a ton. Are you posting in a company wide channel, or DM-ing you&#x27;re close coworkers? Are you posting about an update, or just sharing something random to your team. All that plays into this more than the author expands on (he does quickly mention it in the last section). I think you just have to be a human, esp. in times where everyone is working from home. I think if you followed this advice in every channel, in every scenario, your company Slack culture would start to suffer a ton, and feel very cold (not that the author says that, just an FYI). This is good advice generally, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but just be smart to when you apply it. Don&#x27;t ruin your culture, and come off as a robot&#x2F;cold person in every message you post.')
