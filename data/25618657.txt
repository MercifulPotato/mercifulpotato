WSL2 Debian doesn&#x27;t have systemd installed and what a fvckery it is trying to get it to work. That means sshd, docker, k3s don&#x27;t work as expected on reboot. Some apps do not install properly becasue scripts expect systemd. Windows networking is PITA too just to do something simple like SSH into a WSL2 instance.<p>I don&#x27;t get why deep Windows integration is so important. It&#x27;s not something I would use on a production box. I just want Hyper-V to work like VMware and VirtualBox. As you say, VSCode remote makes it all seamless anyway.<p>I had to go back to VMware 15.5.2 (version before hyper-v layer) and disable hyper-v completely.')
