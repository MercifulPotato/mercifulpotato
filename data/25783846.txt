I can imagine it&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s a tonne of diseases it might carry that could be passed to the local native &amp; agricultural bird populations that they have no exposure to.<p>Australia&#x27;s relative isolation means that there&#x27;s many diseases that local animal populations have no immunity to.')
