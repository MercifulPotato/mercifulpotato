Germany&#x27;s renewable energy was built in recent years, much of it during a time when it was significantly more expensive than now. Frances price is from mostly very old nuclear reactors, many of which are close to end-of-life.<p>And you seem to be attributing the CO2 emissions to the renewables, but that&#x27;s in no way fair. Even if we had the solution to energy storage, you&#x27;d expect a country switching from coal to renewables to have high emissions even at the half-way point.<p>&gt; So, no, large scale solar power is neither cheap nor clean.<p>It&#x27;s more complex than headlines would lead you to believe. But that&#x27;s ALWAYS the case. This conclusion is just as dumb as the headlines, if not even dumber.<p>You&#x27;re right that storage and backup is a big factor, but it&#x27;s a problem that&#x27;s rapidly being solved.')
