FOX may be to the right of MSNBC, but on a larger scale historically-informed left-right spectrum, the two are not actually that far apart ideologically. Most &quot;conservative principles&quot; these days are just the modern liberal status quo delayed by ~20 years; for example, anti-homosexual rhetoric is dead and dying on that side in a way that lines up well with what I remember from the Democrats in the late 90s.<p>The hyperpolarization is not to do with the right vs left dichotomy so much as it is a deliberate, encouraged-by-both-sides establishment of a false dichotomy designed to pen people into a small range of discourse. Some call this the Overton window; the deliberate establishment of contrasting narratives in a 2-pronged strategy was perfected in America by Arthur Finkelstein in the mid-20th century and is becoming an art form today.<p>If you can see FOX as a &quot;right wing propaganda machine&quot; but can&#x27;t see the other MSM networks as being equally polarizing machines aimed at a different half of the audience, you&#x27;re missing the shot.<p>The solution is to see the false dichotomy for what it is, look at who is pushing it, and look at what direction both &quot;sides&quot; actually push for. If you&#x27;re on the right, they want you to have your attention and energy soaked up in this useless Stop the Steal push for Trump, who actually didn&#x27;t accomplish any of the things his populist base asked for (immigration control, really bringing back American jobs, giving a shit about the working class). If you&#x27;re on the Left, they want to soak you up with Biden instead of the more progressive policies that someone like Bernie or Tulsi Gabbard espoused. Either way, you&#x27;re being played if you allow your energy to go toward supporting one of these useless figureheads instead of critiquing the system itself.')
