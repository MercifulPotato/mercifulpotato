It sounds like  you may live in a relatively small space.<p>Almost no home heats completely evenly and you will have some rooms that are warmer than others, especially when the air is on. (Good HVAC setup can mitigate some but not all).<p>So for example, I live in a 4,000 sqft home, and the kitchen is far and away the hottest room in the house, especially when it is in use. So when I have guests over I will tend to turn the overall heat down, and leave the gas logs on in the den to keep guests cozy while I cook.<p>Just an example, but I am sure there are many situations like it out there.')
