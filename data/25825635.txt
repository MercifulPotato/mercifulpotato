Obviously, as zillions of people are using it, it has the best search algorithm of them all. On the first page, I get exactly what I&#x27;ve searched for even though my query is sometimes inaccurate or extremely vague, something I can&#x27;t seem to reproduce with other search engines such as DuckDuckGo. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if there exists one search engine as powerful but I would love to have your suggestions. It&#x27;s the only thing that prevents me from completing my step to DeGooglization.')
