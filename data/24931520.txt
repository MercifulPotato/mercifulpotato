They typically language about what constitutes bigotry. In the OP, yes, the CoC was weaponized, but it doesn&#x27;t reflect a necessary fault in CoCs in general.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m not sure what is even meant by &quot;weaponize.&quot; Is the implication that somebody at the conference had vendetta against OP? It&#x27;s clear that CoCs give people more power, which is a weapon, in a sense. Would reporting someone for CoC violation for sexual misconduct at a conference be an example of weaponization?')
