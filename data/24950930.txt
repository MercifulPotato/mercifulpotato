For a normal major Debian package, a fix to openssl or libc or libgtk-something automatically fixes that bug in the major package as well. For a static binary, Debian has to notice the change, rebuild the static binary, and ship it out.<p>The benefit of a distro is shared, trustable work. Increasing the workload on the distro maintainers is not great, and Debian is an all-volunteer organization, especially sensitive to that workload.')
