When you send bitcoin to an address, you don&#x27;t send to a public key, you send to a hash of a public key. It&#x27;s only when you need to spend the coins that you need to disclose the public key. According to wikipedia hash functions are considered safe against attacks against quantum computers[1] so any coins stored in addresses that haven&#x27;t been spent from before should be safe. There&#x27;s still potentially a window of vulnerability between when a transaction is broadcast and when it&#x27;s confirmed, but I doubt quantum computers offer enough of a speed-up that it can crack a 256 bit secp256k1 key within an hour or two.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Post-quantum_cryptography" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Post-quantum_cryptography</a>')
