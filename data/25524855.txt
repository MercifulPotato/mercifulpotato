I&#x27;m kind of bummed out. The blocks seemed to not stick together. They&#x27;d just &quot;island&quot; and sit by themselves. I finally managed to push them together for a &quot;SELECT FROM customers&quot; combination of blocks. But there was a &quot;clause&quot; thing stuck on the screen.<p>I felt like this should be a really quick thing to do.<p>After all that I then got:<p>Ung√ºltige Abfrage: Unknown table &#x27;web1312.customers&#x27;<p>so the table I selected didn&#x27;t even exist. Possibly.<p>Sadness.<p>(Maybe its a firefox thing? Can I blame firefox?)')
