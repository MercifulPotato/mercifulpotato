Just need a basic whitebox computer with a TV tuner&#x2F;capture card to host, though last I looked into it (which was years ago to be fair) it was still a bit complicated to set up.<p>I always wanted to set one up back in the day but never did as I don&#x27;t watch much broadcast TV. I remember a friend of mine showing me his setup and thinking it was cool as heck to be able to stream all around his house or even remotely while he was on the go. Though this predated high bandwidth cellular data so &quot;remote&quot; meant &quot;on a laptop over wifi.&quot;')
