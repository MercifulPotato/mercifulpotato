Item(by='aww_dang', descendants=None, kids=[25519814], score=None, time=1608706316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514808, text='&gt;Iâ€™m not proposing that some purchases should be illegitimate<p>&gt;(sales) techniques available for cheap nowadays should be regulated<p>If I am reading you correctly, you&#x27;re saying that some sales techniques are illegitimate?<p>Aside from outright coercion, marketing is not violence. Comparing it to a &#x27;drone strike&#x27; sounds like hyperbole. Fraud and violence should be regulated. Segmenting an audience and targeting them with products is neither of those.<p>I have trouble with, &quot;there ought to be a law!&quot;. We have so many laws already. Regulations increase each year. The Internet has been a free and open place. It created so much growth because it was a new, largely unregulated frontier.<p>We&#x27;ve observed regulatory capture in other industries. More laws will do little to protect consumers. Gov has almost no incentive to punish those who are collecting data for them. History shows that the big players will gain an advantage, while smaller publishers won&#x27;t be able to afford the compliance costs. More platforms and walled gardens will follow.<p>If regulation were a panacea, the developed western world would be a utopia. Perhaps individuals would be better served by educating themselves and thinking critically about advertisements, propaganda and the media they consume.')
