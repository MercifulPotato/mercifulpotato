Item(by='masijo', descendants=None, kids=[25197840, 25197780], score=None, time=1606220198, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184294, text='IHP has a lot of potential and it&#x27;s getting better by the day. The way I see it, its weakest point is the documentation: things like changing the default UI framework (bootstrap), integrating react or another frontend framework, giving more complex examples (with foreign keys i.e.), changing the URL style, exposing JSON endpoints, and so on.\nI also didn&#x27;t like the automatic generation of controllers, views, etc that it offers, I found it quite more confusing than just manually writing them out. Maybe this is because I come from Django instead of Rails, but I still wanted to point that out: IHP is full of magic, this is both good and bad.')
