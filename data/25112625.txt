I&#x27;m very happy. I dual boot Ubuntu and Windows on my main machine (Windows for games), but I haven&#x27;t booted into Windows for over three months (busy semester is mostly the reason). My laptop is full time Linux and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.<p>As a developer, Linux is everything I could want, and I really want desktop Linux to continue to gain traction. While DEs like GNOME (which I use) and KDE look and feel modern and come with some great software out of the box, I still run into issues on occasion. The desktop environment is where Linux begins to fall short in my experience.<p>Windows and MacOS have the advantage of having a single &quot;DE&quot; to worry about, where as Linux offers a variety which are independently developed. That&#x27;s awesome, but when I run into a bug once a week, it really sucks. I can fix the problem no issue, but it makes me hesitant to recommend GNOME to a friend to relative.<p>Granted, this can be because I&#x27;m using a 4K display with a new version of GNOME. I haven&#x27;t used KDE or XFCE recently, so maybe they take care of these a lot better. If they are significantly better, please, let me know. I&#x27;d love a good out of the box desktop experience on Linux.')
