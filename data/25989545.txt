Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader&#x27;s performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other “success” parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.\n</code></pre>\nVague accusations of bribery without proof or a source strike me as FUD. But it strikes me as something most people would <i>want</i> to believe if they&#x27;re angry.')
