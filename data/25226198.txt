Most instructions on the 68816 use 1&#x2F;3 of the cycles per instruction compared to the 68k. Sega had their marketing of &quot;blast processing&quot; because Sonic was a &quot;fast game&quot; we all know what was pure marketing. Similarly fast games, meaning games that displayed the same features as Sonic, came out on SNES, Uniracers would be one such example.<p>I think it would be pretty hard to find a Genesis game that would unequivocally demonstrate the 68k in the Genesis was a win over the 65816 in the SNES.')
