You should have rules for what code goes where and stored procedures are also considered an anti-pattern by most developers because they tend to split business logic between the application code &amp; database.<p>Let’s say you decide to use stored procedures with rules about what belongs in app code and what can go in a stored procedure, the “discipline doesn’t scale” perspective would say that as your company and app code gets larger your rules get harder to enforce. So devs tend to fall back to the simplest, easiest to follow version of the rule: stored procedures are an anti-pattern.')
