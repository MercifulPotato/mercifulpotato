Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=[25706515], score=None, time=1610223838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703428, text='&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I don&#x27;t fully understand the mechanics of how distribution is handled and how users would find the appropriate site that hosts the content the user is seeking in cases where their normal node decides to block it.<p>There are several ways to address that issue:<p>1.  Use a site that doesn&#x27;t censor (or at least doesn&#x27;t censor what you want to hear).  Federate (you really should look at the links re: federation I listed a few comments back -- specifically, ActivityPub and Diaspora federation) with other sites.  If the big boys are required to allow you to pull information, you can still see what&#x27;s going on there;<p>2.  All these sites have mobile &quot;apps&quot; (really just inferior interfaces to their web environment), so you (and&#x2F;or others -- and if these sites are forced to open up their platforms it will definitely happen) can create&#x2F;use an app that allows you to access <i>mulitple</i> platforms using the appropriate credentials;<p>3.  Vote with your feet, as I did.  A site can&#x27;t censor you if you don&#x27;t use it.  In a decentralized environment, that&#x27;s less (if at all) of an issue.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many other ways to do so.  Those are the ones that just popped off the top of my head.<p>In the interest of compactness, I&#x27;m going to respond to your later comment here.<p>&gt;Is that what you think this is about? Money? Censorship is almost always about power and the desire to destroy opposition. It is a means to instill fear and stifle the discussion of any &#x27;unpopular&#x27; ideas. It separates people. Money comes later.<p>I don&#x27;t pretend to know what you think.  However, it seems to me that <i>most</i> attempts to create large groups of &quot;followers&quot; are focused on building brands and making money.<p>I am a strong supporter of the freedom of expression and the Marketplace of Ideas[0].  I abhor censorship.<p>But I don&#x27;t really get your point here.  If Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Reddit&#x2F;Joe&#x27;s Hip Hop Emporium&#x2F;Bernadette&#x27;s Universe of Knitting Resources don&#x27;t want to include <i>your</i> (or anyone else&#x27;s) voice, those are <i>their</i> free speech rights and they should not be <i>forced</i> to host speech they don&#x27;t want to host.<p>So what, exactly, is it that you want?  A place(s) where people can share their thoughts and ideas freely and come together with other place(s) that want to participate in that?<p>Or do you want to <i>force</i> others to host the speech that <i>you</i> like, whether they want to do so or not?<p>I&#x27;m all for the former (which is what decentralization is all about), but fiercely against the latter as it impinges on the right of free speech.<p>&gt;Your solutions are interesting but don&#x27;t address the problem I&#x27;m interested in. Thanks for the thoughtful discussion.<p>That may be so, but if that&#x27;s the case I <i>never</i> understood the problem in which you&#x27;re interested.<p>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t find your comments particularly thoughtful or well researched.<p>However, I&#x27;m glad we could have this discussion too.
