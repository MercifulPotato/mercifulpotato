Networks, name lookup, and VPNs remain incredibly complex topics that beginners cannot hope to wrestle with.&quot;<p>I kinda disagree. It&#x27;s probably easier than ever to set up your own mail server, in some abstract sense. You can get a virtual machine, use docker, heck, someone can hand you a complete image that you just have to bring up and set up with some config.<p>The problem is, it literally doesn&#x27;t matter how much the &#x27;open source&#x27; community comes together, it simply <i>can not</i> provide a turn key solution as good as<p><pre><code>     Desired email account: [________]@gmail.com\n     Password:              [________]\n     Verify Password:       [________]\n     [X] I agree to have all my data used in arbitrary ways\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not possible. There is no way to set up a server that easily, even in principle.<p>Or at least, not in a sane way. I can set up a site where you feed me your credit card number and pick a domain name, and I set up your AWS account for you, register your DNS name for you, configure DNS, and stand up everything you need and set it all up... but then we&#x27;ve got a split ownership interest. I can hand it all back to you, but you don&#x27;t understand the setup. I can give you root on the system, but when you change anything, my automation stops working.')
