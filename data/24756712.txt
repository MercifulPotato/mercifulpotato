Economics is more of an art or a social &quot;science&quot; than a real science, but I guess use &quot;science&quot; to muster credibility if they must.<p>What&#x27;s next. The nobel committee is going to rename the literature prize to literature &quot;sciences&quot; because the literature prize has lost any credibility or value?<p>Why not just say economics? Why try to sneakily and falsely latch onto the sciences. It may work for the short term but in the long term it really detracts from the field as it tries to pretend to be what it is not. There is value in economics, but not in the sciences.')
