Look at pretty much any free-with-ads app; a majority of the ads are going to be ads for other free-with-ads apps, many of which you already have installed. The thing is, outside of the Internet most ad spend is for marketing ubiquity, not direct response. You don&#x27;t really buy, say, TV advertising with the expectation of getting so many clicks or calls out of it. And, up until a few years ago, TV was the lion&#x27;s share of ad spend. So who knows if we&#x27;ll see an actual industry reckoning or not. The whole point of advertising is to waste money, after all, and plenty of brands were fine with getting nothing but exposure out of it.<p>More interesting to me is the fact that tech companies are finding it surprisingly difficult to control where their ad-spend goes. I suppose this is an inverse of the problems with supply chains, where Apple can take three years to get a connector vendor out of their supply chain even when they were using literal child&#x2F;slave labor. It&#x27;s a market for lemons; bad &quot;money&quot; (publishers, suppliers) drives out good. The question is: will questionable ad publishing actually harm corporate reputation to the point where big ad spenders go away, or will we just see periodic Adpocalpse-style waves of spending being decreased and then brought back?')
