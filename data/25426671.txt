Attacking the source instead of the claim.<p>&gt; The story also turned out to be not necessarily true, from another comment.<p>The other comment doesn&#x27;t actually contradict the story, though it is pertinent information.<p>The story discusses the problems with Orion and points out that Dominion uses SolarWinds software, with a link to the page where they use SolarWinds Serv-U.

It no longer contains the SolarWinds logo when it did earlier:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201214102053&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvsfileshare.dominionvoting.com&#x2F;Web%20Client&#x2F;Mobile&#x2F;MLogin.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20201214102053&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dvsfilesha...</a><p>I don&#x27;t understand why people think doing things like that helps them. Of all the election fraud claims, the Dominion Hugo Chavez bit is the furthest out in conspiracy theory land, and then they do things like that which are just going to end up on Glenn Beck&#x27;s nightly rant.')
