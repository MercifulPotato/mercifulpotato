It&#x27;s also hard work; I&#x27;ll put in the effort on topics that matter -- as in topics that usefully inform my future actions, rather than topics that have abstract moral weight or whatever -- or sometimes for entertainment, but it&#x27;s not a casual &quot;all the time&quot; thing and there seems to be a limit to how much I can do in a given day.<p>I learned growing up that TV rots your brain. Modern social media works the same way, except that sometimes you can actually engage with it and maybe it rots your brain a bit less in that case. This is called &quot;mindless entertainment&quot;, and various forms of it have always been fairly popular. When I use shallow reading for mindless entertainment, it displaces whatever else I&#x27;d be doing for mindless entertainment. Which is different from displacing serious reading, or even from displacing learning things for entertainment &#x2F; mental exercise.')
