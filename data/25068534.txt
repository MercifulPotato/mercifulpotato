For similar reasons, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best language to pick for a new product - it doesn&#x27;t have the largest community or most momentum nowadays, it&#x27;s neither the forefront of powerful tech nor the backbone of rock-solid boring tech.<p>If you already know Ruby, or you just want to learn it anyway, it&#x27;s definitely not a bad choice. If you&#x27;re choosing afresh though with no specific reason to pick Ruby, it&#x27;s probably not the right choice.')
