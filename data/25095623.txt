As you think about your overall career, I guess I&#x27;d ask you to not think of this as merely a stupid game.<p>In the complete context, you&#x27;re an accomplished technology professional who will continue to develop skills, talents, and capabilities throughout your career. How you put your talents to work in solving level-appropriate challenges and problems is important to your progression in your career.<p>So starting with the meaningful, real, achievements -- your ever-improving aptitude and problem-solving abilities, applied against problems of ever-increasing complexity and depth -- how do we best express that in a short, asynchronous format of about 300-500 words?<p>Inevitably, the compression of a human experience to this reduced, written, format will leave out meaningful nuance and important clarifications. But in the overall system, it&#x27;s necessary for the participants involved to have some way of prioritizing the expense of time, money and attention on interviewing and recruiting specific individuals. The alternative is unworkable for everybody - we simply can&#x27;t conduct full interviews of every applicant, it wouldn&#x27;t be a good use of company&#x27;s OR applicants&#x27; time.<p>So if, for the system to work better, we need to adopt this practice, then how can you best represent your true professional capabilities within a limited, constrained document such as a resume.  My post suggests it is with numbers, and my observations of actual behavior with recruiters and hiring managers show that numbers are better.<p>A great technical resume can help get you the interview.  In an interview, especially a behavioral interview, you&#x27;ll be asked deeper question about that 50% reduction in API load time. If it turns out that it was just a few minutes to implement, the hiring manager will, rightly, question your technical judgment in putting that forth as one of the 2 or 3 or 4 most significant accomplishments in your career at that company.<p>So rather than viewing it as a game, I&#x27;d suggest starting with the real achievements you&#x27;ve had in your career, focus on those and how to best represent them in brief, written format. Tricks or shortcuts like mentioning a task that only took a few minutes won&#x27;t work well, and leave you behind where you could be with more appropriate achievements.')
