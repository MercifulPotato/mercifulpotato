I&#x27;m located in bumfuck Appalachia. Have never been slightly affiliated w&#x2F;the NRA - but I purchased some ammunition online a few months back. Maybe that&#x27;s how they got a hold of my info.<p>Anyways - I&#x27;d highly advise anybody who isn&#x27;t aware of the absolute horse shit they peddle to look at these three images. The highlighted bright red was the only thing readable through the transparent portion of the envelope.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wweheo" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wweheo</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wwexix" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wwexix</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wwf2eg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;prntscr.com&#x2F;wwf2eg</a><p>The most hilariously sad thing about NRA supporters is that they&#x27;re either completely unaware of the Mulford Act, or completely deny how things actually went down, acting as if what was literally written into law was actually not written into law and that any document of the Mulford Act you can find online is actually a democratic hoax being propped by big tech. I&#x27;ve legitimately had these conversations with people. It&#x27;s deeply saddening and outright fucked. They simply deny what was written into law.<p>Anyways, fuck the NRA. Whether you are a fan of the 2nd amendment or not - the current state of gun affairs in California, a point that conservatives&#x2F;gun lovers love to bring up and shit on everything about it, is literally only a thing because Republicans and the NRA didn&#x27;t want black people to have the ability to open carry. When trying to simply explain what the Mulford Act actually was to some people - I was met with b-b-but bipartisanship is good! Why are you angry about it lib hahaha? - But completely lost their shit when bringing up the simple point that one party had tried to enact gun laws for many years and was met with an opposing &quot;hurr durr don&#x27;t fuck with our 2A&quot; - an argument that was quite conveniently forgotten about something like the literal day after black people marched on the Capitol. Definitely not racism though - don&#x27;t let anybody tell you that. Pure bipartisan agreementship. Also, don&#x27;t forget to send the NRA money for this special membership that is oh-so specially at a discount, just for you, right now! Won&#x27;t last so please send your money now so we can continue to be grifting pandering shitbags.<p>But yeah. Final thoughts - if you&#x27;ve ever wondered about one of many thousands of reasons these people end up batshit fucking conspiracy crazy - here is one of them, peddled right to your doorstep unsolicited.')
