Company A goes under and B doubles, becoming known as an elite company worth hiring from. Employees from A demand their old wage ($150k) in their new jobs, and if you want to hire folks away from B, you have to match their new wage ($200k). It ratchets its way up as enough people see net wage growth to drag the industry’s competitive comp up.')
