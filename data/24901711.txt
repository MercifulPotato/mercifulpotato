Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24901809], score=None, time=1603747916, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901081, text='&gt; The US has been having recessions almost like clockwork once every 10 years since 1950<p>Your standards for &quot;clockwork&quot; regularity seem to be quite low. Your own source offered to support that claim shows almost double that frequency from 1950-1990, and a maximum interval of 10 years, 8 months over the whole period. So it is neither &quot;like clockwork&quot; over that period (the frequency has on average dropped over the period, but the intervals are highly variable from one to the next), and not averaging anything like 10 years.')
