Item(by='DyslexicAtheist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611675402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916766, text='humiliation is just semantics here. the bigger picture is that it was the same forces and interests that were behind MAGA, Brexit, AfD&#x2F;Germany, LePen&#x2F;France, Orban&#x2F;Hungary FPÖ&#x2F;Austria, Northern-League&#x2F;Italy, Geert-Wilders&#x2F;NL, etc etc ...<p>Many other (EU) countries that experienced a right-wing surge - and it wasn&#x27;t an isolated problem of <i>&quot;the Brits (or Americans) had gone crazy&quot;</i>. US politics were more visible (=no surprise: biggest Western country and also noisiest media and propaganda dressed up as entertainment).<p>But to recall: S. Bannon and N. Farage meeting at the same venues, inviting each other to give talks and share ideas on strategy to turn the world Nazi (we have literally white power groups in my city who got inspired by these scumbags and followed them regardless of them being &quot;foreigners&quot;).<p>Meanwhile we know from Panama Papers that Banks got funding from Russia to bankroll the UKIP campaign, the Austrian minister invited Putin to her wedding, German ex chancellor Schröder immediately joined the Gazprom board after exiting politics and was instrumental to secure Norstream2. Literally every individual or party in the above list has received funding from Russia to drive their right wing campaigns, all while Putin is sitting in a palace. Also it should be made clear that nobody (Putin or any other dictator) would have had the remotest chance of compromising and undermining politics if it wouldn&#x27;t have been for the left and its incompetent self absorbed doctrine over the past 3 decades (and even after the 2008 financial crisis).<p>So while nobody is helped by comparisons of who is off the worst we should remember that there is a whole structure behind this who see it as &quot;fighting for their business interests&quot;. And while we&#x27;re in the next months no doubt all tearing each other apart about this the real villains are at large and hiding behind the crumbling facade of our &quot;democratic institutions&quot;.<p>IMO acknowledging that this is a global problem that needs to be quashed no matter where we are is an important step in finding a cure.')
