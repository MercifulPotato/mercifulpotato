Is it why so many of Apple&#x27;s new APIs are lacking documentation? Is it the reason the iOS Simulator doesn&#x27;t reliably export the accessibility tree needed to run XCUI tests without flaking half the time?<p>What about the fact that they haven&#x27;t announced a single new product category since the Apple Watch in 2014?<p>To my mind, it certainly seems as if Apple is actually organized to simply refine the innovations of its past, much like the conventionally grown tomatoes that we&#x27;ve all grown accustomed to. Apple is now just another amplified thing, very much in the mold of our post-WWII mindset.')
