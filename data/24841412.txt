Phone makers sell their audience to the highest bidder.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s actually the opposite of how it&#x27;s supposed to work. You&#x27;re not supposed to be able to use your dominance in one market (cell phone manufacturing) to unfairly compete in another (search).<p>If you read the comment in question, there is no suggestion that the cell phone manufacturers are competing in the search market. They&#x27;re taxing it, or selling to it.<p>So.... what are you trying to say?')
