Endorsing systematic exploitation like this is truly worrying.<p>This gets even more problematic when these same hiring practices are normalized and exported to other industries where the same arguments are then made. The result would be a society where there are two classes of &quot;employees&quot; - those worth hiring because they are already better than most and those who aren&#x27;t. This creates a feedback loop that traps the poor in poverty because they can&#x27;t improve at the same rate as full-time employees.<p>Companies have a responsibility to train their employees so that they can &quot;contribute work of sufficient quality&quot;. Making this entirely the problem of the workers until a certain standard is reached is really the &quot;insidiously genius&quot; ploy of companies in redefining their relationship with their workers. Transferring risk and investment in training entirely to the workers themselves is not a path towards a compassionate and equitable society.')
