If a group of &quot;neo-nazi&quot; tags along, that makes everybody a neo-nazi (much less so, a nazi danger, as neonazi is more like a kind of &quot;edgelord&quot; archetype for far-right leaning people).<p>If a group had the hammer and sickle or Mao or whatever on their t-shirts on a democratic side protest would it make the people there &quot;communists&quot;?<p>Or would mean anything about some &quot;danger&quot; to the US of communism becoming installed?<p>US was, is, and will remain corporatist and capitalist. Democrats, Republicans, and Liberalists all agree on that, and even if they didn&#x27;t, tough luck, it&#x27;s not them that have the power, the corporatist elites do.<p>There is as much &quot;danger&quot; of a fascist coup as there is of a communist overtaking, or as there was of Obama being a radical pro-Black president or Trump &quot;draining the swamp&quot;: zero.<p>The rest are talking points for masses with nothing better to do (and pundits that make money of it) to hit each other with.<p>My european 2 cents.')
