Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609818119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641713, text='&gt; Is google really encrypting each individuals email based on a password they have no knowledge of?<p>We&#x27;re talking about giving out a forgotten password, not getting access to email contents.<p>I used to work on the indexing system, not GMail, but my vague recollection is there are some master private keys locked in hardware modules for email storage.  (This is necessary for lawful intercept, etc.)  Access to these encryption keys is orthogonal to access to the account password.  My recollection of the Aurora attacks is that the intruders got access to some systems that were able to decrypt&#x2F;display senders and subjects, but we believed they were unable to get at the email bodies.')
