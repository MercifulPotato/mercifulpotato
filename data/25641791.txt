There are strong safeguards on humans using some of the binaries that do have access.  Access to these encryption keys is orthogonal to access to the account password.  My recollection of the Aurora attacks is that the intruders got access to some systems that were able to decrypt&#x2F;display senders and subjects, but we believed they were unable to get at the email bodies.')
