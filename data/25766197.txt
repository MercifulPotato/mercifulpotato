But I would assume that you can then find better prices for 3TB.<p>You can see it this way:<p>- if you want an office license, it&#x27;s 70$&#x2F;year, and as a bonus you have a dropbox equivalent for free for 1TB.<p>- if you want some storage, up to 1TB, OneDrive is 70$&#x2F;year, and as a bonus you have access to the complete office suite for free (yes, you can download all the office applications to run them locally and up to date, and also have access to the web versions)<p>I personally don&#x27;t see how Dropbox can compete. The competition is cheaper, has more features, and offers almost the same user experience.')
