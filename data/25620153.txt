It&#x27;s a relatively cheap, generic product.  I&#x27;d be a little worried about other unexpected chemicals being mixed in, but food is probably even more of a concern in that regard.  On the scale of things to fret over if you&#x27;re short on cash, vitamin D sourcing is probably pretty low.<p>Besides, what are the chances that a local store&#x27;s vitamin D is actually higher-quality?  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me in the slightest if they both ended up coming from the same place.')
