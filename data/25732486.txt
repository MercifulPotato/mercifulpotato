Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25732591], score=None, time=1610386630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732468, text='&gt; AVX seems to me to be a band-aid to the instruction length problem inherent in x86 CISC systems vs. RISC chips like M1.<p>AVX is neither CISC nor RISC. Its SIMD.<p>We&#x27;re talking about 1970s Cray-systems or 1980s Connection Machine (CM-2 or CM-5). Its a completely different paradigm of compute. An entire history of computing that runs parallel to the CISC vs RISC wars.<p>&gt; Then again, maybe the fact that the memory and GPU are all integrated into M1 also helps propel it over the top.<p>M1 has an awesomely wide 128-bit x4 pipeline SIMD execution backend. Apple is making sure its SIMD unit (for NEON ARM instructions) doesn&#x27;t fall dramatically behind.<p>M1 can perform 4x 128-bit Multiply-and-Accumulate instructions per clock tick. Its no slouch.<p>AVX512 is better than ARM Neon on M1, but even Apple sees the importance of SIMD compute.<p>The ARM world is talking about 512-bit SVE instructions. SIMD compute is obscure and niche: but its a parallel niche computation style with decades of history. Its the proper solution to a huge host of computational problems.')
