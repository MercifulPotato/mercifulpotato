I think this should be rejected as a slippery slope made of ky-jelly.<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t take security in the false refuge of consensus and the feeling that whatever you think you&#x27;re bound to be okay because you&#x27;re in the safely moral majority.&quot;<p>&quot;It is not just the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is the right of everyone in the audience to listen, and to hear, and every time you silence somebody, you make yourself a prisoner of your own action, because you deny yourself the right to hear something.&quot; - Christopher Hitchens [2]<p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY</a><p>bonus (the whole speech is quotable): &quot;Dr. Johnson was waited upon by various delegations of people, to congratulate him of the nobility of the quality; of the Commons; the Lords; and also by a delegation of respectable ladies of London, who tended on him in his Fleet Street lodgings and congratulated him: &quot;Dr. Johnson,&quot; they said, &quot;We are delighted to find that you have not included any indecent or obscene words in your dictionary.&quot; &quot;Ladies,&quot; said Dr. Johnson, &quot;I congratulate you on being able to look them up&quot;. Anyone who can understand that joke, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that 10% of you can, gets the point about censorship especially prior restraint as it&#x27;s known in the United States where it&#x27;s banned by the first amendment to the constitution. It may not be determined in advance what words are apt or inapt, no one has the knowledge that would be required to make that call and - more to the point - one has to suspect the motives of those who do so, in particular: the motives of those who are determined to be offended; of those who will go through a treasure house of English, like Dr. Johnson&#x27;s first lexicon, in search of filthy words to satisfy themselves and some instinct about which I dare not speculate.&quot;')
