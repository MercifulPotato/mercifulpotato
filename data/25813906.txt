I wouldnâ€™t touch any post-2015 MBP, but I wish I had bought one with dedicated graphics card. With each new version of macOS, things have gotten so much slower and laggy, even though I have disabled almost every unnecessary process and app in the OS.<p>The other day, I was working with a 2011 MBP with graphics crad and Chrome was much faster in that compared to my 2015 MBP. I think the graphics card does improve web surfing quite a bit.')
