That&#x27;s literally just a right-wing meme based on him looking kind of creepy in pictures and on video.<p>As far as being a warmonger... that may be fair. Unfortunately, Trumpists lose any moral high ground with Biden trotting out shit like him being a creepy touchy old man, or him being senile, or other obvious nonsense like Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop. They just throw shit at the wall and hope it sticks because it worked once with Hillary Clinton.<p>But then, Trump assassinated Qassem Soleimani, bragged about operations against ISIS and Syria, and has never backed down from threatening to use the military against anyone, like North Korea. I mean, he even tried to use the military against civilians in Portland. Hardly a dove. A dove doesn&#x27;t increase the military&#x27;s budget every year and add carriers to the fleet while cutting domestic health and education programs.<p>Second, yes, the people did want him. Joe Biden got more votes than Obama. More votes than any Presidential candidate in history. People voted for him despite historic attempts at voter suppression and disenfranchisement by the Republican Party. People voted for him in the midst of a pandemic.<p>That&#x27;s how hard Trump lost. Cope with it.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct...</a>')
