Also, Elixir&#x2F;Erlang isn&#x27;t mentioned when they talked about actor based concurrency. Neither is Rust which has some simultaneity with swift. They also didn&#x27;t really talk about problems with swift (adoption for example). Overall this talk is very surface level in my opinion, which is why I think some critique on Lex is valid.<p>He had the opportunity to dive in deeper on some topics - but didn&#x27;t really do so. It just could have been better.')
