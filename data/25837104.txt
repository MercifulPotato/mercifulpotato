I&#x27;m graduating soon and this is something I&#x27;m struggling with. I don&#x27;t like my hometown at all, my college town isn&#x27;t great and everyone I know there is moving away, and there&#x27;s no reason to live near my full time job since it&#x27;s going to be remote. How do you meet people in real life now that college is over?')
