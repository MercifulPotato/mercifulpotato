Item(by='mastre_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603552998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24879395, text='I am a runner and when I go for runs I don&#x27;t take my phone with me.  I have a Garmin watch that has music storage (which I also use for podcasts &amp; audiobooks) and some basic navigation&#x2F;mapping functionality (which I&#x27;ve never used).  I run semi-long distances, up to and above a half marathon for training runs, and never really felt like I needed my phone.  I guess it would be useful for emergencies, and when I ride my roadbike I do have it with me, but that&#x27;s primarily because riding is more dangerous.  The main thing I miss on my runs w&#x2F;o a phone is snapping a pic every now and then.  I would not use it for anything else as I don&#x27;t make any stops (I run non-stop), and quite often I don&#x27;t even wear headphones as I like to enjoy the sounds around me.<p>I suggest you guys try it.  And yes, that includes if you don&#x27;t run&#x2F;jog, _try_ that as well, phone or not.')
