You don&#x27;t need a free implementation to embed it in a browser, you can always implement it from scratch if you are interested. You don&#x27;t even need a team or too much time, a single developer is enough. I don&#x27;t know much about MOBI&#x2F;AZW3 but I doubt they are much harder. PDF is already there. Another useful format is DJVU and there have been well-known browser plug-ins for it.<p>I would love to see all these (not just PDF) to come with the common browsers by default. It seems sad to me they don&#x27;t. The only browser that actually took care was the old Edge. I was very disappointed they decided not to port this feature to the new Edge.')
