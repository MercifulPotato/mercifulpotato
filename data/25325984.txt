A lot of TLDs, people don&#x27;t even know or recognize. There&#x27;s questionable billing policies&#x2F;pricing policies. A lot of it feels like a gold rush from registry side, not to actually benefit consumers. Premium domains from registry, get that nice one word domain you want - but instead of a one time fee, pay it to us yearly to the registry. At least with a .COM the fee is low post acquisition.')
