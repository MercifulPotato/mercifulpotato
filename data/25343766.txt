It does not support all modern features and imposes restrictions on what you can wrap. It is also an external code generator that you have to install.<p>Cython was a real problem, so we switched to the excellent pybind11 library. It is C++ header-only library. Generating Python bindings with that is a breeze and it supports all possible C++ constructs. We lost at lot of weight and awkward complexity by switching out the foundation.')
