The contrast in tooling, discipline and information available to build anything in the data world is so stark it had me questioning my career decisions. Sure, you can read Kimball and Inmon and I&#x27;m sure there are a handful of others out there - but there are drastically fewer than what you can find in the application development space.<p>Things are getting better, Visual ETL tools are falling out of favor to proper coded ETL (spark, dbt, etc) and data teams are starting to see the value of actually engineering a solution instead of just throwing it over the wall to a DBA to deal with. But tooling, and general information on the web is still lacking. Pushing data engineers over &quot;etl developers&quot; or &quot;bi developers&quot; (or &quot;data scientists&quot;) will drastically improve any organizations ability to actually deliver real analytics and hopefully an industry wide push will raise all ships.')
