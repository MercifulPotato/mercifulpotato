Item(by='blix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609406369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25588609, text='One argument I&#x27;ve heard is that women tend to do better at men at picking up &#x27;soft skills,&#x27; i.e. interacting with other people, while men tend to be better at physical labor. New low-skill jobs tend to focus on soft skills, while jobs requiring physical labor are disappearing. It&#x27;s unclear how much of this shift is driven by the minimum wage, but certianly it incentivizes automation&#x2F;outsourcing&#x2F;illegal labor, which tend to disproportionately affect physical jobs. This leaves poor, uneducated men pretty vulnerable.<p>I don&#x27;t have any sources on hand, but there was a nice feature in the Economist about this a year or two ago.')
