It’s not like people read source code from top to bottom.<p>Also, this decimates your velocity is just straight-up coming from an alternative world. How do you write code, are you copying something by typing?<p>I’m sorry to assume it, but I think you only know about java development from third-hand infos and it has nothing to do with reality. Fact is, Java is so huge that for every unreadable mess of a project, you get someone working on robot programming or something totally different with proper architectural decisions and the like.
