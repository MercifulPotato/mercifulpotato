I got the impression from there that the conquistadors, or at least Pizarro, <i>were</i> pretty bad. Not for wanting to conquer and dispossess another empire - that was after all what the Incas had done to their predecessors. But they were worse in a number of ways: a) they were highly deceitful, surprise-attacking a friendly people, and constantly making and breaking promises; b) they were unusually cruel towards the Incas and went out of their way to humiliate them c) rather than ruling the people they conquered, they just tried to extract insane amounts of gold for personal enrichment, not stopping even when they had received far more than they could ever need. A classic example of this is their kidnapping the emperor Atahualpa under false pretenses and claiming they would release him if he filled up a room with gold up to a line drawn on the wall. After an empire-wide effort to raise the sum, with his subjects melting down enormous amounts of artwork and religious objects, they got the ransom and reneged on their word. What a tragic loss to history, for such shabby reasons.')
