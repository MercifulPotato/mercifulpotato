Not sure what gab is now up to, but from what I remember, it was just a free speech site. They had some rules like no doxing, but other than that they never banned anyone for anything. You could say anything you want no matter what your politics are, as long as you didn&#x27;t violate the law. So the issue for me is not really &quot;conservative clubs&quot;, but that you will get targeted by the companies up the food chain, just by allowing free speech to be exercised.')
