We write mission-critical, robust software that&#x27;s used by millions of Walmart&#x27;s customers daily.<p>Our suite of software includes but is certainly not limited to:<p>- a large distributed system that processes all store transactions from every Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club store in the US. If you&#x27;ve ever used Walmart Pay, this is how you get your electronic receipt!<p>- a massive GraphQL service that powers all customer purchase &amp; returns history for all platforms (written using our own open-source GraphQL implementation for Clojure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;walmartlabs&#x2F;lacinia" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;walmartlabs&#x2F;lacinia</a>). We roll out new marquee customer-facing features in this service almost weekly: everything from tire installation services to bakery orders to propane tanks.<p>- services to allow customers to manage and purchase care plans<p>- transactional push notifications<p>Our tech stack is: Clojure (for everything!), GraphQL, Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis, Prometheus, Ruby (for some infrastructure tasks)<p>Here&#x27;s a few things we value that you should have:<p>- A self-starter, self-accountable, curious, and DIY attitude. A lot of our bedrock technology is home-grown and written to solve our own unique Walmart-scale problems. One of the engineers on our team wrote an entire Clojure dialect (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;candid82&#x2F;joker&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;candid82&#x2F;joker&#x2F;</a>), and scripts written in that language now do a lot of heavy lifting of our own infrastructure.<p>- A good intuition for writing code that won&#x27;t fall over under pressure and handles failure states well. We deploy daily and a null pointer might impact millions of requests in a few minutes.<p>- An interest in doing DevOps-y stuff and a high expectation in good monitoring. We have full ownership of the life-cycle of our code and the servers it runs on.<p>- The ability to think and work in functional languages (Clojure)<p>- Experience writing distributed systems with a lot of message passing<p>We&#x27;ve got a unique holiday shopping season coming up, and we&#x27;d love to have you join the team.
