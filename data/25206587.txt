A well-written book usually condenses years and years of knowledge and experience into a few hundred pages.<p>Honestly the modern trend of having to make all educational content always engaging, with immediate rewards at all times seems wrong to me. Sometimes, its better to just chug through a book and boring formalization for 50 hours until you get to a point of clarity, because getting to the same knowledge via dozens of half-complete blogs and online sources takes MUCH more time in the long run. Books assume you will read the whole thing, so they build up the mental framework &quot;breadth-first&quot;, so it seems less useful until you get to a sufficiently high depth. Once you get over the hump though, its great. With quick online learning, they give you a few good &quot;depth-first&quot; dives, but leave the foundational &quot;knowledge&#x2F;concept tree&quot; underdeveloped.<p>Books aren&#x27;t distracting, they aren&#x27;t internet enabled and make it easy to just sit down and go through page by page. Online stuff is usually a great supplement if you miss some intuition but it hasn&#x27;t quite replaced books. Everyone is looking for some way to make the fundamental act of paying attention and learning easier.. but paying attention IS difficult. That is why its valuable.<p>&lt;&#x2F;oldmanrant&gt;')
