It&#x27;d come back in a week or so. Even once Edge started <i>running on Chrome code</i>, Google stepped up writing new tricks to claim that Edge was &quot;less secure&quot; because it didn&#x27;t direct telemetry straight to Google servers.<p>Google&#x27;s underhanded push with Chrome has hurt everyone, and unfortunately, Microsoft probably can&#x27;t &quot;target just Chrome&quot; in retaliating against such messaging, so Firefox gets hit too.')
