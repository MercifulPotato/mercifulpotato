Outside of exotic cases, good database engines are rarely computation-bound in a competently designed system. By pushing computation outside of the database, it tends to increase the consumption of database resources that actually are bottlenecks, typically effective bandwidth (both memory and I&#x2F;O).<p>As a heuristic, moving computation to the data is almost always much more scalable and performant than moving the data to the computation. The root cause of most scalability issues is excessive and unnecessary data motion.')
