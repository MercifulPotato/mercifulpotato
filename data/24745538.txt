Why?<p>First: “The markets will remain irrational longer than you will remain solvent.” Fed policy pumped in too much dumb money. If you don’t think like them, you lose.<p>Second: “Markets create their own reality.” Dumb money eventually creates smart results. Today access to capital is far more important than any other factor in success.<p>Third: “Opportunity is blood in the water.”  Good investments are entrenched stable markets.
