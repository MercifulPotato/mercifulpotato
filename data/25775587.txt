In the Netherlands at least, I find it hard to name more than a few individuals in my social group (university students from a range of studies) that arenâ€™t recreational users of XTC&#x2F;psychedelics. Having visited festivals and clubs in other European countries, I think the situation is not much different there.<p>It seems a bit pointless to keep spending money on hunting these markets when the market consists of such a large percentage of the population. Most people still get it through dealers aswell, delivery is quicker than ordering pizza.<p>More concerning are obviously the weapons, credit cards, etc. sold on these markets. Taking away the sales of drugs would probably help in that fight.')
