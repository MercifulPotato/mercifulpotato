It was never designed for machine use; in a modern RDBMS, 3&#x2F;4 of the time to execute a pkey lookup is spent parsing the SQL string. Yes, prepared statements can help in some cases, but they come with their own overheads that make them difficult to use safely in a large system.<p>&gt; You can also opt our of rigid schema by using JSON columns.<p>You can, but usually in a database-specific way, and support for that in drivers and especially at the ORM level is pretty spotty.')
