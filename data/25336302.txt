It looks like an impressive DSP but without an API, then that stuff is locked to Apple-only software &#x2F; hardware.<p>&gt; video coding acceleration<p>Is that really better than another 96-threads that you&#x27;d get with a 64-core Threadripper Pro? The thread-deficit of 32-core Apple vs 64-core&#x2F;128-thread Threadripper is going to be pretty apparent.<p>When you have another +96 threads available, I&#x27;m not sure if &quot;video coding acceleration&quot; is even needed. Just run that in software.')
