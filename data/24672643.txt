This article rings true for me, although with different colour choices. For example, I didn&#x27;t realize the halo thing was common, but I see it when looking at bright pink things.<p>The larger an object is, the more likely I can tell from that eye alone what colour it is. Mostly I err on the side of cyan - any colour near cyan (green to light blue) will invariably look like a single shade of cyan to that eye, so those colours are pretty much indistinguishable if overlapping like in the text examples. Eg: At night, the blue lights on buses and the green &quot;go&quot; light at intersections are the same colour to that eye - cyan. Until they get close (large) enough and then I can tell that they are different colours.<p>There is a huge difference when I do A&#x2F;B comparison in either case, but when looking through both eyes simultaneously, I don&#x27;t notice the deficiency at all. The brain decodes colour and fills in the blanks in unusual ways.')
