The products look the same, but it can be hard to tell in an image.<p>My grandma used to have the old ones when I visited as a kid.  It&#x27;s been a really long time, but I think the originals had deeper slots and the actual chips were a bit thinner.  By making the slots shallower and the chips thicker they&#x27;d be less prone to bending which prevented them from fitting perfectly perpendicular after a bit of wear.')
