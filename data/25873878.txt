And it&#x27;s absolutely not 800.  Indeed, it looks like 40 or so.<p>Surely there are technicalities that make other places &quot;technically&quot; gas stations too.  But then, there are technicalities that make any AC outlet a charging station -- virtually every large retail facility near me has one or two car chargers, for example.')
