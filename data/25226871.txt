He didn&#x27;t even touch the lock, he just reached through the letterbox with a lever and operated the handle from the inside. I felt a bit stupid paying him to do it really, because I could totally have done that myself if only I&#x27;d thought of the idea, but of course that&#x27;s easy to say once you&#x27;ve seen how it&#x27;s done.')
