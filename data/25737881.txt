I honestly don&#x27;t see them.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Xorg in one form or another since 2005-2006 and frankly since we all got automatic configuration and said godbye to Xorg.conf it&#x27;s been a very very pleasant experience.<p>I&#x27;ve been using both nVidia and intel cards, 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3 monitors (in various arrangement) and network stuff (ssh -X and similar), and a videogame from time to time.<p>Even xterm, with the right fonts, it&#x27;s a very nice setup. I almost can&#x27;t see the difference between a gtk emacs window and an emacs session running in xterm-unicode with proper fonts and antialiasing.<p>Xorg might not be &quot;optimal&quot;, but it works very well for me and I won&#x27;t be switching to anything else until a wayland or whatever reach feature parity (including but not limited to network transparency).<p>Whatever,')
