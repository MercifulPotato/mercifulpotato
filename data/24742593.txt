I found a used CD of &quot;To The Extreme&quot; later and snapped it up.  What a disappointment - not only didn&#x27;t the rest of the songs live up to the hit, but even the hit didn&#x27;t.  The version I had been hearing must have been a different mix from a single, and the version from the album wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.')
