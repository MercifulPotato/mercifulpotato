You&#x27;ve decided that our modern smartphones are evil and also decided that you must have a smartphone.<p>I&#x27;m not here to tell you that you should have just not bought X phone, I&#x27;m here to tell you that you have a choice as a consumer to buy what you want, and if you don&#x27;t want anything available, that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s problem.<p>For millions of consumers, an Android phone or iPhone or Samsung phone is a great option and is largely what they really want. The phones that people buy today are phones that most people have repeatedly chosen over others, including some phones you may have liked. Sorry you don&#x27;t like the current choices, society has never owed anyone a mythical Linux phone. If you want something that doesn&#x27;t exist, make it yourself or convince other consumers to buy it as well so companies find it worth their while. Go buy Purism. Don&#x27;t whine to the government that it&#x27;s not fair you can&#x27;t get a mythical Linux phone.')
