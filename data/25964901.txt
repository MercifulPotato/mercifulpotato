Are you saying between the short sellers’ world views and WSB’s? I have a feeling that a lot of the people on WSB actually work on Wall Street and are just on their phones at work. There seem to be some experienced professional traders there(among many who aren’t), but I don’t see much similarity between them and the shorters in particular.')
