Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604731872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012486, text='&gt; They get higher scores relative to their honest peers<p>This is predicated on the assumption that, as an educator, you provide formal assessments of your students&#x27; capability, intended for third-party consumption. I keep saying this shouldn&#x27;t happen. It makes no sense to assume, in the world where it doesn&#x27;t happen, that it will nevertheless happen anyway. The assessment should be done elsewhere, by someone who is not responsible for educating anyone.<p>Under this structure, it would be possible for cheaters to mess up the teacher&#x27;s assessment of their proficiency, and by extension the overall proficiency of a group of students. But it is strange to assume that they <i>would</i> do this, because -- I asked this above -- <i>what benefit would they derive from doing this?</i> If this action had any effect, that effect would be to move the curriculum onward from material they don&#x27;t understand to material they understand even less. That is a harm to the cheater. The problem just doesn&#x27;t arise.')
