The jokes look funny.  But absent the original properies, there&#x27;s no <i>commercial</i> value to this thing, so without Seuss and Roddenberry  this book wouldn&#x27;t exist anyway.<p>I think it would be a much happier world if we could trade transformative jokes and memes on the internet with impunity, but still agree that there&#x27;s a bright line between that and trying to trade on someone else&#x27;s idea.<p>Right now we end up on one side or the other: either we have to agree that sometimes good stuff needs to be banned entirely (imagine a world without Baby Yoda memes!) or we have to allow someone else to come along and &quot;transform&quot; our revenue sources for their own benefit (faceless corporations steal ideas just as often as they have them stolen!).')
