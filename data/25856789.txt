A better way would be by incentives.<p>For example, there are regulations that 100 ppm of pollution X is illegal, while 99 ppm of X is legal. Emit 99 ppm, and you&#x27;re good. Emit 100 ppm and your plant gets shut down. Even worse, you can emit 99 ppm for 10 hours and you&#x27;re legal, but emit 100 ppm for 1 minute and you&#x27;re illegal.<p>A far better approach is to tax total X emitted, not the rate, and not binary legal&#x2F;illegal:<p><pre><code>    100 ppm for 1 minute times $1&#x2F;ppm = $100 tax\n    99 ppm for 10 hours times $1&#x2F;ppm = $59,400 tax</code></pre>')
