Vision never ceases to amaze me in its robustness. Patients with long-standing (years) visual field defect from pituitary tumour will recover their vision within minutes of it being decompressed. One of the most satisfying things I do is ask the patient in the recovery area if they can see the time on the clock opposite them, - the operation having finished 30 mins ago. Most can, - this says much  more about nature, nerve compression and neuronal  plasticity than the surgery.')
