I&#x27;ve been more paranoid about which firms have my data, and after confirming individual login password is correct (via a manager) and resetting it forcefully - it will not allow you to complete the workflow to delete your account. It always resets to &quot;wrong password.&quot;<p>Interesting dark pattern indeed.')
