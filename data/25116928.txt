Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s <i>Metamagical Themas</i>:<p>&gt; In March of 1977, I met the great AI pioneer Marvin Minsky for the first time. It was an unforgettable experience. One of the most memorable remarks he made to me was this one: &quot;Gödel should just have thought up Lisp; it would have made the proof of his theorem much easier.&quot; I knew exactly what Minsky meant by that, I could see a grain of truth in it, and moreover I knew it had been made with tongue semi in cheek. Still, something about this remark drove me crazy. It made me itch to say a million things at once, and thus left me practically speechless. Finally today, after my seven-year itch, I will say some of the things I would have loved to say then.<p>&gt; [4 pages of detailed discussion of relationship between Gödel&#x27;s methods and Lisp elided]<p>&gt; It was for all these reasons that Minsky&#x27;s pseudo-joke struck my intellectual funnybone. One answer I wanted to make was: &quot;I disagree: Gödel <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> have and <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> have invented Lisp, because his work was a necessary precursor to the invention of Lisp, and anyway, he was out to destroy <i>PM</i>, not Lisp.&quot; Another answer was: &quot;Your innuendo is wrong, because any type of reference has to be grounded in a code, and Gödel&#x27;s way of doing it involved no more coding machinery grounding its referential capacity than any other efficient way would have.&quot; The final answer I badly wanted to blurt out was: &quot;No, no, no—Gödel <i>did</i> invent Lisp!&quot; You see why I was tongue-tied?')
