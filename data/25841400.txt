The general tone I felt was that things like tariffs were tolerated in support of their party&#x27;s leader, not the tariffs themselves. And the backtracking on sanctions on specific Chinese firms indicated there was little&#x2F;no significant GOP support pushing President Trump to follow through. The requirement that TikTok sell off its US operations was watered down into a nice lucrative contract for Oracle, though all that&#x27;s in limbo and the whole issue has lost steam, its fate possibly resting in the courts, or with a new administration that will be dealing with many larger issues.<p>The molehill -&gt; mountain issue of Hunter Biden&#x27;s association with a Chinese private equity fund will raise lots of loud rhetoric, but more for partisan in-fighting than action against China.<p>Meanwhile the US, the West, Corporations will pay lip service to decrying human rights violations and labor conditions. China will accept this as the need to save face, while any stronger action will be avoided to prevent China from flexing its economic muscles against the corporations or countries that rely on their exports. No company wants to be the next hotel chain forced to temporarily take down their website &amp; issue an embarrassing apology. No country wants to be the next Japan, cut off from rare earth exports.<p>Just look at Hong Kong: Sure the US has receded from such issues in the last 4 years, but it&#x27;s not like any other country did anything more than express their displeasure in various diplomatically acceptable ways.')
