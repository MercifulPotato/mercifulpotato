I find the result poorly matches the query I typed, the results are hard to browse, and of course favor videos on YouTube ignoring better videos that may be on other sites.<p>Bing video search is by far better.  Assuming you use DuckDuckGo type your search and follow it with !bv.  The result is an excellent browsable display of videos that match your search well, that can be previewed by hovering over them, and the results aren&#x27;t biased to just YouTube.  You can also add emphasis to words in your search with the +&#x2F;- operators and quotes.<p>Also the &quot;up next&quot; YouTube video is rarely as good as going back to the Bing search and choosing another video.')
