Foam, for me, is the best option I&#x27;ve used.<p>A couple of reasons:<p>- Setup and maintenance are effectively nil, and customizing it is extremely easy. This was the big drawback of org-roam for me. It seems extremely powerful, but even after initial setup, it was just a headache to keep it maintained (and this is not me simply hating products that require config. I&#x27;m not particulary sensitive to upkeep--I&#x27;m typing this on a Surface Pro 3 running Linux, I&#x27;m used to needing to fix things.)<p>- Graph view&#x2F;general UI. A big feature for me is the graph view, similar to Roam, and the associated UI (autogenerated backlinks, etc.). Foam is fantastic here. The general note taking experience is much better than TiddlyWiki (which I think is a fantastic tool as well) and I have to think less about constructing a knowledge graph, it just happens. Also, due to the VS Code ecosystem, there are a ton of nice extensions available for diagramming, embedding images, writing in LaTeX, etc. that make note taking nice without introducing overhead.<p>- Privacy&#x2F;open source. This is perhaps counter-intuitive, but Foam has been one of the better options on this front. It&#x27;s all markdown&#x2F;text&#x2F;html, as you say, but it&#x27;s also fully open source, unlike something like Obsidian (which has a fantastic out-of-the-box writing experience, btw). I run Foam on VSCodium, a community-driven project that rebuilds VS Code into freely-licensed binaries with all of MS&#x27;s telemetry turned off. The Foam maintainers have been open and encouraging about making sure Foam works in VSCodium ecosystem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;foambubble&#x2F;foam&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;foambubble&#x2F;foam&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26</a><p>My whole setup now is more or less run out of Foam. I push up notes to a Git repo, which triggers a deploy of a little web app I have that renders a site built out of my notes, allowing me to do things like view my todo&#x27;s or access information from my phone&#x2F;other devices. It&#x27;s been really easy to set up and maintain, and the Foam community has consistently impressed me.')
