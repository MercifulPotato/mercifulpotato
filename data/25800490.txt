I work for a consultancy that helps and assesses companies too, some of them selling for north of a billion. We can share general, anonymized, observations, and I would argue some of those are very valuable simply because of the breadth of situations we get to see. But we legally can&#x27;t cite specific instances. That&#x27;s the biz. :-&#x2F;')
