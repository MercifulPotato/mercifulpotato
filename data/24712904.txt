Foundational material in a subject is often &quot;completely disconnected&quot; from the reality of the discipline. If I was an engineer taking a first course in integral calculus, should I worry that my teacher may not be a seasoned practitioner, or should I worry that they are good at getting me to understand the fundamentals? I can definitely see your argument if this was a professional practice class, or something vocational, but it&#x27;s a 100 level CS class.')
