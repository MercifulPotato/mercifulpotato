It uses integrated machine learning components to control its configuration, optimization, and tuning. The system will support automated physical database design (e.g., indexes, materialized views, sharding), knob configuration tuning, SQL tuning, and hardware capacity&#x2F;scaling. Our research focuses on building the system components that support such self-driving operation with little to no human guidance. We seek to create a system that not only able to optimize the current workload, but also to predict future workload trends and prepare itself accordingly.&quot;')
