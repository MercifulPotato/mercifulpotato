The RB4011 is fantastic router at the price point and even has a 10G SFP+ port. Great hardware.<p>The configuration UI isn&#x27;t the best, but they also have a full scriptable CLI that isn&#x27;t too bad. Huge future set. I just wish they would move the newest version (7) along quicker in development.')
