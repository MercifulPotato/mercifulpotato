Are you developing native apps with one or two person teams? iOS seems easier to start. Are you developing multi platform apps with teams of hundreds of engineers? Well, Android is much much better.<p>Just to give an example, it is quite easy to build Android apps in a CI, while iOS is a pain (specially because there is no way to build an iOS app in anything other than a Mac). Also, most bugs specific to a platform happens in iOS (they happen in Android too, but my experience is maybe 10 bugs in iOS for 1 in Android).')
