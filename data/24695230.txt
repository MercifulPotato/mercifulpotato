Item(by='Atomskun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601965919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24690096, text='For a sidebar alone, you don&#x27;t need CSS grid (probably obvious). The point of this article, i.e. having something full-bleed, is implemented by adding a specific class to the element. Which means you would always have a DOM similar to<p><pre><code>    &lt;&#x2F;something that gets closed&gt;\n    &lt;full bleed&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;&#x2F;full bleed&gt;\n    &lt;next&gt;\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nMy point is that now, with a new block element in the hierarchy, it would fill the maximum width anyway. It is only because of being inside a CSS grid that you now have to work around the grid positioning which means adding more CSS attributes.<p>The exception would be if you would want the full bleed element directly under the sidebar (in terms of z-index). Here CSS grid is useful, but this is probably a special case anyway.')
