The &quot;version set&quot; defines the complete build, test, and runtime closure of the application.<p>In that sense, a version set is very much like a branch in a monorepo. The difference is that version sets are more composable and a version set contains only a subset of the repo. Like branches, version sets can have an upstream version set, so a common pattern is to have three layers of version sets: the central one (called &quot;live&quot; at Amazon) which contains your build tools, open source packages etc.; a shared platform version set which contains code shared across many applications; and then a number of downstream application version sets.')
