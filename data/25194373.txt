Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606182669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194265, text='that is precisely one reading of the original quote. Americans are rich, but even rich Americans often life in perpetual financial insecurity. THe average American is rich but cannot cough up a thousand bucks for an emergency, which in the US, can be life threatening.<p>It&#x27;s a new sort of poverty, affluent and insecure at the same time, and it&#x27;s probably not a stretch (given the content of the article we&#x27;re commenting on) to say it&#x27;s bad for health.<p>The average Dutch citizen might take less money home, but they also work 30% less, they won&#x27;t face the threat of not having healthcare or a roof over their head, and they don&#x27;t need to inhale car exhaust on a highway for an hour per day but take the bike instead. More money is evidently not the solution to everything. American society seems to be optimised around creating economic activity for its own sake.')
