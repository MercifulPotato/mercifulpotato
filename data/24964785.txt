It was so large and the forms had so many elements that the capture of data, testing, and subsequent state management in redux was enormous.<p>It wasn&#x27;t overly complicated from a technical perspective, but when there were forms with say 50-100 different inputs and dozens of state transitions, it was a mentally taxing experience every time to try to maintain the data model and state machine in my head when debugging or introducing changes.<p>For me the introduction of hooks was amazing as it&#x27;s allowed us to strip most of the redux state management in favour of managing state with hooks inside of functional components. We still use redux for global application state, but there are also hooks for interacting with that redux state too.<p>We effectively went from class-based components in react-redux with say 500 LOC in each class, 500 LOC in each action file, 500 LOC in each reducer file, all the way down to about 700 LOC in each functional component file.<p>I do agree though that debugging sucks. It&#x27;s incrementally getting better, but it&#x27;s got a long way to go.')
