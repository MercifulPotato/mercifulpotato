Here, I&#x27;d been carrying that around for years, and feeling like a failure.<p>I brought it up to my sleep doctor. I said I thought I had it because of my weight, he laughed at it. He said, &quot;If you are overweight, that can <i>exacerbate</i> apnea, but IT ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT CAUSE IT. That&#x27;s absurd.&quot;<p>My sleep doctor is suuuuper fit, and very lean. An avid runner. He said that he has a VERY bad case of sleep apnea. I was floored!<p>He said you either have it or you don&#x27;t.')
