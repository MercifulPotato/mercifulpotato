I did not say what my side is, nor did I say that any other side is part of the public debate. A debate requires at least 2 opposing parties, so not sure what point you&#x27;re trying to make. The point I am trying to make is that these people are not part of any debate, public or otherwise. There is flat out no &quot;debate&quot; happening because it&#x27;s primarily involving a special group that has become the victim of internet and technology allowing the manipulation of information to control mass opinion. Nobody wants to have wasted their lives away playing Farm Ville, but Zynga&#x27;s manipulation of technology sure is able to wrestle away that control from the common people. Likewise special interests were able to manipulate people at light speed by telling them exactly what they want to hear, and riling them up.<p>Propaganda is in the very nature of communication and because of the internet it has allowed special interests to capture the attention of potentially millions and instill extremist ideas. For free speech to work propaganda must be employed and countermeasures must be employed. Free speech doesn&#x27;t mean giving equal weight to all ideas, just like equality of opportunity doesn&#x27;t mean making everyone equal all the time.')
