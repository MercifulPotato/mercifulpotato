That&#x27;s why articles about people still using Tcl or even just people liking Tcl have so much novelty value. Tcl created a language niche that Perl&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Ruby quickly took over. It was all downhill for Tcl from that point on, for all the reasons you mentioned.<p>It was really cool for a little while though- I have fond memories of using it for a couple years in the mid &#x27;90s, but I would never go back to it once I moved on. Also, at the time I remember thinking Tk (Tcl&#x27;s GUI toolkit) looked mostly modern and nice, maybe even more modern and nice than other GUI toolkits common on Unix systems at the time (Athena widgets, Motif, OpenView, etc.). As ancient and bizarre as it might look nowadays, back then it looked halfway decent if not outright OK. I don&#x27;t know what Tk looks like now but I have to think it&#x27;s not that different from 20+ years ago, with the weird autolayout&#x2F;resizing policies and everything. Tk was a huge draw then but probably not so much now.')
