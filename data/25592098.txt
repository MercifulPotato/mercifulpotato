This is a shame, I&#x27;d like to hear the author&#x27;s analysis of its sandboxing.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, it is stricter on providing permissions to snaps than flatpak, in that classic confinement and special plugs require store approval. It has the same issue that most snaps provide access to the &quot;home&quot; plug for trivial access to much user data, but dotfiles are excluded so there is no trivial exploit through .bashrc, or reading of .config data, for example.')
