Google &quot;best low-risk investments&quot; - there are many sites with lists. Invest in near-zero risk investments and park your money there. Do not touch it.<p>&quot;Near-zero risk&quot; means near zero profits. For a ten year horizon, stock index funds are fine but generally considered &quot;high risk&quot;. As the ten year point approaches, slowly re-balance towards low-risk assets. Totally agree on staying away from options, anything leveraged or other gambles.<p>&gt; Look at the general trend of stock market. Invest only when it is going up. Never bet against market. If you invest, buy only stocks or indices you plan to hold for ten years. Never sell. Make sure to have stop losses added to do that for you. When those stop losses get executed frequently, get out of the market. Do not try to do value plays. You may not live enough to see the market reversal.<p>This would be trying to time the market, which is a bad idea. Don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t know which way the stock market is going until after the fact. The advice above is a quick path to buying high and selling low. Instead, invest the same amount every month and just don&#x27;t touch it! Time in the market is what matters.')
