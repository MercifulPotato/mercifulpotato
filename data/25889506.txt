It&#x27;s people&#x27;s savings, and nations put their savings into treasury bills so that they can easily trade with the US.<p>So the government really doesn&#x27;t have debt, it&#x27;s just money supply.  When we buy a bunch of stuff in the world, and when more countries want to buy our stuff, we want more T-bills out there so that it&#x27;s easier for us to transact.  T-bills are dollar bills that have the side effect of setting interest rates foe banks. We should just call it M4 or something, or maybe bring back the M3 category for money supply and include T-bills in it.<p>We have fiat currency, so we should govern like we do, instead of pretending we don&#x27;t. When we label part of the money supply as &quot;debt&quot;, we misunderstand it because it&#x27;s not debt as any other entity, such as a business, understands it.<p>One thing is that I wish that this article would at least better examine demand-pull versus cost-push inflation. Very very different situations, very different causes and fixes for the same phenomenon. Too much &quot;debt&quot; could result in demand-pull inflation, but not cost push inflation.')
