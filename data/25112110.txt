It doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the mortality rate.<p>But if you use that number on the whole population: Instead of a 5.4% mortality in 100.000 infected people of 70+, you end up with 5.4% mortality in 5.000 infected people of 70+, or basically having 270 death instead of 5400.<p>For the other age groups the mortality rate looks good, but &quot;not dying&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re having a great time. A sizable amount of people end up in the hospital (in some places more than there are beds available), that costs huge amounts of money. So if we could reduce that by 95% there is going to be way less pressure on the hospitals and less costs.')
