The customer&#x27;s cash doesn&#x27;t belong to Robinhood. Robinhood is required to provide its own cash as collateral, because it&#x27;s ensuring the market against itself. Those collateral rules aren&#x27;t just for margin purchases.<p>Would love to be corrected here if I&#x27;m wrong, but I&#x27;m not sure margin has really much to do with what&#x27;s going on, and it seems to be most of what we&#x27;re talking about.')
