I kind of over-promised for a small project, thinking that some electronics and little code could not possibly be too hard. After some time I realized that if I had to do the stuff around 50 times (project was a small sensor network), I would be stuck soldering for a few weekends. Then decided that maybe learning some ECAD along the way and getting PCBs manufactured would be cool, albeit totally overkill.<p>I cannot recommend Phil&#x27;s Lab [1] enough. He has videos which take you from basically an empty sketch to ordering a finished board in around 2.5 to 3 hours. Some of the most worthwhile content I have found on YouTube to date.<p>Also, get a multimeter and an oscilloscope. Any oscilloscope will do probably, I have one from Amazon for 30$. For my project, it totally does the job, although you may want to invest a bit more here if you intend to use it for more advanced projects. You cannot believe how many times being able to look at a signal has helped me understand where my problem could be and what might be wrong. It has also helped me figure out what questions I had to ask. For simple projects, you are always going to get there by guessing I suppose, but why make it hard on yourself.<p>Aside from that, just try things. It is probably helpful to spend more time thinking when you are handling more expensive parts, so you do not burn a couple of them out because of carelessness, but also, don&#x27;t overthink it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;PhilS94&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;PhilS94&#x2F;videos</a>')
