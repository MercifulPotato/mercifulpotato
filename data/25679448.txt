And in 6-7 years they might not be supported by new then MacOS releases at all (only security fixes). When someone gets the M4 or MX, they might want to retire the M1 models, or use them for server&#x2F;supportive roles with Linux on them.<p>Others just prefer Mac hardware (Linus Torvalds himself was a big fan of the early Macbook Air, which we used with Linux, and has welcomed the M1 model as well) but Linux software for various reasons.<p>I, for one, ocassionally wish to boot to full native Linux for some stuff. I have several Linux computers I use too, but I usually use those headless, whereas a Mac laptop would be great with a good supported Linux.<p>&gt;<i>What are you guys doing that you have to install linux instead of running a VM or remotely connecting to a linux box? If it&#x27;s just for the sake of knowledge I can understand it.</i><p>Besides repurposing an old Mac, even running a desktop environment as your primary or secondary driver is much faster and usable with bare metal (as opposed to a VM) and, of course, impossible with remote boxes (X forwarding aside, which is not workable as raw native desktop).')
