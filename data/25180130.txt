Item(by='csa', descendants=None, kids=[25180362], score=None, time=1606072469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179854, text='&gt; The SAT isn’t really coachable for most people<p>Based on info from a buddy of mine who runs an SAT prep business, this is a half truth. He says:<p>- It is tough to get gains from a kid who doesn’t want to be there — that is, the parents are pushing the students to prep when the student doesn’t want to. My friend actually tries to filter out these folks in his sales funnel.<p>- Motivated kids can get ridiculous amounts of improvement (40-100 per skill), especially if they are starting off in the lower or middle part of the scoring range (people at the top are capped in improvement by max scores).<p>- I have done some minimal tutoring for a friend’s kid, and his SAT score went up by 110 in math and 80 in verbal from a middling starting point. Anecdote, but still... My “curriculum” was just have him take a practice test every week under test like conditions, review the principles behind the math problems that he missed, review any test strategy issues that pop up, and give him 50 vocab words a week with skills on how to search for how these words are used in a natural setting. With a longer runway, I think he may have been able to double that improvement (the kid was smart enough to get a perfect math score, but didn’t have the confidence to execute in a testing context).')
