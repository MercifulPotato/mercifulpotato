The teachers in school are not there to teach you the most detailed model of the world, they are mostly there to make you exercise your model critiquing ability on some toy models that are simple to deal with. Your math teacher might draw a blank when you tell him he taught you an inconsistent notion of limits in calculus, and your physics teacher will certainly admit that there are holes in the high school version of gravity.<p>But the point wasn&#x27;t to tell you the exact version of what we know, it was to make you think about how models work.')
