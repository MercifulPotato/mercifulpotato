Just with less of the other stuff around it feature wise that Jira has. How your company uses Jira is not what makes Jira good or bad. Jira can either be used in an appropriate way or it can be customized into a big rigid process machine that we&#x27;d all hate. Been there done both. I like being in the Scrum Master&#x2F;team lead position to try and influence things into a &quot;less process&quot; world. Ultimately I&#x27;m probably still &#x27;hated&#x27; by the Devs because there&#x27;s &#x27;too much process and Jira&#x27; and the higher ups don&#x27;t like it either because they don&#x27;t &#x27;have enough control&#x27; (actually illusion thereof).')
