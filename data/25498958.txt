When I got into DSLR cameras about 15 years ago it seemed like Nikon and Canon were evenly matched with each company having a set group of fans. It seems like since then Canon has really pulled away and Nikon seems to be falling behind especially in terms of lenses(quality and variety). If I were to start getting into cameras now I would not look to Nikon, and it makes me somewhat sad to say that.')
