When you do that you start caring about how much money they make during the hours they work, meaning that Uber is now responsible to ensure their hours are spent productively instead of the worker deciding that himself. At this point there is no difference between Uber and a traditional Taxi company, since that is how Taxis operators. Uber can&#x27;t survive as a traditional Taxi company since the laws and regulations around Taxis and employments are so different all over the world and they don&#x27;t have the inhouse expertise to compete with local Taxi companies under those circumstances.<p>So the end result of AB5 is that Uber and Lift will exit California or become traditional taxi companies there. \nEither way California taxi state will go back to where it was before Uber and Lyft entered the market.')
