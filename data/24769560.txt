A &quot;pop-to&quot; operation.  If you&#x27;re ready to free ALL memory allocated at or after allocation X, you can do this by moving the start-of-free-space pointer back to the start of allocation X.<p>2. An end-of-free-space pointer, with its own push and pop-to operations.<p>In combination, these are often enough to get maximum value out of a fixed-size memory workspace.  A function can allocate all returned data structures on one side of the workspace, and use the other side of the workspace for all temporary allocations.  This approach does require tight coupling so there are a lot of settings where it clearly doesn&#x27;t belong, but I&#x27;ve found it to be very effective for high-performance scientific code.')
