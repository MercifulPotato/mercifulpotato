If it&#x27;s mission critical and obsolete, you messed up as a company. If you allowed that to fester for a decade plus, you&#x27;ve been negligent.<p>Now a lot of python stuff isn&#x27;t really that mission or safety critical. So, a hopelessly outdated red hat server that hasn&#x27;t been updated in years running some software developed over a decade ago may be convenient to keep up and running but if it&#x27;s mission critical you could have acted by now. The good news is, you haven&#x27;t updated in years in any case so why start caring about that now? Either way, it&#x27;s your problem; own it and deal with it or not.<p>The source and binaries are still there and will still work a decade down the road. A lot of banks do just fine running software written in languages that stopped being fashionable half a century ago, where the developers have long retired&#x2F;died, suppliers have long disappeared. Running their stuff on (typically emulated by now) hardware and OS that has gone out of production decades before the end of last century. Same thing. If push comes to shove, you can pay people to fix things for you. Banks do this all the time. But expect to pay for the privilege. Or just fix it properly, finally.')
