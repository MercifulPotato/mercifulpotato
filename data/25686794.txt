Historically, quantitative PhDs in healthcare(medical physicists, statisticians, comp. genetics) have been underpaid (in my opinion). Now with FAANG and Quant Funds willing to pay $400K+ comp packages to these PhDs, there are far more exit opportunities for these PhDs.<p>On a positive note, I&#x27;m so glad that clinicians are taking interest in ML! As a practicing ophthalmologist, the fact that you were able to self teach is really impressive! I do know that a lot companies are looking for people like you, who have clinical experience.
