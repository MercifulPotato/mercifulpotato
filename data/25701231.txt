Everyone I meet in San Francisco is against colonialism.<p>&gt; Have you considered that Hong Kong is part of China, was taken as a colony, Democracy was introduced and by supporting a different system of government, in a country that isn&#x27;t yours, is a form of internalized colonialism?<p>&gt; Our country is literally falling apart.<p>&gt; Our biggest problem in the west is our tendency to export our problems. China is internally focused, and will solve its internal problems in Hong Kong. Whether you like it or not. It&#x27;s simply how they operate considering their 5,000 year history.<p>China itself was built by imperialist and colonial actions. If you truly are against such actions (or if you support treaty agreements) you would support Hong Kong citizens in their attempt to stay some sort of separate entity.<p>People have this idea that an enormous unified China is somehow natural. The linguistic variation of Chinese is larger than the romance languages today. China being some unified country speaking Mandarin is about as natural as Rome coming back today and enforcing Italian on all its previous empire. I&#x27;m not personally arguing that China should break apart, but the &quot;5,000 year history of China&quot; somehow implying that they need to take over everything in the area is just a made-up historical argument to support their current imperialism.<p>Maybe we can&#x27;t go back and give Hong Kongers a voice, but we shouldn&#x27;t pretend like their fate was somehow natural or just. And we shouldn&#x27;t watch them go down now without a care.')
