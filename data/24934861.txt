Those investors are analogous to the knights &amp; nobles of the 1200s, who most likely will gladly support the existing system because they benefit greatly from it.<p>What <i>is</i> implied is that people _who train to be investors but cannot find work investing_ will be more likely to develop growing levels of resentment. They are in the same boat as the extra 25000 lawyers per year.')
