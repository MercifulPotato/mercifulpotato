Item(by='carabiner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609356758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584322, text='&gt; I will acknowledge that owning a house is sometimes like having an extra part time job. I&#x27;m forever fixing little things or gardening or changing things about the house. I consider this to be a new hobby, but if you consider it work then that&#x27;s something else to consider.<p>This is good to know and confirms what I&#x27;ve noticed about homeowners. I hate maintaining stuff, whether it&#x27;s my car or my furniture or whatever, and I only do it if the time&#x2F;money tradeoff is worth it. Some homeowners seem delighted by it though, crafting their own castle and the like. Do you have time for other hobbies that are &quot;big&quot; with these tasks?')
