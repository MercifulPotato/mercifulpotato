They take a long time to start, a long time to go through menus and options, and in many cases the &quot;significant&quot; gameplay is interleaved with dialogue, cut-scenes, tutorial, grind, fedex quests, etc... which is opposed to the old-school or indie experience of jumping into play and being challenged pretty fast.<p>... So going through all those motions is OK for great games... but unbearable for those not up to par. I could spend some time playing a not-so-great indie plataformer, but open world action rpgs and the like must be top notch or they&#x27;re painful to play.')
