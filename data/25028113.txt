Taxes are a taking of the proceeds of an enterprise, the more taken the more the owner is de facto the government.<p>In a socialist society there is no concept of individual property and therefore no concept of taxation. The concept of taxation is unique to a capitalist society. Beyond that, I&#x27;d say that what the taxes are used for defines whether it leans socialist or not.<p>Further, I disagree, taking the proceeds does not exert control or ownership until the level is substantially higher than it is now.  Either way, a business&#x27; income apportionment doesn&#x27;t matter as much these days thanks to the rise of equity.<p>&gt; [Rent Control] It&#x27;s local and state Democratic policy, and it certainly is socialistic.<p>Rent control is interesting, as I firmly disagree with it -- for being bad policy. I can see how this policy diminishes the value of personal property, though I could get behind it if it worked. The most effective approach I&#x27;ve seen that strengthens private property rights while also providing for the average citizen is the Singapore HDB model. [1] 78% of Singaporeans live in HDB government housing, and the rest have zero government imposition whatsoever.<p>&gt; [California Gender Law] Of course it is. It applies to business and how they are run.<p>This is a state issue, as you pointed out. I will say though, that I tend to subdivide regulations into &quot;for the greater good&quot; type redistributive regulation (which I think you could make a claim is socialist leaning in a mixed economy), and &quot;capturing externalities&quot; regulation. The free market has shown a total inability to capture externalities, and as such, certain classes of regulation are required for a property functioning market economy. IMO doing so actually net strengthens property rights.<p>&gt; [Single Payer] &quot;It comes from the left&quot;<p>I mean, agree to disagree on this one. I see it as the same degree of socialist as a DMV, police station or fire station. A necessity for a functioning free-market economy, and not a business. I believe having a socialized healthcare system strengthens private property ownership, private enterprise and the free market on the whole.<p>&gt; Do you believe Biden&#x27;s central economic planners will put the charging stations in the optimal place? I don&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t believe Biden will have &quot;central economic planners&quot; -- the Democrat&#x27;s will do the same thing government always does in the US. Find a private company, and have them do it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Public_housing_in_Singapore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Public_housing_in_Singapore</a>')
