Nonetheless, nobody wants Russia to have nuclear weapons, but nobody can do anything about it. They&#x27;ve already have them for a long time.<p>I don&#x27;t trust anyone with nuclear weapons. It would be lovely if nobody had them. That&#x27;s realistically not possible right now. As long as countries continue to amass them, there&#x27;s a need for &quot;more good&quot; countries to keep them. These are almost always democracies.<p>Democracy is generally speaking just safer and better than dictatorship. I&#x27;m just going to stop there, and not get into a debate right now of democracy vs dictatorship.<p>Would you rather have the good man with the power, or the bad man? That&#x27;s the ultimate question simplified. You want the good man with the power, then it&#x27;s a question of who is good, which would lead to huge endless debate right now.')
