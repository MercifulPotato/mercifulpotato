There is no absolute freedom and deciding what form of freedom to rank higher than another is a value judgement.<p>Collective freedoms intrude on individual freedoms (and vice versa).<p>So if a society decides, that (absolut) free speech is the most important value, it also says, that everybody must endure everything another person does say about them. Taken to the extrem every form of lie, verbal abuse, and so on is ok.<p>So you can either have (absolut) free speech. Or you can have some forms of things that are not allowed to say (at least not without potentially facing consequences).<p>As these are value calls&#x2F;judgments this will always be a topic of debate. And that is good. Because in the end every generation, every society and every group needs to define what is the major consensus. What is allowed and what is not. What are the value hierarchies.<p>In the USA, for example, it is perfectly legal to deny the Holocaust. In Germany, this is a punishable offense.<p>If Apple, as a private company, now determines what is permissible speech within their ecosystem and what no longer falls under free speech, then that is their right. Just as it is then the customers&#x27; right to no longer buy the company&#x27;s products.<p>The question could be, at what point is a company perhaps more than a purely private company and more arrived at the status of infrastructure. And should different rules then apply? Is it permissible to dictate to Apple, for example, that they are not allowed to make such deletions. Should we (be allowed to) intervene so far in private-sector freedom as a company? And should the USA then be allowed to intervene differently than China, for example?')
