I don&#x27;t understand why the concept is so unpopular?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not like anyone says &quot;He is Indian, his contribution is probably worthless&quot; about Sanjay Ghemawat or Vikram Adve, right?<p>Absolutely not. But I think that today, if Ghemawat made a typo fix contribution to 10 random projects for Hacktoberfest, at least one of those project maintainers who didn&#x27;t know about him would be yelling about &quot;spam&quot;. I&#x27;m not  sure how to prove this; maybe someone who knows him can ask him to try? :) This is HN after all.<p>Also, since you bring it up, I&#x27;m guessing that the vast majority of Sanjay&#x27;s code at Google is proprietary and not available to the world.')
