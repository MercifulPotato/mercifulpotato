Which society? By which measures are you evaluating the situation?<p>Not exactly, but I can completely see why some people think so.<p>What&#x27;s happening fundamentally is that the boomers are on the verge of retirement. The worker shortage of 2030 is set in stone and the only way to mitigate the damage is very large amounts of immigration.<p>the problem is that housing is limited, worker shortage means housing wont be built to required capacity, and our top industries are becoming parasitic at best. This creates political pressure.<p>Then add in the consequences, women entering the workforce has been wonderful but not for the average worker. Supply increased by demand decreased because political policy of globalism shipped jobs out of the country. Thus we have income inequality that&#x27;s out of control. We also have historic lows of marriage and births.<p>The blame is 100% in the hands of the government. you then look at the government&#x27;s failure and it&#x27;s a disaster. So many federal governments are functionally bankrupt and the debt is higher than ever. the government cant afford to fix their mistakes.<p>What&#x27;s the point of society? It&#x27;s the humans. We have failed in this regard. Will it be collapse?<p>Nope, but I know what&#x27;s coming to prevent the collapse. the governments know how to do this each time.')
