They have the budget, the iteration pace and will to catch up. If the US wants to get back to the Moon or go to Mars before China gets there, it&#x27;s entirely on the shoulders of SpaceX to get us there. Much respect to China&#x27;s accomplishments in this realm. The Russians are broke. I don&#x27;t know what Bezos is doing with the $10b in cash he has raised from AMZN share sales but it&#x27;s unlikely he&#x27;s going to push Blue Origin to go a lot faster (gradatim ferociter and all that). ESA will keep moving along at its fixed institutional speed. JAXA ($1.5b) and ISRO don&#x27;t have the budget to get there. It&#x27;s down to SpaceX (big assist from NASA) vs China for the new space race.')
