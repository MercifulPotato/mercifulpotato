I recently found myself digging a bit deeper into ethereum’s dapps and, at least that’s my feeling, found almost the same exact situation as 2 years ago. Abandoned apps, awful user experiences, unuseful speculative apps(at last for me). Ethereum is still marketed as “a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications.” Yet I have to find any real killer application based on the Ethereum blockchain. The documentation is poor, solidity doesn’t even seem a programming language. Worst of all It’s very difficult to find any piece of criticism around the internet, google only suggests me links of people giving investment insights. I really don’t understand the hype and why people are still reteaining coins of useless blockchains that haven’t changed my life at all(maybe DeFi?). Please tell me, am i wrong? What am i missing? Cause for sure I’m missing something, I’d like to be enlighted, I was a first time enthusiast of blockchain technology.')
