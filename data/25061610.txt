Ended up at my new destination at the height of the panic buying&#x2F;supply chain disruptions with nothing in my pantry and a single roll of paper towel. Literally as unprepared as possible.<p>Needless to say, I managed to stay alive... I completely stocked a new pantry with no problems, except flour and yeast, which was easy enough to find after a week or two of calling around. I did use paper towel as toilet paper for a whole week. Completely. Disastrous, let me tell you :) I did have masks that I use for wood working, so that was nice, but cutting up a shirt wouldn&#x27;t have been the end of the world. And I did buy the very last thing of hand sanitizer at the store, so that was lucky, but in a pinch my 2 bottles of cheap tequila would&#x27;ve done the trick.<p>Tbh if I had spent years prepping for a pandemic I&#x27;d be pretty disappointed with how this one went down... afaict zero prepping was necessary.')
