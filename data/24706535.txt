This issue is affecting many ThinkPads. I&#x27;ve seen it on T25, T470 and T440p, which happens to be the most popular laptop of &#x2F;r&#x2F;thinkpad these days as it&#x27;s easy to take apart and switch components, and as we&#x27;ve seen in this thread it affects many other ThinkPads as well.

Another way to understand this is to imagine what happens when you put someone with bad visual acuity in charge of font rendering: they&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s good enough, and you can&#x27;t blame them.
