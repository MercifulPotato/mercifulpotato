The only correct way to identify the actual error is analyzing the crashdump in WinDbg.<p>I recently fixed a family computer that crashes randomly after a RAM upgrade. Removing the RAM didn&#x27;t help, and it was totally a wild goose chase. The BSoD stop codes indicate some types of crucial system errors or memory corruption, sometimes in drivers, sometimes in kernel, but nonspecific. Finally I installed WinDbg and opened the crash dumps, and all dumps have the same error, and it became obvious immediately,<p><pre><code>    KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR - This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.\n</code></pre>\nRAM was fine, the kernel simply cannot swap from the bad hard drive, no wonder it crashes. But the SSD was known-good, so I checked voltages, and saw the +5 V had a huge voltage drop. Upon closer look, found a loose wire at the power supply.')
