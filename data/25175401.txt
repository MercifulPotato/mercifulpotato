NeXT can be thought of as a pragmatic Smalltalk machine that was adapted to the needs of the higher-education market that NeXT originally courted up to the release of the NeXT cube.  For example, instead of pure Smalltalk with its live object environment, NeXT chose Mach + 4.2BSD as its foundation (which made NeXT able to run Unix software), and it chose Objective-C as the primary programming language for implementing NeXT software, which added Smalltalk&#x27;s object system to C.<p>I&#x27;ve been knowledgeable of NeXT&#x27;s history for over 15 years (I was a high school student when I first learned of the history of NeXT), but I&#x27;m curious about the decisions that led to NeXT picking Mach as opposed to pure 4.2BSD?  I&#x27;m aware that Avie Tevanian, who was a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon who worked on Mach, was an early NeXT hire, and I&#x27;m also aware that before Steve Jobs founded NeXT, he led a project called the BigMac which would have integrated the Macintosh with Unix (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lowendmac.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;apples-bigmac-project-failed-precursor-mac-ii-next-cube&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lowendmac.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;apples-bigmac-project-failed-prec...</a>).  NeXTSTEP could be thought of as a continuation of the BigMac project.')
