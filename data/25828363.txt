The benefits of control and the costs of losing it are growing ever-larger, so each side will fight harder to get the power. Politics got us here. Voting got us here. It will not get us out.<p>Now that the social media companies have played the card of deplatforming the ideological opposition, the power structure of the establishment will expect that behavior going forward. When the pendulum swings, you might find some of the now-loud voices being silenced.<p>We can&#x27;t rely on &quot;the right guy&quot; holding that much power, since power corrupts. There will be no &quot;healing&quot; until the power of the central government declines, unless you think we should start building the Gulags &#x2F; re-education camps to simply silence the wrong-thinkers.<p>But what should you do?<p>Keep building tools to empower the individual against the surveillance apparatus of the state and of giant corporations! Build in ways to communicate even if large ISPs start blocking your traffic or are taken offline. Build ways to transfer value between users to circumvent financial censorship. Technology can overcome the dystopia that we face, since politics does not offer any hope of a better tomorrow.')
