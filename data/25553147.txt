I have daycare for my two kids within 200 meter from my home, and I pay less than $200 per month and kid for that. I have a safe bicycle commute that takes less than half an hour. I have the forest behind the house. In my area kids as young as 7 roam around without direct supervision on their bicycles. Im currently on paid (ok, it doesn’t cover 100% of my salary, but enough) parental leave and will be for another three months. After that I will probably use my legal right to work 80% while the kids are small. And of course free healthcare.<p>I know that this is far from what everyone wants, and wasn’t what I looked for 10 years ago,  but for me, now, it is almost perfect. And I don’t think there’s many places in the world I can live like this.')
