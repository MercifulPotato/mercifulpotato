First, you know you&#x27;re on extremely weak rhetorical ice, and also kind of outside the norms of our community, when you start quoting the dictionary as a rebuttal. The person you&#x27;re debating told you what they meant; what they meant is no longer a part of the debate.<p>Second, it is very much out of the norms of HN to do email-style alternating quote&#x2F;response the way you are. It&#x27;s also very difficult to read on this site. Try just writing paragraphs? We can all read the comment you&#x27;re replying to; we don&#x27;t need to read it twice.')
