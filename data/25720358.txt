I guess everyone has such examples. And you will also find such examples for MacOSX or Windows.<p>For me personally, I wonder why mouse wheel&#x2F;scroll acceleration is still not implemented. I implemented it a while ago for Xorg, which is outdated now, and also the maintainer was not happy with my approach. It&#x27;s now a long outstanding proposal for libinput, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;libinput&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7</a> &#x2F; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;xorg&#x2F;xserver&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;405" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.freedesktop.org&#x2F;xorg&#x2F;xserver&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;405</a> (original bug report from 2010: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.freedesktop.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=29905" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.freedesktop.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=29905</a>).<p>Anyway, I guess there are actually not too much people caring about this feature. And the intersection of those who do and those who have enough free time and knowledge to implement this is just empty.<p>Btw, I don&#x27;t quite understand the comment about KDE. It sounds like the the author claims that KDE lacks other relevant features. But comparing Gnome vs KDE, it is quite clear that KDE has much more features. This is never a complaint I heard about KDE.')
