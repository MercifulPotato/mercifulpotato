The inefficiencies have to come from elsewhere and at least partially from the node difference. An architecturally big one is that x86 only implements SeqCst for atomics whereas looser memory models can allow multi-process programs to be written more efficiently (which they have been already for mobile).<p>In other words I think the problem has to do with the semantics of x86 more than the syntax of decoding x86.')
