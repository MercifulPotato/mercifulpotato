I&#x27;ll respond to both points.<p>1.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say there&#x27;s not a lot of hand-waviness in &quot;soft&quot; fields. Actually, I don&#x27;t really know much about that, I&#x27;ve never participated in any &quot;professional&quot; humanities research. I do read papers from the humanities, though, but only about things that interest me. So I&#x27;m a true amateur.<p>I have, however, participated in academic research in what I think you call a &quot;hard&quot; field, in computer vision and image processing. I worked on papers that were accepted in some big conferences. I promise you, there&#x27;s a great deal of obfuscation in that field too :-).<p>I think PG would say that whereas what I&#x27;m describing are instances of bad faith in fields that do have earnestness, people who publish papers that contain the words &quot;whiteness&quot; and &quot;dialectics&quot; are just standard actors in fields where earnestness is not even possible. I think he doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about.<p>2.<p>I don&#x27;t want to argue about who has or hasn&#x27;t contributed more(whatever that means) to philosophy. But fortunately I live in a world where I can read both Godel and Foucault, and I&#x27;m happy for that. I don&#x27;t even have to pick a side, because the two wrote about wildly different domains.<p>But I don&#x27;t think having falsifiability encompasses the end all be all of what we can explore in writing. Isn&#x27;t that more the goal of proper experimental set-up? Even Wittgenstein, who I believe apprehended better than anyone the world in its logical constituency and relation, recognized the limitation of the logical method[1].<p>[1]. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kfs.org&#x2F;jonathan&#x2F;witt&#x2F;t654en.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kfs.org&#x2F;jonathan&#x2F;witt&#x2F;t654en.html</a>')
