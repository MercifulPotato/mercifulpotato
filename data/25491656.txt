Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608518696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25491579, text='The way the random access iterator was described in the article is not that it allows iteration over an un-ordered collection but rather that it allows random access within the collection. This would not necessarily map well to an un-ordered collection. This appears to be born out by the API which supports arbitrary addition and subtraction to the iterator. I could of course be mistaken.<p>What you&#x27;re describing based on my experience with other languages is simply an &quot;input iterator&quot; over an un-ordered collection. An iterator does not guarantee deterministic&#x2F;repeatable ordering, just defined ordering (as in, guarantees it won&#x27;t visit the same element twice), in my experience.')
