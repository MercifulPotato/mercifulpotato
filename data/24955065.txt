Of course, there are  general trends, like more linear DAC usually sounds better than less linear, but it is not always true. I mean, sometimes, two seemingly equivalent designs may sounds noticeably different, yet their physical measurement would suggest otherwise (which means, we are measuring the wrong thing).')
