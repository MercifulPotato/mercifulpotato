So what sedition are you talking about? I won&#x27;t comment on the rest of your stupid statement as you haven&#x27;t even understood what I was saying. Maybe learn to read the entire comment before you give your 2 cents.<p>---<p><i>Editing because rate limited</i><p>&gt; Not being an American perhaps you should be even more concerned about what you say. This just doesn&#x27;t change the US Governments view what what you&#x27;ve been up to, your government also will be taking a very dim view.<p>Are you for real? I don&#x27;t give a fuck as to what US Government thinks of me. I don&#x27;t give a fuck to what my Government thinks of me. I have a clear view of what has transpired and I know the repercussions this will have on internet and our freedoms. No one can take that right of opinion away from me. Not you, not the American Government, not my Government. Neither have I been involved in any seditious activities nor will I ever be. It just goes to show how anti-free speech America has become these days. It shows in your replies to me that you can&#x27;t even tolerate an opposing viewpoint without insinuations and veiled threats.')
