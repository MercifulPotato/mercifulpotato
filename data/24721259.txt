If I&#x27;m going to spend 8+ hours a day working on a computer, I&#x27;d probably be willing to spend a extra 20% or whatever on total system cost to eek out a bit extra performance even if that cost doesn&#x27;t make sense from a strict cost&#x2F;benefit calculation.<p>That said, there isn&#x27;t really a good way for developers to calibrate the hardware to their workload.')
