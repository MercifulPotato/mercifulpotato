As another commenter points out, you only need a shadow shield.  I don&#x27;t think there would be much more heat transferred from the engine to the fuel tank than in traditional engines; the neutrons would warm up the fuel some but perhaps naively I assume that effect would be fairly small.  Now that I think about it more, I&#x27;m not sure.  Is it the neutrons that heat the water in a nuclear reactor?')
