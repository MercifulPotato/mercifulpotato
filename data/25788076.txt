It cultivates the mindset that politics = party politics at the highest level of government. And then paints it as a bad place. Whereas actually people do political things all the time in their work and personal lives and even most of the decisions made by formal political system are made at the local government level in most western democracies.<p>Redefining a thing narrowly as its uncouth and hard-to-participate subset, and then blasting the thing (using its original wider definition) is a good way to drive people away from participating. Which is what we don&#x27;t want.')
