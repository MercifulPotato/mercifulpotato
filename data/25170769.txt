For example, I&#x27;m from Finland and I&#x27;ve been using Anki to leard Japanese, but there&#x27;s no Japanese to Finnish sets available. So, the only way to learn using Anki is to translate Japanese -&gt; English -&gt; Finnish. And there&#x27;s often new English words for me which will need a translation. I guess this kind of double learning is effective, but sometimes a little frustrating. I have decided to write some Finnish explanations to each kanji, which takes time.<p>Still, I think Anki is great for remembering new words. You&#x27;ll just have to use it daily.')
