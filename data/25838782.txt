Curation is a concept that I&#x27;ve grown fond of in recent years. Does anybody know of books that touch on the topic? Whether it&#x27;s archival, organization, displaying, theming, etc. I love that good curation not only allows you to appreciate a collection, but lets you appreciate it even more deeply the more you appreciate the art of curation itself.')
