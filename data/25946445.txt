You can hold a short indefinitely just by paying interest on the borrowed share value when you entered the position. You can even keep the short from being forcibly closed during a squeeze by providing more collateral.<p>Put options do expire, but the worst case for puts is that they expire worthless. Regular shorts can have unbounded losses.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;05&#x2F;shortmarginrequirements.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;05&#x2F;shortmarginrequi...</a>')
