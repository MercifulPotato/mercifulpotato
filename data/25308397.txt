In addition to it being a useful reference, it also aids me in the following two ways:<p>First, I am far more likely to remember what I have written than what I read. So it&#x27;s a great device for helping to cement the material in your mind.<p>Second, it helps overcome a sort of inertia I have where if I&#x27;m not reading a book, there&#x27;s a hurdle to picking it back up. If there&#x27;s a note in the book sort of summarizing where I&#x27;m at, it not only removes that hurdle, but I have the subjective feeling that I&#x27;m back into it with a running start, rather than having to turn back a few pages to get back up to speed.<p>&gt; It did take a while to get over the feeling of sacrilege of the book, but it has been useful.<p>I believe there&#x27;s a section in Adler about this, and reading that passage was enough for me. I won&#x27;t quote or paraphrase, because I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll represent their statements correctly, but I think that&#x27;s the source of where I&#x27;m at with this now. And the change in my perspective was very rapid.<p>My new perspective on this wasn&#x27;t to see books as less sacred, but to understand that in order to honor that sacredness, I had to consume this book in a deeper, more meaningful way, and form a real relationship with the book in a way that&#x27;s probably impossible without writing in the book.<p>Not to be too cheesy, but there was also a bit of an &quot;Aha!&quot; moment for me watching <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>. With regard to spoilers, the &quot;half-blood prince&quot; (HBP) had a real relationship with that book. It&#x27;s positively scribbled in, and it made the book better presumably for HBP, but also for Potter who ends up possessing the book.')
