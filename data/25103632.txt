For a while I was swayed by the arguments that they&#x27;re &quot;more free&quot; due to fewer individual restrictions, but I&#x27;ve since realized how many definitions of the word &quot;free&quot; we&#x27;re operating under and that I have a different one than many of the MIT License advocates. I would prefer a smaller user base comprised of people each willing to make a small sacrifice (GPL requirements) for the overall benefit of collectively-singular Humanity.')
