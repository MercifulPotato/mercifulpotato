The New York Post (the original source) is a tabloid and (for instance) Wikipedia does not consider it reliable, so there&#x27;s not a lot of reason to trust it too highly:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Perennial_sources#New_York_Post" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&#x2F;Per...</a>:<p>&gt; There is consensus that the New York Post is generally unreliable. A tabloid newspaper, editors criticise its lack of concern for fact-checking or corrections, including a number of examples of outright fabrication.<p>Also I think anyone can credibly point out inconsistencies and highlight the implausibility of certain statements, like the twitter thread does, because those can be easily evaluated.
