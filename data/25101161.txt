It’s similar to the wave of inexperienced developers hired in the late 1990s; employers didn’t have the skills to prove that the contractors didn’t know what they were doing, so a ton of money was poured in with big dreams.<p>Part of that is that they don’t understand what we do and weren’t trained.
