About 4,000 strokes. Over 9,000 new diagnoses of cancer. And about 14,000 of that ten million will die, out of usual all-causes mortality. No one would notice. Thatâ€™s now many people die and get sick anyway.<p>It will arguably be much worse than this initially because the the second group to get the vaccine, after health care workers, are likely going to be folks in nursing homes who would be expected to have much higher incidences of serious medical issues or death normally.')
