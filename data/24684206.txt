It ain’t you! It’s the people living there that make your property more valuable over time. If your renters do well your property value rises.<p>I don’t know. I mean you might be coming from a place culturally that simply diminishes how you benefit from the system. It’s a narrow minded, ill conceived, jingoist, reductionist culture that attributes all personal good to multi-generational hard work and independence or whatever and belittles the losers for being stupid or lazy or having inadequate families or whatever. But a professional landlord must certainly understand the basic economics of why their renters doing well is also good for them. It boggles the mind to make an error like that, which is why I’m suspecting it would take years of conditioning to be skeptical of your customer’s success.')
