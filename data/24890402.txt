Or that I had to declare it or something because I’m moving an amount above some threshold. Sure, it might take only 20 mins of everything goes nicely and you know exactly what you’re doing and someone doesn’t sneeze and tank the value of the currency out from underneath you, but I’m much happier going through proper channels where I at least know it’s going to work because it’s being done by people whose job it is to make it work.<p>Why would I use a stable coin, instead of just three fiat currency it’s backed by though?')
