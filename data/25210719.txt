Maybe it&#x27;s because it wasn&#x27;t that damning after all.  Or maybe because he realized the fix was in for Biden and any amount of hooting and hollering wasn&#x27;t going to make a difference. Or maybe he realized the information wasn&#x27;t credible, but from what I remember, it was.<p>Again, who knows.  Would it have made a difference if other news channels had picked up the story?  Probably.  Did it make a difference? Doesn&#x27;t look like it.<p>Look, I voted for Obama 2008, voted Libertarian in 2012, and Trump 2016&#x2F;2020 (for his America first policies, not his personality, which why this election was so mind blowing).  My background is in Finance, specifically Hedge Funds, and I&#x27;m relatively a newcomer to watching how Politics all works.  The idea that you have to stir your constituents into a craze for 4 years and feed them lies, so you don&#x27;t lose power is really sad.  Both sides are guilty of it.')
