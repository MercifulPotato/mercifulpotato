However, I tried really hard to guess the context of the photos and map those to dates rather than mess with colors and clothing, which can be poor indicators given how cyclical style is.  Biggest takeaway: it&#x27;s really hard to accurately guess when a photo was taken unless you know what historical event it captured or there&#x27;s a dead giveaway (like a piece of tech) in the photo.')
