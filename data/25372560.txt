One example is - if a speculator expects water to get scarcer in the future, they will buy it today and hold it completely unused just to sell it later. The same situation is playing out in the housing market in some cities and now empty homes taxes are being introduced. Of course no one will ever learn from real life, only half baked Econ theory so we will run into the same problems with water a decade later')
