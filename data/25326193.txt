Regular expressions are used everywhere. On the backend it&#x27;s text parsing, on the front end it&#x27;s input validation. I have never written a complete application without using it. You&#x27;re also the first person I&#x27;ve heard grumble about them.<p>I get that if regex is used in an overly convoluted or messy fashion, they become unreadable and unreliable. Just like assignment operators, nested division, or any other basic programming construct. But they are also remarkably powerful at solving simple pattern matching in a robust way. I recommend you go learn them instead of making baseless claims about &quot;the number of developers who spit on the floor&quot; when talking about them or whatever.')
