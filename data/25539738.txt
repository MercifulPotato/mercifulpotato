Light is light.<p>There is one specific difference between the light from LED screens vs e-ink : polarization. LED displays work by adjusting the polarity of the backlighting and then passing it through a polarizing filter. An e-ink display image is unpolarized light. It&#x27;s not clear whether the polarity of LED has the potential to cause eye strain or other negative effects, but it is certainly a quantifiable difference.')
