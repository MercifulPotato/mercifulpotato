No one in the government has any incentive to do anything. In fact not rocking the boat is far safer than doing something new, which is risky.<p>While I do wish the government would shrink heavily, another idea I have is to pay department heads a percentage of every dollar saved each year. As it stands, agencies want to increase their budget and headcount every year as that leads to prestige. If 10 cents of every dollar saved went straight to the head of the department, you would magically see millions and millions cut each year as they install better software, streamline, etc.')
