Across the station&#x27;s output, varying by show of course, there is a baked in flow of curated new music, and music new to me. Depends entirely on your preferences of course. For me in terms of novelty some highlights are shows &quot;the freakzone&quot; and by djs mary-anne hobbs and tom ravenscroft. Frankly, the djs do the heavy lifting and pre filter for you. On the whole I find a much higher hit rate that way than being left to my own devices.')
