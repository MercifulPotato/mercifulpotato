Text editors have the following advantages<p>- One config for all: no need to specify keybindings for each program, and other settings<p>- Similarly, multipurpose tool: a text editor can help with most of the programming languages out there, IDEs are generally tailored towards a specific bunch of languages and tools, with little variation possible<p>- Non-programming tasks: I&#x27;m doing an MA in linguistics, and plan to be a researcher; while coding is useful it&#x27;s only a part of what my text editor helps me with (emacs, in my case, but true even for VSCod{ium,e})<p>- Can VCS configs along with other dotfiles<p>- Free software<p>- Deep customisability helps automate away repetitive tasks add some nifty useful features<p>- Keyboard first: many IDEs have plugins for this and even embedding but it&#x27;s never as good as the real deal<p>Personally I like to pick the best tool for the job and I wouldn&#x27;t really bother with Emacs for Android or Java or C# etc., but when working with many other environments, customisable text editors are pretty advantageous.<p>And over that most if not all features you list are possible at least in Emacs (IDK how well they are done in the Vim world but I bet they have some great tools for all that, nvim esp.).')
