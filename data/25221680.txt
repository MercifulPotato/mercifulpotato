This would ensure against invalid states within a <i>parser</i> by making the type-checking pass another <i>parsing</i> pass instead of a <i>validation</i> pass.<p>2) The author then seemed to veer into applying this philosophy to application code. However, the author also seems like they&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with languages where the line between parser and application is blurred, so in that context this isn&#x27;t such a big leap.')
