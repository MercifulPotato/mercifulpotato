I&#x27;m not sure if any other free CI services offer PowerPC support - if not, it&#x27;s likely to impact PowerPC support (also in many other open source projects). However, an IBM blog post in July said they were providing the servers through Travis free for open source projects on GitHub, so possibly they will agree some way to continue to offer it.')
