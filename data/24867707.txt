Its variables start with $ and that is ugly: I mean, come on, I won&#x27;t even entertain this bigotry.<p>2. It used to be better before: This is just pure nonesense, before OOP PHP wasn&#x27;t good to create any big and well-structured application, it is ironic because most of the bad opinions about PHP come from people who used it a long time ago. Besides, you can still use PHP as you used to, but now you have more tools at your dispossal, You are free to use it as before.<p>3. It is trying to be Java: Well, sure it is more like Java, only less verbose and easier to write. Developers can be much more productive in PHP. And moving in the direction of Java is not a bad thing as the language moved into the Enterprise space. I worked with Magento every day and I am glad the language is more than Java than it used to be, it means we can organise our code better. Again, ironic that some people who mentioned this as something bad about PHP, then went on to say they prefer Java.<p>4. Composer has made the language worse: Honestly this is so ridiculous... so now having package managers is a bad thing? I haven&#x27;t met an actual professional PHP programmer who holds that opinion. All of them like composer, it makes reusing code and creating apps in PHP much easier.')
