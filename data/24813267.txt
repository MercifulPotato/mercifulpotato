If you understand some &quot;deep&quot; understanding of &quot;meaning&quot; to &quot;vision&quot; things to drop the &quot;meaning=necessary&quot; condition (this is according to modern kripean semantics in theory of computer science), you&#x27;ll see that huge M:N matrix are just arbitrary meaning with implicit biased meaning that your experience can just mean non-linear-data that can just easily be reshaped using deformation theory or renormalization groups (common in modern day physics) to overload (modern mathmatical domain shifts between set thoeretic math to more organized category theory math) so you can just co-autocompute the co-monad of meaniningful using a applicative language (you get a rich frame as a set of un-sequences) or just think of arbitrary computations as bits using a convex optimization as compactifications in as arbitrary string theories in quantum field theory.<p>Hint: One thing SIL has for it is a rich way to be an arbitrary bridge over arbitrary langs but those don&#x27;t actually matter so much those are just arbitary combinatorial thinking. Much more powerful is to think allows big step small step semantics and whether arbitary straight line programs can be differenced or not. So thus if you understand thinks properly, it&#x27;s better to just autoconvert that by overloading SIL using a first order substructural finite language like Rust where different modules give you Ocaml-like syntax but the borrow checker and type checker allows two &quot;safe&quot; locally lexical scopped ways of understanding how to reinvent those things to do free construction of work using modern math (hint: use constructive co-homologies) to create cast arb vector fields then make sure they are validated by good sound testing practices to a discrete encoding figure how how two arbitary associated classes of stuff that represent 2-transitive closures can be recombinated in a different weak linear 1-dimensional L-R module where very verbose but safe &quot;local-global&quot; laws can safely coexist where software hardware can interact at much analogies to antenna gain to transmux additon::multiplication n-hz to n^n^n polylog microprocessored:flipflops<p>Remember = names = arbitary\nstrutural pattern inferencing under right semantics might show you better ways of clearly thinking. but you&#x27;d have to basically understand some concept of inverse scattering theories and some generalization of arbitrary caclulus of differences and fluxions over some local. This is very important because wrong use of analog spectrum can hurt other beings. But digital spectra has theoretically infinite bandwidth if two cryptographic processes agree to the same cryptographic session they can do just do whatever and save &quot;effort&quot; work.')
