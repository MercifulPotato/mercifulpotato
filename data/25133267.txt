Inside of the M1, the results are ground-breaking: A single Firestorm achieves memory reads up to around 58GB&#x2F;s, with memory writes coming in at 33-36GB&#x2F;s. Most importantly, memory copies land in at 60 to 62GB&#x2F;s depending if you’re using scalar or vector instructions. The fact that a single Firestorm core can almost saturate the memory controllers is astounding and something we’ve never seen in a design before.”')
