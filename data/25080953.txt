Item(by='koonsolo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605263695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074398, text='&gt; software engineering IS &quot;factory&quot; work because its the grunt work of building what should be a well understood system<p>So what are you implying here? That we should go the Waterfall route and have 100% clear and finished specs? Good luck with that buddy. You&#x27;re just shifting the <i>real</i> problem outside of your &quot;software engineering&quot; space.<p>In my 20 year career, I&#x27;ve never built a &quot;well understood system&quot;.<p>Some things can be built 10 times faster with the right idea. Some features can be supported by a single, simple one. Some screw-ups can take forever to fix. 100% code coverage won&#x27;t give you bug free software.<p>Building software is all about the skills of people (developers, analysts, managers, testers, ...). The better the people, and the more power you give them, the better your project will go. If you hire bad people and have to put processes in place so they don&#x27;t screw up, you&#x27;re in trouble.')
