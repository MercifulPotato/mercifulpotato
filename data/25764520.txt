I have no idea how he wormed his way back in, but this does not bode well for Intel&#x27;s future: Gelsinger is proof of the &quot;Peter Principle&quot;, being promoted too high.<p>EDIT: I was a bit harsh, toned it down.<p>EDIT 2: This is probably petty, but I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that there was a significant hubbub at Intel regarding him using the &quot;Dr&quot; prefix. He scrubbed it from his bio and internal pages when it was pointed it out didn&#x27;t come from an accredited university and that it was honorary. He also caught flak internally for having the pope bless a wafer for Intel&#x27;s future success. It was very weird, especially given the high percentage of Muslim engineers at Intel, and its focus on neutrality.')
