Yes Japanese uses Chinese characters that&#x27;s only a subset of Japanese. Japanese sentences are typically a bit longer than English in terms of syllables and written length - their main reduction technique at the language level is omission, rarely efficiency improvement.<p>- Why&#x27;s it so hot today? = 6 syllables<p>- Nande konna ni atsui no kyou? = 10 syllables (spoken colloquially)<p>What about written length? You can see the Japanese sentence is a little longer here (when the English uses a non-monospaced font). It&#x27;s also enough to demonstrates the why using kanji doesn&#x27;t always provide the huge reduction&#x2F;compression that you&#x27;re expecting.<p>- Why&#x27;s it so hot today?<p>- なんでこんなに暑いの今日？')
