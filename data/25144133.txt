He had his carrier&#x27;s tracking app installed on his son&#x27;s phone so he could see where he was. The son figured out how to disable it.<p>So he wrote an android service that&#x27;ll send him the location whenever he needs it and installed it on the phone. His son doesn&#x27;t know about it... yet.<p>He fully understands this is an &quot;arms race&quot; of sorts and I think he feels like if his son is smart enough to outsmart his dad, he&#x27;s probably smart enough to handle himself with a little less supervision. (I think the kid was in about 8th grade at the time.)')
