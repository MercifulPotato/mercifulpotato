Item(by='tobr', descendants=None, kids=[25089947], score=None, time=1605303453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079095, text='&gt; I feel it&#x27;s pretty funny that you think they&#x27;re not logos.<p>I didn&#x27;t say they weren&#x27;t logos, I asked in what <i>way</i> you intended them to be logos rather than some other type of graphics.<p>It was posted as a Show HN, which is an invitation for the community to look at it and give feedback. I found myself a little puzzled over <i>what</i> I was looking at. To be clear, it&#x27;s fine that you think of them as logos! But in common parlance, a logo represents a specific thing. It&#x27;s not the shape of the Mitsubishi logo that makes it a logo. It&#x27;s how it&#x27;s used to represent Mitsubishi.<p>These are 1000 generated designs that don&#x27;t <i>seem</i> to represent anything in particular. The two interpretations I could imagine was either that you were offering them as &quot;free logos&quot; for anyone to use, or that you created a generative design system for your own use, where the logo might look different every time.<p>You don&#x27;t need to get so defensive over some downvotes (fwiw, complaining about it is against the guidelines, and your complaints about it dominates the thread by now). You made a cool thing and it&#x27;s an interesting design study, but as a Show HN it&#x27;s just not very clear what it is or how it&#x27;s intended to be used.')
