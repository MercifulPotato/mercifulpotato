My wife was prescribed it one time. She would take it and then soon after want to have sex. Mind blowing sex (for me) every time. She was insatiable and wanted to do things way outside her norm. But the next day she had absolutely no memory of any of it. That weirded me out and I encouraged her to stop taking them. Though to be honest I wouldn&#x27;t mind one or two of the ambien fueled sex sessions a year. Absolutely mind blowing, but also exhausting.')
