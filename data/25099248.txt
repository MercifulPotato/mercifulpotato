The ideal mounting height for the TV is such that when you are in your comfortable viewing position, your eyes should be roughly aligned just below the top part of the TV (for big TVs this is difficult so I aim for 20% from the top).<p>I&#x27;ve seen countless HGTV make-overs where they put the TV other the freaking fireplace - just horrible.  This is slightly better, but still bad.<p>The idea is simple and not actually new; I saw a similar idea years ago where instead of a home office it enclosed a small bedroom with bunk bed.  It seems it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to replicate for anyone able to make their own shelves.')
