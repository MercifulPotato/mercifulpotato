I think it&#x27;s ultimately in Apple&#x27;s interest to try to make tooling that enables MacOS&#x2F;iOS apps to work on other platforms too, including the web.<p>Even their own apps would benefit from this. What if iMessage and FaceTime were cross-platform? Short term, maybe it was a moat for Apple - but now there are so many other cross-platform apps which will slowly kill the Apple-only ones because of network effects (pronounced in chat&#x2F;calling&#x2F;social apps).<p>I think iMessage and FaceTime could have taken significant market share from WhatsApp and Zoom&#x2F;Skype - this will become even more relevant when those apps become more platform-like (WeChat style).')
