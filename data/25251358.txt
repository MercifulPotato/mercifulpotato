I believe that he’s just speaking about how he’s driven, and there’s at least a recognition that this is a double-edged sword (“Even in gambling”). The article sure seems to suggest that he has come to terms with the negative impact he’s had on his family and friends and the fact that he took it all for granted.<p>I think this is true of driven people (and narcissists) generally, and it doesn’t make them innately bad or worthy of scorn, just as you shouldn’t get upset at a child for lacking the emotional control of an adult. He’s not really so different from other driven iconoclasts, like a Musk or Jobs. Their personal lives often have a trail of strained relationships (divorces, estranged children). This story is particularly good IMHO because his drive ultimately ruins him, but he finds some small redemption in the end.')
