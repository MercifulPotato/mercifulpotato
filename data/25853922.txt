They launder their claims via US NGOs to MSM - turducken of creating misinformation. Prior to current China&#x2F;FVEY spat, formal government level investigations by AU&#x2F;US have found FLG sponsored reports to be non-credible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20120205064042&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usembassy.it&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;other&#x2F;RL33437.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20120205064042&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usemba...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.refworld.org&#x2F;pdfid&#x2F;4b6fe16df.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.refworld.org&#x2F;pdfid&#x2F;4b6fe16df.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20090620050738&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.america.gov&#x2F;st&#x2F;washfile-english&#x2F;2006&#x2F;None&#x2F;20060416141157uhyggep0.5443231.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20090620050738&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americ...</a><p>At this time, Chinese political structure was _thoroughly_ infiltrated by CIA assets. There&#x27;s also orthogonal indicators like amount of immuno-suppressant drugs in Chinese market cannot support a vast shadow organ harvesting system like FLG claims. There&#x27;s a reason no credible institutions without FLG sponsorship have ever endorsed these findings. Including Mike Pompeo, at the urging for US lawmakers no less, who got drunk on FLG&#x2F;epochtime coolaid. There&#x27;s a special tier of ridiculous claims when even Pompeo can&#x27;t spin it against China. FLG organ harvesting &#x2F; vivisection has always been atrocity porn for useful idiots. It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising these narratives are finally gaining traction during a period where media landscape is generating loads of them, when epochetimes is the #1 news paper on the appstore.<p>I say this as someone with several FLG family members who was prosecuted in China, they are delusional cultists. Everything is peaceful and good intensions until they convince themselves not to seek medical advice and dies from completely preventable illnesses.')
