The Seattle area has an urban growth boundary [2, see the red line] that effectively bans construction of new single family housing. The Seattle government also makes it impossible to get a project approved if it has &quot;too many&quot; parking spots and the the vast majority of the transit system is not paid for by its riders: Sound Transit, Seattle&#x27;s train and express buses, has around 30-40% farebox recovery of operating costs, and capital costs are fully subsidized [3, Page 8]. King County Metro, the bus system, has a farebox recovery of around 25%, again with capital costs being fully subsidized [4, last graph]. User fees (tolls, car registration, gas taxes, etc.) pay a far larger percentage of roads than this: Washington collects 63.5% of road spending from user fees, which is a figure that includes both capital (new roads) and operational (maintenance on existing roads) costs [5]. So someone living in the Seattle area who wants to have a &quot;different lifestyle&quot; has to pay to subsidize the government&#x27;s preferred lifestyle. Seattle isn&#x27;t the only region with a strong bias towards transit (especially with new development), so generalizing across the entire country isn&#x27;t helpful as different areas have very different urban planning cultures.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;p530" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;p530</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kingcounty.gov&#x2F;property&#x2F;permits&#x2F;codes&#x2F;growth&#x2F;GMPC&#x2F;~&#x2F;media&#x2F;property&#x2F;permits&#x2F;documents&#x2F;GrowthManagement&#x2F;CPP_ugb_gmpc_Map.ashx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kingcounty.gov&#x2F;property&#x2F;permits&#x2F;codes&#x2F;growth&#x2F;GMP...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundtransit.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2018-fare-revenue-report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.soundtransit.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;2...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kingcounty.gov&#x2F;depts&#x2F;transportation&#x2F;metro&#x2F;about&#x2F;accountability-center&#x2F;performance&#x2F;financial&#x2F;annual.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kingcounty.gov&#x2F;depts&#x2F;transportation&#x2F;metro&#x2F;about&#x2F;acco...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;states-road-funding-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;states-road-funding-2019&#x2F;</a>')
