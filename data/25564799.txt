Why would it do any IO?<p>Anyway, CRUD does really not lead to clear &quot;is IO&quot;&#x2F;&quot;isn&#x27;t IO&quot; boundaries, and the business logic isn&#x27;t a good candidate for separating from IO into a pure core. Instead, it is a great candidate for separating into a &quot;with business data&quot; context that is neither simple IO nor pure.<p>On the implementation of that &quot;with business data&quot; context you will find plenty of opportunities to push IO to the boundaries of complex code that will become pure. But your intuition is correct, what you are missing is that the code can be broken on more dimensions than the ones you are assuming.')
