FCP vs LCP, how they interplay...<p>I&#x27;d like a video where a page loads and PING! a vital happens, the page pauses and someone talks about that vital, what&#x27;s led up to it, what&#x27;s affected it and what would change it. Then the page unpauses until the next vital is reached. Something to make it relatable.')
