Its the same thing as the alt-right, an ill-defined idea that can be whatever bogeyman you want it to be to whoever you want to scare.<p>This is the problem. You asked if people really don&#x27;t believe that antifa is real. Obviously it is real in some sense since we are talking about something called antifa, but we have no idea if you are thinking of the bogeyman organization that doesn&#x27;t exist, and I am thinking of a philosophy of counterprotest.<p>When people talk about &#x27;getting rid of antifa&#x27; there&#x27;s a reason that so many people on the left laugh. It&#x27;s because there is a false conception on the right that it is some sort of unified organization like the ACLU or NRA where you can literally be a card carrying member. People on the left understand that there is no such thing, it is just an ill-defined idea.')
