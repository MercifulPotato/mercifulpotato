The idea of &#x27;fizzbuzz&#x27; was to just filter out the total unable to do it at all people.  Not to filter for people who can do coding interviews.  Honestly, that these questions are out there and people study for them make an interviewers life <i>easier</i>.  &#x27;Oh you saw this problem online great! explain why it works&#x27;.  It cuts through a lot of gruff.  Had it happen a few times with the particular problem I like to use.  If they can read cracking the coding interview and understand the problems in it and explain them back you are half way there!')
