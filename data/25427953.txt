It was intended to protect homeowners (often on retirement income) from skyrocketing property values that is out of their control. It&#x27;s done great at that, but unfortunately (like any regulation) has also been exploited by the greedy.<p>- That aside, don&#x27;t presume to be entitled to buy the house you want in the place you want it to be for the amount you want to pay for it. It sucks that I can&#x27;t afford to buy a nice home in my hometown because FAANG came in and made it the place to be, but I&#x27;m also not entitled to that. The notion that people like my parents ought to be taxed out of their home so that well-off twentysomethings can have a more favorable property market really grinds my gears. There are lots of people trying to just live in their hard-earned homes after doing the work and taking the risks of building the tech industry, and most of them didn&#x27;t become wealthy venture capitalists in the end.
