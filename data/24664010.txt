Women, and women&#x27;s magazines use it quite a bit.<p>&quot;How many guys have you slept with&quot; is tainted as an indicator of general semantics b&#x2F;c it is a partly idiomatic; as an example &quot;What can I do you for?&quot; is a common phrase &#x2F; idiom, but would be considered poorly constructed English otherwise. The use of &quot;literally&quot; in non-literal contexts a poor indicator of what the word (supposedly) means, and probably a result of differing usage, or possibly lingual style. Any kind of innuendo has a pragmatic meaning, and whole words and phrases have metaphorical meaning - to the degree that they are no longer understood as metaphors. Finally, choice of words pragmatically communicate information too, e.g &quot;those people&quot; or &quot;you people&quot; can have a stigma attached despite being semantically neutral.')
