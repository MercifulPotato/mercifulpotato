It reminds me of the subtle-possibly-false dichotomy between a program and a configuration. Turing-completeness could be one way to think about that dichotomy it, but in this case Lua is definitely Turing complete.<p>In any case, if there&#x27;s commonality to the stuff being described, then that&#x27;s the kind of thing that is &quot;batteries&quot;. Sequences, associative arrays, etc. come up all the time, and that&#x27;s available. Surely there are some things that come up a bit less often when describing systems, though I don&#x27;t have a concrete example on hand.<p>My main question is, since any program is a description of a computation, then what kind of distinction are you making?')
