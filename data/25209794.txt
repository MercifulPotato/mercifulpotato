They aren&#x27;t getting any more optimized, if anything new available options are scaling that back in favor of more land-use, open space, slower growth.<p>&gt; Sorry, I&#x27;m a dreamer I guess, continuously disappointed by a world that doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to set any significant goals nor pursue them at large scale unless it&#x27;s for profit and likely at the cost of the rest of the world.<p>You&#x27;re free to consume whatever you want.<p>EDIT: my opening sentence is not fair.
