Item(by='bane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609768952, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25630011, text='Most of the unions that we have here are public service&#x2F;trades&#x2F;transportation related and if I&#x27;m honest, the results have been very mixed. We used to have more manufacturing related unions, but with the direction manufacturing jobs have gone in the U.S. they&#x27;re mostly just gone.<p>The public service unions (e.g. firefighters, police etc.) seem to do a good job to protect their workers on one hand and keep them fairly paid and serviced, but on the other hand provide a powerful force to keep abusive police employed and fight things like police cameras and other actions that protect the population.<p>The public transportation unions are widely seen as abject failures, providing protection for overpaid, highly underperforming, employees. There&#x27;s been numerous investigations about failures in things like our local municipal rail systems and why they&#x27;re such an abomination of service, and outside of funding issues, the fingers usually get pointed in the direction of essentially unfireable and frankly lazy employees.<p>The trade unions seem to do a good job. Plumbers, electricians, etc. generally seem to be competent, and paid well, and have good relations between employers, customers, and workers.<p>There&#x27;s also a large number of public sector unions here. At one end the usual postal workers, teachers etc. and everything seems to run pretty well there. On the other end are the infuriating government maintenance&#x2F;labor unions who won&#x27;t let you move a waste bin to the other side of your desk without causing a problem.<p>Despite all this, unions are not a major factor of life for most of the people in my area. I actually only know one or two people who&#x27;re union members personally. Despite this, I live in one of the highest average income areas in the country. But I also recognize that for many people this environment prices them out of livable housing and food, and unions can help bolster their pay to make living in this area reasonable for them.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat at a loss as to what better work conditions Google employees are looking for. They&#x27;re among the most highly paid employees on the planet with absolutely incredible work conditions. If I had to wager, in exchange for whatever protections these employees are seeking, the tradeoff will be the erosion and removal of most of the perks that make Google a desirable place to work for. On the other hand, with Google leadership&#x27;s behavior the last few years, they&#x27;ve kind of brought this on themselves so, small violins all around.')
