I learned a lot from watching this video and I have another channel to subscribe to now :)<p>One thing that I found interesting was how they identified today&#x27;s announcement of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (back in September) as one that would require the massive investment in cold chain infrastructure. They also highlight Pfizer&#x27;s engineering of a separate series of cold boxes that would keep the vaccine at temperature for up to 10 days, thereby enabling it to be shipped through standard logistics networks. Great stuff.')
