Psychopaths exist on the end of this spectrum but there are many people in between as it is a spectrum and can be measured physically and determined genetically. People not like us are much more common than you think.<p>I&#x27;d peg the number at 30-40% of people who are largely indifferent to murder and abide by the rules simply because of consequences society or habit. This is of course is just a anecdotal and hypothetical number.<p>The problem is when people judge humanity they instinctively reach for a mirror and believe that other people are a reflection. This is partly true but it causes people to miss  many parts of the personality spectrum that are massively different.<p>Case in point:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;science-nature&#x2F;the-neuroscientist-who-discovered-he-was-a-psychopath-180947814&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;science-nature&#x2F;the-neuroscien...</a><p>The above is an example of a psychopath who probably would have lived his life as a normal person were it not for his occupation and a serendipitous brain scan.<p>You will note that he has confirmed psychopathy through genetic evaluation and physical evaluation of the structure of his brain.<p>Also just want to say that I lied. I&#x27;m not like you. I&#x27;m a bit lower on the spectrum. I won&#x27;t murder someone but if a stranger dies in front of me, I won&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ll definitely try to help him, but I won&#x27;t be having problems sleeping at night.')
