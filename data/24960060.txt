We define the whole project with the client first and agree on overall price. I then split it into few stages and upon completion of each stage I would sit with the client show the work and client signs off the stage as done and pays for said stage. With this type of work I would also always charge non refundable initial deposit as sometimes the client will have the contractor started and then change their mind. I also specify 3 month &quot;free&quot; bug fixing after final acceptance and then maintenance fee should they desire.')
