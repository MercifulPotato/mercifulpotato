They trust you that you intend to transfer the money in good faith. As long as the transfer is complete at no point they make a loan to you because trade settles at T+2, i.e. cash is not required on the date of trade. It is the loaning aspect that is regulated. Free riding is forbidden by Reg-T of the FRB. Your broker&#x27;s settlement risk is not considered a margin loan either. It is a credit risk that they satisfy by depositing funds with the DTCC for a tiny fraction of the notional value.<p>The difference between the credit risk and the margin loan is that in the vast majority (say &gt; 99%) of times the credit risk does not become a loan. You don&#x27;t need to punish all the people acting in good faith for the action of a few. The regulation on free riding comes from a money supply perspective. You are not allowed to create money without taking out a loan.')
