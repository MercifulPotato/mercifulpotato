Unfortunately the ONS data is not reported as often in the press because it&#x27;s updated only weekly, whereas test and trace-based absolute numbers are reported daily even though they&#x27;re close to useless for population-level or region-level analysis.<p>Unfortunately there&#x27;s no similarly reliable source aimed at understanding prevalence and spread in institutional settings I&#x27;m aware of.
