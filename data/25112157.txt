Some supernova event sends us toward the horizon with a bunch of mass, but it’s also getting sucked back in. Space-time starts out looking like a dish and then begins to form a vortex as mass gets sucked back in. It looks like we are accelerating away from other masses. The red shift keeps increasing. Then at some point we are back at the singularity orbiting at the speed of light and now the Schwarzchild metric gives a negative dt^2 due to the combined effects of gravity and velocity, so we can get rid of the negative sign in Minkowski space if we accept the singularity as the normal state of things.')
