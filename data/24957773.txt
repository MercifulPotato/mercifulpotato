Anki yourself in secret until you&#x27;re a super-saiyan, and then unleash your strength on the quivering masses. Hear the lamentation of their women, until they are begging you for mercy and also to teach them about spaced repetition.<p>That brings us to the second problem... spaced repetition doesn&#x27;t work. Or rather, it does work, but it does the wrong thing. If you want to be a walking encyclopedia, maybe SR is a good approach. But if you want to understand the world, be able to do things, be funny and gregarious, know the answer but also know when to play dumb... SR can&#x27;t help you. Even if you want to learn a language, if you can&#x27;t learn it by <i>using</i> it, do you even need it?<p>I was excited about SuperMemo, Anki, etc. too at one point.
