Item(by='DFHippie', descendants=None, kids=[24787759], score=None, time=1602762190, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787399, text='&gt; on what basis does the West have any moral authority to judge China&#x27;s emulation of Western colonialism<p>This is a counsel of despair and it is pure tribalism. No one in the West can condemn the actions of China the nation because the West has done analogous things in the past. So everyone in the West is guilty for everything anyone in the West has ever done. By this logic there is no basis for moral judgment ever and every group is free to dominate any other group. Might makes right. It&#x27;s lovely in this scenario to claim membership in a powerful group that can take everyone else&#x27;s marbles.<p>No one believes this about their own group. &quot;I can&#x27;t judge my neighbor for murder because we&#x27;re both white. His crime is my crime.&quot; People frequently believe this about other groups. &quot;My Chinese neighbor is a horrible person because they are Han and the Han-dominated government in China is doing horrible things to Uighurs.&quot; This is obvious nonsense. Wrong is wrong whoever the judge. It isn&#x27;t the West judging China but individual Westerners. Also individual Han Chinese. Maybe even individual Han Chinese responsible for abusing the Uighurs.')
