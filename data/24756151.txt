It was purely emotional and just like the author mentioned the numbers don&#x27;t work out. But I wanted to treat myself after years car-free living. Since COVID lockdown has started I would say public transportation in my city has become more reliable, and free. Given this change and more time working from home I have even less need of a car.<p>All this free time at home had me thinking of roadtrips, boon docking, overlanding, and camping. So I bought a European 4WD SUV. Basically a money pit in fuel, maintenance, parts and reliability. Financially, it doesn&#x27;t make sense. But all the money I didn&#x27;t pay in car loans, maintenance, fuel, and tolls went to saving for a car I truly wanted.<p>For me, buying a car makes as much sense as buying a gaming PC. It should be something you really want and willing to spend money on. If you need a car for work, get the cheapest one you can and factor the mileage into your salary. I&#x27;ve turned down many offers with small pay bumps simply because the expense of the commute made the salary bump a net negative.')
