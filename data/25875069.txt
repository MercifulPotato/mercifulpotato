Yeah, it picks up my dog barking in the other room. I only used that as an example of what I&#x27;ve got in my office, not as a recommendation. There are a ton of different condenser mics with different patterns, etc., too. But remember, I&#x27;m overloading music stuff for MS Teams meetings. I make no claim that it&#x27;s optimal, just easy for what I&#x27;ve got plugged into the desk.<p>But yeah, for most folks a dynamic is fine, cheaper, and more sturdy. Or a Blue Yeti USB mic. My point wasn&#x27;t to drill into the details and offer a recommendation, though, other than &quot;wire your stuff, and you&#x27;ll be loads ahead&quot;. What is on the other end of those wires is a separate discussion. And I&#x27;m probably not the one to lead that discussion. (I&#x27;m a musician, not an orator.)')
