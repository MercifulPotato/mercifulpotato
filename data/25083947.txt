It&#x27;s a bit like saying you have a headache because you take painkillers. \nIf person is unhappy &quot;screen time&quot; is just a coping mechanism. If you take it away, then the person will find something else to numb their worries. \nYou need to have an honest talk with yourself or a therapist to get to the bottom why you feel this way and then see how you can address it. These &quot;rule of thumb&quot; things are akin to &quot;why don&#x27;t you just smile?&quot; or &quot;stop worrying&quot; and don&#x27;t help.')
