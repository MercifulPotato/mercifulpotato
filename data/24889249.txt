I&#x27;m willing to bet that the phone is bound to fail and their OS will be doomed to obscurity. How do the creators not see this?<p>Three reasons I don&#x27;t think it will work out:\n1. A huge number of people use WatsApp, Facetime, Messenger, etc., for sending messages and making calls. This OS won&#x27;t support any of these apps.\n2. We may hate our phones at times but we use them for a variety of daily tasks, all of which are difficult on this phone: Navigation (Google Maps &gt;&gt;&gt; Any other Sat Nav system), transportation (Uber, etc.), food delivery, information retrieval (Google, etc.).\n3. Even if you wanted a minimalist phone, you could probably just get a cheap feature phone instead of this one.')
