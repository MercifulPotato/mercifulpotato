You need not just young men seeking adventure, but educated and talented people willing to have a family there across long timeframes as infrastructure is slowly built up.<p>The US for example is below replacement rate, which is fine if you has constant immigration or it’s going to increase as the population falls.  Less so if having 10% fewer people means everyone else dies.<p>Technology is only half the battle you also need to avoid  negative feedback loops where if conditions are bad enough you don’t get doctors and surgeons immigrants. Which then makes things worse.  A few year shift is fine for a token settlement, less so if you’re shipping 100,000 people there and 100,000 people back every year.')
