You can go home and turn on your TV, browse the Internet, or whatever. You can also be a part of an online community that is geographically sparse and never meet any of its members in real life.<p>If you never meet people in real life, how can you assist them if they need something? How can you display an altruistic behavior? Perhaps you may answer some questions for free, or upload a free tutorial to YouTube, but will you be able to do other good deeds that require a physical presence? no.<p>What is your motivation for being altruistic? In the 50s, organized religion indoctrinated people from a young age to believe that a deity would reward them if they were altruistic. Those beliefs are now in decline. People now have a different utility function in their heads: they don&#x27;t want to go to heaven, they want to enjoy their lives according to humanist values.')
