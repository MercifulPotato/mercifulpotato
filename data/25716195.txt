Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610295664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711843, text='&gt; My line for free speech seems to lie in speech that incites violence or speech that discriminates against people for immutable characteristics of their person, both of which I know Parler harbors in abundance<p>Which Amazon, Facebook and Twitter also do &quot;in abundance&quot;. I can give a list of links which show direct violations of their violence policy, discriminating religion, people et all and it has been happening for years and yet no action as been taken. But does it matter if I give you such a list? It doesn&#x27;t matter. Why? Because it is taken for granted that all venomous stuff that you find online is coming from the Right Wing&#x2F;Alt Right&#x2F;Trumpists etc. There is nothing that Left can do wrong.<p>Since this is the notion that I find most left liberals employ there is no way to come to a common ground in such scenarios. Unless you are willing to accept that there is venom on the left wing too there is no way I will agree to your point. If you feel Parler harbors hate in abundance you will be shocked to see the kind of hate I have found on Amazon, Twitter and Facebook spewed by the left. If you want to address the issue you should take a holistic approach of condemning it in all platforms and not single out one platform. Only then I can take your argument seriously. But the question is: Can you do it?')
