The purpose of concepts like &quot;culture fit&quot; is to encode the idea that human interaction can&#x27;t be easily reduced to numbers and checkboxes, so people can be a bad fit for a team even if there&#x27;s no specific job requirement they don&#x27;t fulfil. You can go too far and end up with an exclusionary team only accepting carbon-copies of each other, certainly, but the idea that the entire concept of fitting in is fake seems too far in the opposite direction.')
