It was a bit like finally having the chance to be &quot;free&quot; and working how I wanted - and not my employer.<p>Three years later I&#x27;m now convinced that there&#x27;s reasons why people go to offices and why there&#x27;s certain rules in those.<p>Anyways, technically speaking &quot;I&#x27;m not working from home anymore&quot;. I rented out an office space. It&#x27;s as comfy as home (still, there&#x27;s no bed). But having a dedicated space to work and face challenges is great, because afterwise I can drive home - and when I&#x27;m exhausted, fall into my bed.')
