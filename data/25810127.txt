Item(by='md_', descendants=None, kids=[25810181], score=None, time=1610885831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804869, text='As someone fairly well-versed in the email ecosystem, I don&#x27;t understand this proposal, like, at all.<p>- Is it even federated? It seems like not--it seems like it&#x27;s proposing a protocol for organizations to use to run their own messaging service in-house?<p><pre><code>  - If it&#x27;s not, this doesn&#x27;t really get at either the _interesting_ parts of email--the universal federation--or what makes it _hard_. (The reason email has spam, authentication, and confidentiality problems really boils down to the difficulty in securely establishing authoritative identities; this is why protocols like DANE, DMARC, DKIM, SPF, and MTA-STS are tacked on top.)\n\n  - If it is, the documentation is woefully underemphasizing this point. :)\n</code></pre>\n- The proposal (as others have noted) seems to mix application features with message delivery. This doesn&#x27;t seem useful.<p>- Instead of using encryption, the proposal says that &quot;To prevent theft of correspondence (in the event of a compromised account or server) the messaging service must store only messages that have not yet been delivered&quot;. This is...a really problematic design choice.<p>- The proposal suggests a bunch of reasonable <i>application</i> features which many email providers (at the MTA or MUA level) <i>do</i> already support (like &quot;blocking anyone&quot;, &quot;selecting [who] can correspond with you&quot;, etc). Email is fully compatible with these features!<p><pre><code>  - Conversely, the proposal suggests some features which are not obviously satisfied by the proposal itself, like &quot;always know from which site a message originated.&quot; Again, where is identity even discussed?\n</code></pre>\nTo be blunt, this proposal doesn&#x27;t seem like it was written with an eye to what&#x27;s actually challenging about email. The fact that SMTP is not JSON is really not a significant problem; the focus of this proposal is just in the wrong place.<p>To make this more constructive, I would suggest reading the IETF SMTP WG archives to understand the kinds of problems implementors and spec-authors face.<p>I&#x27;m frankly pessimistic about the prospect for a wholesale (non-incremental) replacement of SMTP, but even as a design exercise, starting with what real implementors struggle with makes sense.')
