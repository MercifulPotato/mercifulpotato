Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602177036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704587, text='Having watched the newspaper coverage of the debacle involving Breonna Taylor with neighborhood interest, it&#x27;s very clear how much the War on Drugs has caused so much pain for so little gain. There are so many facts involved that make it harder and harder to not cynically and conspiratorially believe there was some sort of personal vendetta involved and the media circus a cover up (the latest word is the city&#x27;s Drug Enforcement SWAT team throwing the cops involved under the bus for not complying with Drug Enforcement accountability procedures in a warrant search involving a person&#x27;s residence and throwing the entire department under the bus for trying to execute too many warrants at the same time spreading itself too thin and not following procedures). Occam&#x27;s Razor still suggests outrageous ineptitude was involved, and the feeling of a conspiracy is just cops doing what they always do and protecting their own as long as they can before only breaking ranks just when public scrutiny gets too tough.<p>(But the detective that put together the residential warrant &quot;bundled&quot; it with a bunch of non-residential warrants, nearly burying&#x2F;hiding it, when it took it to the Judge to be signed, and then again the SWAT team now says that the residential warrant execution plan was buried in the same swamp of non-residential warrant executions, and it&#x27;s really hard to keep from wondering if that was malice or incompetence as all these details come out. Was it personal? Or was it dumb luck? I can&#x27;t even tell which is worse at this point, because either seems to show a lack of responsibility, and both are worsened by likely what will continue to be a lack of consequences or atonement.)')
