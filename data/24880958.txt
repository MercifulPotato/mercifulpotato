I know given the way I&#x27;d use it there&#x27;s no actual risk, or if I did modify it there&#x27;d be no reason not to contribute back. I do care about getting fired for violating company policy.<p>GPLv2 can be approved fairly easily. GPLv3 is a much tougher sell. For example, GCC is fine because there&#x27;s really no alternative (or there wasn&#x27;t before clang had full compatibility).')
