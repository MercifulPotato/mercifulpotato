As time goes on I feel myself becoming more and more of an Anti-Natalist, especially as I reflect on my childhood. It seems like having kids is just a very instinctual&#x2F;romantic thing that people don&#x27;t really try to resist, and oft not thinking about the implications that come with it (and I certainly don&#x27;t just mean loss of time and autonomy). I find it very strange, and somewhat disappointing in a way. Having a kid just because you &quot;want&quot; to feels kind of perverse to me.')
