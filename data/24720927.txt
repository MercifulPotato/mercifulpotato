But the “convincing red states” take is off the charts wrong.<p>There is no regard for harm reduction logic in conservative politics that isn’t already part of the conservative platform. Guns? Sure, “if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns”. Drugs? Only the ones that are already legal. Safe injection sites? Enabling addicts. Abortion? Baby murder. Sex work? Sin and depravity. Acknowledging racism? Racist itself! Holding police accountable in any way? Riots and looting! Masks? I will literally make up fake science because real science is tyranny! My goodness.<p>Edit: of course there’s room for all of these in big-L Libertarian politics, but... the party has less significant sway in any red state I’m aware of (they’ve had more success in blue NM?), and at the membership level the party seems to be more successful in funneling angry white dudes into the alt right than convincing conservatives to actually care about personal liberties when those liberties might be shared by everyone and help reduce power disparities.')
