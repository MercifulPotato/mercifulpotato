But how many people actually do that?<p>&gt;&gt; something like the raspberry pi but with a socket to plug in a cheap M.2 SATA or M.2 NVME SSD is needed.<p>As nice as M.2 would be, AFAICT it&#x27;s not supported by the SoC which is what allows these things to be so inexpensive. Go with USB then.<p>IMHO an AMD APU could be under clocked to not need a fan, and would allow things like M.2 in a keyboard form factor. That might be amazing but would probably cost 2x to 3x the price. Also, at the higher price people would then complain about the keyboard.<p>BTW I thing SFF designs and keyboard computers should have a couple USB or SD on the <i>top</i> to make it easy to plug in storage devices.')
