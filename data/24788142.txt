MPS is a mature and proven implementation of a whole memory management infrastructure which offers different GC strategies (M&amp;S, Copying, Incremental, etc.). And it&#x27;s written in C, so it could well fit with the Nim runtime. Here is a paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ravenbrook.com&#x2F;project&#x2F;mps&#x2F;doc&#x2F;2002-01-30&#x2F;ismm2002-paper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ravenbrook.com&#x2F;project&#x2F;mps&#x2F;doc&#x2F;2002-01-30&#x2F;ismm20...</a>. MPS is surprisingly unknown. I also only discovered it recently and currently try to use it in a project.<p>EDIT: maybe a reason why people didn&#x27;t consider it so far was that earlier versions were only available under Sleepycat&#x2F;dual license; current versions are BSD.')
