Personally, I don&#x27;t have a problem with the in-city, shared roads having very low limits.<p>I have a huge problem with enormous super-highways having 60mph limits or lower.<p>Some of the roads out where I live were engineered with going 90+ in mind. In fact, there&#x27;s a tale of an engineer going such speeds and getting out of a ticket by explaining that to the judge out here.<p>What was the speed limit? When you&#x27;re over 15 miles from the city, it&#x27;s 60, but pass a turn in the road and it&#x27;s 70.')
