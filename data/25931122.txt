Without this you can&#x27;t do things like:<p>1) Have 2 cars share capacity. The car will decide how much wattage to draw so you have to limit each car to supply&#x2F;number_of_chargers so that you don&#x27;t over draw your supply.  With data connection you have them share the available wattage, allowing cars to pull what is currently available, often this is more than supply&#x2F;number_of_chargers as charger will empty or underdrawing due to charge state.<p>2) Auto bill.  Tesla chargers have NO interface other than the plug. You literally just plug it in.<p>This has changed now but Telsas have been pretty common for a long time here.')
