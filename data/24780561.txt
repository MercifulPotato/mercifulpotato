The Z80. Um... I... uh..<p>The Z80 probably makes as much sense as a fourth-generation microprocessors as it makes sense that there are, what, 11 generations of Intel Core microprocessors.<p>&gt; What were the first three generations, 4004, 8008, and 8080?<p>Probably. The 4040 might fit in somewhere (timewise, its a close contemporary of the 8080, I think, not sure if it would fit cocnceptually in the same or early generations; its still 4-bit like the 4004, but otherwise at least somewhat more advanced.)')
