This is not the first year where I can catch and spread a disease that can kill someone else.<p>Likewise, how far do you extend this logic? I can catch and spread Covid <i>literally any time I go outside</i>. Do I have to avoid all other human contact, or is it just the things that a tribunal of strangers on the internet thinks is unnecessary?<p>&gt; So if you take dumb risks and raise your odds of catching COVID and passing it along, then I am happy to scold you. People who recklessly pass on COVID are why millions are dead and dying.<p>I made a comment about two consenting adults, who live alone, taking a calculated personal risk. I am not sure who is being reckless here, but at the least this is an exaggeration.')
