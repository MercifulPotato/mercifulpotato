Item(by='0xy', descendants=None, kids=[24765063], score=None, time=1602590733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764243, text='There&#x27;s evidence that deliveries of urns to cemeteries was substantially higher than reported death counts [1], as well as gigantic drops in active subscriber counts in China&#x27;s telecom providers [2].<p>I also vehemently disagree &quot;the evidence would be clearly visible&quot;. History is littered with genocides on a massive scale that were successfully covered up. We still don&#x27;t know exactly how many people died in the Holocaust or Holodomor, for example (estimates vary by millions). So this claim that you cannot cover up deaths is clearly false.<p>It&#x27;s also very likely the US is over-reporting numbers.<p>For example, studies have shown US death certificates have &quot;major errors&quot; the majority of the time [3], and several US states have counted unrelated deaths as &quot;COVID&quot; deaths, including Washington State (later partially corrected) [4].<p>I also disagree with your claim that evidence of China&#x27;s data manipulation does not count because it&#x27;s &#x27;six months old&#x27;, you can&#x27;t wave away evidence like that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nationalpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;lines-of-urns-in-wuhan-prompt-questions-of-chinas-pandemic-death-toll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nationalpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;lines-of-urns-in-wuhan-p...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developingtelecoms.com&#x2F;telecom-business&#x2F;operator-news&#x2F;9361-chinese-operators-see-subscriber-numbers-drop.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developingtelecoms.com&#x2F;telecom-business&#x2F;operator...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;coronavirus-death-toll-hard-track-1-3-death-certificates-wrong&#x2F;3020778001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;investigations&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;2...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doh.wa.gov&#x2F;Portals&#x2F;1&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;1600&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;data-tables&#x2F;ChangingCriteriaUsedtoReportDeathsReCOVID.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doh.wa.gov&#x2F;Portals&#x2F;1&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;1600&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;...</a>')
