Instead of seeing for example 1 million infected PC&#x27;s and VM&#x27;s sending email, you would see 1 million infected PC&#x27;s and VM&#x27;s doing PoW.<p>Ill give you an example of how this played out in the past.  Up until about a decade ago, if I enforced TLS on my mail servers, about 80% of the malware bots could not connect as their libraries did not support TLS.  As more smtp libraries added support for TLS, the malware was updated and now enforcing TLS only limits a smalll subset of spammers.  There was no added cost to the spammer.  So yes for a while, PoW will create a window of time where there is less spam for those that adopt this.  The spammers will eventually catch up.  Nowadays malware frameworks are much easier to update.')
