It just so happens that the MSM is full-on TDS and they can&#x27;t seem to let go. Trump is the blackhole for MSM, everything is somehow connected to &quot;Orange Man Bad&quot;.<p>Moreover, the Washington Post reported that 90% of Trump&#x27;s coverage is negative [1].<p>Do you know anyone that is 90% terrible? I doubt it. Taking a step back from one&#x27;s political views, which is hard for a lot of people, it becomes obvious that there&#x27;s little honest and unbiased reporting going on within MSM.<p>Sure it&#x27;s fine to read information with a particular viewpoint (be it conservative or liberal), as long as the reader is made aware that the &quot;facts&quot; are framed from a particular viewpoint. Otherwise it&#x27;s just brainwashing and intellectually dishonest. I think any rational person can get behind this sort of &quot;zero-trust framework&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;jan&#x2F;15&#x2F;a-broadcast-tradition-90-of-trump-coverage-remains&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtontimes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;jan&#x2F;15&#x2F;a-broadcast...</a>')
