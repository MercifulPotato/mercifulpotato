It&#x27;s not rocket science, a trillion dollar business is trying to protect its image using shady tactics. Your framing is again reeking of bias: &quot;people are just vilifying poor Apple&quot; according to you, but it&#x27;s more like you blindly defending Apple, spamming the whole thread.<p>&gt; Once again, you aren’t actually engaging in a discussion.\nYou are begging the question with your framing.<p>We are engaging in the discussion, while you are trying to fool people with deceptive rhetoric. You have been given many evidences, but you always deflected with pseudo intellectual, unconvincing rhetoric.<p>&gt;As I said, if I were really defending Apple, it would be easy to show.\nJust repeating over and over again that I am is not that. You can’t explain it because it isn’t happening.<p>People besides me have given you enough evidence &amp; have also pointed out your weaselly rhetoric.\nYou are truly living in your own fantasy world, most of your comments are greyed out for a good reason.')
