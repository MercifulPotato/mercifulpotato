Item(by='studius', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1603974711, title='Ask HN: What things have you learned that scare you?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Personally, here are some things which I worry about, which is about the closest I get to being afraid in my middle-age:<p>1. I worry that I will be unsuccessful in life and that I hate myself and my career and should write music or books when all I do is code and surf the web. But, I&#x27;m still alive.<p>2. Social media, paranoia, and thought bubbles indirectly cause society to collapse, when I don&#x27;t know how to make soap or shoot an arrow, and don&#x27;t want to harm an animal, and still I eat them everyday. But, Amazon can still ship food.<p>3. Fractional reserve banking and tax shelters, DOD alleged aliens vs natural plasma effects and LSD and lies, Salvatore Cezar Pais and John Quincy St Clair making a mockery of the patent system, possible ignorance of Thorium-based nuclear power, folic acid supplementation -&gt; dextroamphetamine -&gt; schizophrenia for some, bad Covid tests and test pooling, some Radon is good for you since Deuterium protects DNS against genetic damage causing some smokers not to get cancer but too much alpha radiation or Karo or browned toast or Teflon or pesticide or unintentional side effect of GMO gives you cancer, and that tennis being healthier could be correlation vs causation. OH, and that my family and friends will die and I don&#x27;t spend enough time caring for them. But, none of those are relevant to me coding right now for money.<p>So, those are my things. What things have you learned that scare you?')
