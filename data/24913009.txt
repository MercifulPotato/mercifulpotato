I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s not the codec&#x2F;technology&#x27;s fault, but everyone assumes it is, and that is <i>exactly</i> what all the companies peddling patented alternate codecs want you to think.<p>I have a set of Bluetooth speakers, and they sound better over the wired aux in than wireless. I know what this experience is like, and this is <i>why</i> I have tested the codec myself and concluded that it wasn&#x27;t the problem. And since Bluetooth is a digital audio standard, if the codec isn&#x27;t the problem and the data is arriving at the destination, then clearly any quality problem is the destination&#x27;s fault.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Bluetooth is a horrible standard for many other reasons (it&#x27;s worse than USB, and that&#x27;s saying something); I&#x27;ve implemented Bluetooth-related protocols. But &quot;screws up audio quality&quot; isn&#x27;t one of them.')
