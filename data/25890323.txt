The main problems with human-started nuclear fusion are that (so far, iirc) it consumes more energy than it produces, and we cannot sustain it for a long time.<p>&quot;The benefits&quot; are currently very calculable, and direct economics of nuclear fusion is very negative. (The research benefit is unique though.)<p>For nuclear fusion to be of incalculable benefit to mankind, we need insanely small nuclear fusion that is energy-positive and sustainable in a simple way. &quot;Insanely small&quot; means smaller than Moon-sized, when we know that Jupiter-sized is too small&#x2F;light in nature.<p>Sustained nuclear fusion for energy generation still faces daunting challenges.')
