Examples include talking a walk, talking a shower, or just sitting around and letting your mind wander.<p>The other kind of &quot;doing nothing&quot; <i>occupies your mind</i> with low-effort thought processes. Examples include watching TV or reading a book. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a negative thing, but your mind won&#x27;t be solving problems (unless you&#x27;re not really focusing on the movie or the book).')
