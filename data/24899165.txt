Does it invoke an rsync process, or implement the rsync wire protocol?  One of my gripes with rsync is I&#x27;ve not found another way to integrate it into other systems.  librsync doesn&#x27;t implement the wire protocol and parsing the output of rsync itself is fraught with peril (for instance the formatting of --no-h has changed before.)<p>Edit: it seems to invoke an a rsync process but doesn&#x27;t parse stdout for progress.  A bit disappointing but I suppose that&#x27;s all which is needed for this application.')
