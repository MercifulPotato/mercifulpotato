I am really starting to hate this, is this some kind of religion with a holy book where it is just written &quot;OOP is bad.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m finding it difficult to take such a piece seriously and over time it pisses me off more and more.  I use OOP everyday and sure, there is such at thing as &quot;too much OOP&quot;, I have reached that point, but there is also sometimes too little and just a mess of linked functions. I only use Python btw.<p>Ugh, what a horrible negative piece to read for someone who really deeply loves computers.')
