Some kind of admission that the US health field ignored research because &quot;eww, icky Asians?&quot; Evidence that the US health experts knew of the research but are Snidely Whiplash-ish, mustache-twirling evil? As far as I can tell, they&#x27;re just as confused as any other scientist trying to do their best, with the additional constraint that they have to provide an answer to a question and that any nuance in that answer will be ignored anyway.<p>The link I posted is to a 2019 paper discussing how and why some viruses are considered airborne transmissible such that masks would help. (Single papers don&#x27;t usually settle complex questions, right?)<p>cactus2093&#x27;s links are to a paper discussing the difficulty of getting people to use masks correctly and a science popularization article describing an unnamed study from the University of New South Wales and an unidentified CDC study.  The first link does include references about the utility of masks, to articles titled &quot;Risk of transmission of airborne infection during train commute based on mathematical model&quot;, &quot;Knowledge about pandemic influenza and compliance with containment measures among Australians&quot;, &quot;Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses: systematic review&quot;, &quot;Professional and home-made face masks reduce exposure to respiratory infections among the general population&quot;, and &quot;A schlieren optical study of the human cough with and without wearing masks for aerosol infection control&quot;, but those don&#x27;t seem to imply the issue is settled. The second link does go on to say, &quot;<i>While some governments are already stockpiling masks for use in emergencies, MacIntyre said these guidelines had been implemented without evidence to support them. &quot;We now have provided that evidence,&quot; she said,</i>&quot; but it&#x27;s difficult to evaluate the last sentence.')
