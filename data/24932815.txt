You posted a question on HN and look at how many people are willing to put effort into answering it and helping you out, and literally the only connection is &quot;all of us read HN.&quot;<p>If you look up people you&#x27;ve worked with or otherwise know whose opinions you respect and ask them a version of the question you asked here, my experience is that most people will be more than happy to talk and to direct you to other people that can also give useful information.<p>The key issues (again, just in my experience) are:<p>1) don&#x27;t ask for a job, or approach these conversations with the goal of getting a particular job. People can be 1000x more forthcoming and are generally more helpful when it&#x27;s an &quot;informational interview&quot; rather than an informal &quot;job interview.&quot;<p>2) always ask, &quot;do you know anyone else I should talk to?&quot; That&#x27;s how you make progress.<p>3) don&#x27;t be an ass. More actionably: interact with other people the way you&#x27;d want to be approached if the roles were reversed.<p>tl;dr: a &quot;network&quot; doesn&#x27;t need to be a close group of your friends.')
