I&#x27;d recommend seeing an Osteopath if you have similar issues and would like to try it.<p>Situation: When I was ~17 one night I slept kind of oddly twisted.  I was kind of stretching my back and fell asleep and woke up with a sore neck.  It stuck with me for years at some low level, massage would help a bit but it would never really go away.  The pain was largely in the area where my neck and shoulders met, say around the size of a salad plate.<p>I woke up one morning when I was around 30 and it was so painful I couldn&#x27;t sit up from a laying position to get out of bed.  That&#x27;s when I saw the Osteopath.  A physician friend recommended I see them.<p>They gave me these &quot;super ibuprofen&quot; and isometric exercises, and literally it cured me basically immediately.<p>Solution: The exercise involves standing up straight, and using your hands to put opposing force against the different muscles in your neck.  Your head needs to remain unmoved, neck straight, it was recommended that it be done in front of  a mirror so you could make sure you weren&#x27;t bending and remained straight.<p>Isometric exercises are exercises you do where your joints and muscles basically stay static.  If you put your hands in front of you, like the praying position, and press equally with both hands, that is an isometric exercise.  Lifting something is not.<p>In all cases you gently start pushing and gradually push harder, and similarly at the other end start pushing less hard until you are not pushing at all to end it.<p>The exercises were:<p>- Clasp your hands behind your head and oppose tilting your head back.\n- Ditto on the front, trying to look down.\n- Hand on one side if your head by your ear and try to tilt your head to that side.  Ditto for the other side.\n- Palm on your forehead and try to turn your head that direction.  Ditto for the other direction.<p>Again: See a medical professional before you do such a thing, but in my case it solved a chronic upper back pain as if it were a miracle.  Literally a decade of pain was gone after spending 5 minutes doing this.  YMMV.  On the other hand, my non-genetically related mother had terrible bone deterioration and several surgeries including cervical fusion and added metal bits to her back, and if she had tried these exercises she&#x27;d probably end up in the ER.<p>If this guy had spoken in tongues and pulled out chicken parts hidden in washcloths, while doing similar exercises on me, I would absolutely, 100% believe in psychic surgery.  It was miraculous.')
