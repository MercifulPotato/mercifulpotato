You don&#x27;t need to fill your search space with with anything that has a &quot;b&quot; for example, eliminating inserts.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that works. Suppose &quot;abab&quot; and &quot;abao&quot; are words. Note the problem spec says &quot;after replacing <i>a b</i> with an o&quot;, i.e. after replacing _one_ b in a word with an o. If you exclude all words with a &quot;b&quot; and replace one b with an o in &quot;abab&quot; you will get &quot;abao&quot; which you have excluded, so you will think it&#x27;s not a word. I think at best you can ignore only words with a single b.')
