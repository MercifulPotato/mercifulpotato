And that&#x27;s where merge matters, when you for example need to merge protein data with genes and drugs etc. A bunch of pharma companies are using RDF Knowledge Graphs for that purpose. The need for data interchange comes with a certain company size, and that point RDF becomes the solution because there are no real alternatives.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about replacing JSON with RDF. Don&#x27;t need data interchange -- don&#x27;t use RDF. RDF is both at a different level of abstraction and solving problems of different scope.')
