It blew my mind to see things moving across the screen with just code.<p>Keep in mind that I learned pure html when I was 10, my websites were all very static (apart from a animated GIF here and there). The only way you could do a cool menu, effect or animation, was with Java Applet (which I learned after purchasing a online Java course that was taught over ICQ - it doesn&#x27;t get more 90&#x27;s than that).<p>I have this love relationship with javascript ever since I wrote my first &quot;alert(&#x27;hello&#x27;)&quot; and I wish it a happy birthday with many more years to come.')
