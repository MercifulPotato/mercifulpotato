You sound more of a bear than a bull.<p>Back in 2014 I was consistently selling BTC to friends in Brazil at a rate that made perfect sense for them and even above the BRL-USD rate.<p>This year I paid for all of my domain renewals using BTC on namecheap. Hundreds of dollars.<p>You can go to a service I provide <i>right now</i> and you can purchase the services with ethereum and ERC20 tokens. I also accept Raiden, which can make the transaction cost virtually zero.<p>I will reiterate what I asked in first comment: instead of just arguing with the amygdala, is there any chance you can establish a set of parameters and values that will make crypto (not necessarily Bitcoin, not necessarily Ethereum) something you consider worthy of a experiment, or are you forever going to believe that the status quo is the best we can do?<p>&gt; Also, why. It makes no difference.<p>You playing the cynical permabear who sees no point in building on blockchain tech is no different from a corporate drone who does not understand why people work on Free software without any immediate financial reward.<p>Even if Bitcoin fails, it has already paved the way for something that won&#x27;t. You may not care about your freedom and self-reliance, but it <i>ABSOLUTELY</i> makes a difference.')
