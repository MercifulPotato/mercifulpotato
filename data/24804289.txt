The digraph &lt;gh&gt;, for instance, is never &#x2F;f&#x2F; at the beginning of words, so it&#x27;d make no sense for it to be &#x2F;f&#x2F; here. These graphs only have their set sounds in certain places in the words, and they can&#x27;t be divorced from that. It&#x27;s precisely <i>why</i> nobody would say &#x27;fish&#x27; as &#x27;ghoti&#x27;.')
