Adobe should have been able to license the software for as long as they were selling Lightroom 6, with the license expiring when they ceased sales.<p>This, of course, assumes a sane license. Something is profoundly wrong with your licensing terms if they require the addition of a timed killswitch hidden in software installed on customers&#x27; devices.')
