Why should some company I&#x27;ve never heard of have access to my cell phone location data in the first place.<p>Not sure how the second follows from the first. There <i>is</i> a company you&#x27;ve never heard of which access to your cell phone location data. In fact, hundreds, and they buy and sell them in commodity marketplaces just like corn or pork bellies. They sell the data with your name attached for one price, and as anonymized aggregates for a much lower price.<p>Unacast is just saying that they bought the cheaper anonymized version for the purpose of this analysis. Whether the data are real or not is another matter altogether.')
