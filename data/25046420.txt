He did convoy duty. Three times they encountered bombs causing death and dismemberment. Mortar attacks on their camp were a daily occurrence. His turret on the vehicle he was gunner for resounded with the pings of small-arm fire.<p>Twice he survived mortar attacks - one exploded on the wall behind the staff during morning assembly in the yard. Another crashed through the roof on the other side of the wall when he was in the phone room talking to his Mom.<p>It took years for him to finish surgeries and physical therapy at the VA. His college degree took extra years to complete because of it.<p>I imagine &#x27;actual warfare&#x27; is pretty rough then.')
