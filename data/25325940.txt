Although to be fair, I didn&#x27;t use it all that frequently anyways.<p>If your language runtime supports testcontainers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testcontainers.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.testcontainers.org&#x2F;</a>) I would strongly suggest using that over docker compose. Docker compose is so lacking in features that I would just write bash scripts to setup&#x2F;tear down container dependencies. But testcontainer removes the need to write bash scripts and provides some basic orchestration features that make it an absolute breeze to use.')
