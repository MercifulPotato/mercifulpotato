Item(by='tesseract', descendants=None, kids=[25338085], score=None, time=1607377594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337884, text='There are suburban &quot;downtowns&quot;&#x2F;shopping districts near many BART and Caltrain stops where it&#x27;s quite possible to commute and do most everyday errands on foot&#x2F;bike&#x2F;transit. Possibly even easier than a lot of the southwestern half of SF proper. (Having no access to a car at all - through friends or a willingness to use Lyft&#x2F;Uber - does make some things harder). The older and higher-density suburbs tend to be better for this: for instance downtown San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Berkeley, Pleasanton. You pay for the privilege though, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s _that_ unique nationally?')
