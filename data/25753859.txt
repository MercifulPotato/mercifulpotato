From time to time it might snow in Madrid a couple of days, but nothing like this. In the mountains of course it happen almost every year, but not in the plains...<p>All the cities in central Spain are collapsed by the ice and snow (including the capital), there are no public transportation, emergencies services can barely make it into affected zones, a lot of people don&#x27;t have water supply because of frozen pipes (including myself), trucks with food and supplies are still stuck and cannot enter in the city...<p>This chaos is of course because we are not prepared for this extreme cold weather, and we are not prepared because this is VERY unusual.<p>Let&#x27;s say this is the same unusual as in the covid-19 pandemic,nobody would have imagined it a year ago.')
