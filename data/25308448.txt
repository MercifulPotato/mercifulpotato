I removed all snapshot tests from our unit testing pipeline and it&#x27;s much better for it. Was very surprised that Jest doesn&#x27;t have warnings that snapshot testing is a very different thing, and should not be intermixed with unit tests.<p>Snapshot testing is sort of like code coverage, a great tool for telling you what to look for, and you should make it so that doing snapshot testing is easy, but the snapshots themselves should be stored outside of the main repo&#x2F;main testing repo, and in their own thing. Not sure if you are doing that or not, but for anyone else looking at snapshot testing, this is a common mistake I see.')
