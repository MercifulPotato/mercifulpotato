There was an incredible amount of fog yesterday, and it lingered all day. It also killed all wind seemingly (or maybe vice versa?). The water was eerily dead still in the Puget Sound even late in the afternoon, except for tidal changes from my observation. There were also odd areas of the water which seemingly accumulated logs and other debris with no movement towards shore or away from it. A unique weather day for sure.<p>As always, a very informative post from Cliff Mass. For those unfamiliar, heâ€™s a Professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington in Seattle, and somewhat of a local legend.')
