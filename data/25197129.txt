That&#x27;s only statistical methods. The statistical methods are all the rage now, but explainable AI that can reason is an important area of computer science (and research) and uses formal methods.<p>Edit: yeah, you can downvote this, but current AI research splits right along this line, whether it&#x27;s symbolic or statistical. Some AI courses will use NNs, others will use Prolog and ASP. You can&#x27;t just dismiss a whole field of research by reducing AI to statistical methods.')
