The advantage over GANS (which seems to be the most common use of ML in architecture&#x2F;design circles) is the integration of cumulative reward maximization better captures the way designs are incrementally built up.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shape_grammar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shape_grammar</a>')
