And now you are angry for allegedly not having a 10 year support for your OS, so you can avoid some work on upgrading or migrating the VMs. I suspect you should be running VMware as well (and paying for it), instead of KVM or some other open source hypervisor. If the VMs are on a public cloud, you are paying for it indirectly as well. You may have some additional work indeed, but you saved a lot on not spending on a paid Linux distro, being Red Hat&#x27;s or any other distro, therefore it should be worth it... take that into account')
