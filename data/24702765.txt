In the colorized one, I see a bunch of people having a random good time, then some passerby gets caught in the middle.  And although he tries to escape, he doesn&#x27;t seem too upset.  This results in a feeling of mild entertainment.  Kind of like the same feeling from watching a video of household pet antics, or similar.<p>In the original, I see a bunch of Vaudeville &quot;clowns&quot; doing their antics, and a &quot;straight-man&quot; appears on stage, and tries desperately to escape the situation.  The result is a feeling of the film attempting to induce mild amusement.  Somewhat like watching a film where someone slips on a banana peel, or sits on a breakaway chair (slapstick comedy).<p>I believe that this is due to all the exposure I&#x27;ve had of the Vaudeville material has been based on grainy jittery monochrome film, so I interpret the material based on the typical Vaudeville setup.')
