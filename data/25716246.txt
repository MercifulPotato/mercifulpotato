A science based approach (in this particular chemical context) would involve controlled experiments (off the top of my head, what about the roughness of the cast iron? Carbon content? Time to warm up the oven? Why six layers and not twelve? Etc etc). Claims like &quot;youbneed to use 100% pure oil, I think that&#x27;s why it might not be working for you&quot; would not be present - science based involves testing that hypothesis and seeing if the purity or brand or whatever of the oil matters There! There would be some key metrics to measure, such as some molecular analysis of the residue, some test for non-stick ability, and perhaps a longevity test.<p>It might seem like a bit much, but this is an article presenting the conclusions of &quot;science&quot; as recommendations to pursue in your every day life, and a lack of scientific rigor can create false confidence in false solutions. For something as complex as polymerization in the varied environment of home cast iron seasoning, there&#x27;s an enormous amount of work and confounding factors you would need to sift through (seasoning on the stove vs oven?). Without that rigor, you might have stumbled into the best way of doing things, but as other comments suggest, its more likely your lack of rigor has led to missing things like the seasonings tendency to flake.')
