Because USDS employees are government employees with escalation paths all the way up to the very top which gives them a lot of power to break down bureaucratic barriers to modern software development that government contractors &amp; consultants would have no chance of doing. They then can bring in contractors to work in the relatively modern shell that they&#x27;ve created.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a project started by the USDS in 2015. It&#x27;s responsible for managing the complex bureaucratic process of VA legal appeals.

More talented people with the desire to serve their country. It&#x27;s not easy, but it can work.')
