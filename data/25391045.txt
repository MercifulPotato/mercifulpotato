Largely that means people with money, but influence doesn&#x27;t hurt either. He cut the line as a VIP.<p>&gt; Is that ethically wrong? Probably. Is it new? Not even remotely.<p>The story here is <i>not</i> that corruption is &quot;new.&quot;  The story is that there were a total of 108 doses of this treatment allocated to Washington, and one of them went to someone with self-admittedly &quot;very mild symptoms,&quot; <i>and had a history of reckless behavior to boot</i>.  That rare treatment might have been able to save someone&#x27;s life, but it instead went to someone who didn&#x27;t need it and probably didn&#x27;t deserve it.  It&#x27;s worth noting that this instance corruption happened and who was involved, so maybe someday something can be done about it or this sort of thing more generally.<p>It&#x27;s really weird: whenever there&#x27;s a story like this, people seem to climb over each other for the opportunity to note that corruption wasn&#x27;t invented yesterday, like they&#x27;re making some kind of important point.')
