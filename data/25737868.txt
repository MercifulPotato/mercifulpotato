Which is what keeps Amazon from unfairly applying its ToS. And if they can demonstrate irreparable harm, then they can get an injunction forcing AWS to restore their services immediately rather than waiting for the court case to be decided.<p>But I think the best they could do is present monetary damages, which the court could decide AWS is able to pay.')
