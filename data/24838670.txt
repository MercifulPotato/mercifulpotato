It&#x27;s designed to be fairly light on the mechanics, and to help the GM and the players focus on the development of a story within those mechanics.  I&#x27;ve been running a homebrew-story FAE game with a group of 4 friends and I really like the flexibility it gives us to focus on the narrative and character development.  Also it&#x27;s designed to be a pretty minimal time commitment to learn the rules well enough to give it a try.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evilhat.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;fae&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evilhat.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;fae&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fate-srd.com&#x2F;fate-accelerated&#x2F;get-started" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fate-srd.com&#x2F;fate-accelerated&#x2F;get-started</a>')
