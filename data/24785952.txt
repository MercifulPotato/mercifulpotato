Sharing it here for amusement.<p>The endpoint returning the string of &quot;Looks like you&#x27;re based in Netherlands&quot; is a nodej.js script that has this defined in the top:<p><pre><code>    const MESSAGE = &quot;Hey  - it looks like you&#x27;re based in $countryName.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSometime later in the code, in a function I manipulate this string in the module&#x27;s export function:<p><pre><code>    module.exports.getDiscountData = function(countryCode, countyName, etc) {\n\n    &#x2F;&#x2F; Fetch the right message\n\n    let message = counryValues[countryCode]; &#x2F;&#x2F; We get MESSAGE\n\n    message = MESSAGE.replace(&quot;$countryName&quot;, countryName) &#x2F;&#x2F; oops - we overwrote MESSAGE with a new value!\n\n    message = MESSAGE.replace(&quot;$otherVariable&quot;, etc)\n\n    return message; </code></pre>\n}<p>And for each country, I have keys &#x2F;values listed, like:\n&quot;GB&quot;: MESSAGE,\n&quot;NL&quot;: MESSAGE,\n&quot;HU&quot;: MESSAGE_2<p>The problem was that once the first request replaced the country name, MESSAGE was mutated, and it now had the value &quot;Hey  - it looks like you&#x27;re based in Netherlands.&quot; instead of &quot;Hey  - it looks like you&#x27;re based in $countryName.&quot;<p>I had no idea this would happen. And that a &quot;const&quot; in Javascript is a mutable thing. I fixed it by deep copying the string of the original message.<p>The super interesting part is that I did not notice this problem, as when I was testing, I did low frequency testing. As I am using Lambda, I probably got a new container created, where MESSAGE was re-initialized. But with the HN traffic, the containers stayed alive longer, making this mutated string issue a problem.')
