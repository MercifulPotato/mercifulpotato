If in doubt, slice it away and see what people say when you release 2.99.01.<p>This probably takes it down to something not so enormous to carry around.<p>It seems like other languages are all going their own way. Maybe that&#x27;s bad, maybe that&#x27;s good, most likely it&#x27;s a complicated combination of both, but most importantly, there&#x27;s nothing Autotools can do to stop it at this point, so you might as well roll with it.')
