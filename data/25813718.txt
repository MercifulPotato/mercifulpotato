(Not having them means potentially losing account access permanently.)<p>- You often need to enable it.<p>- You should store it with your keys, which dependent on habit might not be around your PC (in my case they always are in my pocket so :=) ).<p>- If your site doesn&#x27;t support U2F&#x2F;FIDO you might need an additional phone + app, or laptop app to get the numbers out of your key.<p>So while I think it&#x27;s a must have for every developer to have a hardware security token lie a Yubikey it&#x27;s not something I could convince e.g. my Dad or Sisters to use.')
