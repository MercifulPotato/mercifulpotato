There is a lot of nuance, obviously, but generally speaking when people say work is too &quot;political&quot; and make complaints that &quot;people are allowed to insult straight white males, but insulting other groups is off limits&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t take much reading between the lines to see what is going on. I hope everyone can take a second and appreciate how underrepresented certain demographics are in tech and that we should all work to change this.')
