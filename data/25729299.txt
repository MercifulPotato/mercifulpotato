I bought it and concluded there are no fixed level platformers I enjoy. At least with Spelunky or Catacomb Kids I can bash my head against different walls. I suspect I&#x27;m partially at Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome spectrum, and timing challenges are infuriatingly hard for me. Many screens in VVVVVV are easy to figure out but rely on perfect execution. I really don&#x27;t see the game as very puzzly. More like a game for speedrunners. At least the chiptunes are nice.<p>I guess I enjoyed Cave Story and Knytt Stories, but that&#x27;s it. I thought about Celeste but it doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;story&#x27; in it ;-).')
