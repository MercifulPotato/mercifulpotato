We know what the options are, we know what the trade-offs are, we can make guesses on what we think the impacts will be. It&#x27;s a &quot;known known&quot; problem, with usually enough time to research it fully. Implementing it properly can be difficult, but that&#x27;s the kind of thing that can be iterated if necessary - we don&#x27;t have to get that right first time.<p>No, I disagree. Some problems are truly novel (or maybe, there are just a handful of competitors and you obviously can&#x27;t see their source code) and you just don&#x27;t even know what kinds of solutions might exist. There might be bits and pieces in the research literature, but good luck even finding them, let alone understand if they are applicable. The space of possible technical and architectural solutions is infinite-dimensional, so it&#x27;s not always a &quot;known known&quot; issue. There might be crazy solutions out there that you simply didn&#x27;t think of.<p>Now, if it&#x27;s about &quot;create a CRUD interface to you e-commerce store&quot;, then I agree that the situation is more similar to what you described, but that&#x27;s not what everyone is working on.')
