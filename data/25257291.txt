The seed in any given tasty apple will produce a mostly inedible apple.<p>You <i>could</i> make a variety of apples breed true, but you have to selectively breed many individuals over many generations, and from seed to apple can be up to ten years, so it would have to be an enormous project to take on that you’d probably have to convince your grandchildren was worth pursuing.<p>The alternative is cloning by grafting on to root stock, which is so very much easier.<p>A lot of the food, especially fruit, that you eat are the same kind of clones. Bananas and avocados are a couple of examples.<p>A fun related fact is that there was this trend in the 50s and 60s of irradiating seeds or planting things in a circle around a radiation source hoping for useful mutations which could then be cloned and produced commercially.  Atomic gardening actually produced several popular varieties of produce.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomic_gardening" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Atomic_gardening</a>')
