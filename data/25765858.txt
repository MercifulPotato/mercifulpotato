In 2001, there were plenty of players on the market that sufficiently did the job of playing audio.<p>Apple saw that they could do better and they did.  They must feel that they can do the same with a car.<p>One way they can do better is privacy.  We&#x27;re starting to find out now just how much data about our driving habits our cars are storing.  Like smart TV&#x27;s it&#x27;s only a matter of time before the likes of Toyota and Ford decide to sell that data to help increase their margins.  I can see Apple offering the lack of that kind of tracking as a big selling point.')
