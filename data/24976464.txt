You have to include the error, which ends up saying “50%” for both before the election.<p>This doesn’t mean that all prediction suffers from this effect, and you have to be skeptical everywhere. I don’t think that’s a fair characterization. Taleb has won by mispriced options. His main statement is that the true probability of this particular event is much closer to 50%')
