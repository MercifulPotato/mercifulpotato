However, paradoxically, the first rule in influencing people is <i>You cannot change people.</i> You&#x27;ll see this in most communications and negotiations books. The more they sense you are trying to change them, the greater the walls they&#x27;ll put up. Change almost always comes from within, and you can only help them be making it easier for them to change.[1] Instead, you have to bring down their defenses, which includes accepting them as they are, whatever their perverse beliefs. That itself will be a major step towards change. The sort of person who cannot stomach a climate change denier is the sort of person who should exit the conversation first - their prejudices will usually do more harm than good.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t muscle through it with logic, reasoning and data.<p>In that sense, they are merely ordinary people. If you&#x27;ve studied the discipline of influence, you&#x27;ll find that changing people via logic, reason and data is the exception, not the rule. From my time in academia, I can tell you that even amongst highly respected academics, it tends to work only within their narrow discipline, and mostly not in other areas of their life. It&#x27;s not hard to find someone who is in the top of their field adhering to weird beliefs. And my former academic self who knew little about influence in those days can assure you that logic, reasoning and data almost never swayed top scientists from conspiracy theories. I know because I tried, as did many of their colleagues.<p>&gt; Public embarassment, mockery and comedy are the society&#x27;s ways of dealing with this. Not saying this is a good idea as it bolsters them even further, but this is all we&#x27;ve got.<p>It may be all <i>you&#x27;ve</i> got, but it&#x27;s a really ineffective way, and simply closes them off to you. If you read the handbook, they too caution not to use this. Not only that, it alienates even those who are on your side. As an exercise, go find people who used to believe in a conspiracy theory and changed their mind. I&#x27;d wager at least 80% of them did <i>not</i> change their mind through mockery and embarrassment. For bonus points, ask them what they think about that strategy.<p>[1] Ridiculing does the exact opposite - it makes change more difficult in their minds.')
