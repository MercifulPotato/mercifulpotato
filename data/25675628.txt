Companies started making these things in the late 90s, when it made sense. In 2020, it might make sense to <i>keep</i> selling drives. But nobody would <i>start</i> making and selling these drives today.<p>A few things happened around the turn of the century: USB came in, 3.5&quot; floppies went away, and laptops started to replace desktops for more people. 3.5&quot; was clearly not the future, but customers had lots of recent work and data on them, that they needed to access from their new computers.<p>The likes of Apple and Sony sold 3.5&quot; USB drives with their new laptops (for way more than $10!). At some later point, Apple and Sony&#x27;s customers had moved on, but the ecosystem of parts vendors, remaining customers, sellers etc would&#x27;ve been enough for the cheap generic vendors to move in.<p>What happened instead with 5.25&quot;? I&#x27;d say: the market was smaller, because 10 years of growth hadn&#x27;t happened yet. The market was much more fragmented, most computers&#x2F;OSes couldn&#x27;t read disks written on another vendor&#x27;s system. There were fewer pieces of $$$$ equipment (synthesizers, industrial controllers) that embedded them. And finally, the 5.25&quot; -&gt; 3.5&quot; transition was pre-USB and pre-laptop, so desktop users just bought desktops with two non-portable drives using the native disk interface.')
