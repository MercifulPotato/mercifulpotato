The actual subsidy is not from unpopular artists to popular artists, it&#x27;s from (artists listened to by) casual listeners to (artists listened to) by heavy listeners.<p>Under the pro rata model, any heavy listeners will divert &quot;other people&#x27;s money&quot; toward the songs they listen to. This could be a superfan obsessed with some indie band, or it could be a fan of popular artists. Moving to a user centric model will certainly penalize any artists that overindex on heavy listeners. For example, children&#x27;s music that gets put on repeat will probably take a hit.')
