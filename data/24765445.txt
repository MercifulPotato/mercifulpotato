I took issue with saying that it was &quot;common sense&quot; to use a license that prohibited things you didn&#x27;t like. My argument is that you might actually intentionally not do that because there is <i>nuance</i> here that common sense shouldn&#x27;t and couldn&#x27;t paper over.<p>&gt; Why do you not just pick a license that forbids uses not compatible with your ethical standpoint, and chose to just not enforce the terms should they be violated? This way, companies are likely to respect your intent and preference and you don&#x27;t have to make use of a legal system you don&#x27;t support.<p>I think that leads to a lot of grey area in terms of what people are and aren&#x27;t allowed to do with my code. It also kind of presumes that I would ever try to enforce anything, which is itself not just an ideological decision but a decision to be made in light of costs and resources and will.<p>Since we&#x27;re now getting deeper into what I personally do, I&#x27;ll note that in practice, I dual license under the UNLICENSE and the MIT. I use the UNLICENSE because it&#x27;s goal is to explicitly disclaim monopoly copyright interest while attempting to be a public domain dedication. I also add the MIT because some folks stopped using my code when I only used the UNLICENSE because they were too risk averse and wanted a more established license.')
