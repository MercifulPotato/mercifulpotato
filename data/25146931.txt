The company was able to move 10s of thousands of employees in a couple weeks securely and reliably (safe for a few glitches, which are to be expected on that scale).<p>There are reliable solutions to completely segregate what&#x27;s happening on corporate systems from a simple, employee owned laptop connected from home.<p>Sure, you can make pictures of the screen, but you can do that in the office too. Then again you can just print it, while at the office. Something which you can&#x27;t do at home.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t really buy this reasoning for a company fancying itself totally hi-tech.')
