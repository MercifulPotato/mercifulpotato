He has to earn that 40% over 4 years but if he leaves within the first year he gets nothing. All he has within the first 12 months is the promise of potentially 40% of something if he sticks around for 4 years.<p>But honestly, as the lawyer in this thread said, this was a crummy deal from the get go. FOUNDERS (rather than employees) should get Founder shares, which are immediately vested. There can be conditions for &quot;claw back&quot; which allow the company to buy back &#x2F; vest back shares for an early departure, but founders shouldn&#x27;t have to &quot;earn in&quot; their share into a company that they start. After all, they started it. It&#x27;s an odd idea indeed if all the founders have a 1-yr cliff because then in the first year no one technically owns anything!<p>When they say &quot;otherwise you&#x27;ll own 40% of nothing&quot;, it&#x27;s not even clear what they mean. Do they imply that they will dissolve the company and form a new one without you leaving you to hold an empty shell company?<p>At best you can argue for your 1 yr cliff value, which is 10%. You&#x27;re not in the position to negotiate between 40% or 3%. You can only negotiate between 3% and 10% because there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re going to earn the 40% over 4 years.')
