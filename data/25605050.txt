The Connection Machines had many CPUs, but the unsung hero was the hypercube of connections between them [the clue is in the name].  According to Wikipedia it was a 12 dimension hypercube so every node had 12 high speed point-to-point I&#x2F;O channels to adjacent nodes, which must have been a nightmare to implement and a nightmare to design software for.  The cost of a CM-5 (Wikipedia again says $25 million) must have mostly been for this very specialised network.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine this could have been competitive with a $25 million pile of beige PC boxes from the same era, but the PCs would have been starved of I&#x2F;O (10 Mbps shared thick ethernet anyone?) so only applications which don&#x27;t need much I&#x2F;O between the nodes would be possible.<p>A &quot;modern&quot; CM-5 would ironically look much more like the pile of beige PCs, because it will have much less I&#x2F;O -- these cheap chips only seem to have at most one or two fast channels (eg. ethernet and SDIO).  There&#x27;s no way to build these into a hypercube.  It will be constantly limited by bandwidth and contention addressing other nodes in the cluster.<p>So I&#x27;d only build it for fun, not for practicality :-)')
