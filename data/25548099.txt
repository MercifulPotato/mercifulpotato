If you&#x27;re curious to read some, it should be pretty easy to google up. But the general theory is that RTS has lots of subsystems and very few people like <i>all</i> the subsystems in a single game, so the player base fragmented as gaming evolved. Tower defense games took the people who liked the base building part of RTSes. Slower-paced strategy games (Crusader Kings, Total War) took the people who liked deeper strategy. MOBAs took people who liked the micro.<p>&gt; I think there’s room for a middle ground, a game that has more complex strategies like RTS’s do, but with casual play like a moba. We’ll see...<p>One problem is that RTS genre is a bit stuck. It is hard to pull in new players given all the other genres I just mentioned. And old RTS players &quot;like what they like&quot;. You can see this in new RTS games that try something new like Tooth &amp; Tail. It has a <i>lot</i> of negative reviews from RTS players saying things like &quot;No micro?!? This isn&#x27;t a <i>real</i> RTS!&quot; Even though the lack of micro is specifically to try to draw in new players.')
