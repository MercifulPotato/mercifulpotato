Mathematica is definitely cumbersome to quickly solve a PDE, a small linear equation system, or do some factorisation with trigonometric functions, never mind Maxima. OTOH, linear algebra was kind of a pain on the good old TI-89 once you got into div and curl. Also, Fourier series could have been easier.<p>I wouldn’t use a hand held to do some Python now, but younger me used to program a window manager in Casio BASIC, so it’s not inconceivable that some kids in high school might actually use it...')
