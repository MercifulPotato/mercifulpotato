It helped.<p>The fact they restored everything in just a day after receiving it makes that pretty clear. They didn&#x27;t need to evaluate their options much at all; as soon as they received it, the repo was back. I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised to learn that the EFF talked off the record with GitHub beforehand.')
