Here I assume you&#x27;re still interested in moving forward with the speculation. If not, please don&#x27;t belabor the point.<p>There is a substantial body of abiogenesis experimentation focused on reproducing DNA&#x2F;RNA proto-life. They haven&#x27;t managed to make anything that self-replicates, but they <i>have</i> managed to make nucleic acid polymers with catalytic activity, e.g. you zap the primordial soup with lightning, you get a bunch of short sequences, some of those sequences fold into RNA-zymes that catalytically produce long &quot;AAAAAAAAA&quot; sequences or long repeating &quot;AUAUAUAU&quot; sequences. The critical next step is to demonstrate the ability to do this from a template.<p>In any case, are you aware of research that aims to do this with alternative polymer chemistries? Such results could inform our speculation about the likelihood of a fundamental 1000x difference.')
