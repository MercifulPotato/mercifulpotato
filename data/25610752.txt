F# was one of the first MS products Open Sourced and they were an early adopter of running on Mono back in 2010 in order to run cross-platform. Now they&#x27;re a supported language on the latest high-performance cross-platform .NET runtime.<p>For a long time the F# community criticized Microsoft for their lackluster tooling support in VS where it was treated like a 2nd class citizen, but that&#x27;s less of an issue now that a lot of devs are developing F# with cross-platform IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains Rider.')
