[...] And all of those arguments may be right. But right now, I&#x27;d argue that this design hurts mass adoption<p>&gt; You seem to be stuck with confirmation bias: Just because the way things are doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re optimal<p>I&#x27;m afraid you haven&#x27;t understood my words. I&#x27;m not talking about optimal, in fact, optimal is explicitly made a non-goal in my comment. You can tell me about VHS vs Betamax, and all I can say is I had never even heard of Betamax until I saw people talking about it on HN. You can tell me Plan 9 is better than Linux, or that (insert obscure brand here) is better than Heinz. Mass-adopted solution != optimal solution. Mass-adoption doesn&#x27;t even require products to attain <i>local</i> optima, let alone global optima. I use an obscure toothpaste that comes in tablets in glass bottles - totally obscure, likely will never reach mass-adoption, but it is better.<p>I was not aware that mass-adoption was not a goal of SourceHut, and I mistakenly assumed it was. Without mass-adoption as a goal, I can totally see how this mentality you expressed makes perfect sense, and I personally agree with it for less-well-adopted things that I use too: &quot;If it does survive, then we all progress. If it doesn&#x27;t, it was a great experiment&quot;')
