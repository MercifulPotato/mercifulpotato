How society treats people who have made mistakes? How people are treated for mistakes seems to rely on how likable a person is to begin with and how egregious the offense. So, I don’t see that critique of social forgiveness going far in broad terms.<p>It is a fact, however, that mistakes have consequences the costs of which can be far reaching—financially, socially, for many years to come.<p>Like any great fall the question is how quickly you can accept change and move forward. Even harder is to accept yourself as society has weighed your ...contributions. (Ie. corruption)<p>The problem then becomes, of course, how can you rebuild when your resources are also diminished (financial, mentoring, clear thinking, network).<p>But a really charismatic person who is just fun to be around, they’ll bounce back.')
