There&#x27;s too many possible ones, and the branches would just be &quot;?&quot;. We could be cousins of several sorts, convergently evolved to have some similarities, be completely unrelated in any way to other life, or any of several combinations of those.<p>And that&#x27;s just the broad strokes, trees would be the details.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting also that even only considering life on Earth that we already know about, the &quot;tree of life&quot; is already kind of a broken abstraction. Consider bacteria that are able to share genetic material without an ancestor relationship for instance, or closer to home even viruses that infect humans or any other kind of mammals. They affect our genetics in ways the tree doesn&#x27;t&#x2F;can&#x27;t capture.')
