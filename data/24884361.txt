The 70% number bandied about is extremely naively calculated, it assumes 0 pre-existing resistance or immunity (Which we now know exists), and it assumes all humans are homogenous sphere-shaped balls floating around in a gaseous society, which is also obviously not true.<p>There are countless reports and studies on transmission among children in school settings, and they pretty much unilaterally state that there&#x27;s very little spread happening there, contrary to everyone&#x27;s &quot;gut feeling&quot; about kids being snot-nosed petri dishes.')
