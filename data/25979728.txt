Our cities have already collapsed. There&#x27;s crime, corruption, decaying buildings. Detroit looks like it was hit by a nuclear bomb.<p>There&#x27;s not enough money for two reasons. The city overspends on everything due to contract corruption and misled ideals. The money doesn&#x27;t go where it needs to go, and when it goes to the wrong place, it&#x27;s like a black hole.<p>The second reason is because large cities offer many more benefits for the poor. People who cannot afford a car simply cannot live outside of city boundaries and bus lines. With increased crime, corruption, and decay, the taxpayers leave (NYC).<p>Cities cannot fix this. If there will be any solution, it must be a national one. The problem of taxpayers leaving and net-drains arriving can never be solved at the local level.')
