All of a sudden it started to happen.<p>&gt; Rudy, you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican party. He’s got guts, he fights. He fights, and I’ll tell you.<p>&gt; We’re going to have to fight much harder and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.<p>&gt; We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.<p>&gt; I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.<p>&gt; It was going to be great. And now we’re out here fighting.<p>&gt; I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. ... Where is Hillary? Where is she?<p>&gt; But it used to be that they’d argue with me, I’d fight. So I’d fight, they’d fight. I’d fight, they’d fight. ... What happened to Hunter? Where’s Hunter?<p>&gt; Now that’s many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. 400,000 ballots appeared from nowhere, right after the election. (Use of “overthrow the state.”)<p>&gt; Let them get out. Let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength. ... They want to indoctrinate your children.<p>&gt; We did good. We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. ... In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat run cities deployed more than 500 illegal unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes.<p>&gt; When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do.<p>&gt; Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation’s future.<p>&gt; So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats are hopeless. They’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.<p>- POTUS Trump<p>That’s only part of the stuff he said during the speech immediately before they marched, at his direction, to the Capitol building. He mentioned being peaceful once in his speech. Most of the undertones of the speech were about fighting&#x2F;being strong for their way of life and belief in him being the rightful winner.')
