This isn&#x27;t &#x27;new way&#x27; in this case. This is solidly - &#x27;old way&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;re already doing it, but let me tell you how I know so much more than you&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ve lived long enough to understand that young people want new and exciting. I tried to convince my 90+ year old grandfather to invest in hemp farming in the early 90&#x27;s. I get it. But, again, this is different.<p>There&#x27;s a level of arrogance.
