Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=[25864230], score=None, time=1611259690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862880, text='&gt; Yes america believing it has the right to interfere anywhere in the world and police other countries to put in governments sympathetic to US interests is a problem. At least to everyone outside the US anyway.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure about &quot;everyone.&quot;  Also, this principle of noninterference you seem to advocate is morally bankrupt, at least when taken to the extreme you seem to take it.  Some very shitty, powerful people find noninterference in their affairs to be a very useful concept, and I deny they have any right to that.  That&#x27;s not to say interference is always justified or always done for good reasons, but it&#x27;s definitely a valid option on the table.')
