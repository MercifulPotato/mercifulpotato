They were pre-named by the cat rescue place and I didn&#x27;t have any better ideas, and so those names stuck for a while. Explaining &quot;Blossom&quot; was sometimes a challenge if you know me, 20st at the time, petrol head, beer, curry, other things, but do love cats.<p>Anyway, Buzz grew into this almost 5ft long (but not fat, or overweight) slightly clumsy cat in his &quot;teens&quot;; there was a laptop flooded by a glass of water, a not inexpensive B&amp;W speaker broken by an attempted leap (grrr)...usual cat stuff.<p>Privately I started calling him &quot;Bongo&quot;, I don&#x27;t know why, it just seemed appropriate, and suited him. I also started calling Blossom, his sister mini-bongo around the house, but then mini-puss. Blossom was the runt of the litter (there were three cats in the photo, I offered to take all of them, Buzz was the middle cat, Blossom was the tiny one).<p>Anyway just a story.<p>Sadly Bongo (Buzz) passed away due to kidney issues at the age of 10 back in 2014. I miss him, he was so good natured (as is Blossom) and an amazing lump of feline friendlyness, seeing this today brought a wee tear to my eye.<p>Anyway, some links to these awesome pals:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;bMr725m" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;bMr725m</a> (&quot;Bongo&quot;)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;YGZZOAW" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;YGZZOAW</a> (Younger days)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;oq124oJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;oq124oJ</a> (&quot;Bongo...again&quot;)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;Fsgmqsd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;Fsgmqsd</a> (When Buzz broke into a bag of paperwork when I left the house for a couple of hours)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;NZLsF59" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;NZLsF59</a> (They still managed to squeeze into their kitten bed somehow even after five years)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;voqjl0F" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;voqjl0F</a> (Blossom, pretty much today, a bit of a lopsided sit, but 14 and a half years old and still as crazy as ever).')
