If there are already <i>enough</i> providers, then more providers doesn&#x27;t mean more access to care (certainly not based on access to providers, rather than cost).<p>&gt; The problem is that things like social planning of healthcare provision are evidently flawed in every respect due to the belief that they canâ€™t be trusted to markets.<p>You&#x27;re on the edge of a no true scotsman argument here, which means I&#x27;m going to bed.')
