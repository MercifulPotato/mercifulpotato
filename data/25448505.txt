I was a bit skeptical, since OL 8 usually releases much earlier than CentOS 8, but couldn&#x27;t verify things either way.  Someone else mentioned that RH actually <i>only</i> releases RHEL8 sources through CentOS8 sources.  Again, I don&#x27;t know how to verify, but if true they raise a lot of new questions about Oracle Linux 8 given the recent CentOS 8 announcement.')
