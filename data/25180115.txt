Pre-COVID, GC&#x27;s irlstore was generally overpriced, they refused to price match anyone, things like earplugs would be double the price of most places, and their brand&#x2F;stock lineup was not very useful. It felt like you were nowhere near the prosumer&#x2F;power user&#x2F;pro user lines, but at the same time you were incredibly overpriced past beginner items.')
