Item(by='psadauskas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610404339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738121, text='I haven&#x27;t seen the one with Cruz, but I did see the one with T**p that was pretty internet-famous a few months ago. The interviewer didn&#x27;t seem so much &quot;excitable&quot; as exasperated that the subject couldn&#x27;t provide a coherent answer and frustrated he had to re-phrase the same question over and over before giving up and moving on. It would have been easy to set a gotcha trap, but I thought the interviewer did a good job keeping it professional and asking real questions that deserved answers.')
