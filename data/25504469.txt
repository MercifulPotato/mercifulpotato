That position is reflected in WHO’s Terms of References for the relevant study[0], for example.<p>Note that the document appears to imply that WHO’s team will not be allowed to operate on the ground in China to collect evidence (see Phase 1 of Implementation plan, the paragraph about building on existing information and not duplicating existing efforts).<p>Note that the document does not mention the possibility of lab escape, despite documented evidence of SARS-CoV previously escaping from a lab in Beijing and resulting in at least one death years earlier, and the fact that Wuhan is home to another one of the very few BSL–4 labs.<p>I am tired of uninformed “who dealt it” finger-pointing as much as the next guy. First, we currently lack information. Second, even if we had that information, we should accept that mistakes happen (human factor and so on).<p>The only valid grounds for finger-pointing, as far as I’m concerned, is if someone attempts to undermine an effort aimed to make humanity better equipped to deal with a similar scenario in future.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;publications&#x2F;m&#x2F;item&#x2F;who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;publications&#x2F;m&#x2F;item&#x2F;who-convened-global-...</a>')
