Since fathers make unique contributions to the development of their children (eg language development [0] and social skills[1]), it makes sense that the children would also affect the fathers, if they&#x27;re connected&#x2F;&quot;there&quot; enough.<p>Since I&#x27;m guessing there will be a bunch of parents in this thread, let me make a humble book recommendation:<p>Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn<p>The Myth of the Spoiled Child by Alfie Kohn<p>Kohn is an education researcher who&#x27;s kind of an iconoclast. His research has focused heavily on what _helps_ children gain the knowledge, academic wherewithal, and social-emotional  skills to be successful in life. His results have been pretty surprising: Homework doesn&#x27;t do much for children. &quot;Time outs&quot; are harmful. And the list goes on.<p>I&#x27;m simultaneously reading Unconditional Parenting and The Myth of the Spoiled Child, which I&#x27;d recommend. The latter looks at American accepted wisdom about children (every generation thinks that their kids are dumber, lazier, and more mollycoddled than _they_ were) and makes some pretty interesting juxtapositions between what we say we want for our kids and how we treat them.<p>0 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fpg.unc.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;fpg.unc.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;resources&#x2F;snapshots&#x2F;FPG_Snapshot34_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fpg.unc.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;fpg.unc.edu&#x2F;files&#x2F;resources&#x2F;snapsh...</a>\n1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;C_Lewis2&#x2F;publication&#x2F;226820170_Fathers&#x27;_influences_on_children&#x27;s_development_The_evidence_from_two-parent_families&#x2F;links&#x2F;0046352c295fe633a2000000.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;C_Lewis2&#x2F;publication&#x2F;22...</a>')
