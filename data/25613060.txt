But they don’t cover PayPal (which lots of our users need), and also recently added 0.5% charge for all subscriptions [0]. Previously it was included. They definitely added value over time, but I would expect them to raise prices as well over time. Also their support, while still great overall, can be w bit patchy and much slower than before (from our own anecdotal experience).<p>I’m curious about the experience of others with chargebee etc as a layer that potentially lets you “swap” Stripe with something else. Is it worth it?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25072783" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25072783</a>')
