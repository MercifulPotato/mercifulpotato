I drive a white model 3 long range AWD and I love it. I&#x27;m still 1: an engineer with 10 years of hardware experience and 2: skeptical of every ounce of BS Elon Musk has ever spread.<p>You know how many parts are under the car? Have you taken one apart? They&#x27;re complicated machines with, again, orders of magnitude more parts than a phone. Forget ICE vehicles, we&#x27;re just talking about EVs and iPhones. You don&#x27;t think Tesla relies on thousands of suppliers? Who do you think makes the screens, wiring hardness, cameras, brakes, glass, acoustic devices, steering, battery temp management, motorized seats, etc etc. And who do you think supplies their parts? And theirs? And so on and so forth. Its a complicated web of suppliers and manufacturers, much more so than what goes into a single iPhone (which is still very complicated). This is why a Tesla costs 35k+ and an iPhone costs ~1k. There are more parts that are more complicated and manufacturing them takes more time, effort, and people. Elon may have a magic car printer in his wet dreams but that won&#x27;t happen in reality for four, five, or six decades.<p>Also, nobody, I repeat, absolutely nobody is holding their breath for you to hit 1m miles in your Tesla. Currently they don&#x27;t even have a story for repair and so many parts are fused that if something breaks you can&#x27;t replace it. The car is totaled. I recommend you watch all of the early Rich Rebuilds on YouTube if you really want to understand some of the nitty gritty details of these vehicles. Yes they are simpler than a normal ICE. By an order of magnitude? Certainly not. Progress is made at the margins, in increments of 1% then 5% then 10% then 15%. Not 1000% in one swoop.<p>EDIT: clarification')
