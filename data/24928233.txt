There also was a naive undertone of a feeling that the things i am learning will greatly benefit me work wise or that learning howto solder on a mod-chip on a ps1 would make me smarter.<p>I now view learning much more differently and i find many subjects really boring to learn and not useful at all.<p>I also know my limits and abilities now when i am 30 much better than when i was 13-25. Before i felt like there was a chance i could be really good at learning something, or that i had some hidden abilities yet to be discovered. But i no know way too well thats not the case.<p>I much more enjoy simpel things in life now, like eating good food and being with friends. The fire of learning has left me, maybe a bit too early(30) but i already know enough to live the life i want.')
