Maybe it’ll come in the next part, but how are people setting up their authentication&#x2F;access to their hosts? Are you using root and allowing root over ssh? Maybe you’re limiting subnets in sshd_config? Maybe a separate local account named something like “ansible?” With full sudo permissions and nopasswd?<p>How are people properly hardening this account?
