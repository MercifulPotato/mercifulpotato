QEMU&#x27;s core use case is really &quot;run Linux&quot;, and more generally running guest code which stays within the documented bounds of system functionality, doesn&#x27;t require much in the way of device support beyond the CPU itself, and which is happy with &quot;runs as fast as possible&quot; behaviour with no accurate emulation of timing.<p>For a system like the Amiga you will be much better off looking at one of the specifically-an-Amiga-emulator projects.')
