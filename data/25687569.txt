One can implement a C compiler that puts activation records on the heap or does other magic to avoid a stack that can overflow. A call stack is an implementation detail. Expecting it to exist or not exist is assuming things about the compiler. Those assumptions may be reasonable but are not part of the semantics of the language itself. They are about particular properties of your compiler.')
