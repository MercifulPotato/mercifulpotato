We do not plan on redistributing others&#x27; content. That would be totally against our primary goal for this project. We just provide links (no downloads from our site) to the original works so that the illustrator gets more traffic for himself and his other works. Sorry about the redundancy. We try to keep the license info as simple and accurate as possible. Currently, We only provide license info for CC&#x2F;MIT and let users read custom licenses from the original site. Also, we are always ready to respect the decision of the creator if he finds a problem with his work being showcased.')
