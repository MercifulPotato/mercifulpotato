You can&#x27;t, for instance, get housing for as cheap as was possible then due to increased construction standards. But that (and other similar obstacles) are not the result of some cabal of billionaires.<p>Some costs in the US, medical being the primary example, <i>are</i> more expensive than they should be due to financial and political scheming. But most things are not.<p>I&#x27;m from the state of Arkansas, where housing is quite cheap. When I lived there (until 2014), my total cost of living was around under $800&#x2F;month (rent+utilities+food). This comes out to $9600&#x2F;year.')
