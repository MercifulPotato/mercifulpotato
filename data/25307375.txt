I have to imagine the tenacity that develops in such a situation is extremely valuable.  They don&#x27;t look to win, since they know they won&#x27;t, instead, they look for a series of micro-victories. Which means they learn to constantly analyze their opponents and wait patiently for the opportunity to best them in some small aspect.<p>I used to teach jujitsu when I was younger.  My younger (by 5 years) cousin was a student there and he loved to practice with me outside of class.  I remember one time we were doing some informal practice in the afternoon, and during a standing grapple, something distracted me at the door of the gym.  In an instant, he grabbed my leg and slammed me hard into the ground.  I was totally shocked and he wasted no time jumping up and down, celebrating for a good 5 minutes.  He was absolutely as excited as he would have been had he won a championship match.<p>I&#x27;m guessing he had that move planned for weeks or months before ever getting the opportunity to execute it.')
