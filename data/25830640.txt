Pandas does not include derivatives pricing models, daycount conventions, schedule generation and algorithmic differentiation which are all basic ingredients in a modern derivatives pricing framework. In general what you are concerned with here is computing the fair value of each instrument usually as an expectation in a simulation or as a solution to a partial differential equation, and the first derivatives and sometimes second-order derivatives of the fair value with respect to the model parameters. Pandas makes a lot of work in empirical finance nicer, data cleaning, time series work, etc. But when pricing and risk-managing a derivatives book as a market maker you are less concerned with inferring the future from the past, and more with interpolating current data in such a way that you do not open yourself to arbitrage.<p>I worked as a model quant for a year a couple of years ago in a bank in the team responsible for developing and implementing the derivatives pricing models. Everything was written in (a lot of) C++, but I suspected and still suspect that you could get the same performance by leveraging one of the off-the-shelf deep learning libraries with a lot less code. Maybe you would have to write a few central components in C++ and assembly to get the exact same performance. I am glad to see someone actually following through on that idea.')
