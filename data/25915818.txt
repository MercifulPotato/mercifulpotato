You don&#x27;t need to recreate your product (probably).<p>- You don&#x27;t need to run distributed databases in a cluster to start.<p>But I think most importantly the decrease in dev speed and performance is an investment in future scalability. And I only imagine that this different will shrink over time to where for example a 1 node &quot;distributed&quot; DB isn&#x27;t that different to work with than a 1 node &quot;traditional&quot; DB. And that small difference pays off because adding a second node doesn&#x27;t have huge tradeoffs.<p>I agree that right now it doesn&#x27;t make sense. If I was starting a new product I would still fire up a PostgreSQL instance. However I think that the day will come where the difference is small enough and software support is complete enough that we will start with something distributed, much like people don&#x27;t often start with SQLite today, even though it is quicker to get going (also not a great comparison because it has less features).')
