But collectively they are.<p>Some portions of information <i>seem</i> innocent too like &#x27;how much is in your account&#x27; could mean the difference between if someone tries to target me or not.  Say I owe 500 bucks and have 10 in the bank and they may not bother.  But say something like I have no debt and have a million in the bank and suddenly I am a very attractive target.  That is for both &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; actors.<p>Something as simple as giving your email to someone can tie you into yet another ad network.  Which has already profiled you.<p>What is the worst of it is, I really do not care if you had the information.  I do care if you use my information to mess up my life or harass me endlessly.  So my default position is &#x27;sorry I am not telling you that&#x27;.')
