A hole 1&#x2F;10th of the wavelength is about an inch and a half. Not exactly tight tolerances.<p>Perfection generally isn&#x27;t necessary - mitigation is usually sufficient. Reducing the interference signal by some percentage (likely a very, very high percentage) goes a long way.<p>Dropping a wire cage around a device broadcasting in the 700MHz band is going to very significantly reduce the signal.')
