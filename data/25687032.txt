Item(by='wskinner', descendants=None, kids=[25687647], score=None, time=1610126421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25683586, text='When the Bitfinex’d posts came out in 2017, I found them fairly convincing. It seems likely there is something not quite right at Bitfinex and Tether. But I have yet to see any evidence that the scale of “not right” is so large as is frequently claimed. These critiques never seem to address the most parsimonious explanation for periods of increased Tether issuance, which is that they are driven by genuine demand for bitcoin, and much of that demand is routed via Tether.<p>There is ample evidence of the sketchiness of the people behind Bitfinex. But there is also a simple explanation for the behavior of bitcoin and Tether in 202 that involves no conspiracies. Many hodlers bought during the March crash because they saw it as an opportunity to buy at a discount (I am one of these people). The crash coincided with events that should drive up the price of bitcoin over the longer term. Specifically, the creation of trillions of new dollars and what many saw as a new era of much looser monetary and fiscal policy. The idea that demand for hard currencies is increased is totally consistent with this.<p>Compared to 2017, I now believe there is a smaller chance of total tether insolvency and a larger chance of significant but not catastrophic shenanigans.')
