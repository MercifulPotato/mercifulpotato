We can&#x27;t even agree on finally enforcing speed limits but with the virus we closed the whole world. I mean pollution in major cities is a bigger health problem objectively than the virus and yet we still allow old diesels to drive in most of them.<p>What I am saying is not that we shouldn&#x27;t treat the virus seriously but that we really need a lot not urgency when dealing with topics like speeding and pollution.')
