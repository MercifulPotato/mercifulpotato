I&#x27;ve had a better experience with DDG: no sponsored results, less skewed rankings, less censoring (Google removes many results from DMCA requests), and of course no tracking. Google&#x27;s lazy-loaded useless suggestion boxes, added a few years ago, that push the content down, often when clicking on a link, were my final annoyance before switching. For the first bit after switching, I missed seeing the daily Google doodles, but I&#x27;m now more cynical towards Google and no longer care.')
