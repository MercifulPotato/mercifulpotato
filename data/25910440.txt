And believe that it can be done with government fiat.<p>I emphatically believe the opposite.  Data collection, storage, and manipulation is ever becoming easier.  The only actual choice is between a society where we&#x27;re lied to about surveillance, or one where surveillance is generally available.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Transparent-Society-Technology-Between-Privacy&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0738201448" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Transparent-Society-Technology-Betwee...</a> laid out the case for this over 20 years ago.<p>Here are the realistic choices.<p>On the one hand, we can create any set of rules we want on paper.  We can get governments to officially support it.  We can be frustrated as those same governments do it ineffectively.  And then watch as the rules meant to curtail monopolies get caught by regulatory capture and are manipulated to support the very organizations that they are theoretically supposed to punish.  (Seriously, do you expect any secret service to not take advantage of what is possible?  Have you heard of Snowden?)<p>Or we can choose the path recommended in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Transparent-Society-Technology-Between-Privacy&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0738201448" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Transparent-Society-Technology-Betwee...</a>, accept that surveillance is real.  And put the tools in the hands of the masses.  This is already happening.  See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asherkaye.medium.com&#x2F;do-you-know-this-man-7836e54abc10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asherkaye.medium.com&#x2F;do-you-know-this-man-7836e54abc...</a> for a story of how a random person in a random photo was tracked down by an internet stranger using reverse image search with facial recognition.  And the tools are only getting better and harder to stop over time.<p>I personally hate both futures.  But I hate the first one more.  And I see people like you as unwitting pawns who are creating the first of those two futures.  And your unwillingness to understand how things actually work, combined with your certainty that you&#x27;ve got the moral high ground, makes you an easily manipulated true believer.<p>Enjoy your certainty that you&#x27;re in the right here.  I guarantee that you&#x27;ll have a lot to be upset about in the way that our world is shaping up.')
