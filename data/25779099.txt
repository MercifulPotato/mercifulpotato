I worked with a company once that had regulatory burdens.  They were young enough that they hadn&#x27;t yet hired the first IT person, let alone a security team, so it was just regular devs trying to comply.  Needless to say when I came in (as a regular dev that happens to specialize in security) I waved the red flag and pointed out the possible jail time to the executives, and they were not concerned, even though the laws explicitly lay out that &quot;because your employees made a mistake&quot; was unequivocally not an excuse (and this has held up in court by the way).  I&#x27;m being ambiguous intentionally here so I can&#x27;t give details.<p>But regardless whether there is a deterrent benefit, I think the reality is that jails effect non-executives and normal people (especially the closer to poverty you get) far more than they ever would executives.  A much better approach IMHO would be to develop alternatives and phase out incarceration altogether (or at least as much as possible) by rolling them out broadly, would be a better, more humane solution.')
