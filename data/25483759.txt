Hacker adds phone number to their own whatsapp. They do this to thousands&#x2F;tens of thousands of phone numbers.<p>2. All of those phone numbers receive an SMS with the OTP to activate whatsapp. In that OTP, there&#x27;s also a link that will activate whatsapp if you click it. &quot;Enter code XXXXXX or click this link to activate whatsapp on your new phone&quot;<p>3. Someone, somewhere eventually clicks that link.<p>4. Hackers take whatsapp account. Add two-factor authentication to it so that you can&#x27;t take it back by reauthenticating normally.<p>5. Extortion.<p>People usually get it back by contacting whatsapp.')
