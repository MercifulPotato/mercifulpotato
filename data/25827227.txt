It is not a replacement and it is trying to solve a different problem. I dont believe Julia contributers are lying awake at night upset that other languages exist and feel they need to put a stop to that. My point (put across clumsily I see) is that IF that was their goal then they are going about it the wrong way as most R&#x2F;Python users have different priorities.
