Waymo has spent 10 years mapping the same city and its basically the single easiest place to do self-driving in the whole world.<p>If you actually look at Tesla presentation, a huge part of the problem they are dealing with is handing things like 50000 different kinds of speed limit signs in every country in the world. \nAssigning lights to the associated lanes and things like that. Finding the 0.00001% cases like object falling of trucks on the highway. Understanding complex intersection without prior mapping data of any kind.<p>I have not heard a single clear explanation how Waymo will go from where the currently are, to overriding a global general solution.<p>Tesla is a silicon Vally tech company that is trying to get its hand on the exact same people that Apple and Google are. And they unlike Apple and Google have their own gigantic data-gathering fleet across every first-world country. They are so far ahead of everybody in terms of data and data gathering its not even remotely close.<p>The reason Tesla seems to get no respect is that (a) Elon Musk over-promised and now he is forever labeled a joke that can never be taken seriously (b) the consumer product on the road does not yet do all the things it claims it will one day do so it providing something for people to criticize.')
