Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[24699079], score=None, time=1601982221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24696340, text='&quot;Readable&quot; is in the eye of the beholder, which is why I commented that this was something I personally found useful, rather than one of the two subtle flaws I mentioned.<p>I can also disable all print statements with &quot;def print(* args, * * kwargs): pass&quot; at the top of the module.<p>I&#x27;ve had times where I couldn&#x27;t figure out where a print was coming from, so I could replace print() to check the arguments passed in:<p><pre><code>   import builtins\n   builtin_print = builtins.print\n\n   def my_print(*args, **kwargs):\n      if &quot;looking for&quot; in args: # adjust as appropriate\n         1&#x2F;0\n      return builtin_print(*args, **kwargs)\n\n   builtins.print = my_print\n</code></pre>\nPreviously I had to do that by wrapping sys.stdout with my own file-like object, to intercept write(). (Granted, not hard, but harder.)')
