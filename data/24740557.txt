The official arch repos are tiny though, so you frequently need to interact with the AUR (which are just user submitted packages (they need to be built by the installer unlike the official repos)).  I think the AUR clients are all unofficial, so I guess it makes sense that people would become disinterested in them, but I agree for such a core part of the arch experience it sucks.')
