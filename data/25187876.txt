Item(by='azdle', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606146069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185092, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;templates.blakadder.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;templates.blakadder.com&#x2F;</a> lists things that can be flashed with Tasmota. So it&#x27;s not a full list of everything with a direct API, but it&#x27;s a list that is already contains basically every type of device. And once you re-flash the thing it&#x27;s fully yours, no need to worry about who your device data is getting shared with, no apps that vacuum up your contacts, and no risk of the mfg pushing an update that breaks your setup.')
