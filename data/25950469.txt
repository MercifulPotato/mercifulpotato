Nathan has a scientific  scope using  a high power microscope objective, an XY stage, and lighting. The results are  different.   Focus  stacking improves depth of field.  But if you&#x27;re  aligning the flakes perpindicular to  the optical axis, flat, then it makes  more sense to just select the appropriate objective and lighting for the DOF you want, and scan the XY with a very high resolution objective to get the 2D details of flat flakes.<p>Big  difference (I do both, but not on snowflakes).<p>Agree he&#x27;s  good at PR.')
