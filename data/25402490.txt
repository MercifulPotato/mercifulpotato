I think most ebooks in general, particularly in web dev space, are void of quality content; so while I completely understand and see your perspective, I think in the context of what is out there, this book is a good effort.<p>I personally would also write a more condensed guide (actually I did :D see here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ashok-khanna&#x2F;common-lisp-by-example" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ashok-khanna&#x2F;common-lisp-by-example</a>), but that’s just you and me having similar style choices :)<p>I need to copy that springer style, it’s beautiful too!')
