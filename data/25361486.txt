Item(by='dhodell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607536884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25356495, text='&gt; Nobody will ever remember the rejected error handling or genetics proposals; but people will definitely take notice if the eventually accepted one come attached with Google names.<p>I guess, but my point is that many of the rejected ones are attached with Google names. Also it&#x27;s unclear to me that the reason for not remembering is due to who proposes and implements the things -- it seems more likely that this is due to a huge volume of proposals over a long span of time. WRT generics, it&#x27;s also very clear that community feedback is being incorporated.<p>So this is why I think the issue is really rejection. Nobody&#x27;s really upset about how error reporting or generics are being handled because it&#x27;s clear that community feedback is being honored, and it&#x27;s clear that the core team is holding themselves to the same standard the community is being held to. Those two properties aren&#x27;t as clear in the packaging situation.<p>That&#x27;s why I think Fuchsia having a documented community process and also having been working within that process for some time is important. We&#x27;re already holding ourselves to the standard we&#x27;re asking of the community.<p>&gt; I believe it takes extra concerted effort.<p>This is absolutely true, and it&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here trying to make sure that folks know there are people involved in the project who care greatly about its open nature.<p>Many people have pointed out that the existence of open source doesn&#x27;t necessarily make the project accessible for contribution, and that&#x27;s I think the more difficult problem to solve in the short-to-medium-term.')
