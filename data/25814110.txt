Item(by='jfrunyon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610912303, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810245, text='&gt; The average YubiKey is £50. There are a few around the £30 price point. That’s a huge expense given the small number of sites that support them.<p>A wide variety of sites support them. I&#x27;d estimate around 1&#x2F;3rd of the services I use daily (both personally and for work) support them. (That said, I got mine for $30 by signing up for a magazine subscription, and wouldn&#x27;t have paid significantly more. And, of course, some of my services have been chosen because they differentiated themelves from the competition by Yubikey support.)<p>&gt; Buy a device, register it, install the app, configure it, find the setting in the website, enable it, hope your machine has the right sort of USB ports, press the button at the right time.<p>Except, with U2F, that&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s just &quot;buy a device, plug it in, find the place on the website, wait for a prompt, press a button&quot;.<p>&gt; Convenience. My YubiKey is on my keyring. My keys are in my coat.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty personal problem. For me, my keys are either on my belt loop or on my desk, which means it&#x27;s always handy. Of course, you can also get one of the models which is designed to stay plugged in, if that is compliant with your threat model.<p>&gt; Risk. YubiKeys have no password lock of their own. ... if you’ve stolen my laptop and the YubiKey is plugged in<p>True, which is why they&#x27;re not generally suitable for standalone use; only as a second credential. Also, if your threat model has you worried about them being stolen together, simply don&#x27;t leave them plugged in together.<p>&gt; Support. WebAuthn is a great standard – but only a few sites support it.<p>That&#x27;s still as false it was when it was your first point.<p>&gt; If fake-github.com said “Hmmm we’re having problems with our WebAuthn backend – please use a one-time code from your authenticator app for added security” would you be fooled?<p>At the very least, it would probably cause me to double-check that I was on a legit site.<p>Overall: I don&#x27;t think you give enough credence to the fact that it&#x27;s real, secure, convenient 2FA. No more digging your phone out of your pocket, unlocking it, navigating to the app, and then setting your phone down so you can type in the code. And then locking your phone and putting it back away.<p>Personally, my Yubikey goes into my laptop at the start of the work day (the first time I use it), and it doesn&#x27;t  come out until I&#x27;m done working (well, or if I need to use my keys). All I have to do is tap the button after I put my password in.')
