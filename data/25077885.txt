No. Even if the criticism is harsh, even hateful. I find this a particularly curious example, because there&#x27;s a long history of criticism of religion, from Nietzsche to Dawkins, much of it harsh, even hateful. I&#x27;m not aware of any countries that ban these writers, though apparently Dawkins got cancelled for also applying his criticism to islam. And what if your religion itself entails beliefs that makes other people, such as women or homosexuals, fear for their rights? Then they are not allowed to hate on your religion, because that makes you fear for your freedom of religion?')
