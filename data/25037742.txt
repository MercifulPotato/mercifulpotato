You get assigned a number of points based on your education level, language aptitude, work experience in Canada, etc. Your application is processed in an order based on how many points you have.<p>They have to “invite” you to apply based on how many points you have, but once you get the invitation and do apply they turn it around in 6 months. Of course now even with Express Entry many applications are stuck in limbo for longer because of increased processing times due to the pandemic ):')
