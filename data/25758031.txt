Even more interestingly if you backorder a domain name owned by another person and that domain name expires, the creation date reflected in the WHOIS record once you obtain it will be the previous owner&#x27;s creation date, not the date you obtained the domain. I think this behavior varies by registrar but that is how it seems to function on GoDaddy.')
