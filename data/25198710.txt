Unsure upon what the PS5 runs for certain, but can be sure that FBSD will live on and amazing how much from that codebase that people use.<p>So whilst Linux for many put BSD&#x27;s to distant past memories, the amount of code from it that is used in other projects&#x2F;products down the line is larger than many realise and can imagine that more people run lines of code with FreeBSD origins today than early 2000&#x27;s.')
