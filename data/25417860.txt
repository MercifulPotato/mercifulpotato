I mean, really work, not be at office.</i><p>Yes.  Some people can, some people can&#x27;t.  Some people can, but they don&#x27;t really need to in order to do the job that they get paid for.  Some people struggle for 9 hours a day trying to do the job that someone else can do in 2.<p>Mental performance varies tremendously from person to person, as does athletic performance.  Can someone run 4 miles in 20 minutes without stopping?  Sure.  Some people can keep up that pace for a marathon (26 miles).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry so much about what other people are doing.  Just focus on your own performance and improve it (or don&#x27;t) based upon how you feel about your productivity and its impact on your life.  If enhancing it is your goal, you&#x27;ve taken the first step of measuring it and understanding what influences it.  You could cut out distractions and see how that works for you.<p>For me, improving my performance has always meant synching up my work with what interests me.  Sometimes that can mean changing what I&#x27;m working on - when I have that flexibility.  Sometimes I have to jump-start my interest in a more boring problem by trying to mentally frame it in a way that I framed other problems that have interested me in my life.')
