I hope a lot of the major VPS providers end up supporting it like Digital Ocean or Linode, etc. Shame many of them you just can&#x27;t just upload your own ISO.<p>I have a project idea I been toying with and my plan was to use CentOS as the base, but the news has been a big disappointment. I&#x27;m not too far along though, so switching to something like Debian wouldn&#x27;t be too hard but I liked the idea of longer stable releases.<p>Feel like the folks at Red Hat&#x2F;IBM has stabbed the community in the back, and also wondering about the other projects they support like Podman, etc.<p>The EOL for CentOS 8 was supposed to be 2029, so people and organizations planned on using it for the stability without needing to worry about major yearly upgrades. So if they take their word back on this project, what about other projects or even paid products by the same company?<p>Then some were mentioning they waited until CentOS 6 was EOL, so some just skipped CentOS 7 and went straight to 8. Then with COVID shutdowns causing cutbacks and layoffs at places, people might have to upgrade sooner than they&#x27;d hope to something else or fork out the money. Seems predatory to me, so I think this move makes IBM look bad. Really hope someone realizes this is a huge mistake and backtracks. Feel like this is something someone in higher management did hoping to increase revenue without thinking about the whole larger picture.')
