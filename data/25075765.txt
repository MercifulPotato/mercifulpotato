You can fake it with extras, but it&#x27;s a hack<p>- if you upgrade to a new python minor version you also have to upgrade to the latest poetry version or things just fail (Something to do with the correct selection of vendored dependencies. May have since been fixed -- new python versions don&#x27;t come out all that often for me to run into it. And in fairness the latest pip is typically bundled with each python so it avoids that issue)<p>I still use poetry because it&#x27;s more standard than hand-rolled pip freeze wrapper scripts, and there&#x27;s definitely progress (the inability to sync packages was a hard requirement for me but is not fixed) but it&#x27;s not quite there yet')
