Between being crammed in the cars, the mentally unstable accosting you, the lack of cleanliness and the occasional assault I&#x27;m simply not willing to deal with that continuously. I put up with it because it was cheaper than owning a car in NYC at a time where I needed to make that trade off but I don&#x27;t need to make that trade off any more.<p>This is with the MTA receiving billions of dollars and subsidies. Give us a system like Japan or even some of the light rail like I experienced in France and I can see people moving towards public transport. Continue to give us systems like the New York subway and I don&#x27;t see cars going away.<p>This article makes largely the same point -- the way we do public transport in the US is flawed and technology can help us make it less so, but it has to have buy in from our political systems and the people. As long as institutions like the MTA have a say we&#x27;ll only see mismanaged and rapidly aging systems.')
