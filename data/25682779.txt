Just like the same power structures were last year used to amplify the &quot;positive&quot; message of certain other protests.<p>Armed people stormed the US Capitol, after being incited to do so by the current US President, in order to overturn a legal election result. People died as well.<p>You can&#x27;t &quot;blow this out of proportion&quot; the same way you can&#x27;t blow something like Chernobyl out of proportion - it was huge, it has huge ramifications, it impacts a lot of people.
