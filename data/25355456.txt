Yoshua especially was right there with Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, Andrew Ng as the earliest pioneers of successful deep learning, for over 20 years. (While most technologists were crazy about this thing called the World Wide Web in the late 1990&#x27;s, these guys were shaping brain-inspired AI algorithms and representations.)<p>Anyways, one of the papers by Yoshua that was really influential on my master&#x27;s thesis was published in 2009, has received 8956 citations to date on Google Scholar, called &quot;Learning Deep Architectures for AI&quot;. For many young researchers, even though this paper pre-dates much of the hyped architectures of the current era, I would still recommend it for its timeless views on deep representations as equivalent to architectural units of learning and knowledge, including its breakdown of deep networks as compositions of functions.<p>&quot;Learning Deep Architectures for AI&quot; by Yoshua Bengio (2009) -\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iro.umontreal.ca&#x2F;~lisa&#x2F;pointeurs&#x2F;TR1312.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iro.umontreal.ca&#x2F;~lisa&#x2F;pointeurs&#x2F;TR1312.pdf</a>')
