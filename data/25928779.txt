If I have a private Facebook account that&#x27;s reserved solely for family matters, what right do you as a prospective employer have to expect to see it?<p>- I see your point is based on the notion that &quot;if it&#x27;s public in one space, you <i>intend</i> for it to be public in all spaces in your life&quot; - but that&#x27;s an incorrect assumption: Fetlife profiles aren&#x27;t &quot;public&quot; (insofar as Google can&#x27;t see them), and I don&#x27;t have my real-life name on it, and I certainly don&#x27;t intend to share it with anyone whom I want to maintain a strict separation from my private life.<p>Am I not entitled to a private life? What right do you have to enter my private life?<p>Can I see your Fetlife account? Can I see inside your house from the street-level windows? Can I bring a ladder to the side of your house and peer into your upstairs bedroom? Where&#x27;s the limit for you?')
