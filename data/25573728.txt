Interactive video games require you to take and execute the decision yourself, putting yourself in the shoes of the player character.<p>If you&#x27;ve played the Last of Us 1 or 2, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. If you saw it, it would affect you deeply. But actually doing those things hits so much harder. Is it possible that has a deeper effect on us compared to a movie? I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s not a ridiculous proposition.')
