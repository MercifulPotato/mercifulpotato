What you consider complex is considerably different from what, say, a beaver considers complex—I&#x27;d much rather trust a beaver to make a beaver-dam than a human. I conclude from this is that it&#x27;s the line rider itself that is beyond the capacity of most species, not the composition, which is of incalculable marginal complexity compared to beavers first inventing Line Rider before moving on to make dams. Not a great move, if I do dare to put myself in the flippers of a beaver—you&#x27;d have to invent language first, which must be a rather arduous task compared to doing what your parents and instincts teach you.<p>FWIW I have much greater hopes for humanity than this dedication to a line rider map. One day we&#x27;ll intelligently compose into stopping global warming, I swear!')
