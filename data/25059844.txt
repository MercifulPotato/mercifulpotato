But if trafalgar is the only group putting out polls where trump is ahead in several states, and then those states are lost, isn&#x27;t that meaningful? Trafalgar was putting a &quot;shy trump voter&quot; bias into their polls, basically shoving the polls arbitrarily right.  Some of that may have helped with polling errors that hurt other pollsters, but its clear they went too far, especially with many midwest states that ended up going blue.')
