What they are reporting makes no sense.  Putting people in a HYPERbaric oxygen chamber shouldn&#x27;t make them HYPOxic, which is what they are suggesting causes the age-reversing effect.<p>This fundamental misunderstanding gives me little faith they have in any way correctly interpreted and reported on the study.')
