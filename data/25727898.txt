I&#x27;ve had multiple orders lost for a month plus now and they&#x27;re like &quot;blah blah covid, please wait&quot;.<p>Or then I accepted an invite to Halo Band and it died on me 2 and a half months in, just stopped charging... not only did the support agent tell me to try using my phone charger (the Halo uses a proprietary connector...) to charge it, he then insisted I needed to <i>buy</i> a replacement power adapter and try that before they&#x27;d do anything. For a beta product that was (is?) invite only. Eventually I got Amazon to send me a new device, which came in a plastic baggy wit no bubble wrap dropped into one of their soft mailers with a refurb sticker on it...<p>I&#x27;m going to need them to get all of their departments on the same page.')
