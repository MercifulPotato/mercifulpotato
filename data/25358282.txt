Item(by='542354234235', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607521088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25349293, text='&gt; You are absolutely more likely to be shot at while serving a warrant, than working in a convenience store.<p>Over 600 convenience store workers are murdered on the job per year [1] compared to about 60 per year for police [2], about 5-7 of which are during serving warrants (additionally backed by your own source). Convenience store workers are murdered at about 7 per 100k, while police are about 7-8 per 100k [3]. As for how dangerous it is, there are more than 60,000 “no knock raid” search warrants per year in the US [4] and there is no way of knowing how many 10s of thousands of regular warrants are served as well. Saying that serving warrants is “inherently dangerous” because people <i>could</i> become violent is like saying working at a convenience store is inherently dangerous because any customer <i>could</i> be a violent robber.<p>&gt; This is a shameful remark, exemplary of the general tone here. &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to get COVID and die - quit being a nurse - now go ahead and work without a mask!&quot;. It&#x27;s absurd (and basically offensive) to suggest that public servants shouldn&#x27;t have the right to take appropriate steps to defend themselves, or even have to put themselves in a position of danger, let alone harassment in the first place.<p>Well, wearing a mask doesn’t put others at greater risk. If police want to wear body armor, great. If police want to put other people in danger by excessive weapons use, then no that is not ok. Everyone is allowed to defend themselves against an attacker. Police want to defend themselves anyone that <i>could be an attacker</i>, which is not ok. I am all for providing safety equipment and training to all jobs. I am not ok with compromising the safety of others for the safety, perceived or otherwise, of the police.<p>This twisting of the concept of defending yourself is exactly the problem. Police already carry guns, multiple less lethal weapons, body armor, etc. If they are attacked, they have multiple ways of stopping the threat, including deadly force. No one has made any claim otherwise. But police want to be able to brandish their weapons and point their weapons at other people that have not shown themselves to be a threat, because there is the <i>possibility</i> of a threat and the misguided idea that imagined threats justify real threats by the police against other citizens.<p>My tone is one of outrage that police brandishing or even drawing their weapons against unarmed fellow citizens is just seen as normal and acceptable. That police being allowed to see every person as a potential threat and to treat them that way is the standard. Having your hand on your weapon is a threat. Having a weapon drawn is a threat. Pointing your weapon at someone else is a threat. Police threatening unarmed people is not acceptable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;mlr&#x2F;cwc&#x2F;assaults-and-violent-acts-in-the-private-retail-trade-sector-20032008.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;mlr&#x2F;cwc&#x2F;assaults-and-violent-acts-i...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;fbi-releases-2019-statistics-on-law-enforcement-officers-killed-in-the-line-of-duty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fbi.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;fbi-release...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;iif&#x2F;oshwc&#x2F;cfoi&#x2F;police-2018.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;iif&#x2F;oshwc&#x2F;cfoi&#x2F;police-2018.htm</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-war-on-drugs-gave-rise-to-no-knock-warrants-breonna-taylors-death-could-end-them" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;politics&#x2F;the-war-on-drugs-gave-...</a>')
