I agree, that seems likely.<p>In my mind, this would likely include housing&#x2F;land ownership.<p>By proposing to subsidise housing instead, you&#x27;re proposing to effectively give this money directly to landlords instead of to everyone to have their own negotiating power and make their own decision.<p>But, won&#x27;t the cost <i>still</i> just rise accordingly, by your theory - won&#x27;t landlords just pocket that money and demand even more?<p>It seems more effective to trust people with their own money.')
