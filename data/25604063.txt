We had a pretty amazing on-prem lab full of Blades that we used for distcc, so I&#x27;m sure that helped deliver the lightning.<p>One thing people always overlook though with distcc is that while you compile remote, you always link local.  That was the bulk of our build time and wasn&#x27;t the fault of distcc.  Object files would come at lightning speed (compared to pure local build) but linking was still non-trivial.<p>These days I&#x27;d bet a modern AMD would beat distcc in our situation due to latency times.')
