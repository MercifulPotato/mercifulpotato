There is no grid pattern here, its still using the medieval street patterns, plus a whole set of one way routes and no stopping areas. That&#x27;s why this is so complex. Roads are also all named, sometimes confusingly. &quot;One poultry&quot; is a road, not a building, you&#x27;ll need a number to go with that to get to a building. &quot;Crutched Friars&quot; is a street. &quot;Blackfriars&quot; is a bridge and a station and a road all in slightly different places. There are at least 4 Green Lanes...')
