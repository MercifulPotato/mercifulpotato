IMO the <i>thought</i> of implicit conversion is absolutely asinine.<p>But, in fairness, PHP isn&#x27;t the only language that does this. Python, at least, is more sane.<p>&gt; and drop any string after, e.g. &#x27;1eabc&#x27; becomes 1.<p>In defense of PHP, it does yield a NOTICE if you attempt to apply certain operations to implicitly cast strings (e.g. addition), so there&#x27;s that.<p>Suffices to say that while I&#x27;ve written PHP for years, I&#x27;m quite comfortable with its idiosyncrasies, it doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t find them appallingly brain damaged. :)<p>FWIW the identity operator (===) is also a best practice in JS for nearly identical reasons which also exhibits similar (and in some cases nearly identical) implicit casting.')
