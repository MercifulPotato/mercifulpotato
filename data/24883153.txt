Hammack’s book is great, and it’s great that the author made it freely available.  I personally used Chartrand’s “mathematical proofs” and thought it was very helpful, I like it a little better than Hammack’s book, but they are both great for people getting started, particularly for self-study.<p>You also need to talk to other humans about math on a regular basis - feel free to contact me, I love talking math!
