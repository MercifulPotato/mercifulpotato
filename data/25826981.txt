The purpose of voting in a democracy is to remove gridlocks.<p>Well I suppose in a &quot;pure&quot; democracy where voting decides everything there is no gridlock, but those types of systems usually suck because there are no checks or balances, and whoever buys up the most votes wins. Most western nations are not governed by pure democracies. USA is a federal republic with 3 systems of government that check and balance each other and they get gridlocked all the time.<p>&gt; And if they really cared, they could trivially have you killed, with nothing happening<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;with nothing happening&quot;. Something would definitely happen. If you&#x27;re OJ Simson and the prosecution botches your case, then sure &quot;nothing happened&quot; (besides the millions you spent on lawyers and bad PR). But even OJ wasn&#x27;t untouchable - he spent around a decade in prison later for other felonies. What about Jeffery Epstein? Harvey Weinstein? Yeah, their money buffered them for decades, but justice eventually caught them in its jaws.')
