Item(by='Tuna-Fish', descendants=None, kids=[25919205], score=None, time=1611683176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916718, text='&gt; Everyone else had to play by the same rules until SpaceX doesn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; You say it&#x27;s fair, but certainly if you were in that industry as a competitor it appears as favoritism.<p>No they didn&#x27;t. When this was publicly said by a competitor when the challenge to the amendment was filed, and exasperated FCC official literally said publicly that anyone is, and has always been, able to do things the way that SpaceX is doing, and in fact FCC prefers it. The only reason most companies have not been doing it this way in the past is that SpaceX ends up paying a lot more in filing fees. The argument that SpaceX doing this is somehow favoritism is harebrained. What exactly is stopping the competitors from doing the same?<p>Whether it&#x27;s fair or not is also entirely beside the point. That was not what I was arguing at all.<p>&gt; They also lie to push things through, like rate of decay, speeds offered, latency.<p>No, they don&#x27;t. The rate of decay calculations in SpaceX filings have been based on the models FCC expects licensees to use. Yes, they do not perfectly model reality, but they are what FCC wants, and what everyone else uses too. As for speeds offered and latency, well, actual latency as realized in the beta seems well in line with what SpaceX has promised, and while they so far only offer a single speed grade to beta testers, they have demonstrated speeds in line with their original claims to the air force, and presumably will also offer those to customers (at a much higher price point) some point in the future. This is also entirely beside the point.<p>To be frank, right now you sound like you have read too many dishonest SpaceX hitpieces, synthesized the idea that SpaceX is ran by cowboys who habitually ignore the rules, and are grasping at straws to support it, including quite a bit of moving the goalposts.<p>I have made a single, factual claim: SpaceX meticulously follows the rulings given out by FCC and FAA. I spend quite a lot of time spelunking FCC filings looking for information about satellites, and I honestly believe it to be true. Can you point to a single actual counterexample? Not &quot;competitor is angry about FCC ruling and claims FCC shouldn&#x27;t have done something&quot;, but an actual FCC ruling or regulation on the books, that SpaceX proceeded to break. Because I do not know of a single example, and that is actually rare for a company in the industry. If you believe such an example to exist, please post it, preferably with a link to the actual ruling they are breaking.')
