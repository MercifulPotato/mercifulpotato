Here&#x27;s a popular media story about the article [2].<p>I have cut out sugar except for social occasions in the last 10 years and find amazing improvement to my well-being and clarity of mind. The alliance of food mega-industry and politics in the US is one of the reasons the US is morbidly obese.<p>I routinely score higher on my health checks (we have a once-a-year doctor check-up with blood-work for all employees) than my colleagues that are very fit and engage in more physical activity than me, but consume sugar daily. I also have almost eliminated dental procedures, excluding routine check-ups. Before, I needed a cavity filled every other year.<p>These are just personal anecdotes, but there is starting to be more and more research out there on just how bad sugar is. Consider doing a personal experiment and see how you feel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosmedicine&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal.pmed.1001798" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosmedicine&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;jo...</a>\n[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-industry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psmag.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;the-not-so-sweet-side-to-the-sugar-in...</a>')
