He was literally separating children from their parents to scare others away.</i><p>To put it precisely, the child separation policy is in clear violation of the fourth Geneva Convention, the <i>Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War</i>, which also governs the rights of aliens in times of peace. Specifically, Article 38 ยง5:<p><i>children under fifteen years, pregnant women and mothers of children under seven years shall benefit by any preferential treatment to the same extent as the nationals of the State concerned.</i><p>The US has been no stranger to Geneva Convention violations but this is a particularly egregious example within our own borders thats also arguably a violation of the <i>Geneva Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide</i> [2].<p>Coming from a country that lost tens of millions of its people to the war machine that inspired the Geneva Convention, I feel physically sick that people support someone who would <i>intentionally</i> enact such policies. The last four years of gaslighting has made it incredibly difficult to interpret that support as anything but a complete dereliction of empathy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;ihl&#x2F;385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d&#x2F;6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;ihl&#x2F;385ec082b509e76c412567390...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;applic&#x2F;ihl&#x2F;ihl.nsf&#x2F;Treaty.xsp?documentId=1507EE9200C58C5EC12563F6005FB3E5&amp;action=openDocument" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihl-databases.icrc.org&#x2F;applic&#x2F;ihl&#x2F;ihl.nsf&#x2F;Treaty.xsp...</a> - Article 2 is the relevant one')
