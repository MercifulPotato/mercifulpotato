Item(by='Yetanfou', descendants=None, kids=[24668624], score=None, time=1601683887, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24666611, text='You <i>do</i> realise that your wife&#x27;s Bantu-speaking ancestors displaced the Khoi and San (also known as bushmen) when they <i>invaded</i> the area which is now known as Botswana I hope? If you insist on <i>decolonising</i> Botswana it is not the western coloniser (who gave up its colonies in 1966) who bears the brunt of shame but the Bantu-speaking Kalanga since they displaced the original population - the Khoi and San go back a <i>long</i> time, back to the dawn of Homo Sapiens Sapiens. If your wife descends from Tswana-speaking people she doesn&#x27;t escape guilt since the Bakgalagadi moved into the southern Kalahari which was, again, previously inhabited by the San and Khoi. Or did she maybe descend from the Toutswe who came out of the east and invaded parts of the territory now known as Botswana? Or maybe she descends from the Bakwena who moved into the southern Kalahari and displaced the Bakgalagadi (who earlier on had displaced the San and Khoi)? Should she descend from the Bangwaketse she has ancestors who occupied parts of western Botswana, if instead she has her ancestry with the Bangwato she&#x27;ll be sad to learn that her ancestors occupied parts of Botswana which were formerly held by the Kalanga. Eventually the Batawana moved into the Okavango delta, one of the last refuges for the Khoi and San in Botswana so if she descends from them the memory of her ancestors&#x27; guilt is still fresh - the late 1700&#x27;s.<p>Maybe it is better to take history as it is, learn lessons from where things went wrong so those mistakes are not repeated and look forward instead of back?')
