It just means that organizations smaller than NYT or WaPo will make proportionally less money, which would be true of any monetization method. The question is whether you can bring in as many total dollars with such a shared subscription scheme as you could with advertising or some other similar venue.<p>&gt; Likewise, most artists don&#x27;t make any meaningful money from Spotify.<p>And if they would have made meaningful money with CDs, merch, and whatnot then the cause is that people are paying less in aggregate for music via Spotify than they used to from other channels (Spotify&#x27;s cut might also play a role if the difference is only 2x or something). It&#x27;s not that Spotify is paying out in proportion to listens, because that was already happening.')
