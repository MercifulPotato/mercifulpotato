The right hand side is the parametric representation in matrix form of the manifold used. The &#x27;R&#x27; is the curvature tensor, which is a in terms of the metric and its derivatives of the entries.  Because there are 4 dimensions, a 4x4  metric tensor is used to describe the manifold, and because it is symmetric, there are 10 unique entries and hence 10 equations. These entries are not integers but are parametric equations themselves.')
