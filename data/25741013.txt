The engine is an implementation detail that programmers probably care very little about; a linear engine being default but not raising errors would be the best-of-all-worlds scenario.<p>(It’s a little weird to see the i flag not working with linear regexes, mind. Surely that’s easily implemented when the regex is compiled?)')
