Not unless you&#x27;re sideloading apps and your device doesn&#x27;t have Google Play on it.<p>Notifications about phone os updates seems like a bit of a stretch.  When my Windows device has updates I can&#x27;t remove those notifications.  And on MacOS I can&#x27;t close the update window though the notification can be dismissed (at least for the Big Sur update I just did last week).<p>iPhone&#x27;s have apps that can&#x27;t be removed that come from Apple.  Ever tried removing Siri?  Bixby seems like Samsung&#x27;s rough equivalent.  Some Apple apps you can remove but then the phone&#x27;s &quot;system functionality&quot; becomes questionable (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208094" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208094</a>).<p>Seeing as android=Google, and Samsung=Note10 it&#x27;s not too much of a stretch for them to bundle apps.  I&#x27;d agree--it&#x27;d still be nice to be able to remove everything.  But the bundleware you&#x27;re complaining about, outside of the device manufacturers and OS owner, amount to Netflix, Facebook, and OneDrive.  Yea less than ideal.  But disable them if you don&#x27;t want them there and they&#x27;ll be as good as gone aside from a few mb of space.  Again--not ideal, but it&#x27;s hard to believe this is that big of a deal breaker.')
