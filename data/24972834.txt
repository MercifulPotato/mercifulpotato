It&#x27;s a clunky way to see isolated formating for a short portion of text.  For example, how to search for all places in the text for a font change, or margin change, or section format change.  It&#x27;s difficult to also show where certain formatting starts or stops.  \nUnder WP, you can instantly scan the entire document looking for those changes. Not so with MS Word.  That being said, RF is better to compare 2 sections of text to immediately show their differences.')
