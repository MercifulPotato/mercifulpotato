But it’s certainly something that could be exposed at the API level and optimized in the future. I’d be really curious to see if Microsoft would let Apple show them up on relative emulation performance. In the old days I’d assume no way... now I kinda think they’d jump at the opportunity to let Apple be their flagship reference hardware.')
