If you look at any independent consumer reports the picture is very different. And<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s plenty of people liking Google and even Facebook still.<p>Please never never mix up the sentiment of a site with a voting system (which while design will drown out certain ideas) with the general reality. This leads into very nasty surprises - both when releasing products in your company or when expecting election results. To be honest it&#x27;s very bizzare that supposedly smart people on HN say dumb things like &quot;who&#x27;s still using Google products&quot; and other silly sentiment in this very thread.<p>(Having said that, YTM is a pretty awful product which seems to be born from some very awful corporate decisionmaking. Everything YouTube is really.)')
