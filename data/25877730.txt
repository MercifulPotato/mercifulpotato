Unlike C++ it&#x27;s a 100% superset of C, and it takes its cues from Smalltalk where objects send messages to each other rather than statically call each other&#x27;s procedures. To support this, there is a very rich runtime that allows all sorts of reflection and metaprogamming atypical in a compiled language.')
