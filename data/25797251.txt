If your adversary can simply join the  group or turn existing members, ... or  host the service itself directly ... then confidentiality is lost.<p><i>Large-scale subversive movements rely on impunity, not tradecraft.</i>  They operate in the open <i>because they can</i>, or possibly <i>because they have no effective fear of doing so</i>.  This might be through allies, self-defence capabilities, counterstrike or retaliation capacity,  or other factors.<p>Secrecy, tradecraft, encryption, and the like are not entirely useless.  They are vital to strategic planning <i>within a small and trusted core leadership</i>, and also over generally short periods of time during active operaton to maximise enemy uncertainty over actual plans and activity.  Deep-strike or retaliatory-strike teams may operate under cover or concealment, but typically reveal their position when striking (snipers, SBLMs, wet-ops teams).  Cyberwarfare is an exception to this general rule:  computer networks themselves elevate uncertainty over position and identity, though routes and peers are typically apparent.<p>As Google+ shut down from September 2018--April 2019, I helped with assessments  of migrating users and communities elsewhere.  A large part of that was assessing just how many groups existed, how many members, and how much activity.  Available data suggested about 5 million groups.  Sitemaps revealed over 8 million by shutdown date, growing rapidly even in the final weeks, though also showing many deletions.<p>In particular, G+ Communities could be Open (anyone can join), Closed (moderator must approve), or Private (activity and membership hidden).  Both &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&#x27; communities are &quot;Public&quot;.<p>90% of communities were public, 10% private.<p>Of the public communities, roughly equal numbers were Open (55%) and closed (45%).  But the mean <i>membership</i> was 91% open, 9% closed.  <i>Simply requiring moderator approval reduces membership by ~90%.</i>  Those of you designing intake funnels, take note.<p>Private community size wasn&#x27;t available to me, but I strongly suspect a similar magnitude effect.<p>Extremists grow movements when they can operate overtly.  Being pushed underground will impact surveillance relatively modestly, but organising and recruiting bigly, in my belief.<p>Further notes and graphs on G+ community characteristics:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.antefriguserat.de&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Migrating_Google%2B_Communities#Google.2B_Community_Characteristics_and_Membership" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;social.antefriguserat.de&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Migrating_Google%...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;plexodus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9zx67d&#x2F;google_communities_membership_analysis_preview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;plexodus&#x2F;comments&#x2F;9zx67d&#x2F;google_com...</a><p>G+ Communities membership distribution\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ab6a5470f57001368d400218b79d8c8d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ab6a5470f57001368d400218b79d8...</a><p>G+ Communities: Most Recent post date by month\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;23acfd90f05d01368b220218b79d8c8d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;23acfd90f05d01368b220218b79d8...</a><p>G+ Communities Activity Analysis: Itâ€™s the Posts, Stupid\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7fce6710f55001368d3a0218b79d8c8d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;7fce6710f55001368d3a0218b79d8...</a><p>Plot  Community size vs. frequency, log-log.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;images&#x2F;4c728664f0f342e0203f.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joindiaspora.com&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;images&#x2F;4c728664f0f342e0203f...</a>')
