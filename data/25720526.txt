For example, despite the popularity of the dash-to-dock extension, the GNOME developers stubbornly refuse to make the dock built-in. So with the default setup, mouse users (like many in my family) need two large cursor movements (flick to the left corner, then slide down to the dock) every time they need to switch between applications[1].\nIn fact, at least one core developer has even floated the possibility of removing the dock and its list of currently running apps altogether.<p>[1] No, the window previews aren&#x27;t really useful because their positions are non-deterministic and it&#x27;s hard to rapidly distinguish mostly white, unlabeled windows anyway.')
