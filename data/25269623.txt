If I want to, I can make a post about a hobby project on Reddit and (if it&#x27;s actually something interesting) it&#x27;ll get quite a bit of attention. If I post the same thing on twitter, it&#x27;ll be lucky to get a tenth of the attention.<p>I do wonder how much of this is due to the lack of emphasis on a poster&#x27;s &quot;credentials&quot; though. Reddit seems to be the last online platform where anyone can contribute to a discussion without being judged for how &quot;popular&quot; someone is.')
