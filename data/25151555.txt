It took them extra effort to do this, it&#x27;s easier to make a device&#x2F;OS without DRM than with it. You can&#x27;t exactly hack it because that would require millions of dollars worth of equipment and some very specific knowledge.<p>I&#x27;m not renting it. I&#x27;m not licensing it. I&#x27;m buying it.<p>&gt; Expecting them to change how they design their product for the masses (that LOVE THEM), because you can&#x27;t do exactly what you want, is wrong.<p>That would empower their users. Developers would be actually making MORE apps for the platform because they would have the confidence that they&#x27;ll be able to get that app into the hands of users one way or another. I&#x27;ve seen some stories of someone doing a lot of work making an app only to have it rejected because its very idea didn&#x27;t resonate with the review team. There&#x27;s nothing they can do to bring it into compliance â€” countless hours of work were wasted.')
