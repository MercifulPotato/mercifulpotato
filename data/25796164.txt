I applaud your resolve, and you have certainly had a tremendous amount of success that should be celebrated!<p>But I can&#x27;t help but think about the 9 founders of other companies that had the same resolve in the same situation, but things did not work out so well.<p>All you other people thinking about going for broke need to be ready to hit bottom and build yourself back up afterwards, because 9 times out of 10 that&#x27;s what will happen. Or, even better, first put yourself into a situation where you don&#x27;t need to go for broke to give yourself an excellent chance at success.<p>I think this is why a lot of crazy big startups come from younger people, they can afford to go for broke before they have a family and other obligations, because the worst that can happen is they are left with nothing, then they settle for a high-paying job at a big tech company and 2 months later they can afford a new car.')
