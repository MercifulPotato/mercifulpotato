If you forget both your password and recovery key, the data will be lost.&quot;<p>Many people assume that that when it says &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, it actually means &quot;won&#x27;t&quot;, and that they&#x27;ll be able to beg or browbeat support into helping them.<p>I can also already see the argument: &quot;but that&#x27;s not my data, it&#x27;s in My Documents, it&#x27;s a document so it shouldn&#x27;t be encrypted!&quot;<p>Communicating these things to users is hard because when it comes to computers, the lexicon is often personal.  What one user calls My Documents might refer to the My Documents collection in Windows, and another one might mean a random folder they created that they put documents in.  It&#x27;s basically impossible to get everyone on the same lexicon, although it&#x27;s getting better as young kids grow up with computers.')
