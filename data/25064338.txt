But when I schedule parcels for pick up, I have to print the label myself. They don&#x27;t bring one with them, so they would have no way to identify the parcel.<p>If I bring it to the post office I can preregister and show a code and they will put a label on, but I never do that anymore due to the covid measures. There&#x27;s a massive queue outside now.')
