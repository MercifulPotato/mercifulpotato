This without support like a garbage collector or a virtual machine overseeing things. OK, it&#x27;s not bullet proof, but large swathes of issues are prevented that often aren&#x27;t in other big languages, and you kind of have to go out of your way to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>As for use in the industry, I see it mentioned every now and then and I keep being surprised because I have low expectations of its adoption, but then suddenly there are big things like Dropbox rewriting their synchronization core (Nucleus) in Rust, and Microsoft releasing Rust bindings for their next-gen Windows API (WinRT).<p>So I guess it&#x27;s still rare in the very large realm of software development, but probably more popular than one may expect for a bit of a fringe language. One that I first thought would remain a proof of concept and point of discussion in computer science circles. I&#x27;m happy to be wrong because I think it does solve some long standing problems in certain projects.')
