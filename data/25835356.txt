Yes, intel greedily choose not to participate in the phone soc market and are paying the price.<p>But their choice not to invest in EUV early doesn&#x27;t mean that they will never catch up. They still have plenty of cash, and presumably if they woke up and decided to, they wouldn&#x27;t be any worse off than Samsung. And definitely better off than SMIC.<p>Similarly, plenty of smart microarch people work at intel, freeing them to create a design competitive with zen3 or the m1 is entirely possible. Given amd is still on 7nm, and are just a couple percent off of the M1 seems to indicate that if nothing else intel could be there too.<p>But as you point out Intel&#x27;s failings are 100% bad mgmt at this point. Its hard to believe they can&#x27;t hire or unleash whats needed to move themselves forward. But at the moment they seem to be very &quot;IBM&quot; in their moves, but one has to believe that a good CEO with a good engineering background can cut the mgmt bullcrap and get back to basics. They fundamentally just have a single product to worry about unlike IBM.')
