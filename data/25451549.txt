If you&#x27;re changing the system regularly, upgrading is valuable because you don&#x27;t want to spend your time dealing with old software or backporting newer versions. Most of the scenarios where you do want that are long-term commercial operations where you need to deal with requirements for software which isn&#x27;t provided by the distribution, and in those cases they likely do want a support contract.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there are enough people left who have the “don&#x27;t touch it for a decade” mindset, aren&#x27;t working in a business environment where they&#x27;re buying RHEL&#x2F;SuSE&#x2F;Amazon Linux&#x2F;etc. anyway, and are actually going to contribute to the community. 100% of the people I know who used it were doing so because they needed to support RHEL systems but wanted to avoid paying for licenses on every server and they weren&#x27;t exactly jumping to help the upstream.<p>Red Hat bought CentOS in the first place because they were having trouble attracting volunteer labor and I think that any successor needs to have a good story for why the same dynamic won&#x27;t repeat a second time.')
