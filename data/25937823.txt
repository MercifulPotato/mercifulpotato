He had plenty – and gave me permission to share them:\nThe market has come to its lowest form. This is even crazier than Tilray (TLRY) [see below] and Tesla (TSLA). The Reddit crowd apparently said, &quot;Let&#x27;s find a company that&#x27;s completely dead – and because everyone knows that, there&#x27;s a big short interest – and engineer a short squeeze.&quot;\nThere&#x27;s not a five-year-old in the country who can kick my ass… but 1,000 of them probably could. That&#x27;s what happened here.\nEven so, my losses have been minimal – and I&#x27;m making it back by selling ridiculously priced calls. For example, when the stock was at $75 today, I was getting paid $18 for $90 strike calls and $14 for at-the-money calls that expire on Friday! If you&#x27;re a professional player, you adjust to the market to make money off it.\n---')
