I basically use it as my todo app or &quot;hello world&quot; for learning new technology.<p>For the longest time I always wanted my blog to have a database and everything because then I had to work with the DB tools in the new language and everything (C# -&gt; Python -&gt; JS -&gt; Rust) and write migration tools in the new language and everything.<p>Wordpress would be better &#x2F; easier if the end goal was blogging, but for me the end goal is to have a side project that is built and maintained the way I want :)')
