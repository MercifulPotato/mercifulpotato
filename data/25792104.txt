The perceivable smoothness from a 90-120Hz display still surprises me but now I can&#x27;t really go back to an older display for daily use. Flagship Android devices also have far more hardware features in general (faster charging, more interfacing options, more cutting-edge &quot;gimmicks,&quot; etc.). To be honest, I don&#x27;t mind iOS, but I&#x27;m not really sure what iPhone hardware you think is better or even on par at a comparable price point.')
