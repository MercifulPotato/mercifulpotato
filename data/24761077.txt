(But please don&#x27;t call it serverless 2.0... those of us who lived through &quot;Web 2.0&quot; will thank you)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverless.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverless.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homepages.cwi.nl&#x2F;~storm&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;reader&#x2F;Dijkstra68.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homepages.cwi.nl&#x2F;~storm&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;reader&#x2F;Dijkstra68.p...</a>')
