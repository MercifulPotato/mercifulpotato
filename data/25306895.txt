The interesting turn on vAccelRT (of the runtime system that is) is that apart from the simplicity for running on a VM that the virtio backend gives, it seems that people are eager to use the vAccelRT mechanism, to map a complicated piece of code to a simple function call that is hardware agnostic. We&#x27;ll see how this will turn out...<p>After all, API remoting is out there for quite some time (see rCUDA); some people are using it, but we think that a more general, semantic abstraction needs to be introduced... especially for the Serverless use-case.')
