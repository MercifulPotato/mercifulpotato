This is not true. The IQ representation is extremely useful for certain kinds of processing, even if you&#x27;re working in baseband. There are plenty of reasons to take a real baseband signal, run it through a Hilbert transform to get a Q, and process it as IQ data.<p>It just so happens that audio DSP algorithms happen to almost never care about those exact kinds of processing, due to the way our ears and brains work. And thus, IQ data is not used in audio. But it&#x27;s <i>not</i> because it&#x27;s baseband. It&#x27;s because our ears don&#x27;t care about phase relationships (which is one thing you can more easily preserve in the IQ domain) and because frequency shifts like downconversion are not useful in music since they destroy the harmonic relationships in the sound.')
