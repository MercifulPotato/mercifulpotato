It just seems pointless when you can run the <i>exact</i> software in the web browser you likely already have running, with less overhead to boot.<p>The music streaming service Tidal really highlighted some of these issues for me, and started my hate-train. Their desktop application is electron-based, which supports HiFi, as does Chrome. The crazy thing is Chrome is the <i>only</i> browser that supports HiFi, and has been this way since the service launched in 2014, despite countless requests from FF users to add support. If Tidal is going to spend 6 years ignoring everything but Chrome for the sake of their electron app, IMO other companies are going to follow suit and continue the march towards Internet Explorer 2.0')
