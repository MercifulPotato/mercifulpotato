The discussions we have are what&#x27;s needed to decide how the internet&#x2F;web moves forward. And there&#x27;s a bit of cake eating and having it too from both sides.<p>There&#x27;s an expectation from the publishing&#x2F;serving side of the equation that the content is being served to a proprietary app or a web browser that works a particular way. With the browser being one of Chrome, Firefox, etc., along with Google&#x27;s YouTube apps.<p>On the user side, especially those who understand how the content is served, that the browser is not the only abstraction allowed. Google themselves run bots to scour the internet employing all sorts of tricks to access and index content. There&#x27;s a fundamental way in which the http protocol works and its content served that is client agnostic. Everyone, Google Search most of all, have benefitted from this.<p>Making tools other than browsers illegal will fundamentally break the internet in my opinion.')
