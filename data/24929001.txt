Same reasons seem to apply to the context discussed here (news site aimed at the US region). Specifically:<p>&gt; Although such a website would likely track the user behavior of EU&#x2F;EEA citizens, as the website would attract native speakers of several European languages, the GDPR does not apply here because:<p>&gt; the service does not target EU&#x2F;EEA residents, and<p>&gt; the tracked user behavior is not occurring within the EU&#x2F;EEA.')
