The tails could be a lot longer. The tails are prehensile, and the lizards use them as anchors.<p>Their feet end in these opposable little claws. Their eyes are completely independent of each other, and are usually wandering around, looking at everything around them.<p>Their camouflage is <i>very</i> good. They can become downright invisible in seconds.<p>They are also slow, and easy to catch.<p>We used to catch them, then put them on our index fingers, facing out. They would wrap their tails around our fingers, and didn&#x27;t usually make much of an effort to escape. Real laconic little buggers.<p>We&#x27;d point them at flies. When they spotted a fly, both eyes would snap to the front, forming a binocular pair. Their mouths would slowly open, exposing their tongue.<p>Then the tongue would shoot out, fast as hell. It was often a lot longer than the chameleon. The end of the tongue has a sticky bulb that grabs the fly.<p>The next thing you know, they are calmly chewing (yes, they chew) their new snack.<p>After we got bored, we&#x27;d put them back into a bush, where they would calmly get off our finger, and change color.')
