They are primarily exerted upon you by your peers (close friends, family, colleagues), and not by the media. Whether these social control mechanisms are good or bad depends on the how closed these groups are and what view&#x2F;policies they have. For example, if you&#x27;re surrounded by religious fanatics, then that&#x27;s likely going to be bad for you.<p>What you refer to is actually an &quot;alt right&quot; meme that was invented to discredit free thinking (free thinking requires people to be well-informed) and push an authoritarian and communitarian agenda in which people are more controlled than in a free society. It&#x27;s a fascist agenda that only works if you successfully discredit media first, since otherwise nobody will buy the &quot;alternative facts&quot; nonsense they&#x27;re trying to sell.')
