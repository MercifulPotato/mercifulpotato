This, I would expect, makes these two sorts of predators less likely to attack humans out of individual desperation.  However, although it&#x27;s rare, groups of wolves attacking humans as prey is not unheard of.  Children are particularly at risk from what I understand, since the wolves know they&#x27;re weaker.  (To an orca, I think any human in the water would be weak.)')
