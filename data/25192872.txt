Consider the fact that he’s getting on in his years - do you think that GNU will just fold when he’s no longer with us? Of course not, he’s the founder but it doesn’t stand and fall on his name. You’re suggesting the equivalent of “if you don’t like it just fork it” - which is usually to splinter and fade into obscurity. Many in the GNU community felt the same as the Guix maintainers.<p>Even RMS never suggested they leave the GNU Project (to my knowledge) - and why would he? Guix and Guile are two of the most vital projects in GNU, and the maintainers, both in their capacity as individuals and maintainers of a GNU project, are entitled to espouse their own views. So, if RMS himself didn’t even think they should pack up and leave, taking a crucial aspect of a GNU operating system with them (besides Debian which isn’t part of the GNU projects, how many other GNU operating systems run Linux-libre or Hurd natively?), what makes you think it’s a good idea?')
