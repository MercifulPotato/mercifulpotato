My first thought was that this is such a newbie book. It was so...male.<p>I am not saying this to be disrespectful or rude to you because you did mention that you enjoyed it..but I literally had to skim 10% of the book to hear the authors wax poetic about ..I don’t know what?<p>Cookbooks should be about recipes ...and recipes should be about methods. Not endless words and sentences about nostalgia. There is a place for that...and that’s not a cookbook. And the nostalgia is not even interesting.<p>And it treats the reader like they have never seen a vegetable in their lives. And images. There weren’t any that made me want to cook them.<p>And it comes off a little twee and precious mentioning ‘salt’ as an important ingredient. Seriously? Wtf?<p>I seriously recommend any French book for cooking. Because they codify methods. None of these are recipes per se ..’torn croutons’ is not a method.<p>If it’s for vegetarian&#x2F;vegans learning to cook, I recommend the cuisine that taught the French..the Italians. Anything by Marcella hazan is good. As is silver spoon cookbook.<p>Www.Food52.com as well as www.thekitchn.com are also good. Altho they are websites and it is what it is.<p>I also love Donna hay books from Australia. Anything by Mark Bittman. Milk street can be ok. Available on Netflix iirc. America’s test kitchen can be proper lessons for those who are complete newbies.<p>I was just so mad reading six seasons and I had just finished skimming it because there was literally not one page that made me what to linger. I was just disappointed and seeing it mentioned here literally 3 seconds after I closed it with a huff on kindle is kinda funny.')
