And from the beginner point of view, they&#x27;re all similar. They can all be programmed using the Arduino IDE and language, and all except the Nano can also be loaded up with Circuit Python and programmed in scripts rather than binary.<p>They&#x27;re all pretty simple to use, with good documentation. I would probably add an M5StickC to this list, as they come as a nice modular package, with case and screen and a bunch of fun things for experimenting.<p>Since they can all be programmed using Arduino IDE, which has good documentation and forum support, you don&#x27;t have to deal with a bunch of external toolchains and whatnot (though I would suggest VSCode with the PlatformIO plugin as soon as you&#x27;re comfortable with the programming side of things.)<p>Ordered most to least simple:\nNano\nFeather\nM5StickC\nTeensy<p>Ordered by most to least powerful:\nTeensy\nM5STICKC\nFeather\nNano<p>Ordered by most to least peripherals:\nM5STICKC\nTeensy\nFeather\nNano<p>Ordered by most to least reliable:\nNano\nTeensy\nFeather\nM5STICKC')
