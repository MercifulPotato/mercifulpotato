It&#x27;s an easy meme.<p>Even if Ethereum is at present better technology (I think it is), it&#x27;s also trying to become even more (scaling and PoS and more). That progress has been slow, and has many competitors with great technology. Labeling Ether as &quot;digital oil&quot; gives one useful mental image, but that&#x27;s certainly not as sexy as &quot;digital gold&quot;.<p>I attribute the continued market cap dominance of Bitcoin over Ether almost entirely to Bitcoin being (at least for now) a better meme.')
