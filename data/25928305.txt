My simplified understanding of the stock market is that: 1) you have a company with a good idea, but the company does not have enough money to fund the idea, so they sell shares of the company to shareholders in exchange for capital 2) using this capital, the company grows and succeeds, and in return it pays portions of its profits back to its shareholders&#x2F;investors in the form of dividends.<p>However, this all falls apart when the company never issues dividends, as many public companies have yet to ever do so.  At this point, what does it matter how well the company does or what their profits are?  If no dividends will ever be paid, then the stock price is irrelevant to the company as long as it issues no new shares (or if all remaining shares are held by the founder to retain majority voting rights).  Whether the stock goes from $10 to $1,000 has no effect on the company, right?  So what does the price mean at this point?')
