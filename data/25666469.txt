WHO has no competence whatsoever to judge on that basis, and as far as I know they haven&#x27;t consulted with anyone who does.<p>If they had bothered to consult with actual experts, they&#x27;d tell them that humans can be communicated with if one picks the right words. Even now, in no place with a mask mandate has there been an increase in human contact. It turns out that the public can process some mixed messaging (and that diseases are really scary and that lockdowns reduce contact). Experts would probably file your analysis under &#x27;elite panic&#x27;.')
