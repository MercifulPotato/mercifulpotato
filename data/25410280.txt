But it&#x27;s also additional complexity that is non-essential to the problem. It&#x27;s what Fred Brooks called accidental complexity in his No Silver Bullet essay. It is important for us to acknowledge and differentiate between the two kinds of complexity, because we in the software industry can and should aim at reducing the accidental&#x2F;non-essential type.<p>About abstraction, even when it&#x27;s good, it still depends. For example: you can use a Visitor Pattern to solve a collision detection problem, but if the language had multiple dispatch you would have less complexity. So it is definitely non-essential complexity.')
