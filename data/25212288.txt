Tech is about how we arrive there. If you disagree on the direction we are headed, discussing different ways to arrive there seems pointless.<p>You may agree with the status-quo politics, but other people don&#x27;t. For them it&#x27;s not about the tech, it&#x27;s about the overall direction. For those people the important discussion to have is political.<p>For instance, I personally am against the current direction macOS and Windows are headed. I have no problem with these kind of security measures <i>as long as there is a button to opt out</i>. Currently, Apple decides for everyone, and doesn&#x27;t provide ways to opt out for power users. I dislike this, and I feel like discussing better cryptography, security protocols, etc, doesn&#x27;t address my priorities.')
