You can pretty much try to throw up all the exceptions to that claim you want but in the end you a few issues which show it, first being they don&#x27;t want to invite further regulatory control over their industry, second they don&#x27;t want legal liability for actions of those who use their platforms, third they respond to the whims of their management and to a certain point their employees on who they let use their systems.<p>People must recognize that politicians exert undo influence over all businesses simply because they can change the law and regulatory structure they operate under. It easily explains why so many politicians move into cushy business jobs in not slot their friends and family into the same. Its the cost of doing business. Established political players simply have too much power.')
