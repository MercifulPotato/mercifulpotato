The incumbent doesn&#x27;t have to be good, they just have to be not <i>so beyond terrible</i> as to make their constituents switch parties. There is no reason for the party to not support the incumbent otherwise.<p>I think you could also make the argument that after a few decades in congress, it becomes less and less likely that someone has a real sense of what life is like outside of that world, what the average citizen wants and needs from their government, and in some cases how the culture and technology of the world around them actually functions.<p>Even if a it means loosing a few good people, I think overall some reasonable term limits would have a positive impact overall. They don&#x27;t even have to be short limits, even something like a 24 year limit would make a <i>huge</i> impact.')
