How can you suggest that remaining in that environment is going to be conducive to her publishing high quality research?<p>I disagree because I don&#x27;t think Big N has exclusive access to the data necessary for cutting edge research. You don&#x27;t need petabytes of data to train cutting edge neural networks.<p>It also seems she published the paper she is best known for before joining Google, suggesting academics are not submitting subpar research compared to Big N.')
