To be fair this is because the word is used to mean different things, not just objective truths, even in formal contexts.<p>Unfortunately because people don&#x27;t hold the same idea about what the word &quot;fact&quot; means, and some don&#x27;t believe in the concept of objective reality at all, one person can talk of &quot;fact-checking website&quot; and be thinking of only objective facts, while another person hears that as &quot;prevailing-opinion-promoting website&quot; to be used for non-objective facts.<p>&quot;Objective truth checking website&quot; would be better.  The intent is unambiguous at least.  1+1=2, pi is definitely irrational, and the Earth is not flat.<p>Unfortunately when it comes to things like &quot;evidence of widespread electoral fraud sufficient to overturn the result&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t apply perfectly.  That type of fact cannot be known absolutely; there&#x27;s always that bit of wiggle room of possibility which feeds conspiracy theories, especially in a population distressed about many issues and distrustful of institutions and each other.<p>Such things can however be known beyond reasonable doubt to the man on the Clapham omnibus (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Man_on_the_Clapham_omnibus</a>).')
