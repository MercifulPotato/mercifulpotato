The term &quot;sideloading&quot; was invented to ostracise and discourage the practice of acquiring software independently --- which was the norm up until Apple and its walled garden appeared.<p>But now, perhaps when sufficiently large numbers of people realise that what &quot;malware&quot; means to the big corporations is different from what it means to users, we&#x27;ll have another mini-revolution back to the independent sharing and community trust model that the industry tried to eliminate because it would subvert their control.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get too political here, but after seeing the outcome of the US election, and the events from then until now, I knew that stuff like this was going to happen.')
