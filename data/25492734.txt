I love gnome 3, Its by far the nicest DE I have used on linux and what I would recommend to anyone to start with. I have used XFCE&#x2F;Mate&#x2F;Plasma&#x2F;Unity and none of them worked as well.<p>Sure, XFCE doesn&#x27;t work as well as Gnome 2. But you can&#x27;t use Gnome 2 anymore. XFCE is way better than Gnome 3! (At least, as of the time Gnome put out version 3.)<p>And yeah, this indicates a very serious problem on the part of Gnome.')
