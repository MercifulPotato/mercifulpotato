It should slowly grow over time as bugs get tests written for them, but if it gets over 80% you probably want to refactor some.<p>&gt;80% test coverage digs way to far into the code, testing the implementation instead of the interfaces&#x2F;apis. It is a definite code smell that probably means the tests were written poorly and need some major reworking.')
