They neither recommended masks nor warned against them, but laid out the facts: &quot;we don&#x27;t (didn&#x27;t) know. We&#x27;re scrambling to get data.

I could come up with a possible reason Aspirin might work: maybe it&#x27;s the fever that kills, Aspirin lowers it. The risk is known and rather small. Should medical science recommend everyone to take Aspirin?
