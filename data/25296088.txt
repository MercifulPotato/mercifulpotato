In one thread she responds with tweets such as: &quot;“I’m sick of this framing. Tired of it. &quot;, &quot;Again. UNBELIEVABLE. , &quot;tell your fanboys to stop trolling me&quot;. Basically she was telling Lecun he&#x27;s an idiot of not agreeing with her. And pretty much everyone else who is not agreeing with her.<p>Did you see Jeff Dean&#x27;s email they just added to the article? Not surprisingly, she is doing the same thing. The reviewers are not agreeing with her and she is shocked how someone dares to reject her paper. She starts making demands to reveal who that was and sends an email to the Women AI list like it&#x27;s some racist attack against her because she is a woman and black researcher. That&#x27;s a toxic behavior of a very arrogant researcher. She clearly expects to get some preferential treatment because she is a big shot researcher or she just thinks she is smarter than everyone else. The irony.')
