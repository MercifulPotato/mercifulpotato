This feels <i>almost</i> perfect to me. There are still some rough edges and I still have to ultimately deal in terms of HTML&#x2F;JS&#x2F;CSS.<p>I&#x27;ve got a side project that takes the Blazor server-side concept to the absolute extreme. But, I haven&#x27;t had much time to work on it this year considering... Hoping to get back into the crusade in early 2021. Looking to pilot it as a replacement for one of our Blazor server-side apps in 2H 2021. One of the bigger objectives is to develop a web application that is perfectly auditable and secure as possible. If you render final client views on the server, you can DVR precisely what each client is experiencing. The client source can be ridiculously lightweight and betrays nothing regarding the business. My prototype currently serves a ~50kb single-file HTML payload that runs the entire show for each client. I am looking at things as deep as server-side rendering of the mouse cursor. Looking at each client as a simple event stream from the server&#x27;s perspective is a really neat way to organize this problem.')
