The fact is Finland has one of the most startup friendly environments around:<p>— top schools (Aalto U. produces incredibly talented engineers)<p>— startup friendly ecosystem (cheap rents, cheap internet)<p>— Finnish work culture (direct, no nonsense, hard working but balanced)<p>— fantastic food and beverage scene in downtown Helsinki<p>My wife is originally from Finland but we live in SF now, but as soon as COVID is over we&#x27;ll all go back to Helsinki so I can start Webflow&#x27;s first EU office there. Hope this program stays around for that!')
