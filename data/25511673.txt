The &quot;right way&quot; is to keep the state of the last POST and prompt the user for confirmation, but it seems like it is undocumented as to what it does. I&#x27;m guessing it either does not retry or it retries and hopes effect will be idempotent.<p>No one (SPAs, traditional webpages and &quot;spiced&quot; webpages like this included) is doing everything right, but my objection to this framework is that it seems to try to say things are simple or easy when they clearly aren&#x27;t.')
