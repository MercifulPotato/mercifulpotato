Vast majority of real estate in Vancouver adhere to Canadian law, the industry is very well developed, agents and lawyers cross their T&#x27;s and dot their I&#x27;s.<p>The issue is there are just too many wealthy Chinese people. Essentially any Chinese citizen who owns property in tier1 Chinese cities, many snatched up 20 years ago for nothing, can afford to buy 1M+ homes in Vancouver or Toronto if sold.
