This includes me.  \nI have never met anyone from that demographic who moved to SV from TX who espoused a different view, though they clearly exist based on the move-back fantasies common in HN comments.<p>That said, I did know several Indians (n=4, subcontinent, not Sioux, all Hindu, not Muslim) who seemed to enjoy Texas more than the gringos.  They were all highly educated like the aforementioned cohort but also really into pickup trucks. We lost touch over the years and I’m curious to see how they viewed the cultural shifts under the outgoing administration.')
