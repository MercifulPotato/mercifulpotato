It depends on what you mean by &quot;we&quot; and by &quot;can.&quot; Some specialists have turned some lead atoms into gold in a billion-dollar particle accelerator.<p>Common, &quot;ordinary&quot; software can neither be mechanically derived nor verified using any feasibly affordable process at common scales. Let me remind people that the largest programs ever verified end-to-end were one-fifth the size of jQuery, and they required world-experts years of effort as well as careful simplification.<p>I&#x27;ve written a fair bit on program correctness and formal verification&#x2F;synthesis [1], and I, myself, am a practitioner and advocate of formal methods, but I am not aware of any in-the-field, industrial scale, general (non-niche), non-specialist, repeatable, affordable formal synthesis&#x2F;verification techniques that can handle systems and specifications of the scale TLA+ is commonly used for by ordinary engineers. If you know of such examples, I&#x27;d be interested in seeing them.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pron.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pron.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
