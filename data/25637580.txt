I had a roommate think that he was a super smart day trader and understood how to get rich.<p>Another one is the kids who think actually trying to &quot;learn&quot; things in an obviously padding in course for the bachelor&#x27;s program is worth your time. For example, learning Assembly. My school is not an amazing school and unfortunately neither was my teacher for it. I did what I had to to squeak by an A with as minimal effort as I could because I knew I&#x27;d never touch that stuff again in my average job. Some kids took it very seriously as though it&#x27;s what everyone learns.<p>The only thing important about school is to get the degree. You don&#x27;t learn much in it at all. You learn more in what you&#x27;re willing to do on your own to build a portfolio on github. That&#x27;s one reason why I liked CS was because I could at least do that. Unlike Art though, it&#x27;s a corporate job that usually pays the bills.')
