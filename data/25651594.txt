The US decided to support Syrian rebels (of whom mostly turned out to become or move to ISIS). Syria is a secular state, whether you like to believe this or not. The Russians and Iranians were legitimately asked by its officials to help support the Syrian army to tackle the terrorists. Yet, the US and its allies financed&#x2F;armed so called rebels that made a disaster of the country. Remember McCain&#x27;s visits and photographs back in 2011? Why is the US even STILL there?! \nI can not think of a single country in the ME that turned out to become better after the US started meddling in its elections&#x2F;government - ironically, including the one which you are currently blaming.<p>Blame the incompetence of Brexit on the people who advocated for it and who like to ignore&#x2F;dismiss facts.')
