You know, a very reasonable search query when someone&#x27;s trying to determine whether a frontend framework is ready for production use. This does not bode well.<p>&gt; Well, offer up your language of choice, and I&#x27;m sure we could work together to find some online comments to assassinate the creators&#x27; character.<p>Yeah, okay, let&#x27;s play that game: you asked for it. Let&#x27;s try to search for &quot;Reagent state management&quot;, also the foremost frontend framework for a relatively obscure language (Clojurescript). I guarantee you will not find Rich Hickey making an ass of himself on the first page of results. I&#x27;m fairly certain you won&#x27;t find it in the results at all, because he is more mature than that.<p>Let&#x27;s try again for Scala.js: &quot;Slinky state management&quot;. Again, no sign of Martin Odersky acting like an immature jackass anywhere in the search results.<p>Words matter. First impressions matter. If you don&#x27;t realize that I&#x27;m afraid you are in need of growing up yourself.')
