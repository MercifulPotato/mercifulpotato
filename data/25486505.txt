If Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech delayed their vaccine to work on lowering the temperature requirements, Moderna would eat their lunch, and Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech would be relegated to second place on the place it matters the most: the history books.<p>As is, I&#x27;m sure that Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech are already working on improving temperature requirements, while leading the race.<p>&gt; This gives us three options, Is it Moderna taking more risks, Pfizer being more risk-averse or is the Moderna one inherently more stable?<p>I have zero insight on the situation, thus I can&#x27;t really tell. However, it&#x27;s clear that each and every single actor in the story, from biotech companies to politicians and also regulatory bodies, is taking way more risks on this issue than what they would otherwise take.')
