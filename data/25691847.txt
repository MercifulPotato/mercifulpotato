What you describe happens when someone installs Signal on a new phone (or reinstalls on the current one).<p>Linked devices are different. There is no notification when someone adds a new linked device. That&#x27;s because the only way to add a linked device is to scan a QR code on the device <i>with your phone,</i> then confirm you want to add the device. The device is implicitly trusted, because only a trusted device can add it. (It is also possible to trigger the re-verification from the desktop manually by clicking &quot;reset secure season&quot; in the conversation menu, but that&#x27;s separate from adding a device.)<p>Aside: Implicit trust like this is a great trade-off, because otherwise you&#x27;d have to verify each of their devices from each of your devices, which means approximately nobody will ever do it. Ask anybody who used Matrix&#x2F;Element E2EE prior to a couple months ago ;D.')
