The party affiliation is used as a signal that something fishy might be going on if the ratio of R to D is very different from the votes recorded.&quot;<p>This sounds so weird to an Aussie. For most people when you enter the polling place, you get bombarded by party supporters with their &quot;how to vote&quot; leaflets. Most people take all or none to be polite and not indicate your preference. Inside you give your name and it is ruled through on the roll printout and you are handed your ballot papers. Once you vote in your little cardboard both you slot the paper in the box. You go outside, hand back the how to vote leaflets, and chat with people after you have bought your &quot;democracy sausage&quot; ( a hot dog bought from the local school or fire service fundraiser). No one really cares how you voted (and 95% of people eligible vote)')
