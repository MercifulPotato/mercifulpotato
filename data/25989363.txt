They are definitely the &quot;legacy&quot; in the commercial satellite imagery market. But what do you see as the discriminator of your company to newer companies providing commercial imagery like Planet and BlackSky? High resolution and thermal imagery are certainly discriminators but other companies are driving that direction too (higher resolution, larger spectral coverage).')
