This majority is not problems in the computer or data sciences, or those of computing infrastructure or services.<p>Modeling for example, a complex payroll system or large airline reservation system, cannot be effectively represented that way. Enterprises tried doing so for a decade of “structured analysis” i.e. a dataflow approach.  Were no lessons learned from that?')
