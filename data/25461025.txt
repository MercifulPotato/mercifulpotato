Both vaccines are two-dose regimens, and the Trump administration has elected to hold back shipments of the second dose in an effort, it says, to ensure that everyone gets a booster shot.<p>Some state officials said the delayed shipment of the second dose complicated their planning, while a person familiar with Pfizer’s supply, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details, said there were many more doses available that are not being shipped than simply the batches being held back for booster shots. &lt;&lt;<p>------------------------------------------<p>i have yet to see if any particular states are short on distribution.  It would be quite concerning if Demographic of a state was correlated to disparities in distribution.')
