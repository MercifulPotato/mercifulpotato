Many do not.<p>Even though farms are smaller in the UK, am I correct in assuming that many farmers still practice mono-crop? If they do, then depending on wild pollinators alone is never going to be the best strategy. Crop yields will always increase significantly by introducing farmed bee-hives.<p>Here is an article I found from the UK Bee Farmers Association\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beefarmers.co.uk&#x2F;working-with-other-sectors&#x2F;contract-pollination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beefarmers.co.uk&#x2F;working-with-other-sectors&#x2F;contract...</a><p>It says in the organization even runs a &#x27;National Pollination Service&#x27; with a sitting &#x27;Pollination Secretary&#x27;.<p>I think beekeeping is a very interesting industry. I&#x27;m sure many people in the UK and the States are probably unaware of these practices and how integral they are to farming.')
