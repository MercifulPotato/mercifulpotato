It seems awfully condescending to me.<p>Nobody&#x27;s bound to your perspective of what&#x27;s rational.  Better to just accept that this is the kind of hurdle that self-driving will have to jump over and work on getting there ASAP.<p>Elon realized that the best way to get people to buy electric cars was to make electric cars that are better than gas cars, not to tell people they&#x27;re wrong and stupid for not wanting to buy some inferior electric car.  Once self-driving cars are obviously better than all but the best race drivers, people will accept them as a matter of course.')
