Item(by='syedkarim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602535310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756635, text='My current house is a prefab, modular home. It was trailered up from Indiana. A crane put the pieces together in a day (two halves on the first floor and four dormers on the second floor). The cost of the crane was about $5000. The cost of the 1500 square-foot cape cod was about $130,000. The entire project was around $330,000, but the property was raw land in an unincorporated area, which means there are certain line items that really jack up the bottom line.<p>We didn&#x27;t save that much by going with a prefab home. We also didn&#x27;t save much time, because we got stuck waiting for a sub-contractor and inspector during the finishing process. If I&#x27;m not saving money or time, well, what&#x27;s the point?<p>It&#x27;s a decent-quality house; as good as anything built on site. But nothing special. One of the main reasons to go down the pre-fab path at this price range is because there are relatively few custom home builders who will bother with homes that don&#x27;t cost at least $500,000. Their margins are about 20%, but regardless of the size of the house, they are completing only three or four a year. They need higher top line projects, otherwise the don&#x27;t see much bottom line.')
