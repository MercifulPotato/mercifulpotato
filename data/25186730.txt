You guys doubled down on that by refusing to reconsider, saying unless you were a contributor to the project, your opinion was irrelevant. Mike McQuaid&#x27;s responses as a representative of the project were user hostile, all while he tried to paint himself as the victim of abuse over the matter.<p>If you want to regain my trust, remove the analytics function, swear off such things forever, and expel Mike McQuaid from the project. But I doubt that will happen, so MacPorts it is. And I&#x27;ll encourage everyone I know to use it rather than Homebrew.')
