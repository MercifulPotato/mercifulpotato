The few actual investigations of actual crash statistics show the opposite to be true.<p>Engineering standards aren&#x27;t scientific papers, they are practical and instructional, and the hunches of their authors is sufficient for standardization, necessary even, because you can&#x27;t do science on the efficacy of standards that you haven&#x27;t written yet. Some early road engineers guessed that wider streets were safer, and it has been taken as gospel truth ever since.')
