If the insurance company has to pay out billions of euros for a single leak, it&#x27;s going to have to charge pretty hefty premiums for their client. In order to stay profitable, the client has to raise prices for their mental health services. If the end user was previously paying 100 euros to talk to someone about their mental health issues, maybe now they would have to pay 100 euros to talk + 200 euros to cover the insurance premium. Doesn&#x27;t sound too good, does it?<p>Now let&#x27;s imagine what the insurance company does when it&#x27;s about to get hit for 4 billion euros. Instead of paying out, it&#x27;s going to hire an army of lawyers who are going to make a convincing argument that, actually, this was not a data leak at all, this was [something else not covered by the insurance agreement]. We&#x27;ve already seen this with all the &quot;cybersecurity insurance&quot; products, which are basically scams.')
