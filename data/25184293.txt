NodeJS is potentially slower in certain CPU-bound tasks due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript.<p>On the other hand, thanks to its event loop and concurrency model, NodeJS is much faster than many languages&#x2F;runtimes in I&#x2F;O (reading&#x2F;writing to stores, fetching data from other servers, etc.) - which is what many web servers do <i>most</i>.<p>Your original comment also mentioned:<p>&quot;in-browser execution has seen most of the speedup (as it&#x27;s where most of the optimisation is focussed on).&quot;<p>Which is also not true. The V8 engine is hyperoptimized and runs not only Chrome but Node too. It is precisely one of the reasons why server-side JS has gained in popularity over the last decade. The fact that it was initially devised for a browser environment does not mean that optimisation is focused there.<p>If you&#x27;re an engineer or web developer I really suggest that you brush up on these things, because with comments like the ones you&#x27;ve been dropping you&#x27;d definitely raise eyebrows - and not for the good...')
