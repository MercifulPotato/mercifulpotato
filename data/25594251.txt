Network partitions may persist for unbounded amounts of time as far as the CAP theorem is concerned, and an unspecified amount of packets may be dropped and&#x2F;or delayed. It could be the case that every message you send gets dropped due to a persisting partition and in such a case none would arrive, thereby violating the &quot;guarantee&quot; of exactly-once delivery.<p>In practice I agree that these problems are quite rare since most network are reasonably stable. However, especially at scale it&#x27;s not rare to see messages dropped or delivered more than once. I have no doubt IBM MQ can achieve exactly-once <i>most</i> of the time, but no distributed system can achieve exactly-once delivery <i>all</i> of the time.')
