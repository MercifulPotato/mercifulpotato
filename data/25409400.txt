Not to mention the &quot;hacks&quot; they use to artificially lower entropy of repeated characters.<p>So the password\n1010101010101011101101000000010111011011101001010001001101011011\nis calculated as only having a length of &quot;2&quot; and a base of 10. So it would be about 6 bits according to this. But the generation method clearly is generating a binary string with length 64, for a total of 64 bits of entropy.')
