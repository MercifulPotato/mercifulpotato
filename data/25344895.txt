The simplicity (and pricing model) of running code on Cloudflare Workers should be reason enough to do this.<p>I agree that AWS Lambda for this project would have been more than sufficient, together with S3 for static hosting. However, the advantage of CF workers over is that you combine both the CDN, static hosting, the API layer and the back-end logic running in one and the same worker, therefore significantly simplifying your setup.<p>With AWS (and without using Lambda@Edge), we&#x27;d probably have to use a combination of Cloudfront, S3, API Gateway &amp; Lambda. All of these could easily be defined in code with something like the Serverless framework or AWS SAM, but there are a lot more moving parts here when compared to CF Workers.')
