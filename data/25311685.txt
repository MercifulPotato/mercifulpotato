For 10 years, his research team tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein. “We couldn’t solve it.”<p>But AlphaFold had no trouble. It returned a detailed image of a three-part protein with two long helical arms in the middle. The model enabled Lupas and his colleagues to make sense of their x-ray data; within half an hour, they had fit their experimental results to AlphaFold’s predicted structure. “It’s almost perfect,” Lupas says. “They could not possibly have cheated on this. I don’t know how they do it.”</i><p>Sure, you want to validate thing experimentally, but that isn&#x27;t different to imaging.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;game-has-changed-ai-triumphs-solving-protein-structures" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;game-has-changed-ai-...</a>')
