Do you know who&#x27;s behind it?<p>My only complaint so far is that they claim that one of the reasons for creating Idagio is that the main streaming services are track&#x2F;album-oriented, implying that Idagio does this better. But if I go to an Idagio album (here [1] is a random example), there are just tracks. If I view the same album at Apple Music, the album is nicely divided into works [2], and also annotates each track with the composer.<p>I do love the ability to browse by work and find matching recordings, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.idagio.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;r-strauss-and-brahms-orchestral-works-live" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.idagio.com&#x2F;albums&#x2F;r-strauss-and-brahms-orchestra...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;d3sNrnc.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;d3sNrnc.jpg</a>')
