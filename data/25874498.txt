My problem with experts is that their advice often seems to take into consideration only a very circumscribed set of concerns, and that their tacit assumptions -- normative assumptions, particularly -- are rarely questioned sufficiently, if at all.<p>Let me share a quip, one that pertains to one specific type of expert: namely, lawyers. &quot;Legal training sharpens the mind by narrowing it.&quot;<p>Experts give advice, which by all means should be considered. Read that last clause carefully. I argue that we have a kind of cult of expertise where careful consideration of expert advice within the context of larger concerns -- the full picture -- is too often given short shrift.')
