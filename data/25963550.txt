When I send money to India from a US bank account via an intermediary (so that neither the US bank nor the Indian bank are first-party to the transaction) it is removed from my US account (in USD) and reaches my Indian account (in INR) within seconds, and I can see the balance in my Indian account and spend it right away, so I have no reason to believe it can&#x27;t happen domestically when it doesn&#x27;t even involve a currency change.<p>It&#x27;s like this in most parts of the world. It&#x27;s only the perversity of the American banking system where money transfers in this day and age routinely take 2-3 days and no one thinks there&#x27;s anything bizarre about that.')
