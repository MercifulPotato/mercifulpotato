There are just things the Republican caucus is not going to do because of their philosophical and public commitment to austerity.<p>My point is that Trump is almost the perfect president to get this done because he has purchase with the base even when he contradicts orthodoxy. A conservative nervous about being primaried for voting for a big government program like this has all the necessary cover to vote for it under Trump. That they could not get it done under Trump I see as incredible evidence of the party&#x27;s commitment to austerity government.<p>Look at the fight over food stamps we have every time the farm bill comes around. SNAP costs about 1&#x2F;3 of 1 percent of GDP. It helps ag and basically extends food security to the entire country. But Republicans fight over it like it&#x27;s Medicare. I&#x27;m not condemning them for this. I happen to disagree but they fundamentally believe, no matter the cost benefit analysis that the government should not do these things and cannot conduct them effectively. It is hard for people to understand because we are so used to the post war order in which both sides believe in government up to a certain point at least.')
