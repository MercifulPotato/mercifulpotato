My knee jerk reaction when I saw the product was, wow I can create a book of all the articles I read in 2020 and make it a coffee table book. It is a good gift to give close friends as the articles that shaped your year, or one to reminisce on, but above all this book needs to be picture heavy, it needs to feel like a magazine or coffee table book to have mainstream appeal. I hope OP tests this out, there is def a market here')
