Why shouldn&#x27;t Amazon be compelled to get a preliminary opinion from a judge on whether this is illegal or not. Based on that decision they can preemptively  remove the content and let the defendant &quot;appeal&quot; (probably incorrect legal term) the decision. If the court rules it&#x27;s not illegal, then there should be no risk of legal liability to continuing to provide the service.<p>If things are parler are as bad as people are making it out to be (i haven&#x27;t been following it closely) then this should be a trivial step that legitimizes the decision.')
