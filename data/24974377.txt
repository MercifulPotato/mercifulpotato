Where I live wild pigs are not a problem, but in the Southern states of the USA there are literally millions. They are the most invasive of species, descendants of those imported from Europe or maybe Russia in the 19th century. Some get to be enormous. They destroy property and they&#x27;re tearing up hundreds of thousands of acres of land. They&#x27;re smart and dangerous. The right solution is of course to shoot them en masse, but the optics aren&#x27;t so good on that solution.')
