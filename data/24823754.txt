Yes, he had a paycheck and bonus package as incentive. Performance reviews too.<p>But as to Walter&#x27;s attacking on Cutts, that&#x27;s just someone not willing to put in the work to being a responsible adult. When it comes to Google search, you can&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself&#x2F;your-site unless you&#x27;re a bull in a China shop. Also, Google&#x27;s search is really complicated and I can&#x27;t generalize for his specific situation but it&#x27;s extremely likely that it was OP&#x27;s fault for using &#x27;black hat&#x27; techniques (either directly or indirectly).')
