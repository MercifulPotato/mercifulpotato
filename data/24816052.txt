(changing sides every now and then so the top of the butter winds up with a dihedral &quot;roof&quot; shape) Depending upon temperature of the butter, one has to use different speeds and feeds, but the correct ones for easily spreadable curls come quickly with practice.<p>[1] other scraping folk arts: hand-carved toy &quot;christmas trees&quot; with wood curls (originally, I think, suitable for use as tinder. These days we use chemical blocks as starters) and raclette, a dish involving scraping molten blobs off a wheel of cheese.')
