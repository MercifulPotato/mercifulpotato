The devices I&#x27;d really worry about if they were compromised are people&#x27;s personal phones, which presumably they had on their person.<p>A note for context: a friend of mine who works in the capitol brought me along one day and asked me to wait in the minority leader&#x27;s antechamber (a large room like a hotel conference room) for a few minutes while a vote was called. There were various bits of CAT-5 sticking out of the wall and I was unsupervised for nearly a half hour. Various people came and went and paid me no heed. I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the first or last person to have been in that situation.<p>TL;DR special secure facilities exist for a reason. The Capitol is used to randos.')
