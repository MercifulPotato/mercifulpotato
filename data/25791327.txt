It does not appear to be. Before HN there was slashdot.org, whicj is still around. Slashdot lost the thread I think because of revenue concerns and change of ownership. If this place is truly 100% a finacial loss then it does seem to validate yet again that news for profit is a bad idea because the news is soon compromised in the name of more viewership to drive ad revenue. If Reddit went 100% loss then I&#x27;m sure better moderation decisions would be available to them, likewise for Twitter and Facebook.')
