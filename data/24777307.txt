I don&#x27;t get why American TV shows always need to be ran to the ground.</i><p>It&#x27;s a side effect of the weird way TV show syndication contracts (used to) work. Basically for various historic reasons you could charge cable networks more for showing re runs of shows with over 100 episodes than you could shows with less than 100 episodes.<p>So it often made long tern economic sense to push your show over that 100 episode line even if the last season or two where terrible and got terrible ratings on initial airing.<p>en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;100_episodes')
