A normal flow for me is credentials stored in browser&#x2F;password manager. Login is more or less seamless, and typically takes under a second.<p>OTP login is multiple steps, involves me doing a copy&#x2F;paste (or remembering the code), and requires a mandatory delay while I wait on the email. If I wanted to login incognito, or in a different browser, I may have to copy&#x2F;paste the URL etc.<p>A better question is why anyone uses them at all given how bad they are. I&#x27;ve stopped using at least one site because it exclusively uses OTP links.')
