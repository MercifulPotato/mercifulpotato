As a language it is the most bureaucratic one of all. These very deep import paths, the ban on multiple inheritance and the rule that a file can only contain one class all make the language bureaucratic. Programmers willing to put up with that are the more bureaucratically inclined ones and hence one ends up with all of these spurious layers of abstraction, giving every field a getter and a setter and so on.')
