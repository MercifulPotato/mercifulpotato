That idea will be obvious in a hindsight. I&#x27;d even make a guess that it will be like a &quot;stateful&quot; state machine that accumulates state in a particular manner and uses that to control the underlying state machine. We still will be nowhere near understanding intelligence, but that clever trick will be enough in most cases.')
