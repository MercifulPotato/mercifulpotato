It should have basic features like &quot;forgot password?&quot;. In the future, I also want to allow things like &quot;sign in using Gmail&quot;.<p>I looked into things like Cognito and Firebase Authentication, but they seem a bit overkill for my goal (I don&#x27;t need stuff like two factor auth).<p>What tools&#x2F;libraries do people recommend? Should I roll my own solution for this? Thanks!')
