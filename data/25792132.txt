Even drug dealers are known for &quot;the first one&#x27;s free&quot; type of setup. Storage units have &quot;first month free&quot;, cable companies &quot;sign up now for 3 months at $49&#x2F;mo for 6 months&quot; kind of stuff. It wasn&#x27;t until sleazy startups and SaaS types come along that do things like &quot;free and always will be&quot; *until we realize we were not good business people and can&#x27;t run a business like that.
