And was Hindu or Islamic mathematics not modern? Did it only &quot;emerge&quot; as modern mathematics when it arrived in europe?<p>I wish the article defined what their definition of &quot;modern mathematics&quot; is. It&#x27;s primary focus is on the transfer of the Hindu-Arabic to Europe. What is it about the transfer of the numeral system to europe that made it &quot;modern&quot;.<p>Also, wasn&#x27;t &quot;modern mathematics&quot; officially formalized fairly recently?
