Item(by='thatcherc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604578649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24996153, text='I&#x27;m most interested in the the rust-&gt;iron electrolysis process - neither the article nor the video describes how that&#x27;s done, except to mention that the process used clean electricity. Certainly it&#x27;s possible, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much electrolytically produced iron today. I wonder if they&#x27;re using a process that requires the oxide to be melted (very simple but needs really high temps) or a lower-temp, more chemically involved process. If they have a good-enough way to produce elemental iron, it seems like replacing an existing coal&#x2F;gas fired iron smelter with a renewable electrolytic one would be a cool experiment too.')
