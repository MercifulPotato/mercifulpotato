(For the record, I support a Canadian style system.)<p>The biggest challenge I see is that people might rush to California to claim the benefits. It’s not clear that’s a real problem (and it’s not the problem Vermont and California actually ran aground on).<p>The Supreme Court’s precedent in this area is a shambles. But if California offered state-run universal insurance, I bet the Supreme Court would approve measures to keep people from moving to California after they got sick.')
