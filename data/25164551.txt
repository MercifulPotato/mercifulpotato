Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605903894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25162631, text='Another one with the fixed set mentality... let&#x27;s go for another round.<p>&gt; I do want a sound justification for a new tech that is consuming the power of a small Europan country.<p>The need to consume that much energy is not inherit to the tech. It is just an issue of the current implementation. No one is shrugging their shoulders and saying &quot;it is what it is&quot;. What they are saying is &quot;This is one of the many issues that we need to address and we are working towards a solution.&quot;<p>Do you know of any new technology that come into existence already free of issues and as efficient as physically possible? Me neither.<p>Also: should I assume that you don&#x27;t fly anywhere? Don&#x27;t buy anything from China? Only consumes local produce?<p>Is your concern with the environment guiding all your lifestyle choices or only those you don&#x27;t care about?<p>&gt;  problems in Lebanon (...) canâ€™t be solved with technology.<p>No, the tech does not solve anything by itself. The tech is just an instrument, and it is an instrument that can help people there to escape government measures that lead to mismanagement of resources and favoring bankers. The tech can allow smaller groups of people to be their own (their communities) banks and not having to rely on a centralized &quot;too big to fail&quot; system.<p>The instrument does not &quot;solve&quot; anything. But it allows people to change the scale of the problem. It&#x27;s much easier to recover from many shocks spread around smaller entities than to recover from one Black Swan event that can wipe out everyone at once.<p>&gt; I believe your choice of browser does little in the context of the other 90% who is still on Facebook although I honestly have respect for your dedication and efforts.<p>Again, the tech is not what is going to solve anything. Brave (the browser) and BAT are just instruments that we have at our disposal to affect the change that we want for our lives.<p>Quite frankly, are you the type of person that always waits everyone else to do something in order to think it is worthy doing? Must be horrible to live with such apathy.')
