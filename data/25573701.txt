You can tell that the mass is wrong based on the way it moves.<p>I think this is a similar effect but in reverse -- we know the limbs <i>are</i> heavy and aren&#x27;t made of styrofoam, so the fact that they are moving like they are is uncanny. Our brains aren&#x27;t used to motorized and hydraulic limbs.<p>You can get a little bit of this effect watching assembly line arms sometimes, but it&#x27;s less jarring because they are clearly disembodied, whereas this thing is fairly humanoid.')
