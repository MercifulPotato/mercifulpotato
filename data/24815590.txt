The US is not &#x27;headed in this direction&#x27;.<p>&#x27;Free Speech&#x27; is the wrong banner for this discussion, as no-one&#x27;s speech is threatened here - everyone is essentially free to say as they please publicly, and on their own web sites.<p>The Press is &#x27;free&#x27; to say what they want, which includes a ton of bias, but that is what it is.<p>&#x27;Social Media&#x27; is a very new thing - it turns out it can be extensively influential and &#x27;memes&#x27; from out of nowhere can grab narratives like dogs chasing each other through a crowd.<p>FB and Twitter are private platforms, concerned with content unlike AT&amp;T, Amazon, email or network providers who are fully neutral - and Social Media has always been censoring content: if you attack individuals or threaten violence etc. you would have been banned 10 years ago.<p>The algorithms have always been favouring one thing or another using any variety of criteria, so the very nuanced question boils down to the nature of &#x27;truthiness&#x27;, the degree to which it can be assessed, and how much it can be used for algorithmic purpose - and especially, how could it be done &#x27;fairly&#x27;.<p>I wonder if there are truly objective methods whereby people only ever see posts if they are shared directly by friends, thereby implying a more &#x27;direct&#x27; model, like email, whereby if one party wants to chose with a specific, other party, well there&#x27;s nary anything anyone should censor there.<p>Alternatively, one could contemplate anything with any political content whatsoever, to be in fact, political, and to be managed in accordance with the same rules for political spending etc. - but that might be altogether too much.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think that this is an existential question to the point wherein industries need to be disrupted or transformed, we are probably &#x27;somewhere near&#x27; reasonable at this point, with some modifications we may have a system we can live with.<p>Finally - it should be noted that &#x27;free expression&#x27; doesn&#x27;t in any way imply &#x27;fair expression&#x27; - like a free market, it can be leveraged and dominated by a few small voices who want to &#x27;take control&#x27;. There&#x27;s no reason that a few smart minds couldn&#x27;t establish control over the narrative whereupon we&#x27;d have to ask ourselves if that&#x27;s what is remotely good for society. As much as we sometimes loathe the press today, there are a lot of checks and balances, along with &#x27;narrative driven news&#x27; the MSM are beholden to mostly facts, there&#x27;s quite a lot of integrity in that system. A &#x27;free for all&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t have any such controls and  any kind of real truth could be lost.<p>Perhaps the best solution would be to just stop using social media as we do. I did, and don&#x27;t miss it at all.')
