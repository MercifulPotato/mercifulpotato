That leaves the US with a way out if they want to proceed with the extradition - guarantee a different set of circumstances.<p>And isn&#x27;t that actually done on a fairly regular basis?  IIRC, the US has pledged not to pursue the death penalty in certain cases in order to get cooperation on an extradition.')
