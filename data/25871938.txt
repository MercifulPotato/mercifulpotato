I can&#x27;t say anything about the other software but gitea is known for having accessibility issues, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-gitea&#x2F;gitea&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7057" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-gitea&#x2F;gitea&#x2F;issues&#x2F;7057</a><p>Edit: the reason that I posted this was not due to some hypothetical blind people but rather because I have been in a situation where I want to show a cool project to a friend with vision issues but I can&#x27;t because the project is hosted on a gitea instance. I posted this because I was unaware of this issue until recently and presumed that there would be others here who are also not aware of this.')
