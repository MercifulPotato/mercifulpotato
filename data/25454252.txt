No mention in the article if this has better fuel efficiency than existing rotaries, though their FAQ blames the poor efficiency and emissions issues of the Wankel on the weird shape of the combustion chamber[1], so if this design resolves those issues maybe we&#x27;ll see these in cars eventually.  (They&#x27;d better act quick if they want to get in on that market; I expect it&#x27;ll be essentially all electric sooner than most people think.)<p>They seem to think the apex seal wear issue will be better with the apex seals stationary.  In addition to that, I wonder if it might also be possible to design the engine such that you can just slide the apex seals out sideways through a slot in the engine housing (sealed off in normal operation) without disassembling the whole engine?  That by itself could be a pretty big improvement even if the seals wear down the same as they do in other rotaries.<p>I also wonder if they have a good solution to having more than two rotors?  Mazda made a 3-rotor but due to the way the engine fits together the eccentric shaft had to be in two pieces that bolt together.<p>I hope as soon as this company makes a car-sized engine someone swaps one into a Mazda RX-7 or RX-8 just for fun.  Maybe see if they can beat these guy&#x27;s record [2] for longest RX-8 trip on a single tank of gas.  Or swap one into one of the old Mazda rotary pickups.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liquidpiston.com&#x2F;faq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.liquidpiston.com&#x2F;faq</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PfiQu3XH2Pg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PfiQu3XH2Pg</a>')
