This is the struggle of depression.<p>I find for situations like that, the blastoff technique works well.  When you find you need to do something, instead of thinking about it, start counting backwards from 5, like you&#x27;re a rocket getting ready to blastoff.  It takes 4-5 seconds for the other part of the mind to come in and override the action, so as long as you jump out of bed before that timer hits zero, it&#x27;s easy.  This way you can do whatever it is you need to get done regardless how you feel.  You can always think about how to do it once you&#x27;ve gotten started.  It sounds silly but it works very well and is super easy to do.  A zen teacher once told me, &quot;Don&#x27;t think.  Do.&quot; to mean basically the same thing.')
