Item(by='lordnacho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603789014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903990, text='&gt; Couldn&#x27;t agree more about how annoying it is that Nordic countries are always described as super exceptional.<p>Same here, it creates unrealistic expectations.<p>A lot of the things they say about Nordic societies are a bit more two-sided than they are made out in the Anglo media. For instance you don&#x27;t have very strong job protections in Denmark, and some of the government handouts are dependent on you not having significant savings.<p>I remember I had an American teacher in school who decided to go back there just because he couldn&#x27;t fit in socially. Something about the society means that people are hard to get a hold of. They kinda already have the friends they&#x27;re gonna have. Not everyone is the same of course, but you often find with Scandies their friend slots are full.<p>The weather is great during the summer. In fact, it&#x27;s perfect. Not hot enough to be oppressive, sun stays up late. But the rest of the time it&#x27;s not great. Like today, it&#x27;s cloudy in Copenhagen, threatening to rain. There&#x27;s a lot of those days, and the nights get longer. You&#x27;ll find a lot of the time it&#x27;s dark when you want to do stuff.')
