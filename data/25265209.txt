I was a Zamboni driver from the age of 16 to 19. I was the youngest driver at my local, municipal rink in metro Detroit which had one indoor and one outdoor rink. A pretty good gig that earned me admiration from lots of pint sized aspiring hockey players.<p>Driving it was fun. It was even more fun when you focused on how fast you could go vs how well the ice was resurfaced. (Did I mention I was 16?!) The mechanics of the machine were also very cool.')
