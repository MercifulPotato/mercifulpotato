In fact, it will still be supported for quite some time. Mojave, 10.14, is supported until late next year and, High Sierra, 10.13, is still supported even today!<p>Unless there&#x27;s some new feature that you absolutely just <i>must have</i>, there just really isn&#x27;t any compelling enough reason for most folks to immediately upgrade to a new .0 release.<p>In the Windows world, the conventional wisdom -- for probably a decade and a half! -- has been to wait until after SP1 to move to a new major version.<p>Maybe the younger generation just hasn&#x27;t been burned (bad) enough (yet) for them to learn not to touch the stove?')
