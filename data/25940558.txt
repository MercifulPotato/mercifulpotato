Item(by='YeGoblynQueenne', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611832568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932322, text='&quot;Sexual assault&quot;, &quot;infanticide&quot;, &quot;forced pregnancy&quot; and &quot;murder&quot;, these are terms that are normally used to mean something that a human does to another human, not another kind of animal.<p>I&#x27;m curious, but would you call what male cats do to female cats &quot;sexual assault&quot;? Or what cats do to mice, &quot;murder&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m asking because the reason that &quot;murder&quot;, in particular, is usually only applied to human behaviour is because a human motive is usually assumed, i.e. either some sort of emotion like anger etc, or financial or other profit. Conversely most people don&#x27;t believe that animals can have other motives for killing other animals than to eat them (yet check out &quot;surplus killing&quot; on wikipedia). So I&#x27;d say that killing another animal to eat it seems to only be interpreted as &quot;murder&quot; when it&#x27;s done by a human, which sounds like it&#x27;s motivated from reasons other than to succinctly and precisely define a certain behaviour.')
