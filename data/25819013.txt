And how hindbrain those keystrokes are now? It gets that way with onion-chopping (and everything else in the kitchen).<p>Take mise en place seriously. If the recipe calls for chopped onions, chop them before you turn on the burner. Later you can work on parallelizing the process (eg, chopping the onions while the bacon is rendering) but to start with, just work on getting all the pieces on the table before you start the chess clock. Delegate to sous-spouses or sous-children.<p>Rarely do you need to be a perfectionist. If you are saut√©ing or stewing or braising or souping, the onions cook down. Ceviche is a different matter. Baking may be more specific, but that kind of witchcraft is forbidden around here.')
