They make up for it by selling the order flow. This only works as long as interest rates are low and, importantly, they can get enough credit to cover it all.<p>In times of unprecedented volatility and unprecedented risky trading behavior, securing that debt becomes non-trivial. Robinhood&#x27;s debtors have no desire to be left holding the bag if something blows up.')
