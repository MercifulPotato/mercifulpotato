This is something we have all talked about as future optimizations for the best user experience. We&#x27;ll be changing a lot of our buttons over to links first.\nWe plan to change how our GM search functions to make it easier to see a number of GM&#x27;s at a glance as well, and probably moving to paginate those pages.\nThese additional ideas for the profile are fantastic, and I will be adding them to our optimization list for profiles! Thank you so much!')
