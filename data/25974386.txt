These guys however are still sort of separate from overall Ford and the car is basically designed to sell well and not lose them to much money. Ford has the issue that they simply don&#x27;t have battery supply to scale their EV production.<p>They are getting batteries from LG in Europe right now but all new capacity is basically already reserved for all the Europeans. They simply can&#x27;t copy the Model Y and sell 300k a year, specially because to match the Y in specs, they needed to put more battery into it.<p>I agree with your point on FSD. They said they would start to value it during trade in now, but even so, when you sell it privately, if the buyer doesn&#x27;t want FSD its harder to sell, its limits the pool of people who want it.')
