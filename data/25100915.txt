That didn’t stop it from excelling.<p>I’ll add that I also have worked in Python predominantly. One of the things that frustrates me about it are the packages that use lower-level language bases that need compilation during a ‘pip install’. Hunting down dependencies gets old pretty fast when you were expecting ‘just Python’. For those that are ok with that and the performance hit, Python can for sure be a suitable tool for use cases that would traditionally be tackled lower down the stack.')
