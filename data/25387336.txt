It is really easy to write re-usable code for Cypress tests in plain TypeScript&#x2F;JavaScript, and just directly import the file.<p><pre><code>    x.usernameField.type(&#x27;Joe User&#x27;);\n    x.passwordField.type(&#x27;$ecureBR0&#x27;);\n    x.enterWrongCaptcha();\n    cy.get(&#x27;.err-captcha-fail&#x27;).should(&#x27;be.visible&#x27;);\n</code></pre>\nBasically, I think all the code to locate UI elements and perform common interactions with them should be in re-usable utility code, so that the actual tests can focus on just testing what they test.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Cypress docs probably do a great job emphasizing how easy this is (especially since they go out of their way to de-emphasize the &#x27;page objects&#x27; pattern, but without offering much in the way of a replacement).')
