Many of them would elect to then sell their houses to developers who would build apartments. Many would choose on their own to add units to their own property. If some people don&#x27;t like living next to apartments, then they are out of luck though. I don&#x27;t know if we should expect people to have that kind of say over what their neighbors do with their property.')
