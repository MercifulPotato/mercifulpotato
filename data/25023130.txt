These things have names, zygotes, embryos, fetus.<p>Yes, and they are all human, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;human" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;human</a><p>&gt; None of these are living humans yet. They&#x27;re pre humans.<p>Citation needed.<p>&gt; without an identity or awareness<p>That is pretty easily disproven scientifically. Not even a biologist who is for legal abortion would say that a baby in the womb is unaware. There was an ultrasound a long time ago where you see the fetus recoil from the abortionist&#x27;s knife. Of course it&#x27;s aware. Just because it can&#x27;t see the outside world yet doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s unaware.<p>As far as identity, well, it has a unique fingerprint, DNA, etc. Are you saying you don&#x27;t have an identity until there&#x27;s a birth certificate?<p>&gt; At what point do you think the sperm and egg are human?<p>Well, they are human from inception (see above). But they are a separate human being at conception.<p>&gt; What proof do you have that says a fetus at 16 weeks is alive? How are you defining alive?<p>Even a single cell is alive. You have drifted from textbook science at this point.<p>&gt; This is still dependent on the mother<p>Dependence doesn&#x27;t disqualify you from being human or alive.')
