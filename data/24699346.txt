What&#x27;s the Asian food scene in Minneapolis? Can you get Sichuan, Hunan, Henan, and Yunnan or is it just that one Sichuan place?<p>How about the movie theaters or theaters? I went from New York to Seattle and finding a theater that showed non-blockbusters was really hard. When I did find one, they were always three months behind New York. If I wanted to watch, say, Parasite, when could I do that? Four, five months after New York?<p>There&#x27;s definitely some appeal to Minneapolis. You can&#x27;t rent a jetski in New York and you certainly can&#x27;t afford a mansion. But you also can&#x27;t watch the latest Palm D&#x27;Or and get Yunnan noodles in Minneapolis.')
