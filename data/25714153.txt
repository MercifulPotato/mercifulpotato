A few hundred years ago the roles of the police and the army might have been much more similar, but today we have better ideas in how to address an occupied building.<p>History is full of examples and dead bodies where the military has been used against its own people who oppose or obstruct the execution of law. It many countries it also follows a period of regret and new laws in order to prevent something similar to ever happen again. Just because the government has a law that gives them authorization to send the military in order to secure a building, it doesn&#x27;t mean it is a good idea.<p>Would the military trained personnel have done a better job during the capital attack than the police trained one?')
