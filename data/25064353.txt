There&#x27;s no better time to take risks than when you&#x27;re young. Sure, you&#x27;ll probably fail. But even failure will get you to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.&quot;[3]\n</code></pre>\nStartup founders, what would you have done if right after finishing university you had these options?<p><pre><code>  1: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;before.html\n  2: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startupschool.org&#x2F;future-founders\n  3: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;notnot.html</code></pre>')
