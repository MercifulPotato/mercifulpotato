Item(by='openasocket', descendants=None, kids=[24757432], score=None, time=1602524280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756118, text='OK, I think I&#x27;m following. Your notion of free speech ideals isn&#x27;t bound to a specific law like the 1st amendment and is more abstract. (I&#x27;ll note that it sounds like your notion of free speech here actually seems to cover less speech than the 1st amendment, since you&#x27;re explicitly excluding harassment and threats which the 1st amendment may cover. Of course, that&#x27;s determining what is legal and illegal while free speech ideals are more abstract, so that&#x27;s kind of an apples-and-oranges comparison). And you object to Counter Culture, which you&#x27;re defining as coercive actions against those who hold abhorrent or objectionable views. And you propose an alternative, which we could call Refutation Culture, where you instead seek to open up a sort of dialogue to prove those views wrong or immoral.<p>I have a couple of follow-ups. You reject using Cancel Culture to silence those expressing abhorrent ideas. But what if someone isn&#x27;t expressing a political view or ideology, but is instead performing bad actions? Like using racial slurs and insulting minorities, or shouting sexual harassment at women walking down the street? As you mentioned, threats and harassment aren&#x27;t protected under the banner of free speech ideals. And, depending on the circumstances, those actions may be protected under the 1st Amendment, so are not illegal. Do you object to using Cancel Culture against those who are performing threats and harassment? If not, do you have an alternative recommendation? Because I&#x27;m not sure how Refutation Culture would apply in such a situation, there&#x27;s no idea being put forward to argue against. As a follow up, what about abhorrent views being put into practice, such as the CEO of a company instituting racial segregation in their stores?<p>Secondly, where do you draw the line between Cancel Culture and general acts of protest? If someone in a position of power publicly expresses abhorrent views, and under Refutation Culture we should voice an alternative viewpoint, can that take the form of a protest? If we march around that person&#x27;s office holding picket signs refuting their viewpoint, would that be considered coercive?')
