I haven&#x27;t looked back.<p>It used to take work and knowledge to use Linux as a daily driver, like you would Windows. But Linux has matured, and now all of the things you expect to work just do work.<p>And, aside from doing any .NET projects, EVERY programming endeavor I&#x27;ve worked on in Linux has been an absolute breeze. 98% of the time, everything I need is just an &quot;apt install&quot; away, configures correctly, and runs correctly. There is no reason for Windows to exist anymore.')
