You could have it produce some random output within an expected range and then do lots of fast probabilistic computations to resolve the answer.<p>It would come up with the correct answer before the computation is complete some percentage of the time, the other times you would need to wait for it to resolve. You can&#x27;t be sure until it&#x27;s finished, but some possibly correct answer might even be useful whilst you wait for it to complete.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Probabilistic_Turing_machine" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Probabilistic_Turing_machine</a>')
