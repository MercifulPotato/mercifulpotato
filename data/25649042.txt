The whole reason people flout the restriction is because their personal risk is very low. For people under 45, catching covid presents similar risk of dying to a year of driving a car. If government tried to ban driving, arguing that it is for my safety, I would be pissed and would not accept that law. However, if 10% of drivers died every year, I wouldn’t need government to stop me from driving, I’d stay the hell away from the killing machine myself.')
