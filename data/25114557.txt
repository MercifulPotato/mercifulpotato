I can&#x27;t really see how short pieces of text (like URLs) could be compressed to become smaller. That being said it&#x27;s definitely a cool concept! I once worked on a code playground kinda thing for my school and there was a function to share the code written in a URL. How we did it was just to include the whole piece of code as a URL param in base64!')
