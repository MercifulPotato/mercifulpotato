Walmart provides immense value to millions of people. They&#x27;ve developed an infrastructure that delivers cheap products to areas that otherwise would have few other options.<p>Oracle is the antithesis of Walmart. They provide insanely expensive options to corporations who are already locked in to their products.<p>One of the saddest days was when Oracle bought Sun and effectively killed all their open source projects overnight, like OpenOffice and MySQL. Yes, those things are still technically around, but they&#x27;re not getting any serious development, and all the core developers of those projects have forked them into new open source projects.')
