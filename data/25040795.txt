I remember watching something once where the chef of a fancy pizzeria said that the most important thing in pizza is the bread: it should taste great without any topping. Then the sauce and finally everything else.<p>I&#x27;ve had a great vegan pizza once and between bread, sauce and toppings, it tasted like great Italian-style pizza. Sure, a sprinkle of cheese would have made it better still, but the point is it tasted great and it tasted like pizza.<p>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t make for a great American-style pizza, which is all about overloading on cheese (and having rather meh tasting bread typically...), but that&#x27;s not all there is to pizza around the world.')
