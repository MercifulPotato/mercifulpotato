There&#x27;s real potential to break open the market on general computing&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;laptop chips here. I can see how that might get complicated from an OS support standpoint, but it could also instill a remarkable amount of innovation-driven competition. It probably already has, with board-room meetings (and more importantly some long lunches with engineers hashing things out) realizing the M1 is the one to beat. And since it&#x27;s Apple, and Apple will probably remain niche &amp; not license their tech to others, the first to market with even an 80% M1 solution will be in good shape.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m most impressed by the GPU side of the M1. Rough equivalence to a dedicated 1050 Ti is crazy. That&#x27;s in the respectable-low-end gaming side of things: I&#x27;m on a weird Intel-AMD hybrid chipset (hades canyon) that puts me between a 1050 and 1060 and I&#x27;m running AC:Valhalla on moderate settings ~45fps. It seems like Rosetta can achieve something around 70% performance, so less demanding new games and most older games should be playable for anyone who just wants to play and doesn&#x27;t mind a steady 30fps and modest textures &amp; AA. I think some Wine variant (CrossOver?) is already working to make native Windows games playable under Rosetta as well.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t happen overnight, but the prospect of making AAA games playable on a $700 off the shelf mini of $1000 mac book would spur on the big game engine makers to port their tools over to make M1 a build target. Sure if you&#x27;re tech savvy and shop around and don&#x27;t mind at least a few hours of integration hell you can build yourself a very budget low-end gaming pc for ~$500 by forgoing a dedicate GPU and relying on the Vega 11 in Ryzan 5 3400G and that&#x27;s without an OS and a much larger footprint. (Though if Steam gets their act together and offers a cloud-streaming option where I don&#x27;t have to repurchase my games ::ahem, Stadia:: I&#x27;d forgo gaming hardware and stick to a strong Ryzen CPU w&#x2F; solid APU for non-gaming tasks.)')
