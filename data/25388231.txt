Like Audeze did with Mobius. The headphones use accelerometer and gyroscope (which AirPods have too I presume), and position the center of the audio to where you are looking. You can re-center it with a button press. And it works pretty well!<p>So, the hardware is all there. Apple could have done the same, bringing spatial audio to whatever place you want.')
