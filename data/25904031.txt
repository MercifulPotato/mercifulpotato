If they are not acting in a reflective manner, since they&#x27;re being covered up, what good are they?<p>In my mind, geostationary satellites with reflective properties are a solution to a symptom but not to the root cause. I was always taught to fix the root cause of problems, not their symptoms. Therefore I find your strategy to be sup optimal.<p>Having said that, I agree that if we find the root cause to be unsolvable, we should look into fixing some of the symptoms instead.')
