Back when they still came with 4200rpm 2.5&quot; hard drives, and I put a newer drive in a then 5 year old Dell because I needed it to last another few years.<p>I did have a battery go bad in my MacBook Pro about 8 year ago, and it was replaced by Apple free of charge even though it was WAY out of warranty and I didn&#x27;t have Applecare. Service like that alone is enough to keep me as a customer.<p>Most of the rest of the time by the time I am ready to start upgrading components, I am just wanting a newer, faster machine in general. I am not saying these things are not important - the are obviously important _to you_. But Apple has figured, correctly in my opinion, they are are not important to a _lot_ of people, or at the very least are not deal breakers. And more often than not I find myself in the latter camp.')
