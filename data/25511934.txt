You would have to trade off the number of cameras.<p>As for the rest, lp&#x2F;mm only makes sense at a given MTF rating. MTF50 is the standard. MTF9 is very, very, very generous. Incredibly so.<p>But anyways, sure, let&#x27;s take 900lp&#x2F;mm on the short edge for 4590lp&#x2F;mm MTF9 - maybe I misremembered. A 5DSr with a real world zoom lens, the 24-70mm F2.8L, gets 7700lp&#x2F;mm <i>in the real world</i>, and that&#x27;s the MTF lens-sensor system, not just the lens. And that&#x27;s not even close to the maximum possible resolution, nor to the maximum you can actually get in real life as you can. If you take the sharpest full-frame lens I know of whose MTF9 is limited to 400lp&#x2F;mm because no testing apparatus was available that could go higher, the actual maximum is around 9600lp&#x2F;mm. In any case, even the highest theoretical resolution of a phone is far lower than the practical resolutions of ILCs in use today, and is actually less than the sharpness of a 90$ lens on the very cheapest full-frame body you can find.<p>Indeed, take the Canon 50mm EF II, with an MTF50 yielding ~2000-2400lp&#x2F;mm on the short edge of FF sensor. According to this source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.uned.es&#x2F;personal&#x2F;rosuna&#x2F;resources&#x2F;photography&#x2F;Diffraction&#x2F;Do%20sensors%20outresolve.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.uned.es&#x2F;personal&#x2F;rosuna&#x2F;resources&#x2F;photography&#x2F;D...</a>), at around f&#x2F;1.6 we should get around 420lp&#x2F;mm, on the short edge that&#x27;s 2142lp on the short edge, which is less than the cheapest EF lens in production right now. I don&#x27;t know about you, but the best possible performance in theoretically perfect conditions being under the performance of the cheapest EF lens in the real world says something.<p>In real life, of course, the lens-sensor system will barely get close to the theoretically perfect result, and you will peak at the best possible result being around half the linear resolution of the cheapest production Canon lens.<p>Keep in mind, if you were to go for a larger sensor, you&#x27;d have to increase the focal length to compensate too. So 20% increase in sensor size length would need a 20% increase in focal length and at the same f number you&#x27;d need a 20% wider aperture too. And again, you&#x27;d be fixed at around 25mm FF eq. focal lengths, if you try more practical focal lengths like 50mm FF eq. you would see a drop in quality. They&#x27;re already pretty much at their optical limits and have been for a while, actually f&#x2F;1.6 isn&#x27;t even the fastest phone lens - but those had smaller sensors still.')
