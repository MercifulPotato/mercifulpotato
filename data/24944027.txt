It feels like your vote, if for the leading candidate, only gets counted once, while voters for the losing candidates get more votes.<p>And yes, I understand that this is not the case, but adding additional confusion to our system when trust in it is at an all time low doesn&#x27;t seem like a smart play. Gone will be the days when you can present a simple set of numbers to the general populace.<p>It&#x27;s also been very strange to have a lot of out of state money dumped into my city of ~50k to get it added for our local city elections. I&#x27;ve gotten more ads and mailings about it than for our US Senate election, probably by a factor of 5x. It&#x27;s clear one political party has made the determination that it will be beneficial to their side.')
