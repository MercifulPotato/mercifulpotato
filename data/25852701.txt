They are populated still but the architecture points clearly to a time when there was so much more going on in the area.<p>All around the UK there are spa towns and resorts that were clearly bustling with wealth (community and personal) a century ago, but have now slumped in popularity.<p>A town like Malvern for example.  It was the <i>height</i> of Edwardian (I think that’s the right era) sophistication.  A must visit tourist destination for the middle classes.  All that really remains anymore of the town’s prestige are the schools and the immovable hills.  You see some spa infrastructure still but a lot of it is derelict.<p>I was in Llanthony valley a few summers ago and took a really interesting guided tour through some local unpaved roads.  Our guide, Henry was born in the village in 1930.  He showed us the sites of two former pubs, now completely gone except for some York stones on the threshold.  They’d drink there, or walk an hour across the valley to the pubs on the other side when they felt like it.  We looked through the old school that taught 15 children of local families.  It’s now just another big house with two cars parked outside.<p>The big house up the top had a squire who rented land to Henry and his father where they grew valuable soft fruit crops for sale in the local market towns.  The village had other services: a shop and a farrier.<p>All gone.  The fruit plots are now overtaken with ash and briar.  People still lived in all of the houses, but they were now the country homes of people who worked in the big local towns, or London, or had just retired to the area.  I don’t begrudge them for that, and it was surely a much poorer life back in the 1950s, but it was also a much more of a <i>local</i> one and that felt like it had a lot of value. It also felt like the people were all there but they just didn’t know each other any more.  Or they did, but they didn’t work together, so it was a dormitory suburb albeit in the heart of a Welsh valley.  <i>No one worked there.</i><p>It felt quite melancholic.  The big towns took so much away from the second cities, villages, and countryside.  When you can find British communities that still thrive away from the major cities it is <i>magical</i>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.malvernremembers.org.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;great-malvern&#x2F;great-malvern-7.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.malvernremembers.org.uk&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;great...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cwmyoy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cwmyoy</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdeyetraveller.com&#x2F;st-martins-church-cwmyoy-crooked-church&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thirdeyetraveller.com&#x2F;st-martins-church-cwmyoy-crooke...</a><p>...and here’s another great link:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.bfi.org.uk&#x2F;free&#x2F;film&#x2F;watch-tenbury-wells-spa-1978-online" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;player.bfi.org.uk&#x2F;free&#x2F;film&#x2F;watch-tenbury-wells-spa-...</a>')
