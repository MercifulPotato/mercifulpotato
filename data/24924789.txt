Wayland is an attempt to do one thing and do it well, hence why it doesn&#x27;t have solutions for things like clipboard management. Because that&#x27;s not part of display management &amp; composition. Wayland only does that one thing.<p>By contrast the common complaint about Wayland is that it doesn&#x27;t have the vast variety of unrelated features rammed into it like X does.<p>Part of the problem here then is that there&#x27;s A) no big pushes for &#x27;does one thing &amp; does it well&#x27; for all the <i>other</i> X features (like clipboard or global keyboard shortcuts), and B) fragmented implementations of the wayland protocol. There really should have been a much better, and more singular, reference implementation that Gnome, KDE, etc... all just embedded instead. Which means the &quot;does it well&quot; part is taking a really long time, as developer communities are split up.')
