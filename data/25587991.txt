Item(by='codethief', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609373830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25578655, text='&gt; Given that there have been exactly zero experiments conducted in laboratories close to black holes, isn&#x27;t that qualifier kind of a cop-out?<p>No, I don&#x27;t think it is. I agree of course that it&#x27;s hard to test predictions regarding black holes. But I was addressing OP&#x27;s statement that<p>&gt; For example, you can use string theory to study the structure and behavior of black holes and holography, something called AdS&#x2F;CFT, an area that has been incredibly successful.<p>and I merely intended to express my disagreement with the claim that AdS&#x2F;CFT has been &quot;incredibly successful&quot;. Successful in what way? Measured by what metric? Clearly not by the usual metric that says that experimental evidence is what counts. And <i>on top of all of that</i> AdS isn&#x27;t even close to the spacetime describing the known universe.<p>&gt; Given the observational knowledge of today, even a true theory of quantum gravity beamed back from the future would fail to produce verifiable experimental evidence in the realm of black holes.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily true.
