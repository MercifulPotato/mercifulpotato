Which is why I&#x27;m opposed to mandatory mask wearing and especially to social isolation. These measures actually prolong the pandemic by delaying infections.<p>Yeah...I&#x27;m not interested in risking long-term lung and organ damage in the pursuit of an as-yet-unproven &quot;herd immunity victory condition&quot;, just because some people don&#x27;t want to wear a piece of cloth on their face. It&#x27;s clear we won&#x27;t find much common ground, probably best for us to stop discussing this further.<p>Also, elderly folks will still be left in social isolation with your solution, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a real win.')
