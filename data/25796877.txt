In my experience it’s usually some version of “hey”, “hi”, “hello” if you’re lucky. Or something <i>slightly</i> more creative but crass&#x2F;disgusting if you’re not.<p>I don’t think it’s fair to characterize it as “women punting the ball back” so much as it’s just not usually worth the effort for a lot of people — no matter their gender — to think of something more original to say.<p>I don’t know why people complain about it though. It seems like the perfect way to really stand out in the crowd. Everyone wants to be recognized as a unique individual and when your inbox is full of “hey” all the way down then a message from someone who took the time to get to know you a bit is definitely going to be opened and replied to more often.')
