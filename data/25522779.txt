I&#x27;m a huge fan of the futurist motto that <i>actual</i> progress, as opposed to <i>expected</i> progress, is driven by difference-from-current. (Maybe from Kurzweil?)<p>E.g. (1) we don&#x27;t have flying cars because they&#x27;re not different enough from street cars to justify their cost, and (2) we do have incredible wireless cell phones because they&#x27;re fundamentally different than landlines.<p>&quot;Massive transition&quot; etc. just doesn&#x27;t ring true.<p><i>After</i> transitioning, the car experience won&#x27;t be fundamentally that different than the current car + ride share experience.<p>If anything, the future of automobiles seems more likely to lead to lower ownership rates, more commoditization, compressed margins, and a worse market to win.<p>Apple still has to answer to shareholders, and Tim Cook doesn&#x27;t have Jobs-levels of trust to trade on.')
