I think you know what follows, but just for completeness and for other readers: they aren&#x27;t, <i>at all</i>, just like insects in general (the numbers are so unbelievably insane I&#x27;m nog even going to look up the latest one but just say &#x27;70% decrease in the last couple of decades&#x27; and it will be ballpark correct, unfortunately). And unlike the domestic bees they cannot be bred (or at least not easily). Pesticides likely also play a role in there, small perhaps, habitat loss is estimated to be the main factor. Which mono-crops also is the key player in of course; not just because those fields are no habitat but also because upscaling leads to destroying the surroundings, and so on.')
