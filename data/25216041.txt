Don’t remember much about the machines outside that.<p>Now I’m looking at MacBooks. I’m not overly familiar with their lines but I’m a bit concerned. The newer Pro with the M1 is capped at 16GB (my main machine has 64GB these days) and I’m a bit weary of an Arm processor in a product labeled “pro”. Most of the laptops I’ve seen with Arm processors are rather low end, maybe good lightweight, everyday use, but I would be weary to use them for development. The larger MacBook Pro seems not to have the memory limit and does not advertise the M1 (which for all I know could be fine), however the base price is much higher. From my understanding the Air is cheaper and smaller, but I don’t recall the specs or know if they would perform well for development.')
