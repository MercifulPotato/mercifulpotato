I needed to optimize a critical C++ function that took two 3D line segments and returned a transform matrix that would transform the first line segment into the second. I was able to completely remove the matrix multiplications from the function by using SymPy to pre-compose the scale&#x2F;rotate&#x2F;translate matrices and simplify the result, and the benchmarks showed a significant speedup.')
