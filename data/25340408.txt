Let&#x27;s be honest, even senior network engineers would have a hard time debugging and diagnosing this. AT&amp;T doesn&#x27;t want to pay support staff six figure salaries and I assume most senior network engineers don&#x27;t want to be support agents (customer facing).<p>AT&amp;T (though applies to lost of companies) probably need a &quot;unicorn&quot; role of a very technical person that is paid as such, but able to interface with customers on specific highly technical issues.')
