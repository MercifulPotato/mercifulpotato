If people get annoyed enough they could fork the open source parts and rewrite the extensions that aren&#x27;t open source.<p>Furthermore, there are programmers using other languages where the extensions are already open source, so it would be viable for some users from the start.<p>I&#x27;m also reminded of how some companies built their business on open source servers only for Amazon to create a competing service with their code. This makes me more sympathetic to the partial open source business model.')
