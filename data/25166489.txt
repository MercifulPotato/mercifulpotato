While a service can easily tell you if it&#x27;s &quot;up&quot;, sometimes the only way to determine if it&#x27;s &quot;available&quot; is to check. Keep in mind that the sentinel for any given service will be different. If you think about it, how could any external monitoring service determine when a service under it&#x27;s purview is available without actually checking?<p>Maybe it already has something like this, but I feel like systemd could provide an API endpoint for applications to send a simple status when they are &quot;ready&quot; - at which point it would be up to the developers to provide that at the right time.')
