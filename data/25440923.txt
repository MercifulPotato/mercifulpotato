For some reason\nthose are much less popular even though I find them more\npratical.<p>Where dynamic WMs constantly rearrange all the windows with\nevery change according to some fixed layout, the static ones\nwork basically like Vim&#x27;s windows and buffers. Meaning windows\nare stacked above each other by default with only the first one\nshowing, but with some shortcuts you can split horizontally or\nvertically and change all split dimensions.<p>I have used many tiling window managers and over time I\ngravitated away from all the dynamic WMs because they&#x27;re just\nnot flexible enough for the real world. They tend to work on the\nassumption that the user needs all windows on the screen all the\ntime, and this does not make sense in many scenarios.')
