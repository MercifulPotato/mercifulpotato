But that says something about where we are today as a society and what is within the realm of possibility.<p>No it’s not that simple. Especially because you’ve forgotten about past Capitol riots at McConnell’s office (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;politics&#x2F;sunrise-movement-mcconnell-protests&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;02&#x2F;25&#x2F;politics&#x2F;sunrise-movement-mcc...</a>), and Pelosi’s office (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-politics&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez-nancy-pelosi-climate-change-congress-democrats-protest-a8632361.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-politic...</a>), and the legislative chambers when Kavanaugh was appointed (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-45754771" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-45754771</a>).

Or consider that you probably hadn’t heard of the above incidents I enumerated.
