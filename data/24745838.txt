Item(by='jcims', descendants=None, kids=[24746320, 24745957, 24746486, 24745889], score=None, time=1602425000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745324, text='I&#x27;ve heard a low pitched &#x27;hum&#x27; for a couple of years now at my house.  It is weird because it actually has two tones, one at ~28hz and one at ~36hz and it alternates between them...usually at the lower frequency but will sometimes hop up to the higher frequency for a few seconds.<p>I&#x27;ve tried recording it with several different high quality microphone setups and absolutely nothing at all.  Also, nobody in the house and none of my neighbors hear it.  So at this point I think it&#x27;s something in my head, but I only hear it when I&#x27;m in my house.  Never when I&#x27;m on the road.<p>Not sure if this counts as &#x27;the hum&#x27; but it&#x27;s definitely weird.')
