Perhaps a large print outs of Pie, side walks are hanging on their walls and they just have to get it right couple of times to understand what it is.<p>P.S. I recently received an CAPTCHA on LinkedIn to identify a &#x27;Spiral Galaxy&#x27;, although that made me happy, the questions raised about CAPTCHAs seems validated with it.')
