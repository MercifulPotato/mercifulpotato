I considered my self a self-development junkie - trying one method after another. I lucked onto a seminar called &quot;The Secret of Creating Your Future&quot;. One of its tenets is goal setting. This seminar was an introduction to NLP - a worthy goal. My original goal was to better my professional development, but I discovered that my personal development was improving enormously as well.<p>Eventually I was enrolled in courses aimed primarily at professional therapists. They certainly welcomed me as they need people to practice with as they themselves are learning new techniques.<p>This series has enormously transformed both my professional and personal life. Highly recommended.')
