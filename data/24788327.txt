Many of these features are rarely used, and many clients&#x2F;servers don&#x27;t even implement them, but SFTP is not a feature-complete replacement for FTP. But there are some environments (e.g. mainframe environments) where these features are used, and these feature gaps make it difficult or impossible to replace FTP with SFTP')
