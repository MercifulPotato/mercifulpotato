There are techniques like homomorphic encryption that go in the direction of allowing analysis on encrypted data.<p>Musing on possible other solutions, I wonder if simply ratching up the cost and repeated access and limiting data output would discourage this profile building.<p>Another possibility is it possible to concieve of the service, that takes in a script, runs it, and then tests the returned data for the level of information entropy. Blocking anything above a certain threshold. FYI not sure if that is complete nonsense, but conceptually, with much hand waving, maybe it works.<p>Going local though does help too')
