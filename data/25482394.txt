But, it&#x27;s largely pointless: I work at home and don&#x27;t go outside except to get some groceries now and again. If I did get COVID-19, I&#x27;m at a very low risk of dying. I&#x27;m probably not going to spread it to anyone either; I live alone and would just stay in bed for the two weeks I was contagious.<p>I.e. you wouldn&#x27;t find it worthwhile to pay whatever it may cost for an early dose (the LA Times reports people offering up to $25,000). Distribution by willingness to pay does sort  by those who are able to pay <i>and</i> finding it worth the cost.')
