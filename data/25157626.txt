If the effective reproduction (R) of your country&#x27;s population is below 1 it won&#x27;t spread there, even if the rest of the world is letting it run wild and free.<p>That only persists as long as the lockdown measures you mentioned are in place. Yes if you maintain those measures indefinitely, you can keep the virus at bay indefinitely, and that&#x27;s a different claim than I thought you were initially making.')
