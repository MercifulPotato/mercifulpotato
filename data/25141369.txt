It’s not like trying to prove the Riemann hypothesis. You cannot solve the black hole information loss problem with math alone. You need data, there is no data, and there won’t be any data. Which is why the black hole information loss problem is for all practical purposes unsolvable.<p>We lack experimental data.  We lack a way to get experimental data.  All we have is some beautiful mathematics.  That&#x27;s nice, but we don&#x27;t know if it corresponds to reality.  That&#x27;s true of the paper under discussion, and it&#x27;s true of all the other papers proposing solutions as well.')
