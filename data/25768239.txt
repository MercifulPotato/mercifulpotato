In-person meetings and real-time calls have been a major part of the work. There is an agenda and very good notes are taken during these sessions (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;pm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;pm</a>). The calls have been essential for coordinating in a more formal setting and to get a feel for when consensus is achieved on a particular topic or proposal.<p>What threaded forums later added was the ability for others to get involved in the discussion, particularly those who are not core developers or not able to attend.<p>2. Another important medium has been GitHub issues (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2315" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2315</a>). Proposals are submitted as a PR and, earlier in the evolution of the governance process, many people would comment on them. These were not ideal due the flat nature of the format.<p>What generally changed on GitHub issues in recent years was the encouraging of commenters to go to an external forum thread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2315#issuecomment-630407273" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;EIPs&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2315#issuecomment-63...</a>), leaving editors and authors to work out structural and other basic issues about a proposal in GitHub PR comments.')
