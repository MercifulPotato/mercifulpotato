Moddable compiles JS to a byte code on the PC and builds an image to transfer to the embedded chip. The XS runtime of Moddable probably is closer to a full development pipeline, for people used to low-level embedded development.<p>Low.js was more high-level, when I tried it you did not need to know anything about embedded, just send JS code to the embedded system with low.js on it. Moddable required full knowledge of C and embedded development.<p>Moddable directly supports almost all of ES 2018.<p>Low.js uses Duktape with their own stuff added and last time I checked required transpilation of the JS code to ES5.')
