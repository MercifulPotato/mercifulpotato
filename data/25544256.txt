Tonnes of companies have hundreds and even thousands of patents. The original claim that innovation is being blocked needs a clear example to support it.<p>&gt; No volume price breaks, no prototype-quantity orders (at any price), no partnering with other manufacturers, no shared development projects<p>None of this sounds like blocking innovation. Sounds more like a difference in perception about costs. It would be like me expecting to get preferential treatment from one of the LCD vendors to develop something.<p>&gt; but you&#x27;re not supposed to be able to sit on a patent hoard this large while behaving this badly<p>I see a lot of superlatives but googling doesn&#x27;t give me any hint of what you&#x27;re referring to as their bad behaviour.')
