Had we chosen concurrency of “1” request, we probably wouldn’t have even noticed the bill.<p>&gt; If you count the number of pages in GCP documentation, it’s probably more than pages in few novels. Understanding Pricing, Usage, is not only time consuming, but requires a deep understanding of how Cloud services work. No wonder there are full time jobs for just this purpose!<p>Great write-up - thanks for sharing @bharatsb! As you say, cloud pricing has become too complex for developers to understand quickly (they want to ship features, not calculate costs). Infra-as-code is great, but it has made it even harder to understand which code&#x2F;config option costs what. `terraform apply` is like a checkout screen without prices.<p>We&#x27;re trying to solve this problem with infracost.io, initially looking at Terraform. It would be interesting to get your feedback on whether such an approach might have helped you? Probably not as it doesn&#x27;t look like you were using Terraform?')
