A precise bug report is good, a &quot;precise complaint&quot; is a mere opinion. It feels really nice to write one and people like patting themselves on their back, but opinions are like assholes, everybody has one.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d much rather see a solution to a problem than a complaint. The solution might involve discussions that go back and forth, but if they culminate in a decision on a way forward with a person willing to do the work, they are much more useful than &quot;your code sucks on line&quot;.<p>Complaining isn&#x27;t contributing.<p>Edit: also, working on a solution doesn&#x27;t preclude discussion on the proper solution.')
