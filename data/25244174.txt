Still it’s fairly slow, that’s why I was thinking about streaming stuff to a running BEAM from a Golang executable, say. Presumably then this problem goes away (compilation may still take a while). I guess if the #! just streams the file content over we are still protected by the execution bit, but what about malicious programs streaming their own content?')
