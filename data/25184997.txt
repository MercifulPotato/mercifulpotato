Croatian fascists rose to power riding a nationalistic sentiment that was brewing in the country which has been under foreign rule for centuries. Not sure where you get the &quot;started the war to annihilate everyone else&quot; angle.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not a fan too, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to paint everything with a rough brush and miss the nuances. It&#x27;s important to understand people and what motivates them and what are the phycological forces at play. And you can do that without having to concede a &quot;good people on both sides&quot; bullshit.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t think my grandfather had any idea about politics and -isms. He was just a kid been dragged into the war merely by belonging to a given tribe in a given place in a given time. When I was a kid his whole spiel about fascists va communists, christians vs party, was just our people vs their people. He used the same words and arguments I heard of people when the enemy was the &quot;american imperialists&quot;. There was no ideology whatsoever, just the feeling of being oppressed.<p>I don&#x27;t see anything wrong punishing actual war criminals and top level brass, but when you stigmatize a whole population do you really expect people not holding a grudge and distorting facts to paint themselves in the best possible light?')
