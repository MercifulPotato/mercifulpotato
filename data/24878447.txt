With burner reactors, the 239Pu produced is less than the fissionable material consumed, and most of the 238U ends up not being usable.<p>I&#x27;ll add that with current technology, you can&#x27;t reprocess MOX fuel another time (too many higher isotopes of Pu and transuranics beyond Pu are produced), so any Pu in it after it&#x27;s consumed must be disposed of.')
