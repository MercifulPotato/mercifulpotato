The idea that we should tolerate big parasites because they&#x27;d take their money elsewhere both undervalues everything else about a region and it&#x27;s people that might keep them there and overestimates the value of being home to <i>greedy</i> wealth.<p>It&#x27;s stupid to play in the race to the bottom of governing power versus concentrated wealth.
