Walter Duranty&#x27;s bias and agenda, for example, aren&#x27;t really in doubt anymore.<p>Those examples are stale.  It&#x27;s like saying there&#x27;s no evidence that English language literature was ever common in any library, and citing the contents of some British library circa 1100AD as proof.  Pulitzer&#x27;s yellow journalism phase spanned from the late 1800s to about 1900.  In the last decade of his life, he rejected it an apparently turned his paper into a respectable publication [1].  Duranty&#x27;s reporting occurred in the early 1930s, and has since been scathingly criticized and rejected by the paper he published it in [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism#After_the_war" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Yellow_journalism#After_the_wa...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walter_Duranty#Calls_for_revocation_of_Pulitzer_Prize,_1990%E2%80%932003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Walter_Duranty#Calls_for_revoc...</a>')
