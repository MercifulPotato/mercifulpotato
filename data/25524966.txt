Item(by='lykahb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608782813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524095, text='Brave got a lot of flak for both blocking webpage ads and showing their own. Some of it was based on the wrong assumption that it substitutes website ads with their own. Instead, both Brave and Opera show ads in the context outside of the web page.<p>I have fond memories of the old Opera based on Presto - its gesture system and tuning of web pages display are still unmatched. Why was it so good? The engineering talent, clear vision for product that cared for both regular and power users, or anything else? I&#x27;d say that it was because it was a paid product in a market with free alternatives and it strived to be so good that people pay and recommend it to friends. There is a parallel with JetBrains here. Alas, the technical and financial challenge was too big. Both Presto and the spirit of that company are long gone. RIP Opera.')
