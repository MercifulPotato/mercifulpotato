Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609636373, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618136, text='&gt;Conway stated that two independent proofs used to exist, one by himself and Richard Parker (that only proved that N existed), and another one by Mike Guy (that actually proved that one may take N = 24, and that it was best possible). Unfortunately both proofs were lost. Here we announce a new proof (which establishes that one may take N = 29; with more computations one should be able to rederive (or else refute) Guyâ€™s sharp N = 24).<p>This guy was so prolific. Can you imagine losing math proofs because you had so much unique and valuable math in your office, briefcase, passenger seat of auto, etc. that papers and proofs were falling out in the parking lot and being used to support wobbly tables?')
