But the humanity learned much more since then.<p>And it&#x27;s not a new phenomenon. As the American continent was discovered by Europeans, with all the vegetables never before seen in Europe, it was already completely obvious that the world as described in the &quot;holy&quot; texts doesn&#x27;t match the facts. America just doesn&#x27;t exist in the Bible or in Koran, and neither do most of the products we eat today. (2) And then the Mormons, being in America, filled that gap with their &quot;newer&quot; &quot;holy&quot; text again delivered by an angel.<p>It&#x27;s so completely not fitting what we scientifically know that the detractors can&#x27;t argue at that level at all, trying instead to place their god in the &quot;gaps&quot; (1) which became immensely smaller as the scientific knowledge progressed.<p>The spreaders of doubt can&#x27;t increase the &quot;gaps&quot; the science already narrowed down, but work day and night to increase the number of people whose own perception of the world around them has bigger gaps, especially by maintaining the false associations in their minds (&quot;when you hear this think instead about that&quot;). That&#x27;s doable and that&#x27;s good enough for them. But it&#x27;s bad for humanity. That&#x27;s how we have people drinking bleach and spreading such ideas to others. They just remain confused and demotivated to learn consistently (&quot;we should doubt everything especially the science&quot;). And by the same principles, we get the text we all comment here and your response too, hanging exactly to these words.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps</a><p>2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;18-food-crops-developed-in-the-americas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;18-food-crops-developed-in-t...</a> -- there&#x27;s no: beans, corn (maize), peanut, peppers, potato, sunflower or tomato in the Bible and, of course, no American continent. Both in the Bible and in the Koran the Earth is flat, under the solid firmament (the original word meant something like &quot;the thinly beaten firm dome&quot; as the metal bowls were made) to which the stars are attached. In Koran, moreover, the &quot;god&quot; shoots the devils with the shooting stars.<p>Edit: a response to the &quot;god is unknown&quot; reply: yes, &quot;god&quot; can be &quot;unknown&quot;, and I agree that those who argue should first precisely define their &quot;god&quot;, what is however known is that whatever the religious books tell you that god <i>is</i> -- just can&#x27;t be true, and the stories are on the level of simple child stories, from the today&#x27;s perspective. My definition therefore is &quot;all the appearances and acts of god in the holy texts.&quot; If you are ready to throw away everything in the &quot;holy&quot; texts and still believe in &quot;something&quot; that is not against what is already scientifically known, I surely have no problem with that. But a jealous god demanding a firstborn son to be ritually sacrificed, or sending bears to maul children who mocked his prophet, or sacrificing himself on the cross in spite of being almighty and being able to do any simpler intervention, or giving exclusive prophecies to an illiterate caravan robber allowing him to have as many wives as he wants and commanding him to kill all unbelievers?
