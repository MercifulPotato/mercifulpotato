But the humanity learned much more since then.<p>And it&#x27;s not a new phenomenon. As the American continent was discovered by Europeans, with all the vegetables never before seen in Europe, it was already completely obvious that the world as described in the &quot;holy&quot; texts doesn&#x27;t match the facts. America just doesn&#x27;t exist in the Bible or in Koran, and neither do most of the products we eat today. (2) And then the Mormons, being in America, filled that gap with their &quot;newer&quot; &quot;holy&quot; text again delivered by an angel.<p>It&#x27;s so completely not fitting what we scientifically know that the detractors can&#x27;t argue at that level at all, trying instead to place their god in the &quot;gaps&quot; (1) which became immensely smaller as the scientific knowledge progressed.<p>The spreaders of doubt can&#x27;t increase the &quot;gaps&quot; the science already narrowed down, but work day and night to increase the number of people whose own perception of the world around them has bigger gaps, especially by maintaining the false associations in their minds (&quot;when you hear this think instead about that&quot;). That&#x27;s doable and that&#x27;s good enough for them. But it&#x27;s bad for humanity. That&#x27;s how we have people drinking bleach and spreading such ideas to others. But by the same principles, we get the text we all comment here.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;God_of_the_gaps</a><p>2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;18-food-crops-developed-in-the-americas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;18-food-crops-developed-in-t...</a> -- there&#x27;s no: Beans, Corn (Maize), Peanut, Peppers, Potato, Sunflower or Tomato in the Bible and, of course, no American continent. Both in the Bible and in the Koran the Earth is flat, under the solid firmament (the original word meant something like &quot;the thinly beaten firm dome&quot;) to which the stars are attached. In Koran, moreover, the &quot;god&quot; shoots the devils with the shooting stars.')
