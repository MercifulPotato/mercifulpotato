It&#x27;s full of so much nonsense that can only be described as gambling. This is putting aside the direct skin purchases that range from $5-$20 that have no effect other than to change in game appearance. The gambling though.<p>Regular events, most of which which are draws, with skins as prizes, where the odds of winning, as stated in game, are at times lower than 1%. These draws will tend to give the first few free or winnable through in game tasks, but inevitably end up costing actual money if you actually want even the slightest chance of winning.<p>The costs for this to actually win a prize i imagine could easily end up being pretty significant.<p>It&#x27;s constant though, every day, every week, every month. New draws and prizes for people to buy with rewards that are essentially completely pointless.<p>It&#x27;s a free game, so i&#x27;m pretty sure this is where the majority of the games profits come from and it seems like an extremely profitable game.<p>It all does seem to be things that would be primarily appealing to kids though. Things to make the characters look cool and let you brag. Then again, there&#x27;s plenty of adults susceptible to that kind of thing.')
