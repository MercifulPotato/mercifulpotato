Looking through their FAQ, they don&#x27;t really seem to define what a &quot;app&quot; is. Could this not mean the entire OS should be replaceable with one that wasn&#x27;t made by a &quot;gatekeeper&quot;? Because if say, Apple, allows you to remove Messages.app but keeps the Messages API private or locked behind an Apple-only entitlement, that isn&#x27;t very useful, and the user should be able to load another OS at their discretion that lets them run whatever SMS client they want. Unless they want to require that all of the system services be able to be accessed by whatever app the user installs, which seems like a bigger kettle of fish.')
