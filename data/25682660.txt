Is this the curse of right wing populism? Why do disenfranchised people love voting for people that don&#x27;t care about them? Trump didn&#x27;t win the election but he still had lots of support even though he was only looking out for himself (and others like him) during his presidency.<p>Green investments are such an incredibly easy way to implement jobs programs yet people hate on them because they believe not subsidizing anything is more important than solving real problems like domestic underemployment. Yes, when I talk about green investments I am not even considering how you are doing something for the planet, I&#x27;m just talking about the economic impact of building up a domestic industry. For all intents and purposes you could also have spent money on maintaining roads or building lots of houses for all I care but when you listen to someone like Trump he would spend it on useless crap like coal. There are very little employment opportunities (if you ignore the work needed to undo the CO2 emissions) in a dying industry. But hey, it&#x27;s got high visibility and is an emotional topic so lets shoot renewables down in favor of it even though you had more to benefit from the &quot;green scam&quot; (hyperbole) than coal.<p>China is doing an extreme amount of jobs programs. All those ghost cities are there to employ construction workers first, sell capital to wealthy individuals and eventually be populated by immigrants. They also loan money to developing countries and build infrastructure for them.')
