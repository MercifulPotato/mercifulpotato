In my opinion, you don&#x27;t really get to be independent-minded without the negatives that come with it. For instance, most conspiracy theorists are highly independent-minded people. They definitely reject authority, and they&#x27;re highly curious and contrarian about established narratives.<p>This recent small debate I found on Twitter is a good illustrative example of it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ModeledBehavior&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328023553824993280" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ModeledBehavior&#x2F;status&#x2F;13280235538249932...</a> The account in question (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;toad_spotted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;toad_spotted</a>) was someone who got the pandemic right earlier than most people, so conventional-minded people followed it because it was a good source of information about the virus overall. But now that another situation has come up where independent-mindedness can also show itself to be useful (and potentially right), conventional-minded people will dislike it, just like they disliked it when the outcome of the virus wasn&#x27;t yet known.<p>I felt like mentioning this because I feel like there&#x27;s a lack of appreciation for how exactly the negative aspects of independent-mindedness manifest themselves in real life, and without that appreciation for the negatives of it I think it&#x27;s easy to misjudge how independent-minded someone actually is and to also misjudge people who are more independent-minded than you because they seem more difficult to get along with.')
