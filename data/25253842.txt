I have used both, and I find matlab clunky and slow to start, while octave is very lean and responsive.  My way of using them is probably not very representative though.  I never do plotting, it&#x27;s mostly saving the computed solutions into files  and looking at them with other programs.  In the rare cases I need to plot something, I write the data into a file and call gnuplot separately.  Also, I do not run the interactive interpreter, but I write scripts that launch a new interpreter for each run.  Matlab seems to be extremely ill-suited for this usage.  For example, it takes about 3 seconds just for launching (!).  Also, there are bizarre problems (apart from ridiculous memory usage), when running several matlab instances in parallel.')
