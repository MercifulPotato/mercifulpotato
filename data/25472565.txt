Why?<p>- It&#x27;s in both AMD and Intel&#x27;s interests for x86 to remain dominant for as long as possible. If they could it would be in their interest to drive Arm new entrants out of the market (I don&#x27;t believe that will happen though).<p>- Introducing an Arm product (or even hinting at one) would add credibility to new entrants and undermine existing products.<p>- They could almost certainly switch to an Arm design reasonably quickly if they needed to.<p>There is also some uncertainty about the impact that Nvidia will have on Arm when it takes it over. x86 is AMD&#x27;s jointly owned ISA - they have no control over the Arm ISA.')
