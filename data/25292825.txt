Interest rates on savings accounts are supposed to be slightly lower than interest rates on loans with the bank taking a profit in the middle.<p>Home loans used to be much higher, in the 10-15% range and you could get 6-7% on your savings account.<p>With home loans in the 2-3% range, those margins aren&#x27;t feasible anymore.<p>But that&#x27;s probably an old understanding. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more financial wizardry to it now.')
