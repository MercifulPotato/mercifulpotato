This caused very low latencies to basically never work without dropouts.  I can distinguish a 20-30ms latency and above that it becomes too difficult to ply anything meaningful.  Even my semi-pro tascam interface could only sample between 11-14ms. Faster cpus over the last 5 years and ultimately Usb3 solved the polling problem but is just now picking up traction in newer devices due to the usb-c connector.')
