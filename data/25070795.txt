It&#x27;s a quiet NaN with a payload, which is well-defined by the IEEE 754 standard.<p>As other posters pointed out, it&#x27;s relying on a &quot;should&quot; behavior from the spec, which is risky but common. It sounds like disabling the &quot;RunFast&quot; mode cleared up their issues, which seems quite far from it being an &quot;obscenely bad&quot; design decision.<p>It&#x27;s not terribly unusual to require IEEE 754 compliance in numerical code, like the usual options for avoiding --ffast-math -style stuff.')
