(I think I agree there too.)<p>I think we agree up until this point, at which you fall into a trap. This is the same trap I was trying to avoid by giving my SSPL scenario above.<p>A copyleft license like GPLv3 does not prevent a business from operating a SAAS business.<p>AGPL would apply, but it only triggers upon <i>modification</i>. So as long as Amazon doesn&#x27;t modify Elasticsearch itself, they don&#x27;t have to publish anything (because there&#x27;s nothing to publish), and if they do modify, they have to share just those changes. Which is very fair to me from a copyleft perspective.<p>Now SSPL tries to go further and say for merely <i>using</i> the software in a certain way, you must release not just any changes to the software itself but also <i>everything</i> around the software. That is what makes the SSPL neither open source nor free. (I guess I don&#x27;t actually know how &quot;free&quot; is defined, so I can only say for certain that it&#x27;s not open source, but I don&#x27;t think SSPL even counts as copyleft)')
