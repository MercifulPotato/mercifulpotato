Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607862672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406025, text='&gt; Having two or three people you know give a decent review to a book.<p>I have a large amount of Goodreads friends, often IRL friends with whom I know I share hobbies and interests. And yet, when I use the Goodreads &quot;See books in common&quot; feature, we share almost no books. I think a real problem for media-rating websites today is this: the glut of readily accessible content on the internet makes it less and less likely that any two people will share any one item of content.<p>The same problem can be found on Last.fm, where there are so many bands out there today, so much free listening to do, that even ardent lovers of a particular genre might not have very overlapping tastes. Last.fm appears to have been forced to change their compatibility algorithm, so that now you are &quot;Super compatibility&quot; with another user by just sharing a handful of bands in common, whereas in the past you would have had to share a <i>lot</i> more bands and listens in order to be ranked as Super.')
