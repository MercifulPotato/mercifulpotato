The guy hacked together some code in a few days and deployed it to a service with unlimited billing without any kind of sanity checks and without even understanding what he was paying for. He’s an ex-Googler, it’s not like he hasn’t heard stories like this before. And the takeaway? “Oops don’t deploy buggy code” and “I shouldn’t have used the default settings”. OK, sure, let me know how that works out for you.')
