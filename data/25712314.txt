I&#x27;m nervous posting; but anyway I wanted to share my reading platform:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;books" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;books</a><p>In short I wanted to create a platform that allows kids and adults to enjoy reading regardless if the content is fiction or non-fiction.  However, I didn&#x27;t want just another material design site, I wanted to make it add a retro aspect to it.  It&#x27;s using MDB, a heavily hacked RPGUI (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ronenness.github.io&#x2F;RPGUI&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ronenness.github.io&#x2F;RPGUI&#x2F;</a>), old school fonts (previously posted on HN <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;int10h.org&#x2F;oldschool-pc-fonts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;int10h.org&#x2F;oldschool-pc-fonts&#x2F;</a>), and using OctoberCMS as the backend.<p>There&#x27;s so much content in the wild web but reading it can make your eyes strain (especially on large &#x2F; wide monitors).  Reading pages should be easy on the eyes, making it reading more enjoyable.<p>In addition, the concept is to take content and split the content into smaller chunks.\nFor fiction I want to import books from (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;</a>).<p>For a full book example, I took Frankenstein\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;frankenstein&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;frankenstein&#x2F;1</a><p>For a full short story, I took H.G Well&#x27;s A dream of Armageddon: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;dream-armageddon&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;dream-armageddon&#x2F;1</a><p>Finally for e-learning, I have some AWS notes:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;cloud-computing&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tutee.io&#x2F;pages&#x2F;cloud-computing&#x2F;1</a><p>Another thing that helps is the Summary section that will help you remember or refresh where you left off. Note: the summary notes are made up...just filling it in beyond Lipsum.<p>In the end I would love to make it social where users can create their own content such as short stories, full books, or even notes.  Perhaps even the agility to collaborate or write material together, &quot;check out books&quot; (like going to the library) except you can contribute your own material in the book you just checked out.<p>I would love some help in developing this further and taking it to the next level. \nFor those readers out there, I can use some help on content to put up there as well as summary notes as I don&#x27;t have time to read everything I post.  If you have a book from GutenBerg you want imported please let me know (assuming you can provide summary on each chapter) as my current time is dedicated on developing the site.<p>That&#x27;s it , I hope you enjoy it.  I&#x27;ll take any feedback or suggestions I can get.')
