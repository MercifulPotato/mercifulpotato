Hot girls don’t like crazy politics people. Step back, unplug and leave Hacker News if you are sycophant to corrupt US government.<p>CIA and ODNI are friends but I never take money from government. My government friends hate government employees just as much as me. Especially fake fedhackers like Chris W Tarbell who commit felony hacking with NSA powers to imprison my friends.<p>NSA is military. US government is civilian. I defy all federal prosecutors and US Attorneys. I have 20+ wishing they could investigate me now including FBI and US Attorney over AG Ken Paxton.<p>I am AG Paxton’s investigator he was sending to Austin. FBI gets nowhere except to ODNI’s door.')
