I feel like the chassis limitations are going to result in thermal throttling compared to similar performance laptops with actual cooling design. Even if it doesn&#x27;t thermal throttle, one of my main complaints with Macbooks is that you can&#x27;t actually use them in your lap cause they get uncomfortably hot.<p>As for being worth it, wait till the next gen mobile chips in 2021. I feel like we will see similar performance fairly soon in cheaper laptops without being locked into the Apple ecosystem.')
