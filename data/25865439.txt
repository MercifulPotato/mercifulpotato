Down the road, they saw someone using the software in a way they didn&#x27;t like and decided that as they were now bigger, they could afford to get a license drawn up with their values in mind. I doubt there was a nefarious plan to use a licence for it&#x27;s reputation.<p>Now, I do think we are missing a standard license in this space - everyone seems to be writing their own, which limits those that can use them to larger projects.')
