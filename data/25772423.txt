Germans are just happier to rent. Buying often doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense financially either. It&#x27;s not much cheaper to buy than to rent and you lose a lot of flexibility. I could afford to buy a house, but I don&#x27;t want to. That would just tie up a large fraction of my wealth into one fairly risky investment and make it much harder to move when my life changes.')
