Grapes and Beef both take more water per calorie than almonds.<p>I think the confusion comes because people don&#x27;t take calorie density into account.<p>An acre of grapes produces 375 million calories and uses 2.5 Acre<i>ft of water\nAn acre of almonds produces 580 million calories and uses 3 acre</i>ft of water\nBeef is much much worse.<p>As an aside, Husks take up negligible water in terms of the trees consumption and are not a good indicator. 99% of the water used by nut trees goes into evaporation.')
