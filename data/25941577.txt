You are subject to it, not party to it.<p>Consent matters. Always and everywhere, consent matters. It doesn&#x27;t just matter in the abstract. It matters in each particular. Consenting to chip in to build a road shouldn&#x27;t be assumed to be consent to chip in to start a war.<p>There is no &quot;social contract.&quot; There&#x27;s just subjection of people to power.')
