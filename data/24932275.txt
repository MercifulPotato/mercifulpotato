For people who hope to own land but don&#x27;t already, it&#x27;s always out of reach, because they aren&#x27;t competing with their peers, and the wealthy pockets that are buying homes aren&#x27;t customers of other local businesses. It&#x27;s not quite the same as a cluster of unicorns driving up tech salaries to the point where teachers and nurses can&#x27;t compete on the market. There are no unicorns based in Vancouver. It&#x27;s hard to identify any career path, even doctor, rockstar engineer, or lawyer, that a high school graduate today could expect to follow while working in this city and be on track for home ownership when time comes to start a family. Assuming that the trend continues, that is. And if it corrects, then it&#x27;s a question of who was unlucky enough to catch the knife -- because any young locals in the ownership market are going to be highly leveraged, there&#x27;s no other way.<p>That might read like xenophobia, but actual immigrants who intend to live, work, and raise families here are generally warmly welcomed and appreciated no matter where they come from. There are some people who get their signals crossed but it&#x27;s a small minority.')
