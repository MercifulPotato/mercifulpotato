To extend the parent&#x27;s example:<p>Bob and Fred both die at age 43 (18 + 25). During their life, they both married and had children, Barbara and Felicia, respectively. While the US system is not conductive to preserving intergenerational wealth, it&#x27;s still true that the wealthier can pass on more than the less wealthy.<p>So at their age of 18, Barbra starts with 20 units of utility, and Fiona with 8. Sure, Bob has passed on much smaller percentage of their wealth than Fred, but his descendant is still better off than Fred&#x27;s.')
