The very fact that you&#x27;re going to be rolling out a tool and educating your staff in secure password management is a huge win regardless of which option you choose.<p>That said, for a team size &lt; 25 I would recommend 1Password. The product is fantastic - best in class - and they are regularly pushing improvements across all platforms.<p>For teams 50+ I would choose LastPass which has better &#x27;enterprise&#x27; features, but despite having used it at work for 7 years I still really dislike it. This could be because I&#x27;ve been using 1Password in a personal&#x2F;family capacity for about 12 years!')
