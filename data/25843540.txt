I think the crowd I interact with is probably somewhat different though, because they&#x27;re mostly crypto&#x2F;blockchain people.<p>While I have encountered a fair number of expats who moved to China and regularly visit NL&#x2F;DE&#x2F;CH, and rave about how <i>good</i> things are in China, I&#x27;ve also heard the opposite from Chinese friends who moved away.<p>The issue <i>is</i> very complex, and I don&#x27;t disagree that China is full of promise. I really would like China to succeed, and I think that co-operation is necessary to fix a lot of the problems that threaten us on a planetary and social scale (climate change, immigration, economics, etc.).<p>However, I have a very strong distaste for the CCP and really would like to see them dismantled. For this reason, I doubt I will ever visit China, simply because I&#x27;ve been very publicly vocal in this position.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear more from you â€” I think civil discourse is very important. But I also don&#x27;t have much tolerance for gaslighting, and sadly many pro-China&#x2F;CCP actors have gotten very good at that.')
