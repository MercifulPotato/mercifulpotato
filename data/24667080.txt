You can get the polymorphism by inheritance, delegation, or what-have-you. You can get runtime binding with a vtable or a name lookup.<p>The usual term for just-encapsulation is &quot;object-based&quot;. The STL is definitively not object-oriented, according to its author, Stepanov, who has said that giving the STL classes member functions was a mistake.<p>OOP is a niche technique. It has uses, sometimes. More often, a function pointer suffices.')
