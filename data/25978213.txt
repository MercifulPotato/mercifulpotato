Other things will not be blurry, and that&#x27;s a huge huge benefit.<p>This is the same trade-off as you would get without it.<p>The precision isn&#x27;t an issue, the error build-up is with rounding and it becomes particularly problematic when you have subsurfaces.<p>As I have said in another sibling comment, if you don&#x27;t want the compositor to do any scaling, then don&#x27;t enable scaling in the compositor.')
