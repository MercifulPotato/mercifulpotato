We know what happens if you don&#x27;t set a per-person limit to, at least, how much is free. But that&#x27;s rationing (?) and evil, apparently.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the terminology, and I suspect there&#x27;s a deliberate effort to ensure the idea of both government and free market supplies in tandem stays out of popular consciousness. See &quot;death panels&quot; for healthcare... if you can&#x27;t compete with government, perhaps your business just isn&#x27;t very good.<p>Alternatively, Universal Basic Income. Then, assuming your goal is to ensure people aren&#x27;t dying due to lacking basics, you&#x27;ve only got one parameter to tune and one to monitor.')
