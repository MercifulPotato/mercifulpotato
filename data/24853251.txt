Especially with a guitar, you tune a string against another string at the same time. It is easy (for me) to tune away small differences because the beat frequency is audible.<p>On this test I could not determine the 1&#x2F;64th differences, I guessed those but I got all the 1&#x2F;32nd and bigger intervals easily. I have a feeling that off-by-1&#x2F;64th would be easy to hear if the tones played at the same time.')
