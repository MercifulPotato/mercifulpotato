I found I seldom looked at it. I myself replaced Google Analytics with self-hosted Matomo for a while, but then I just dropped it altogether because I simply don’t need it. Now I <i>do</i> have server logs that I can look at, and from time to time I do (and they reveal things like Atom feeds consume the substantial majority of the traffic and page loads, which client-side JS logging would never have revealed!), but it wouldn’t bother me to have no analytics at all.')
