I find as I ratchet up the dose, or get very deeply focused on a task, the complexity of the music I listen to goes down. Morning, before the meds kick in, I like high-complexity high-energy stuff: eurobeat, electroswing, hard bop. That gives way to psytrance, then house, then techno, with high-tech minimal being my go-to when I am really firing on all cylinders. Then into lofi, downtempo, ambient, then silence for when I&#x27;m overstimulated.')
