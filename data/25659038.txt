I don&#x27;t feel magically any better or worse. I just feel the same as if caffeine wasn&#x27;t a factor. So I go back to drinking coffee and tea because I enjoy it. But I also hold that bit knowing I can always quit because I have done it. It&#x27;s not addictive in the sense of cigarettes. It&#x27;s a pleasurable taste. Caffeine has a side effect that has marginally minimal negative effects. So I don&#x27;t get why we criticize outselves for enjoying something such as beverages with caffeine.')
