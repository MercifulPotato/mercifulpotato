There&#x27;s even a Wikipedia page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_helicopter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Black_helicopter</a><p>Now, just like every other conspiracy nut, I&#x27;d like to state upfront that I&#x27;m no conspiracy theorist. However, over the years &quot;seeing black helicopters&quot; has been an insult used by some. Yet I used to see them parked out in the open at the National Guard base along I-70 in eastern Indiana like 25-30 years ago. And here we have photos published by not-disreputable source. Make of it what you will.')
