S expressions were not intended to be definitive, and you were not supposed to interpret code in code itself. McCarthy was just interested in the mathematical proof of creating a Lisp machine different from a Turing one. The practical side of that was of no interest for him and other people added this fucntionality.<p>Actually McCarthy was working on a new research domain called &#x27;Artificial Intelligence&#x27;. For that he and his team needed a programming language. They did early experiments with list processing added to Fortran. Eventually they developed their own programming language. It was designed and implemented over short time frame of a few years for an IBM computer they had.<p>McCarthy and his team were very much interested in the practical side how to implement Lisp and they learned a lot while doing so. During the first design and implementation phase &#x27;it became clear that this combination of ideas made an elegant mathematical system as well as a practical programming language&#x27; (McCarthy, History of Lisp, 1979).<p>The new programming language was thought to be used to implement software like the proposed &#x27;Advice Talker&#x27; (McCarthy, 1959).<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-formal.stanford.edu&#x2F;jmc&#x2F;mcc59.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-formal.stanford.edu&#x2F;jmc&#x2F;mcc59.pdf</a><p>&gt; For production you need standards that are simplified<p>Quasi standards for Lisp were early the Lisp 1.5 language (the language description was published as a book). Then actual work started on a new language standard, supposed to be Lisp 2. That work failed eventually. In the 80s&#x2F;90s Common Lisp was defined as a standard. Further standards of Lisp languages were IEEE Scheme and ISLisp (an ISO standard).<p>&gt; For production you need standards that are simplified<p>See the extensive standards of Ada, C++ and Java EE, ...<p>C++ is a very complex language standard, even with meta-programming features: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template_metaprogramming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template_metaprogramming</a>')
