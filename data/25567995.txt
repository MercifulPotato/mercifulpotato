A very minor comment:<p>&gt;So, thereâ€™s a total of three types of vectors in NumPy: 1D arrays, 2D row vectors, and 2D column vectors.<p>I think you can have &#x27;vectors&#x27; of arbitrarily high dimension, by adding empty axes, or doing, say,  .reshape(-1, 1, 1, 1).<p>I would also tie this point with the rule for broadcasting that dimensions which do not match need to have a value of one.
