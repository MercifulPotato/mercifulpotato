Unfortunately the biggest consumer tech giants (Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft etc) have turned into 1 giant monopoly (since they collude illegally, as numerous news leaks have shown).<p>The only way to truly protect the rights of the individual would be for the government to step in at this moment to put big tech in it&#x27;s place. Unfortunately I have very little confidence that it&#x27;d actually happen. Esp since the newly elected government in the US seems firmly on the side of big tech (political contributions and what not).<p>Failing government intervention, I fear a technological dystopia is not too far away in the future, if not already here. The other alternative ofc would be for individuals to take back control by moving out of these platforms towards their own personal websites with custom email and RSS feeds.')
