Yet a landlord isn&#x27;t allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.<p>Even if the landlord insists on a contract abrogating this, it&#x27;s unenforceable. Policy restricts this because 1) landlords generally have very high negotiation power, and 2) tenants rarely read the fine print. It seems to me that both conditions are approximately true for the major cloud providers.<p>If you agree with tenant eviction protections, then you should probably support similar eviction protections for cloud computing. AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Gmail&#x2F;iCloud could ban you as a customer, but only with 90 days notice. Otherwise, immediate eviction could only occur if it involved legally codified egregious behavior,  and would require a court judgement.<p>I think this would eliminate nightmare scenarios where somebody suddenly finds themselves locked out of their Google Drive and Gmail for some algorithmic mishap. But it would put very little operating burden on the cloud providers.')
