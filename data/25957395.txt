He has a book coming out about Oumuamua. I will probably buy the book because Loeb is apparently brilliant. His evaluation of Oumuamua is very interesting.<p>BUT the data about Oumuamua is really really tiny. The science of interstellar objects is nascent. Other than to say &quot;If it is a natural object it is super-strange&quot; I am not sure what else there is to say.<p>In the interview he was articulating theories about it being a cosmic &quot;buoy.&quot; So I am anticipating a couple chapters of solid science followed by a lot of speculation, even if it is highly informed speculation.')
