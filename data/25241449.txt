Maybe insisted on acquiring the Growl company? I don&#x27;t think Apple should have just avoided building Notification Center, since that&#x27;s a big net benefit for everyone.<p>If an acquisition is rejected&#x2F;infeasible&#x2F;not applicable&#x2F;etc, then I&#x27;m not clear on the right thing to do. Acquisition might have been possible with Growl, but for some other cases there&#x27;s not even a company to acquire. Have any other big platforms done this well?<p>(Apple&#x27;s acquisition of Workflow which became Shortcuts seems like a case where they did this well)')
