I find it interesting that the paper was published before Face ID was announced, since in retrospect it&#x27;s clear that&#x27;s what they were working on.<p>That paper also mentions something that has still not found its way into an Apple product: they posed 3D models of hands and then degraded them to appear as depth maps, with jagged edges, artifacts, and occlusions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;gan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;machinelearning.apple.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;gan</a>')
