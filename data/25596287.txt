You typed this, not me.<p>&gt;They are afraid of looking like an idiot. If they ride with me I look really cool with a slick bike and low profile gear, while they are riding a walmart bike in baggy shorts with a dumb helmet, while visible to hundreds of people in cars.<p>How exactly did I misinterpret that? You think you look cool and knowledgeable and that&#x27;s why no one wants to ride with you. You don&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s probably not why they won&#x27;t ride with you.<p>&gt;The difference is looking like you know what you&#x27;re doing, and looking like you have no idea what you&#x27;re doing.<p>People who spend gobs of monet on all of that gear don&#x27;t look like they know what they&#x27;re doing; they look like middle aged men and women cosplaying people who knows what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s unnecessary and nothing more than a fashion statement.<p>I think it&#x27;s you who misunderstands how most of the world views your spandex. And I have no &quot;dislike for bikers&quot;; I dislike the snotty attitude some of them have about their dumb, pointless, overpriced gear that, uh... makes them slightly faster while riding down Main street I guess? When I play baseball with my 7 year old I don&#x27;t feel the urge to throw on cleats and eye black.')
