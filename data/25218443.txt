This is the error when doing anything with chrome.storage.sync:<p><pre><code>  Error: The storage API will not work with a temporary addon ID. Please add an explicit addon ID to your manifest. For more information see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzil.la&#x2F;1323228.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an error, not a warning, and set&#x2F;get definitely don&#x27;t work.<p>If I replace all storage.sync invocations with storage.local then it&#x27;s okay, not error&#x2F;warning, and setting&#x2F;getting seems to work.<p>So the problem is limited to storage.sync, but it&#x27;s not just a warning.<p>Edit: now that I googled the problem again, it seems adding an explicit addon ID according to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extensionworkshop.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;develop&#x2F;extensions-and-the-add-on-id&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extensionworkshop.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;develop&#x2F;extensio...</a> should work. I don&#x27;t recall what I did back then, but I definitely did quite a few things to no avail.')
