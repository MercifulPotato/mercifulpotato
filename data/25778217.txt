Item(by='lordnacho', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610641376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772849, text='&gt; Honestly I would rather ban videogames. I have seen many smart, hard working people whose lives have been ruined by videogames. So much wasted potential.<p>Me too, I&#x27;ve also seen a lot of life wasted on games. Some of it my own!<p>But isn&#x27;t this much the same line of reasoning as with drugs? Some people just can&#x27;t control it. I&#x27;m all for adults being adults and making adult choices. But clearly there&#x27;s people who can&#x27;t deal with games as well as drugs.<p>Where I grew up, you can get weed without a problem. I just somehow never thought it was worth the money, and though I had a few friends who&#x27;d buy they never got into any trouble with it.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s also a function of your environment what you find destructive. Like many kids, I grew up in the middle class where games would eat more time than drugs. I wonder if you are the same? There are others who grew up much more exposed to drugs and drug addiction, who maybe didn&#x27;t have a computer to waste time on.<p>I&#x27;m also in favour of legalization, but mainly for practical reasons. We&#x27;ve tried making hard drugs illegal, and people aren&#x27;t satisfied. Maybe try a different approach and see if there&#x27;s a better balance there.<p>My main issue with it is that I don&#x27;t really want to give the drug lords a head start on a business that we want non-criminals to run, but that&#x27;s something else to thing about.')
