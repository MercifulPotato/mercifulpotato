There&#x27;s a slippery slope here.<p>Just because &quot;humanity, including giant healthcare conglomerates who stood to profit came together to fast track vaccines against a deadly global pandemic&quot; it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;regulation of the vaccine and drug industry is pointless.&quot;<p>If the FDA were to relax its standards across the board due to this one success in the face of an anomaly, you&#x27;d better believe drug manufacturers would be fast tracking dangerous drugs.<p>Heck even in the current regulatory environment dangerous products make it through.
