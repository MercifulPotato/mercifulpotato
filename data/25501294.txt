But the sentence approach requires a lot of arranging pieces of paper and remembering which words you are working on.<p>So I developed 02books for my family and decided to share.<p>You can use it (no account required!) here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;02books.app&#x2F;<p>Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sofignatova&#x2F;02books<p>Thanks for letting me share - this my first real open source project!<p>Regards,\nSofya')
