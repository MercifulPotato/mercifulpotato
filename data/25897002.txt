They are a tiny part of the photolithography equipment sub-sector, but the present moment is marked by overwhelming demand for semiconductors for automotive applications, and those chips aren&#x27;t running on leading-edge nodes like TSMC 5nm or Intel 10nm (there&#x27;s no reason for them to). If I were the CEO of a global automaker, I&#x27;d be buying legacy (22nm and older) foundry equipment in order to make chips in-house because the eventual product mix transition (ICE vs EV) means I&#x27;m going to need more custom semiconductors than ever before.<p>The semiconductor industry is so complex that it depends upon companies in many nations, including Japan. No one nation owns the semiconductor lifecycle, but each part of the process is dominated (but not entirely owned) by one nation. Japan dominates wafer production. One company in the Netherlands dominates photolithography equipment. The United States dominates processor design. China dominates device assembly. Korea dominates NAND. Taiwan dominates foundry. Companies in all of these places are laying out a bunch of CapEx so clearly there&#x27;s an anticipation of a rising tide that lifts all boats, rather than a rejiggering of market share that hurts one economy (forgetting China for a second) while helping another.')
