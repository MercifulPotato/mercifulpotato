Item(by='geerlingguy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604356576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974280, text='tl;dr - The Pi 400 can take a 2.2 GHz (2200 MHz) overclock, whereas older Pi 4s could only go up to a maximum of 2.147 GHz (at least for now—that may just be a firmware limitation).<p>And the surprising result (for me) was that even after a couple hours of stress-testing the CPU, it didn&#x27;t even come close to overheating, and the top surface stayed below 34°C, so it didn&#x27;t turn into a little space heater for my fingers.<p>Anyways, I thought I&#x27;d add some data regarding the overclock, performance, thermals, and power consumption since a lot of people today have been asking about them.')
