Item(by='cle', descendants=None, kids=[25098828], score=None, time=1605401057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095528, text='&gt; You should read it &quot;do you trust Apple is acting in your best interests OVER any random app you might install or website you visit?&quot;.<p>For much of the software I use, the answer is no.  I don&#x27;t trust that Apple is acting in my best interests over GNU software, for example, not by a long shot.  I don&#x27;t even trust that I could <i>understand</i> if Apple is acting in my interests, because massive corporations like Apple have unparalleled resources they can use to obfuscate their intentions.<p>Is our best shot at trusting one another to delegate that trust to a notoriously non-transparent corporation with a laundry list of conflicts of interest, obfuscated closed-source software, and that&#x27;s operated out of a country well-known for surveilling its citizens and citizens of other countries?<p>Personally I&#x27;m not anywhere near ready to accept that <i>that&#x27;s</i> the best we can do, nor that it&#x27;s something that we even should do.')
