Then, when we need to actually care for our families, we outsource that to the private sector, so that other atomic worker units can do the job for us. We have to do this, because nobody has time to care for our parents; we all have to work!<p>What did we get for doing this? What life improvements were gained?<p>The collective grief of the millions of people who have died alone is not worth any of this.')
