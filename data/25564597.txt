One benefit (with respect to the CPU) of pure functions is that they can be cached because you know you&#x27;ll get the same result for each call (of course, this impacts memory), which you can&#x27;t guarantee with impure functions. But that&#x27;s a tradeoff of memory for time. I&#x27;ve never seen anyone claim there&#x27;s <i>no</i> cost to a pure function.')
