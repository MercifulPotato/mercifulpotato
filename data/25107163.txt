If you don&#x27;t value democracy, reason, liberty and equality, then what do you value?<p>I listed a lot of known alternatives, you could value ultranationalism with strict traditional societal and economic rule like fascists do, or you could value white supremacy and rule over other races like nazis, or you could value biblical rule of Christian interpretation like theocrats, etc.<p>Now you seem to say, no it&#x27;s none of the many alternatives I listed, okay, but what is it?<p>And yes, I actually can&#x27;t imagine what else you could be than one of the many non-liberal alternative I listed.<p>&gt; You simply cannot imagine that someone could be a non-liberal without being evil<p>That&#x27;s because it is hard for me to think that someone who doesn&#x27;t value democracy, doesn&#x27;t value reason, doesn&#x27;t value liberty, doesn&#x27;t value equality, will be willing to accept that I live my life as I please, with a fair chance at opportunity, riches, power, and happyness. So it seems anyone without those value will be  trying to have authority and rule over me one way or another, and not with my best interest at heart. It seems natural to consider evil someone whose likely to do you wrong.<p>&gt; By conservative here i meant really anyone who is not 100% onboard with democratic party doctrine, which is enough to be ostracized in SV today<p>So by conservative, you mean a republican voter? Why not say republican party voter or something super clear and unambiguous then? Why does the article say &quot;conservative&quot; ? Is it not because republican are conservative? And now I&#x27;m back at my original confusion, what kind of conservative is the republican party? Liberal conservative? Or anti-liberal?<p>I find the narrative against liberalism dangerous. Liberalism is what the western democracies, including the US are based on, and it&#x27;s what made them prosper and a great place to live. So am I suppose to believe there is a strong anti-liberal movement in the US? Pushing for a return to nazism, facism, monarchies, theocracies, oligarchies, feudalism, etc. ? If not, it only takes people to say, hey woa, hold on, you got.it all wrong, we&#x27;re full on liberal, just conservative as in my second definition above. But the fact that even when I ask people don&#x27;t say that, but seem to circle around and evade the question, makes me feel it might be the former.')
