Multiple times. And we&#x27;ve listened to you here. Now fuck off.<p>What you&#x27;re really saying is that there is election fraud and Biden&#x27;s win is illegitimate. Which is just another way of saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in democracy, I&#x27;m an authoritarian and I&#x27;m going to go out and undermine democracy because I want America to be an authoritarian state.&quot;<p>You should be banned from HN and I think that anyone who doesn&#x27;t believe that the election was legitimate should be banned from the HN community.<p>You&#x27;re full of shit and all this pseudo-philosophical pseudo-analytical pseudo-objective cant you&#x27;re spewing is nonsense.<p>You&#x27;re acting exactly like one of those crypto-racists who knows that their true belief would be deemed unpalatable or unacceptable by the community so they&#x27;ll blow as much smoke around as possible without ever stepping out to say what they&#x27;re actually driving towards.')
