But the road to hell (a society full of dangerously misinformed citizens) is also paved with good intentions (trying to keep the internet free of censorship).<p>I guess my point is that none of this is actually easy to navigate. Anyone saying &quot;censor the story, it&#x27;s no big deal&quot; is missing the bigger picture. But IMO, so is anyone saying &quot;disinformation is not a problem, it shouldn&#x27;t be tackled&quot;.')
