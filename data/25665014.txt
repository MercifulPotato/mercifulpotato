It’s an expression of surprise, and feedback that you really don’t seem to be making a clear point.<p>You reduced my original comment to “everyone is biased, this is not a deep insight”.<p>I thought you might have something deeper to add, so I was surprised not to see it.<p>“It&#x27;s true in the sense that you cannot impugn a particular part of the spectrum for the actions of individuals because there is no way to reliably quantify dishonesty much less attribute its distribution across a poorly defined political continuum.”<p>This seems like a re-statement of the original comment I made in response to the post about FOX.
