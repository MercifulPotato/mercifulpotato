Item(by='mqus', descendants=None, kids=[24890932], score=None, time=1603663518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887670, text='&gt; making cameras illegal because people take photos and record videos of copyrighted material.<p>It&#x27;s not like there are no better alternatives. Instead of making it illegal, just setup a fee and a distribution scheme.<p>In Germany, we do pay some additional fee (0.5â‚¬?) on usb-sticks, printers and hard drives, etc, because those things <i>could</i> be used to copy copyrighted material. These fees go directly to associations that represent copyright holders, like GEMA ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GEMA_(German_organization)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;GEMA_(German_organization)</a> ). This happens since forever.<p>So there is already precedent for blanket-regulation of and compensation for possible use&#x2F;misuse of copyrighted material. In fact, this is what some people proposed as a kind of reasonable alternative to the Upload filters of the EU Copyright directive (&quot;Article 13&quot; and so on)<p>I&#x27;m noticing that this is not really a coherent argument, more of a braindump, sorry.')
