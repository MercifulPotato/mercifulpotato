Item(by='Quarrelsome', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607715072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389592, text='&gt; It&#x27;s weird how normalized censorship has become in just one year.<p>I feel like its people trying to deal with the discord of this new breed of politicians that brazenly lie so often that its impossible to know what&#x27;s real anymore.<p>Politicians used to be masters of selective information and leaving key information out while still not technically lying. Now they say whatever the fuck they want with scant attention to reality and facts. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing this IMO because the amount of attention they receive means that they strongly impact the narrative.<p>As a non-US example; Boris Johnson yesterday stated that it was &quot;very likely&quot; that Britain will leave the EU without a deal, despite coming to power on an election campaign where he stated he had &quot;an oven ready deal with the EU&quot;. If you were taking the British government&#x27;s word at faith then yesterday&#x27;s statement would have been a massive shock to you because for four years no government minister has stated that this outcome will happen.')
