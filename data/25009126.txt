Item(by='Joker_vD', descendants=None, kids=[25009222], score=None, time=1604682248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008519, text='&gt; I am not sure why you brought up my &quot;Value&quot; definition, that was a little random.<p>Because your definition of &quot;Value&quot; is uncontroversial and customary, unlike your definition of &quot;linear graph&quot;--I have met it in your article for the first time. Granted, my knowledge is limited but that&#x27;s my point exactly: if you bother to introduce the most basic concepts that your readers are most likely already accustomed with, then also please introduce the advanced concepts that you&#x27;re about to discuss. If you feel that it makes the article too long, maybe consider removing the trivial definitions of the basic concepts, but not the other way around.<p>I don&#x27;t want to come off sounding aggressive or rude, and in fact I&#x27;ve read some other articles on your site with great interest, but this particular one leaves a bit of a taste of a maths article written by a crackpot: it starts with talking about what is a number, what is addition, talks about how numbers can also be multiplied and divided, a-a-a-and then in a blink of an eye it goes into very remoted areas of the number theory which may not actually exist (at least Googling them doesn&#x27;t show anything relevant).<p>In fact, googling &quot;linear hierarchy&quot; suggests that it&#x27;s a term from biology, and it doesn&#x27;t describe a graph or a tree at all: &quot;In a linear hierarchy, there is one individual who dominates all the other group members, a second who dominates all but the top individual, and so on, down to the last individual who dominates no one&quot; (Ivan D. Chase, Kristine Seitz, &quot;Aggression&quot;, in Advances in Genetics, 2011). So &quot;linear hierarchy&quot; is apparently a linear (or &quot;total&quot;, as it&#x27;s also called) order, and it&#x27;s actually consistent with the customary definition of &quot;linear data structure&quot;: the one that arranges it&#x27;s elements in a sequence, so arrays and linked lists (in fact, those used to be called &quot;linear lists&quot;, see Wirth&#x27;s &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot; from the seventies) are linear data structures, but trees and graphs are not.<p>To sum it: your usage of the term &quot;linear&quot; seems to be novel, and so it&#x27;s confusing for someone who hasn&#x27;t met it already, and arguably most of the readers haven&#x27;t, maybe define it, even at the expense of defining what a &quot;value&quot; or an &quot;agent&quot; is? Those words you use in their customary senses.')
