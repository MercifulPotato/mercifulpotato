After billions of years, I would expect all planets be attached (gravitationally) to a star, shouldn&#x27;t they?<p>&gt; Indeed, a few years ago, Polish astronomers from the OGLE team from the Astronomical Observatory of the University of Warsaw provided the first evidence for the existence of such planets in the Milky Way.<p>Wait. Evidence is not the theory. Did they predict this or discover it?')
