Trump&#x27;s team is &quot;intentionally misleading the public about what happened at State Farm Arena on election night,&quot; Sterling said. &quot;These aren&#x27;t magical ballots.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re wrong. The accusations are wrong. Our judges, some Trump appointees, said the accusations are baseless. Stop buying into bullshit because reality is uncomfortable.')
