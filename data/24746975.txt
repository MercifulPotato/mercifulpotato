Just imagine if people had to rewrite all that numerical computation for every new language.<p>Leaving some performance critical stuff in C is okay. We can expose them to a variety of languages then.<p>&gt; away from Theano [...] I had to switch from Tensorflow 1 to Tensorflow 2<p>I feel you. But I think this has more to do with Google&#x27;s deprecation culture. TF1 was nice for its time, but I will never adopt TF2, as they will drop it any time as well. I have higher hopes for PyTorch though.')
