I&#x27;d also love to use this to trigger events (e.g. turning off lights when everyone leaves, turning them on when anyone gets home).<p>Regarding payment: I would get value from this, but primarily in conjunction with a higher-level service built atop it (providing features such as those mentioned above), and I&#x27;d want to pay for the higher-level service with this integrated, rather than paying for the building block. (That&#x27;d mean either you&#x27;re providing the higher-level service and getting paid directly, or providing the building block and getting paid by the higher-level service rather than by the end user.)')
