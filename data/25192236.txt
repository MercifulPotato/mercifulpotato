If you don&#x27;t do that, not only you will eventually get crashes and leaks and overflows, but you also miss the point of programming in C in the first place.<p>C is fast, but C is not fast because it overclocks your CPU or whatever magic you can think of. An good reason why is is fast is that it gives you tight control over your memory. You can reuse buffers, size them precisely, allocate them exactly when you need them and free them when you are finished, nothing funny happening behind your back.  It generally results in lower memory usage, better use of cache and therefore better performance.<p>If you don&#x27;t manage your memory precisely, then sure, C is probably not the language for you.')
