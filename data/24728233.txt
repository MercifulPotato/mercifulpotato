This plastic road is reported to be durable and pothole free (Subramaniam 2016; Manju, Sathya, &amp; Sheema 2017). Today, there is more than 33,000 km of plastic road in India with most of them being rural roads and a small number in cities such as Chennai and Mumbai (Subramaniam 2016).</i><p>...<p><i>The waste plastic content for dense-graded and open-graded mixes is set at 6-8% of the mass of the bitumen (Sharp et al. 2017).</i><p>Putting that 6-8% in perspective, Australia produces about 3 .5 million tons of plastic waste a year, and uses 800,000 tons of bitumen.  So only about 1% could be recycled at the 6-8% level.<p>Perhaps an even bigger downer is:<p><i>However, the concern associated with plastics breaking down into microplastics might create another problem to the environment. Subramaniam (2016) quoted a Professor of Plant and Soil Ecology at Freie Universität Berlin, ‘once in the soil, these particles may persist, accumulate and eventually reach levels that can affect the functioning and biodiversity of the soil’.</i>')
