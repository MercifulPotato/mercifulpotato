Facebook controls the juxtaposition of ads with content, and with each other. This can reinforce the power of the individual ads, or attenuate it. In this case, it&#x27;s pretty clearly creating a &quot;caravan&quot; of ads because that&#x27;s more effective than letting each stand alone.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work at Facebook, but I was in storage. It gave me no particular insight into how the ad system works. This is just based on general knowledge of how human psychology and ML work.')
