Item(by='btilly', descendants=None, kids=[24982267], score=None, time=1604425421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976150, text='Not so clear.<p>If you go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nces.ed.gov&#x2F;pubs2014&#x2F;2014008.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nces.ed.gov&#x2F;pubs2014&#x2F;2014008.pdf</a> for a more detailed look at the data, you&#x27;ll find that the fraction of adults world-wide who score at level 4&#x2F;5 is the same as the USA.  In age breakdowns, more US 55-65 year olds are at that top literacy bracket, and in every other age cohort is worse.<p>Therefore there is no reason to believe that the US at the level 5 is any different than the global average.  And there is reason to suspect that the USA is getting worse over time.<p>Incidentally I was merely stating it as data and didn&#x27;t blame this on a glaring education problem here.  That would be a much longer discussion.')
