Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604539579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24990146, text='&gt; leaving a scattered few credit unions and smaller banks around, which will be extra inconvenient when you travel and they absolutely will not offer the same range of credit cards with good rewards programs.<p>A lot of credit unions are members of the CO-OP program, which gives you access to more ATMs than any of the big banks (possibly more than all of the <i>combined</i>). At least for travel within the US, being part of that CO-OP credit union is much more convenient than BoA and their ilk.<p>I just checked: 50 BoA ATMs within 20 miles of me. Over 100 within the CO-OP network. This is in a decent sized metro area.<p>I just checked my small undergrad town: 3 in the city, and 2 in the adjacent city. BoA has only 1 - and only in the adjacent city.<p>In my experience, it&#x27;s always been able to find a Co-Op ATM than a BoA one.<p>Others complained about poor services, web sites, etc. I suppose that can be true, but it isn&#x27;t for mine. In fact, I had to ditch one of the national banks because it couldn&#x27;t provide simple features that my local credit union does - stuff like limiting which of my checking accounts is tied to my ATM card - <i>without</i> limiting it in their online site. So if I tied my ATM card to only one account, then when I logged in to the account&#x27;s site, it would not let me transfer money between the accounts that are not on the ATM (although it would let me view transactions, etc).<p>I&#x27;ve also used my debit card in other countries. It worked just like any other card would (I did have to inform them in advance so it wouldn&#x27;t trip up fraud detection).<p>&gt; and they absolutely will not offer the same range of credit cards with good rewards programs.<p>You do not need to have a bank account with Chase and other companies to get good credit cards with rewards programs.')
