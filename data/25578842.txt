I&#x27;ve gotten sick. That&#x27;s why I did write to camp the night before near the trailhead, at 9,000&#x2F;10,000, and to be okay with NOT going over the pass on day one. Maybe that&#x27;s enough to acclimate, maybe not. If you feel terrible when you wake up for day one, don&#x27;t hike, go into Bishop and get a steak at the Bowling Alley.  If you feel terrible while hiking on day one, turnaround. But for most people, probably, with that one night&#x27;s sleep at altitude the day before the hike and a slow first day, they will be okay.<p>We&#x27;re talking pretty much about the same altitude situation as going to a ski resort in Colorado.<p>The thing is, I want even the beginner to experience spectacular mountain scenery so in the USA, that usually means hiking at 10,000, above the tree line.')
