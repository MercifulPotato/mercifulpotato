I&#x27;ve now had to advise multiple people who couldn&#x27;t turn on their WiFi in Windows (the switch just did nothing). I also couldn&#x27;t fix that without a reinstall (not for a lack of trying). My family iMac refuses to import photos from an iPhone into Photos, failing the transfer silently. I have no idea how I&#x27;d even go about fixing that besides calling Apple and forcing them to fix it.<p>No man gets to deal with all of the possible computer problems, thankfully. But in my experience, most Linux problems have been fixable and I managed to fix them, while more closed OSs have left me stumped many times. I no longer believe that a computer can work without problems, so my priority is making sure that <i>when</i> problems appear, I can diagnose them and fix them easily.')
