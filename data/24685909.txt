You click &quot;buy now&quot;, but somewhere in the small print it says &quot;oh but you&#x27;re not really <i>buying</i> buying it though&quot;. That should be illegal. In fact, pretty sure it <i>is</i> illegal.<p>Chances are, if someone wanted to spend the thousands if not millions of dollars&#x2F;euros&#x2F;pesos&#x2F;whatever to actually take legal action to demand the content they paid for, it&#x27;s not unlikely that the decision would fall along the lines of &quot;You can&#x27;t just effectively sell something and claim you didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> sell it&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like the &quot;It&#x27;s not monetization I swear, they&#x27;re just donating and we&#x27;re giving them something back to show our gratitude&quot; bullshit people pull with Arma 3 servers. Everyone sees through it, but it works as long as nobody has a real interest in actually stopping it.')
