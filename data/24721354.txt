Our RPC services use the certs to encrypt their traffic amongst each other, and also to enforce RBAC (since the certs are traceable, via vault, to a service or individual&#x27;s identity).<p>&quot;Dynamic&quot; secrets imply that rotation is automated and frequent, and that there are no &quot;blessed&quot; certs, but rather that all certs&#x2F;keys are generated in exchange for a successful identity assertion.<p>For example, if I can prove that I am LDAP user gen220, who belongs to group db-x-developer, I have earned the right to request a credential for connecting to db-x, which expires some arbitrary time before my identity-assertion expires.')
