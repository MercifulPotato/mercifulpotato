But that mutation also applies to its own reproductive mechanisms, like RNA polymerase, which degrades in the presence of evolutionary pressure from the immune system against the attachment proteins, so the latter strains become dormant because they lose reproductive integrity. It then takes conditions lacking an immune response to evolve back to a working polymerase and attachment head.<p>I think it is interesting to note that the immune system itself is largely responsible for spreading most RNA viruses: inflammation, coughing, sneezing etc. Is this us evolving population-level (probably more like Dunbar number than 8B) defense in response to the general threat of viruses, or is it a weakness that each individual virus evolves to exploit. It seems to me that this involuntary spreading behavior is much more pronounced in humans than other mammals.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scopeblog.stanford.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-coronaviruses-infect-us-how-infectious-viruses-created-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scopeblog.stanford.edu&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-coronaviruses-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mbio.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;2&#x2F;5&#x2F;e00150-11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mbio.asm.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;2&#x2F;5&#x2F;e00150-11</a>')
