There&#x27;s also no other countries which have seriously tried to get covid to 0 except some island nations - which is interesting.<p>I&#x27;m convinced the most important difference is policy, but I wonder if there might be some psychological effect of living on an island all by yourself which makes you think &quot;Well, can we just pretend the rest of the world doesn&#x27;t exist?&quot;. Those thoughts might be harder to think in Europe.<p>&gt; Itâ€™s basically like saying the state of New York could have been able to drive COVID down to zero while other states had it exploding.<p>I think Canada could drive covid down to zero by closing the US border, then enforcing strict lockdowns. (And apparently they <i>have</i> closed the border to the US.) I think the US or the UK could do the same if they wanted at a national level. Well, at least in theory. I acknowledge it would be much more difficult to do the same in a small european nation. At least, it would be difficult to do it alone.')
