Svelte is a cool project, and the discussion RE buildtime vs runtime raise some great questions RE trade-offs. What I would say is that neither project would be the right choice for every use case. Svelte is very feature rich and provides more of a “batteries included” framework approach, whereas Synergy has a much smaller feature set and scope which leaves flexibility and choices in other areas. In this sense, Synergy is easier to compare  feature-by-feature with a library of smaller scope such as Preact.')
