Some will flat out tell you &quot;i can&#x27;t beat that price, go for it&quot; or they won&#x27;t even bother responding to calls or emails.<p>When you have other options, it changes the power dynamic of the relationship and gives you a ton of leverage. The dealership needs you to purchase the vehicle and that can&#x27;t happen if you walk away.')
