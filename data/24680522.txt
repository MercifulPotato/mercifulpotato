It is not the <i>content</i> DNS servers that are causing the scaling problems, it is the <i>proxy</i> DNS servers, and the DNS clients and applications softwares that drive them.<p>* <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdebp.uk.&#x2F;FGA&#x2F;dns-server-roles.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;jdebp.uk.&#x2F;FGA&#x2F;dns-server-roles.html</a><p>The change that needs to happen is the thing that most people nowadays tell one <i>first</i>, that this paper in contrast leaves all of the way to the end: run your own content DNS server(s) for the root, on your own LAN or Intranet.  It&#x27;s fairly simple to do, and it&#x27;s an idea that has been around for over two decades, now.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24277855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24277855</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19526108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19526108</a><p>* <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;dnsroot.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;dnsroot.html</a> (dates back to 2001)<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24280536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24280536</a> et al.<p>It takes a long time in the DNS world for such grassroots ideas to percolate to the level that they get circulated by corporate officers.  This article is, for example, still propounding that every resolving proxy DNS server works like ISC&#x27;s BIND, and has a &quot;priming query&quot;.  This is untrue in reality, and is one of the differences between BIND and some of the softwares (e.g. dnscache and MaraDNS) that came along to replace it a couple of decades ago.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maradns.samiam.org&#x2F;faq.html#roothints" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maradns.samiam.org&#x2F;faq.html#roothints</a><p>Similarly the argument that Google should use a subdomain, presented in this article without any counterpoint at all, has long since been countered by pointing out that this makes the malicious actors&#x27; lives easier; as conditional forwarding and split-horizon DNS service, which are well-known things, would then make it easier to fool Google Chrome.  And there have been other counterarguments made, <i>years</i> ago.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=3609498" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=3609498</a> (yes, 2012)')
