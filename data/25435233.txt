Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608066238, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434904, text='<i>&gt; there are plenty of others</i><p>Historically, our society has drawn a distinction between force (things like direct threats of violence or incarceration), which makes things done under such conditions involuntary, and things that are addictive but which people still voluntarily choose to do.<p>In some cases, such as smoking, we have ended up still imposing penalties on companies that purvey such products, but the basis for such penalties has not been the addictiveness of the thing, but the physical harms it causes, such as lung cancer. Addictive things that do not cause harms of the same sort, such as slot machines, have not been treated the same.<p>IMO that distinction is a good one: addiction does have a voluntary aspect that is not present in cases of simple threat by force. Treating addictions as though they simply override the agency of the person is not, IMO, a good idea. And I think a similar distinction can, and should, be drawn between simple threat by force and &quot;persuasive technologies&quot;; there is a voluntary aspect to the latter--people have to choose to believe what they are being told--just as there is with addiction.<p>Of course we also draw a distinction between acceptable persuasion and fraud or manipulation, which are unacceptable and punishable. That distinction is also a good one, and I think it can help to deal with &quot;persuasive technologies&quot; in a reasonable way.')
