Programmers employed by a business are in charge of automating repetitive tasks, not performing them (the classic measure of productivity).<p>I perform UX research on APIs. Here, we standardize the &quot;output unit&quot; and therefore can get a better idea of a developer&#x27;s productivity. Every developer performs the same task, so we can simply measure time spent.<p>There will never be an ethical solution to measure developer productivity during the workday; this isn&#x27;t Ford&#x27;s assembly line.')
