And I believe in the US I would be convicted for computer crime.<p>Isn&#x27;t it the same here? If Youtube&#x27;s anti-circumvention tech <i>whatever it is that DMCA compliant refers to</i> is so weak that source code how to circumvent it is in the wild for years and Youtube does nothing to address it, isn&#x27;t it theirs fault? :shrug:<p>We&#x27;re both IANALs, but it is interesting to put it into perspective that the same sentences that makes laws mean something totally different in practice on two sides of the globe due to cultural differences and&#x2F;or origins of given laws.')
