Plenty of time to try and do a proper investigation. But instead they sat on it.

And the journalists at NY Post refused to put their name in the byline. If I worked at CNN, and saw that right leaning orgs were staying away from it, maybe skepticism is warranted. And keep in mind, they are refusing to release copies of the source material to other journalists. So no one other than the NY Post has the ability to authenticate (even fox business can&#x27;t get access[1]).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;media&#x2F;523087-giuliani-goes-off-on-fox-business-host-after-she-compares-him-to" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;homenews&#x2F;media&#x2F;523087-giuliani-goes-off-...</a>')
