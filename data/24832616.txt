Recognize that gig jobs are going to become more of a thing in various ways, and set up state sponsored benefit plans for gig workers. Start a mini UBI that covers 4 weeks PTO at the median California wage, open up medicaid eligibility, etc. If the problem is these people don&#x27;t have benefits, give them the benefits. Trying to force Uber et al to book these people as employees is just propagating the issue in the first place.')
