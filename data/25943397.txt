I can&#x27;t decide which of these three languages would be best suited for it. Does anybody have experience with any of them? What did you like? What did you not? What should I use?<p>The students are a bunch of talented high-schoolers, however they only picked up programming this September. That means good tooling and a friendly compiler are paramount, because they&#x27;ll often be leaning on both.<p>I don&#x27;t have experience with any of the languages, but I write Haskell and Typescript for living, so I should be able pick these up rather quickly. Because I know Haskell so well, I lean towards PureScript, but I don&#x27;t want to base my decision only on this.')
