Further, to avoid replay attacks it must include the current time in the message it signs. NTP is used by macOS to determine the current time, so as to verify the signature provided by the keyboard.<p>So, if NTP is slow to respond or time out, you are stuck waiting for  your Mac to verify your keyboard&#x27;s signature.')
