It&#x27;s a constant situation of scrolling down localisation dropdowns triyng to find out if my locale or language, is &#x27;English (UK)&#x27; or &#x27;British&#x27; or &#x27;Great Britain&#x27; or &#x27;United Kingdom&#x27;[1], or simply not even there with just &#x27;English&#x27; listed (which of course is US English). Then to add more salt to the wound, I&#x27;ll find a dropdown that is in Alphabetical order, <i>except for</i> &#x27;United States&#x27; which for some reason is pinned to the top.<p>Because we Brits share a language with the US, and because most software is written by americans, or by people who learnt american english as a second language, our language is being steadily eroded. If it were any other language being abused, there would be campaigns to stop it happening.<p>---<p>[1] No, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom are not the same, and are therefore not interchangable.')
