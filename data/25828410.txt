If you&#x27;re waiting for the perfect model, you&#x27;ll never do anything, which brings to mind another adage, adapted: strong models, weakly held. That is to say, do the best with what you&#x27;ve got and don&#x27;t be afraid to change once you find a better model, but <i>always</i> remember that they are models with limits.<p>The fine article linked here about fungi I applaud as improving our models.')
