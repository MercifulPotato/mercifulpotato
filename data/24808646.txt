It it&#x27;s the classic &quot;not-invented-here&quot; syndrome. Noone wants to borrow the solutions of another country, or even a province or city within Canada!<p>Always finding some rationale to do it their own way, or do more local (inferior) studies to tick a box. Then hire a bunch of inexperienced engineers to build something that they have never done, and get x10 expensive, and 10x worse results.<p>All under a flag that it will create local jobs.<p>Imagine that&#x27;s how tech would work? We want to be build a complex micro-service system, that we have never built, and we are only going to hire talent from within the distance of 10 km, to &quot;create jobs&quot;. How would that work out?')
