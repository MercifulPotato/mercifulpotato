What products would those be? Glancing around, I&#x27;ve got mice, trackballs, keyboards, laptops, desktops, assorted Android phones and tablets, routers, switches, bluetooth speakers and headphones, some lights, a Nintendo Switch, and a Chromecast. Of those, only the Chromecast would be affected if the manufacturer disappeared tomorrow. The desktop is from 2011, and the laptops span ~5-10 years old, not one running the original OS (and many with hardware upgrades). The phones did require bootloader unlocking (kudos to Motorola for making this painless) and aftermarket ROMs to stay up to date, but even without that they&#x27;d <i>work</i> without needing any company help. Likewise I&#x27;ll concede that <i>some</i> routers&#x2F;switches are a pain (I was grumpy at the hoops I had to jump through to switch my Edgerouter to OpenWRT) but it&#x27;s fine and again even the default options didn&#x27;t require an online account or any service from the manufacturer. I don&#x27;t think this is a foregone conclusion at all.')
