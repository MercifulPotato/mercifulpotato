Eg if you are designing a custom RISC-V chip for a media encoding system you will want extensions for that application, and make use of those in your development tool chain. The software for your Hardware, or at least the performance and functionality critical part, is often only targeted at your hardware, not any arbitrary RISC-V system.')
