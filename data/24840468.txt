(though the perspective is my own and satisfied with the mix of life I&#x27;m into and whatever I&#x27;m!) in my career and have enjoyed a good and competent technical team with me all the time.<p>I mentor my team mostly from ground-up and have found that anyone can become a fantastic and a dependable competent resource provided enough freedom and directions. Also worked as a startup coach. Been into startups since early 2000s<p>Obviously, this handle is my pseudonym and not my real name. Extremely sorry for that as I value privacy more than anything and people call me that I&#x27;m a paranoid. I&#x27;m still not in a position to divulge much personally.<p>I&#x27;ll try to list down common issues faced and lessons learnt by startup a CTO as much possible.<p>- Having to deal with a non-technical founder is very hard<p>- Technical work could be very challenging if you are one of the few who takes cares of many things or try to play multiple roles<p>- Getting competent resources could prove to be a very tough task if you are in a third world country. (I&#x27;m not talking about the Bay Area types)<p>- Have a process right from day one. Do everything in a documented manner and work like what will happen if you get run over by a truck (it could happen to anyone on the team). Then what?<p>- Technical stack identification for an initial MVP will take time until one gets it right considering a 360 degree view covering all the aspects<p>- Having business knowledge &#x2F; outlook is a must and without that, however technical one could be, he&#x2F;she will not bring value on a long run. There could always be a better one who will replace you<p>- Strike the deal from the day one. There is no free lunch. Negotiate hard and properly for what you are worth. No slack or compromise on those aspects<p>- There are no shortcuts for anything<p>- Everyday is a learning day<p>- There are newer ways of doing things which gets into the mainstream and some might even come from you!<p>- Keeping the team together and motivated is an extremely tough thing to do if you are in a non-commercial decision making role. Try to vest some powers towards that direction if you are joining a team (not as a part of core founding &#x2F; decision making team, but just playing a CTO &#x2F; VP of Tech or something akin to it)<p>- Pleasing everyone is not possible all the time. Learn to cope with frustrations and take decisions based on long term goals<p>- Never get driven by emotions<p>- Be ready to adopt to any situation, and be adept at many things. Learn, learn and learn and put to use<p>- Have a birds eye view on everything and have the vision of an ant on specifics (up close!)<p>There is much more to write (it&#x27;s my part time passion and mostly use it for internal communications, mentoring and teaching), but seriously considering it towards a book of experience in (near?) future.<p>Though the above is incomplete in many ways, would like to hear the thoughts &#x2F; views from other technical people. Thanks for reading so far!')
