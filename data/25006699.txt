Since asset prices are typically leveraged on wages (through mortgages), assets will inflate faster than wages (unless the interest rate is set to counteract this.)<p>But inflation is only beneficial to &#x2F;new&#x2F; buyers if wages inflate faster than assets. Otherwise the relative debt of all mortgage holders increases over time.<p>Whether asset inflation is beneficial to a home owner is debatable, since all properties appreciate at the same rate. &quot;Moving up&quot; still means increasing the relative size of the mortgage.')
