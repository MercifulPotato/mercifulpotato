People would notice if you suddenly start claiming to be from a different community.<p>The classification of higher and lower caste itself is an oversimplification.<p>Wearing the thread implies that you are from a Brahmin community. Brahmin is just one of the many communities that exist in India based on geography, language (including numerous dialects), wealth and religion (including different sects). Each of these communities think they are better than some subset of indian ethnicities.<p>Some groups (Dalits being one of the prominent examples) are unfortunately at the receiving end of biases from almost everyone else.')
