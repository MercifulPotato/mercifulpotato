The new cables (if you buy an iPhone today) are Lightning at one end, and USB-C at the other. So you can&#x27;t use them with your old adapter. This means a new iPhone buyer is getting a phone with no charger, and any of the old chargers they have won&#x27;t be usable with this cable.<p>And cheap USB-A Lightning cables are crap. Even expensive ones from Anker are crap. Apple made ones are okay, but have poor strain relief, so eventually they crap out too.')
