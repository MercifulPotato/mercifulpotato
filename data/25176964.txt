Every annoying thing has a bizarre undiscoverable keystroke to invoke a sensible not-broken alternative.<p>Why they don&#x27;t make the reasonable implementations the first class defaults is way beyond me... (I haven&#x27;t read the mailing list&#x2F;bug report threads enough to find out, if someone has insight I&#x27;d love to know. It&#x27;s like they know something is what people don&#x27;t want to do 99.9% of the time, they fix it, then they hide the fix; ie deleting some audio without shifting everything over - I have never wanted to shift things on delete. Not once, never. Not a single time. Why is that default?)')
