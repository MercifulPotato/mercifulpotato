Out of their readers, there are many, many, many total losers and mediocrities. That list is cherry picking given that most of the names on that list do not even pay dues to the Ayn Rand Institute and could not be considered card carrying Objectivists. There have been many successful card carrying Objectivists, but claiming that everyone who read &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; derived their success from Ayn Rand in some way is just silly.')
