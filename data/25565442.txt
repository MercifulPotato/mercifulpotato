Since it is not a specialized skill, many do have trouble finding jobs in their field.<p>The barista at my favorite coffee place, had a marketing&#x2F;pr degree...  you just don&#x27;t need a college degree to make coffee.  If she never finds a job in her field, or something that requires college degree, it would have been wasted money and a loss to society.<p>If you have to give free college, it has to be conditioned to things that do benefit the economy&#x2F;society (engineering, teachers, medicine, etc).  This introduced  a different problem, that is &#x27;state planing&#x27;.')
