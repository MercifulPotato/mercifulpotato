I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the technique is worse than useless when that assumption is violated.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t have time right now, but a toy example I like to throw at these kinds of problems is mapping primes to their indices (e.g. 2-&gt;0, 3-&gt;1, 5-&gt;2, ...). General-purpose learning algorithms can usually make a little headway with it, but not much, and only with substantial resources thrown at the problem. I&#x27;d be shocked if that toy example were any faster with their solution than a b-tree.')
