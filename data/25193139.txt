If someone &quot;donates&quot; iPads to &quot;the Sheriff&#x27;s Office&quot;, does this mean that they can be taken by people who work there (for example, Sung could sell them on and pocket the cash)? What is the mechanism here? The cut-and-dry case would be asking for a cash bribe and pocketing it, so is this a way of making the bribe look like something else?')
