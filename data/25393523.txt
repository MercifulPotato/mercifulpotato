California has unfortunately been exporting its ridiculous cost of living and lifestyle to the American west for decades, Austin is just the latest to feel it.&quot;<p>It seems like that but the actual phenomenon is simply the slow, increasing urbanization of the United States.<p>There are, of course, actual Californians moving into places like Austin and Bend and Colorado Springs but with or without them, the American expression of 21st century urbanism is what we&#x27;re actually witnessing.<p>California <i>the place</i> just happens to be 15-20 years ahead of most of the rest of the country on that path to urbanization which is why it&#x27;s so easy to mistake it for &quot;Californication&quot;.<p>As evidence I would put forth Minneapolis:  this is not a place that many Californians are moving to <i>and yet</i> they are experiencing the same kind of anti-zoning housing movement, they bemoan exploding housing prices  and they aspire to the same cultural and societal progression that everyone in the Bay Area would recognize.<p>I maintain they are not experiencing &quot;Californication&quot; - they are experiencing urbanization.')
