She&#x27;s right it&#x27;s picked less often than all other sequences combined, but that&#x27;s not the same as being picked less often than every other sequence individually.<p>Best lottery advice I heard from a math teacher was only make bets that have a chance at a retire-early sized prize and preferably no chance of small winnings. The idea being that when he loses, he&#x27;s donating to charity, which he would have done anyway.')
