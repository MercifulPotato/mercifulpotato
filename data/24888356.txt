They don&#x27;t know either<p>- Iran wants to play a regional power in the Middle East, far greater than it is now. It is to be noted that many countries in the ME, such as the UAE, Qatar, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Bahrain have significant Shia minorities or majorities in some cases. When the Arab Spring happened, Iran actively encouraged protests within the Shia population to overthrow the monarchy in Bahrain, until the UAE and Saudi Arabia reacted. Even now, the UAE regularly arrests Shia folks it suspects of cavorting with Iran (a large part of the Arab population in the Emirates are descended from Persia). Not to mention, Iran invaded and expelled the local Arab population of a tiny island of one of the constituent Emirates of the UAE, before the country&#x27;s formation and during the time of the Shah. Iran is quite the expansionist.<p>- basically what Rouhani thinks. Wait until Biden gets into power, and hope that he&#x27;s going to continue the Obama policy. This is not common among all dictators though - some want Trump to be in power, like the monarchs of the Arab states, since he&#x27;s an Iran hawk.<p>- a solution to Iran&#x27;s repressive regime, duh. Iranians have been immigrating en masse for a long time to the US, Canada, UK and Europe. Anywhere there is a democracy. There are a ton of Americans, British, Europeans and Canadians who graduated from Sharif University of Technology, the equivalent of Iran&#x27;s MIT.<p>- not just term limits, but the need to &quot;pander&quot; to their constituencies. One decade, they warred in the Middle East, the next decade they want to leave the mess they created, but then commit more troops (Obama on Iraq)? It&#x27;s definitely not like Russia or China or India (all of which are&#x2F;were friendly with Iran) who have had a steady policy in the region of being on talking terms with everyone.')
