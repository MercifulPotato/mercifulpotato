Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=[24899759], score=None, time=1603730647, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897425, text='&gt; &gt;  compilation time definitely IS an issue for us,<p>&gt; But is it due to &#x27;single file libraries&#x27;?<p>That&#x27;s a fair point, they&#x27;re generally not. I just meant that if those libraries were single file, but otherwise unchanged, then the problem would only be worse. I see what you&#x27;re saying about unity builds, but if you build your dependencies totally separately from the rest of your program then it&#x27;s not so important exactly how fast they build. I&#x27;m imagining a situation where you leave vcpkg to build all your libraries overnight, then you spend the next few weeks iteratively working on your application code (which is how it usually works for us).<p>&gt; The reality is that unless you are using something fairly fundamental it will probably only need to be in one compilation unit in the first place.<p>In the projects I work on, which are really quite varied, many (but not all) libraries are used throughout the codebase as vocabulary types. Again, I think this just comes down to very different codebases and uses of libraries for us.')
