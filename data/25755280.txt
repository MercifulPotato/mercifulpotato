Item(by='scarmig', descendants=None, kids=[25755661], score=None, time=1610492835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25754955, text='&gt; Diversity factored into 1 of 3 subcategories in 1 of 3 top level categories. It isn&#x27;t fair to say the &quot;CDC recommends prioritizing [essential workers] over the elderly because the elderly are disproportionately white&quot; when it is just one piece of a much larger and more nuanced discussion.<p>For the two top level categories in the rubric, Science and Implementation, the elderly-first approach had achieved a score of 6&#x2F;6, while the essential workers-first approach had achieved a score of 5&#x2F;6. Elderly-first was favored at that point.<p>For the third top level category, Ethics, elderly-first was given a score of 1&#x2F;3, while essential workers-first was given a score of 3&#x2F;3, which brought essential workers-first to 8&#x2F;9 as opposed to the elderly-first score of 7&#x2F;9, driving the decision.<p>As part of the subcategories of Ethics, essential workers-first netted 2 points from the subcategory &quot;Mitigate Health inequities,&quot; the first a positive point for it because &quot;Racial and ethnic minority groups disproportionately represented in many essential industries&quot; and the second against the elderly-first because &quot;Racial and ethnic minority groups under-represented among adults &gt;65.&quot; That is what drove the outsize result in Ethics.<p>Here&#x27;s a direct question for you: diversity considerations netted the essential workers-first approach 2 points. Would you say that &quot;significantly greater number of lives saved&quot; should be worth the same as diversity (2 points), a bit less (1), or a bit more (3)? Or do you go with the rubric and say the number of lives saved merits no consideration at all, because it&#x27;s not an ethical concern on par with diversity?')
