If you look at newspapers, they break pages up into columns. If books exceed a certain width, they get broken down into columns. Journals often break their articles into columns.<p>Now, a fair follow-up to this is that why don&#x27;t we make text on the web into columns, so instead of big sidebars of white space you fit multiple columns of text on the screen? I&#x27;d say this is probably because the web uses scrolling instead of pagination. If there&#x27;s more text than can fit on the page, it&#x27;s faster and easier to just scroll down than it is to load a new page. But if you have a layout with columns, you&#x27;d have to scroll down to read, then scroll back to the top each time you finish a column, which is a hassle. So just having one long column requires the least user effort.<p>All said, of course some people might have different preferences. I&#x27;m sure some people find it easier looking from side to side with full screen text than scrolling down, or easier to click a next page button than scrolling down. But I think the trend for fixed width single columns on the web is one that&#x27;s meeting many if not most peoples&#x27; preferences.')
