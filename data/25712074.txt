Often you&#x27;d have to move countries or at least cities. In many smaller cities you can also make good money in IT with lower cost of living outside of FAANG; 2) they pay better, but nowhere near the US market craze; you can get,say, 20k better but not 200k better; 3) FAANG in EU tend to hire rather senior engineers; 4) there&#x27;s this feeling that it&#x27;s hard to get there and you get whiteboarded with irrelevant process, so many people don&#x27;t even bother trying; 5) many people are perhaps not very up to date with US companies&#x27; salaries possibilities (open salary sharing in EU is not very common, and glassdoor often has few &#x2F; outdated data points; outsiders don&#x27;t know about Blind, levels.fyi  etc).<p>Having said that I&#x27;m in my 30s so I don&#x27;t know what current students think.')
