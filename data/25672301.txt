Individual police, I can agree were overwhelmed and were not trained or ready for this.<p>But as organizations (Capital Police, Metro Police, FBI, etc.) this event was broadly known to be happening all over social media well in advance of Wednesday&#x27;s event. There should have been a response as soon as that crowd made it to the steps of the building.<p>What concerns me is how this could have played out if that rioting group was even 10% more organized than they were. Or if they were intending to destroy&#x2F;damage the building beyond windows and doors. Could you imagine if instead of just taking selfies in the senate president&#x27;s chair, they piled up the desks and lit them on fire?<p>I hope this event sparks some changes in security protocols, because now any extremist group intending to disrupt government or make a bold statement know exactly how to do it and know they&#x27;ll get far enough to do some serious damage.')
