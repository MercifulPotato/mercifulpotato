We would ideally want to work with the real numbers, but no computational model can represent <i>all</i> real numbers (by a trivial cardinality argument).<p>Obviously, we can make useful progress in practice and evolve beyond the floating point representation (at least for general tasks), similar to what we did for other theoretically undecidable problems (like garbage collectors), but let&#x27;s not pretend it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s easy to fix.<p>The paper is interesting and talks about very real problems, but it&#x27;s still a far cry from something that can be used in production.')
