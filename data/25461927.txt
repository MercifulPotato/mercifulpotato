Nicely defining and visualising dags of job really is the killer feature.<p>Browsing task&#x2F;job logs is nicer in Airflow IMO.<p>Airflow scheduler is flaky - hopefully better in 2.0.<p>Airflow has much more “magic” than Jenkins this is often infuriating.<p>All that said, my preference is to move jobs to Airflow. Getting a nice gui for manually triggered jobs in airflow is&#x2F;was the only large missing piece for me.')
