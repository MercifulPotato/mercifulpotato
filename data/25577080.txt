TV&#x27;s are absolutely not a necessity nor really a good use of your income in any form (though not really that expensive, what is expensive are subscription plans).<p>I think it&#x27;s interesting to describe things like TV&#x27;s as &quot;very most fundamental creature comforts&quot; when someone has less than 1000$ in savings. If you are that strapped for cash you should recognize that every dollar you do have is extremely valuable and should be used to put you in a better financial situation.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the idea that being poor means having poor character, it&#x27;s often out of situational issues or ignorance, but the issue arises when we start to defend legitimate misuses of money and say &quot;well people deserve to live comfortably&quot;')
