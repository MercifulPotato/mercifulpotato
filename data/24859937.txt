If individual cells have higher voltage than other cells, a resistor for that cell is switched on to burn off excess charge.<p>More advanced controllers can use flyback transformers to move charge from one cell to another. This is vastly more expensive than just using a resistor, though, so it&#x27;s only used in applications where energy conservation is key, like solar projects or where heat is a constraint. The LTC3300 is a good example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.analog.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;ltc3300-1.html#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.analog.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;ltc3300-1.html#</a>')
