I had taken several other courses around the same time, and they all used Matlab.  All of the courses had arranged for a free Matlab license for the time the course was active.  You also were given the option of buying the Student version for $99.  That didn&#x27;t last long, I haven&#x27;t seen any courses offering a free license (or even using Matlab for that matter), and to get the Student license you have to be enrolled at a 4 year institution.<p>In those classes that did use Matlab, there were quite a few people sticking to Octave, though it wasn&#x27;t 100% compatable. And when I got to Ng&#x27;s course, I (and I imagine a whole lot of others) were really happy to see he went 100% with Octave.  Had he gone the Matlab route, the old course would be pretty worthless now.<p>We&#x27;ll never know what happened behind closed doors, but I think Matlab was sponsoring some courses in order to get new people hooked on Matlab and it just didn&#x27;t pay off.')
