OP has experience with email and judges slack to be better. Neither are “right” or “wrong”<p>I find Slack is better than Skype For IM. I find zoom the best for face to face meetings and screen sharing (slack doesn’t seem to have a “share this window” option), but slack for starting a quick call and for asynchronous comms, and things like changes and alerts. Email for comms outside the company.<p>Use whatever tool makes you work well.')
