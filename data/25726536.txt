Even if you stored current state in a proper Model, there is nothing you can do if your event queue ends up being &quot;&lt;down&gt;, &lt;down&gt;, &lt;enter&gt;&quot;.<p>I guess that&#x27;s why Qt prefers to do all UI event processing exclusively in a single thread. The event queue will always be serviced in order.')
