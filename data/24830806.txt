I thought I tried that and just made sure I did. The following did not work for me: Settings &gt; Safari &gt; Clear History and Website Data &gt; Searching for &quot;passwordless.dev&quot; &gt; Edit &gt; Removing the &quot;passwordless.dev&quot; row. The two accounts are still there when reopening passwordless.dev and clicking on &quot;Sign in&quot;. I&#x27;m probably missing something obvious.<p>Edit: Oh. I guess the &quot;for all&quot; in the article mean that this only works if I clear the complete history for all sites? I did <i>not</i> try that.<p>Edit2: Cleared all website data. The two test accounts are still there.')
