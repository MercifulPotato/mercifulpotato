Your friends, family, and support infrastructure is all in the place you&#x27;ve been over the last 40 years.<p>Purchasing another home and moving to it have huge transactional costs.<p>It would have been completely reasonable to include plans for the reverse mortgage as part of your finical planning already: Americans often have a significant fraction of their net worth tied up in their homes.  So that money may well be spoken for.  It also may be just unavailable:  The city&#x27;s assessment of your home&#x27;s value may not match with a lender&#x27;s assessment.<p>Think of it this way, if I show up at your town council&#x27;s office and offer to pay 2x the property taxes you currently pay, should I be able to bid you out of your home?   If that wouldn&#x27;t be ethical, why is it ethical to do it in a distributed way?<p>I think Prop13 is nuts, but the opposite idea of continually subjecting people&#x27;s homes to volatile and unpredictable market price based taxes is also nuts.')
