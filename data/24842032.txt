As soon as the result of one thread depends on the result of another thread you have to have some mechanism for synchronization.<p>I mean it&#x27;s not really any different from writing a C&#x2F;C++ program that avoids use of mutexes by having each thread operate on separate parts of the process address space. I&#x27;m still intrigued but it&#x27;s not mind-blowing to me to fork a bunch of threads and join them when the function execution completes.')
