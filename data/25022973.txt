This takes place for some of the most common high-skilled occupations in Americaâ€™s leading hightech area.</i><p>While there certainly <i>are</i> citizens getting paid $208,000 a year for certain high-skilled roles, I think it is entirely plausible that for many roles, the competitive wage is far below that <i>and</i> there are not enough American citizens who can fill those roles even for $208,000.<p>(Or, put another way, for certain roles, if they can&#x27;t find citizens available and qualified to do the work, employers will simply choose not to engage in whatever business they were considering engaging in. There&#x27;s no way that&#x27;s good for the American economy.)')
