She eventually started recording all meetings in her cellphone and summarizing key points at a later leisurely pace so she could also effectively participate in the meeting.<p>This was like before the Olympics in Brazil, so it must have been 2015, maybe earlier. Since then, I&#x27;ve always assumed that someone is secretively recording all meetings where I have to wear a suit.<p>Much, much earlier, during the 2008 meltdown, meetings sometimes ended with loosen-up remarks that one wouldn&#x27;t want recorded (one client was a big corp whose CEO was known to have an extremely attractive wife). These were valuable bonding moments, but maybe they underscored a corporate culture that had its downsides (like making the pretty girl in the team do all the charliework).')
