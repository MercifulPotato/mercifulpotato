It would take some work though, possibly even including support from browsers and screen readers. The pseudo-focus and pseudo-caret features in particular are problematic. Also, blind people might need a playback mode that advances the recording manually frame by frame (only counting frames that actually include changes), rather than playing back in real time.')
