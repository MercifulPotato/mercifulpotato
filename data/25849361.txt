The protocols involved are called Olm and Megolm.<p>Olm is used for establishing 1-on-1 sessions between pairs of users (or rather, their devices). This is then used as a secure channel to share Megolm keys. A Megolm key is ratcheted with each room message sent and is used to derive a symmetric AES key with which the message is actually encrypted. Periodically (every N messages) a new Megolm key is created and re-shared with room participants.<p>So the end result is that it has roughly the same security as Signal, except that a single compromised Megolm key will reveal N messages to the attacker instead of just a single message. In return, the protocol is much more scalable, enabling relatively efficient large end-to-end encrypted groups. Otherwise, all the session self-healing, forward secrecy properties of Signal are retained.<p>TL;DR: Approximately the same as Signal, trading a tiny bit of security in the event of a key leak for more scalable encryption in the setting of large groups.')
