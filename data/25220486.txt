Including the standard libraries and some specific stuff there that isn&#x27;t optimal for the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. And especially that whatever is newer and more recently entered the standard is automatically better. It&#x27;s understandable that they support their own existence by doing all that -- it&#x27;s about becoming &quot;more important&quot; just by following&#x2F;promoting some book or some obligatory rituals (it&#x27;s an easy and time proven strategy through the centuries, and that&#x27;s why I call it &quot;religiously&quot;, of course -- and I am also not surprised that somebody who identifies themselves with being one of the &quot;lawyers&quot; wouldn&#x27;t like this perspective -- you are free to suggest a better name). But it should also be also very obvious that it&#x27;s not what&#x27;s necessarily optimal for me to follow, as soon as I can decide what I&#x27;m doing. And yes, it&#x27;s different in the environment where the &quot;company policy&quot; is sacred. There one has the company &quot;policy lawyers&quot;, and typically every attempt of  change can die if one isn&#x27;t one of them.')
