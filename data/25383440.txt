Its not a flow that already exists. You need to factory-reset your device to log out.<p>2) the team that was put in charge of linking FB accounts to oculus are not the same team that owns the home screen gui.<p>3) working between teams is a hard problem<p>4) adding a logout flow is a boat load of work, because the rift os was never designed to do logging out, because why would you need to log out of an oculus device, barring cockups?<p>Personally I think its a mistake to force linking accounts. I can see why they want it, it makes future multiplayer and AR integrations better.')
