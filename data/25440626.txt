That would also have allowed the browser to generate reports for the user regarding which sites currently have which permissions, etc.  This would have put the onus on the browser implementation to get it right, and not e.g. fail to show the messages, but one could argue that <i>any</i> browser could get the random CSS used for these prompts wrong and not show the message.<p>I&#x27;m a GDPR fan and will likely use this jurisdiction transfer as a ceremonial point to close my FB account for good.')
