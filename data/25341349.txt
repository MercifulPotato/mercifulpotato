Judges aren&#x27;t going to issue a warrant based on asking a bunch of people if they sent a message.&quot;<p>Judges absolutely issue warrants all the time just for the hell of it. The very up parent seems to be indicating that some sort of due process was done because &quot;oh, a judge issued a warrant&quot; and I&#x27;m emphatically stating: a judge issuing a warrant means as much as me saying the sky is made of M&amp;M&#x27;s - just the ravings of irrelevant madmen in the face of actual facts.<p>Edit: I will say - the warrant process should absolutely be adversarial. Justice is to be blind. Which means if a crackhead and a cop come to a judge and requests the legal authority to break into a home with lethal force, the judge should weigh both requests the same. That&#x27;s the intent of our legal system - the executive does what it thinks it&#x27;s supposed to do in light of what the legislative has passed, while the judicial watches them to make sure they don&#x27;t screw up.<p>Instead they all get together as buddies and stomp their collective boots into the skull of their fellow citizens.')
