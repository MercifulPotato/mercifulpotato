When information is suppressed, people fill in the gaps. Some people do it with wilder and wilder ideas, but there _is_ a gap, and those who think the information suppression is totally benign are naive, considering both historical precedent and the obvious question of, &quot;what are they hiding that they don&#x27;t want people to know about?&quot; If it was benign, a government by the people and for the people would be transparent to the people. Lack of transparency hints that it is neither by nor for the benefit of the people.')
