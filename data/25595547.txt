There isn&#x27;t a clear way to distinguish between &quot;this comment is low quality&quot; (quality moderation) and &quot;I disagree with it&quot; (content feedback).<p>Downvoting has the aggregate effect of suppressing speech. In the case of low quality, this is a good thing. In the case of disagreement, it runs the risk of discouraging expression and diverse ideas.<p>Perhaps people have ideas they&#x27;d like to discuss, but don&#x27;t want to risk &quot;losing points&quot; because the idea may be unpopular. I know that I have personally experienced this, and stopped myself from expressing an idea because I&#x27;ve been pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t be popular. Given the overall high quality of discussions on HN, this chilling effect is disturbing. Have others experienced it?<p>Upvotes are a positive signal, it seems to me that the risk of conflating positive signals is less than that of conflating negative signals, since it doesn&#x27;t have a suppressive effect, it has an uplifting effect.<p>Would it make sense, and improve the community, to eliminate downvotes and to only have positive signals?<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting getting rid of flagging a comment, just downvotes.')
