The goal overall of the article seems to be to claim that ML is the correct path because hard logic based AI is too complex and will never work.<p>I think this is a bad view because it doesn&#x27;t acknowledge that both are necessary.<p>It is painfully obvious that humans have an internal dialog, and that the subconscious also engages in a sort of thought process involving tokens as well.<p>There are clearly many possibilities that we consider as people. These possibilities follow something close to logic but heavily influenced by notions that have been built through a non-logical process ( our &quot;beliefs&quot; )<p>What is hopelessly inadequate is pure neural networks and&#x2F;or trained ML. To ever approach anything similar to human thought we will have to use tokens.<p>Doing that is very difficult but not insanely so. Using the word insane implies that such a process is not guided by some predetermined logical system. I agree it is not fully logical, but not that it is insane.<p>The article is too dismissive of classical AI and seems to imply that those pursuing it are wasting our time.')
