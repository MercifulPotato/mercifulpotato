There&#x27;s a huge lump of inertia there.<p>If you&#x27;re just referring to Apple&#x27;s future, the endgame is already a done deal. They don&#x27;t roll back something this fundamental once it&#x27;s public.<p>Their last Intel computers will be manufactured and sold within 3 years; I&#x27;d wager a month&#x27;s salary on that if I had it lying around.<p>If they can&#x27;t make it perform at the top level like AMD, which seems unlikely but obviously it&#x27;s too soon to tell, they&#x27;ll make up for it in other ways or simply live with the performance hit until they can.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t believe in inertia. Their partners and customers can either make the transition or get left behind. Microsoft&#x27;s business model depends on making enterprises happy; Apple doesn&#x27;t care.')
