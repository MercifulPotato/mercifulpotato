Item(by='trzeci', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608404503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='&gt; How can the game be acceptable or fun when cars run on tracks and NPC’s don’t have a problem being attacked?<p>Because I don&#x27;t interact with NPC&#x27;s and traffic. I treat these aspects more like a decoration to the game, not an interactive content. \nThere is plenty of interactive content and side missions, so I have enough of fun spending my time there instead of killing NPCs and pretending this is a GTA, so that I can fight police.')
