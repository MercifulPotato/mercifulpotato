I agree with most of this article. IdeaVim is a pretty good vim emulator (although not perfect, but none of them are).<p>There&#x27;s something to be said by having sane defaults that do exactly what you want. Probably my biggest issue with vim is you can easily find yourself in no man&#x27;s land because your setup inevitably becomes uniquely your own. For example I used coc.nvim in vim, and although it worked great overall, I would often find autocomplete text sitting in an unnamed buffer that I would have to clean up. Despite googling like crazy and even asking for help in a couple vim communities, I could not solve this problem that seemingly only I had.<p>The article touches upon this as well, saying a 50 line tsx file doesn&#x27;t work for the author in vim. For me a 1000 line tsx file works just fine, so the author managed to dig a unique hole for themselves there too, most likely.')
