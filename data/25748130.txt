Why isn&#x27;t there ever a intuitive explanation in text books about this?</i><p>In an equation like<p><pre><code>  df&#x2F;dt = k Δf\n</code></pre>\nthe Laplacian create a diffusion-like effect only if k is a real positive number. If k is a real negative number, it creates the opposite effect that concentrates whatever f represent and make it more spiky.<p>When k is an imaginary number, it is not like diffusion o anti-diffusion (I don&#x27;t know the technical name). The associated operator is unitary and the behavior is different.<p>Many books about the heat&#x2F;diffusion equations and Schrodinger equation have this discussion. And the generalized versions where k is a functions that depends on x or t, or is a complex number instead of a real or complex number.<p>For an intuitive idea of what is happening, the idea is that you consider at time=0 the function<p><pre><code>  f(x,t=0)=A sin(ωx).\n</code></pre>\nIf k is real and positive, the amplitude of the function decrease with time. And when ω is big, it decrease faster, so the small features disappear very faster than the smooth parts.<p>If k is real and negative, the amplitude of the function increase with time, and you have the opposite effect.<p>If k is imaginary, the function just rotate in the complex plane but does not increase or decrease the amplitude. So you get a wavy effect instead of a diffusion effect.<p>The initial equation is linear, i.e. there is no f^2 or something like that. With some hand waving you can extend the simple cases where f is sin or cos to more complex cases.
