Fiat is far too easy to earn for some and far too difficult to earn for others.<p>The only thing holding the fiat system together are the elite&#x27;s willingness to hold onto it in spite of the fact that it is worth nothing to them (particularly in our risk-free bailout-driven economy). The elites only hold fiat to create artificial scarcity; to create an anti-competitive moat around all their existing businesses.<p>At this stage, from a capitalist point of view, the elites who hold fiat are doing charity work at a loss to themselves... It&#x27;s a purely idealistic pursuit which is not grounded in their own self-interest. The ideological basis of this charity work is dubious and in the end, the real capitalists will throw their cronies under the bus for profit.<p>The artificial fiat manipulation that we&#x27;re seeing now is setting the stage for a massive wealth transfer. The incentives for betrayal between members of the elite keep getting bigger now that their freedoms are at stake.')
