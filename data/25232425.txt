You probably won&#x27;t become a master but you have to make the effort. The effort is all.<p>Stick with playing the cello then.<p>&gt; Importantly, everything valuable that is known was once unknown by everybody, including masters.<p>We as a species are <i>way</i> beyond the point that laymen - no matter their intellectual capacity - can acquire detailed knowledge about every special topic in even just a single scientific area.<p>This isn&#x27;t as simple as music theory or perfecting motor functions by means of practising. Just to give you an idea of the scale we&#x27;re talking here:<p>The journal &quot;General Relativity and Gravity&quot; [1] alone published 167 papers in 2019.<p><i>Yesterday</i>(!) alone, 20 papers were announced on arxiv.org [2]<p>So assuming you already know GR by heart, you&#x27;d need to spend every waking minute of your existence just reading up on what&#x27;s currently being discussed within the community. This leaves absolutely no time for reflection on and understanding the material, let alone working on original ideas.<p>You are delusional if you think that 200 years of modern mathematics, physics and astronomy can be mastered by a single person, let alone an <i>average</i> person, who rarely has the mental capacity to even understand most of the material en detail.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;10714&#x2F;volumes-and-issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;journal&#x2F;10714&#x2F;volumes-and-issues</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;list&#x2F;gr-qc&#x2F;new" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;list&#x2F;gr-qc&#x2F;new</a>')
