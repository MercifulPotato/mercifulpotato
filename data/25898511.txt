Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611543301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898428, text='&gt; For what it&#x27;s worth I think you are wrong.<p>I&#x27;m happy for disagreeing opinions.<p>&gt; But once it is mature<p>You may be right, and if it turns out that you are I&#x27;ll happily change my opinion. But it seems like you agree that currently centralization is the way to go for an app like Signal. Honestly I&#x27;d love to see Signal decentralized, but I don&#x27;t think it is the right move right now or in the near future. But given what you said I still don&#x27;t think it means it is the right time to call for decentralization. Signal doesn&#x27;t have to be the leader in advancing decentralization technology. They are already leading in secure and private communication and I don&#x27;t think such a small group can be experts in too many things. They got their niche and I&#x27;m happy someone is doing it.<p>I&#x27;m curious though, why do you think decentralization will move faster in the future? What advantage do you see in that? I&#x27;ve always seen decentralization as lagging in updates because it is more difficult to get users to update and software can&#x27;t exist in isolation (software rots).')
