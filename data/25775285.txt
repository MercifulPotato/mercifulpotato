The annotations are stored directly into the PDF and all readers I tried it with can read it.<p>It was expensive, but it saves me from some Monitor time each day, which was worth it for me. Especially the A4 format of the tablet makes it very nice, it really ist just like a pice of paper with a pen to annotate it and that&#x27;s why I enjoy it.')
