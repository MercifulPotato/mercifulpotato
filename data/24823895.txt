The guy is not smooth or engaging.  He doesn&#x27;t <i>sound</i> like he has the opinions &#x2F; experience &#x2F; stories to share, although I have no idea, perhaps he does.<p>I just don&#x27;t get why he&#x27;s popular, aside from that he&#x27;s able to get interviews with famous&#x2F;important people because he&#x27;s popular.')
