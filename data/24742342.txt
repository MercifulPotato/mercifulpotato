It took zero time to adjust, and within a day I was actually touchtyping using the properly assigned keys for every letter, something I&#x27;d tried many times over the years, but always found super awkward on a normal keyboard. I realised that I&#x27;d always subconsciously known there was something wrong with the weird fingers-curling-under-each-other you&#x27;re supposed to do and it felt like a weight had been lifted!<p>Of course, that was for prose. It took a month or so to arrive at a satisfactory layout for all the symbols, having suddenly dropped to 48 keys. Though thumbs are so useful! Using them only for spaces is criminal.<p>Still use a laptop on the couch at home for casual stuff. Still can&#x27;t type properly on it.<p>Not much point to this comment, I guess, other than that I highly recommend anyone to borrow someone&#x27;s plank&#x2F;preonic&#x2F;ergodox for a day or two if they&#x27;ll let you, and bang out some prose. You might be very pleasantly surprised!')
