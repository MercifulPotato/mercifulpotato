Item(by='salawat', descendants=None, kids=[25408962], score=None, time=1607884825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25408481, text='&gt;&quot;If you can get it to us, we&#x27;ll store it&quot; is totally reasonable.&quot;<p>No it isn&#x27;t. On the one hand you say we&#x27;ll store it if you can get it to us, then on the other you build an obstruction to data getting to you. Data propagation is part of storage. I have to get bits off my processor, to your physical media to be stored, and you just built a barrier to keep that from happening. You don&#x27;t get to use &quot;unlimited&quot; for marketing attractiveness, then bait-and-switch.<p>So maybe to you it sounds reasonable, but to anyone that values being up front about the service they are offering, that&#x27;s nothing more than selling a product you can&#x27;t deliver, i.e., deception and false advertising.')
