On paper, it&#x27;s a beautiful machine, but much like in the case of FireWire, it doesn&#x27;t meet eye to eye with the real world around it.<p>The Toyota is less ambitious, more constrained by reality, and while it certainly doesn&#x27;t match the on-paper specs of the Lamborghini, it is in every way more practical and viable as a system.<p>I would consider the Toyota to be the better engineered of the two when looking at them as cars and not as toys, even though it lacks the technical wow factor.')
