This is like your cell phone company telling you that the tethering feature you have always had access to is now part of their Pro plan, for which you won&#x27;t be charged extra. Then they turn around and start charging for the Pro plan on the grounds that it has a bunch of features you don&#x27;t care about â€” and one feature that was previously available outside the Pro plan.<p>Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding what&#x27;s happening here, this seems really lousy. I became a Stripe customer because of the simplicity and transparency. It seems that both of those benefits are disappearing.')
