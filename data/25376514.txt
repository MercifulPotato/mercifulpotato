Also, local food production can vary, place to place, season to season - what&#x27;s sustainable during a good year, might not be during a bad one.<p>Plants and animals can eat and drink things humans can&#x27;t; e.g. a plant is fine with muddy, faeces-contaminated water, it would even thrive on it. Livestock may happily eat grass&#x2F;straw long-term.<p>The killing of one cow won&#x27;t feed a human for the rest of their lives - multiple cows are needed to provide constant food, and the cow population may as such increase along with the human population.<p>When the rate at which the cows are eating grass is faster than the rate at which the grass grows, your population is unsustainable, and you will eventually not be able to feed everyone. The only sense in which it&#x27;s &quot;impossible to exceed the carrying capacity of the earth&quot; is that when you do, people will die.')
