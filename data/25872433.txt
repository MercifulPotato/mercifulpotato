The changes occur in a defined sequence, and other replicas may lag behind the leader, but cannot be inconsistent with it.<p>Your example can&#x27;t happen, because if (for instance) A is the leader, then C will not apply change Y without contacting the leader, which will tell it to apply X first.<p>If you want more details about how this handles all the edge cases -- for instance, what happens if the leader crashes -- the Raft paper is quite accessible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raft.github.io&#x2F;raft.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raft.github.io&#x2F;raft.pdf</a>')
