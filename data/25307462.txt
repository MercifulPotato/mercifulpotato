Item(by='xboxnolifes', descendants=None, kids=[25308810], score=None, time=1607113994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307227, text='&gt; Most people enjoy creating&#x2F;building&#x2F;earning...<p>That&#x27;s kind of the issue though. At a large enough scale, donations can undermine the value of creation &#x2F; earning. A new show shop might not have much value in an economy that has a large enough supply of donated shoes constantly thrown into it. Since it&#x27;s not valuable to build these shoe suppliers, they do not get built. The population becomes dependent on the donations, as existing infrastructure does not exist to support them if the donations suddenly stopped.<p>I believe this is why the original comment separated disaster relief from charity. Giving people their first pair of shoes for free from an external economy may not be necessarily bad, but subsequent pairs hinders growth of a local shoe economy.<p>DISCLAIMER: Shoes are pure example. If you disagree with the idea of this comment, please do not focus on the shoes.')
