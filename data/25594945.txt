But demand is quite variable- 2am on a not-so-warm-or-cold day, who needs all that extra energy? Why not use the excess to create hydrogen and store it? Now the energy doesn&#x27;t go to waste.<p>The problem is not of the energy going to waste or the plant being unable to throttle down.  The problem is that fuel cost is immaterial; a plant running at 1% output power still costs 99% as much per day as a plant running at 100%.<p>That means that building 10% oversupply is tremendously expensive.  If you&#x27;re using it 10% of the time, it costs 10x more per MWh than the baseload power.  If hydrogen is 11% as profitable as baseload, you are only gathering another 10% revenue, and the power is still 5x as expensive as normal electricity.  That would be far more expensive than any other source.<p>You could easily estimate hydrogen economy would be worth &gt;&gt;10% of electricity... but only at the margin.  <i>Right now</i> it&#x27;s reasonable to say hydrogen is worth 50% of the value of electricity used to make it.  For all regional grids in the US, daily peak is 30-50% higher than the daily minimum[1].  That&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> amount of overcapacity to consume, far more than can be utilized by base industry.<p>Having &gt;70% nuclear and&#x2F;or relying on hydrogen economy to make nuclear economical is pretty highly dependent on hydrogen vehicles.  Fermi math: 142 billion gallons annual[2] @25 mpg fleet efficiency[3] translates to .9 trillion kWh @4 mi&#x2F;kWh, or ~25% of annual electricity.  The bottom line is that it takes a relatively minor (~15-20%) overcapacity would tap out basically all possible uses for hydrogen.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42915" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42915</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;energyexplained&#x2F;gasoline&#x2F;use-of-gasoline.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;energyexplained&#x2F;gasoline&#x2F;use-of-gasoline...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-autos-emissions&#x2F;u-s-vehicle-fleet-sets-new-record-for-fuel-efficiency-in-2018-epa-idUSKBN20P35M" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-autos-emissions&#x2F;u-s-v...</a>')
