You can drink while ensuring you&#x27;re not drunk or hungover at work, for example. For COVID, it&#x27;s not possible to control the impact; if you have COVID, you do not work. Additionally, you can spread COVID to other employees prior to a positive test or symptoms and consequently affect the business outside of your personal availability. That&#x27;s not really the case with drinking or a refusal to exercise.')
