Logic and engineering can achieve goals, but they can’t help you choose what goals to achieve.<p>The real world is big and incomprehensible, and we all have to choose optimization goals based on what limited understanding we have of the big picture - also known as the “system.” There is no math formula you’ll ever be able to find that can do that for you.<p>Optimizing a known goal, that’s the straightforward kind of engineering, the kind I said in the article maxes out at Senior Engineer. Figuring out what goal to optimize for is messy and uncomfortable, but it’s the only way to eventually solve the bigger problems of the world.<p>When I was in grade school, math was my favourite subject, because the answers were always right or wrong and you never had to worry if the teacher would disagree with you. It was comforting. It still is. But to grow up and have a bigger impact, we have to move on and learn about uncomfortable things too.<p>I can tell this bothers you a lot. It used to bother me a lot too. The reason I write articles like this is to explain the things I used to not understand, using words that I hope would have helped past-me understand sooner. Maybe it will help you too. If not, no harm done.')
