When I read the word &#x27;computational design&#x27; I don&#x27;t immediately think of &#x27;parametric design&#x27;, &#x27;algorithmic design&#x27;, &#x27;generative design&#x27;. Instead, I have to use google and read around. The landing page itself describes thi.ng as &#x27;a truly manifold long-term project devoted to Computational Design&#x27;; again I&#x27;m a bit stumped, what does the author mean by manifold in this context? Go to the github page and the title reads &#x27;Polyglot computational design tools&#x27;, are we calling ourselves Polyglots now? Seriously?<p>That&#x27;s usually about as far as I get before I conclude that I don&#x27;t care enough. To my mind those are all flags which indicate that it&#x27;s probably not something I want to engage with.')
