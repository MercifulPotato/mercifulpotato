Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=[25939089], score=None, time=1611813173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25938430, text='&gt; The easiest way to expand medicine access ...<p>This seems to suppose one (or both) of two things:<p><pre><code>   1) access to medicine is limited because of the supply of health care providers, so more providers would help\n   2) access to medicine is limited due to cost, and more providers would force the cost down, as per &quot;supply and demand&quot;, &quot;the market&quot; etc.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not aware of much evidence for (1), though I don&#x27;t deny that it is possible. For (2) to be true, it would have to be the case there can actually be a competitive marketplace for all kinds of health care, and we know that this is not true for (at least) emergency care. Many volumes have been written by people much smarter than me that explain the many reasons why health care is not really susceptible to what are supposedly &quot;normal market&quot; behaviors and benefits. Just increasing the number of doctors will (a) not necessarily drive down the cost of health care nor (b) expand access to health care.<p>&gt; This why we have to be careful about generalizing from our own experience conclusively :)<p>Certainly in general, this is true. But when the claim is that &quot;<i>anyone</i> who wants a good physician&quot; would do this, not so much. Falsifiability, and all that.<p>&gt; People ought to take more responsibility ...<p>This is a moral statement, not some sort of fundamental statement about the nature of reality. Not only is the level of personal responsibility up for the debate, but so is the form such responsibility should take. Citizens in many other countries have chosen to &quot;take more responsibility&quot; for their healthcare in different ways than you are proposing (by taking aggregate action to create socialized health care systems that delegate many things <i>to the system</i>, intentionally).<p>&gt; Perhaps you haven’t noticed but the watchers in government agencies and the for-profit, big salary corporations they are supposed to be watching are the same people. its called “regulatory capture” and “revolving door”.<p>Speaking of over-generalizing ... also, &quot;There’s how things are, and how things should be.&quot; I do not believe that regulatory capture is an inevitable outcome of a democratic-ish governmental structure.')
