How long it took Mozilla to implement pull down to refresh on mobile version until 2020, 5+ years?<p>These devs WANT their product to fail, they don&#x27;t want success, they don&#x27;t want users, they just wanna get their weekly money and play and implement useless features nobody asked for. This is what happens with horrible management in Mozilla with Firefox going now extinct, Signal (pretty much same as Firefox not growing ant user base, even the uptick in recent days in molecule (drop would be overestimate) in Whatsapp ocean) and Wikipedia which is also spending money on projects completely unrelated to Wikipedia site, yet they dare every year ask users for donations to keep Wikipedia running without ads, while reality is they have money for years to run and if they didn&#x27;t waste them on stupid things even longer.')
