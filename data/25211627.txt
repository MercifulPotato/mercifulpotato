They&#x27;ll provide a report about how every IP address claiming to send on behalf of your domain is doing.<p>dmarcian does a great job of helping you make sense of these by grouping all of the traffic by sending source and then letting you drill down for more details.  There&#x27;s also a cool &quot;TMI Mode&quot; on the SPF checker if you have an account that will use the traffic from your DMARC reports to show you which parts of the record it&#x27;s associated with.<p>Each sending source (Google, Sendgrid, Mailgun, Mailchimp, etc) needs to be verified for DMARC alignment. Alignment is important because you can pass DKIM using a domain that&#x27;s totally different than the one that the message claims to be from. DMARC alignment addresses that gap.<p>* Disclosure, I work for dmarcian')
