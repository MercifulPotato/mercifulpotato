The screens on the Q2 felt like a resolution of something between 720 and 1080p, which isn&#x27;t that good compared to my dual 4k monitors.  Same with a 8k &amp; 6k 180 &amp; 360 video.<p>Overall VR feels like it needs a 4x resolution bump.  Basically a 16k 360 video rendering and 4k x 4k per eye vs the 1832x1920 per eye that the current q2 has.   To do that well you probably need something like a two 3080 GPUs, one for each eye.<p>Even after that, maybe even an 8k x 8k would give a big improvement.  We don&#x27;t have GPUs that can render that today.<p>Foveated rendering is definitely needed for this to become possible.')
