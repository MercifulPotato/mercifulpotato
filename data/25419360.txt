Putting it in pre-internet terms, it&#x27;d be like walking down the high street looking at shop windows to try to answer a question rather than going into a library to look it up in a book. Wikipedia isn&#x27;t trying to sell you something - with the high street vs library analogy its more like a book than a shop.')
