I think that there will be more of a reason for a young engineer to be a place like SF or Silicon Valley when things return to normal than for a mature engineer. I foresee lotsa cheap commercial real estate, which will enable young companies to start in SV. I&#x27;m less sure what will happen to the home and apartment markets, yet at least the prices will be stable or lower to start with. The more of a mature engineer you are, the more likely you are to be in a stable job where you can work remotely and may be inclined to either move away from the valley or never move in.<p>I could be wrong; the next few years will be interesting.')
