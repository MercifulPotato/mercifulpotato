I want it to succeed, but both WhatsApp and Telegram are simply a lot more convenient to use.<p>WA and Telegram have a pure web client when you want to quickly have access to your chats without installing anything.<p>If you decide to install the standalone clients you&#x27;ll find that Telegram is vastly ahead of Signal. You can change the spellchecking language and add dictionaries, you have a lot more options for formatting messages (code blocks etc...), it deals better with multimedia content like inline audio, it&#x27;s a lot faster and less resource-hungry.<p>The only reason I still bother with Signal is because I know that, in theory, from a security perspective it&#x27;s the better of the three. In practice it&#x27;s by far the worst though.')
