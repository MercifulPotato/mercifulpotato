In one party consent states (which are the majority of states), only one person (presumably the person doing the recording) needs to be aware of and consent to the recording.<p>That difference can obviously make a huge impact on the legal ramifications of recording. For example, during the Monica Lewinsky&#x2F;Bill Clinton affair, the only person actually indicted for a crime (later dropped) was Linda Tripp, who was brought up on wiretapping charges for surreptitiously  recording Lewinsky. This only happened because Maryland is an all party consent state.<p>This is also why customer service calls start with &quot;This call may be recorded for quality purposes...&quot; - it&#x27;s to inform you that the call is being recorded if you happen to live in an all party consent state.')
