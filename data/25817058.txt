In that case, there&#x27;s no difference between that person being a data scientist or a medical professional.<p>Do you care to expand on your argument, and perhaps provide support as to why, for example, it&#x27;s okay for a medical professional to also be an activist but not for a data scientist or tax accountant? Where&#x27;s the line, and why?')
