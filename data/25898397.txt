There&#x27;ve been more recent moves away from that (both elastic tabstops and indent-only-and-never-align are approaches) but they haven&#x27;t become universal so if you ever deal with code that isn&#x27;t from a tightly controlled group with practices against position-based-alignment, you are going to run into code that uses it.')
