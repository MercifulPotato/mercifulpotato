Item(by='mojuba', descendants=None, kids=[25559808, 25559712], score=None, time=1609167815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558879, text='The most dreadful thing in this industry to me is this: how many years of experience do you have?<p><pre><code>  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5+\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s it. Fin. More than 5 doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The truth is that the difference between 30 years and 5 years of experience in a particular field can be as big as between 1 and 5. I just want to ask, does anyone in the industry really care about this fact? Does it matter to any company out there? Have you ever seen a job posting that has say 20+ years of experience as a minimum?<p>As someone with 30+ years in the industry I&#x27;m constantly worried that nobody really <i>really</i> needs a coder with so much under their belt anymore. That nobody sees the value in a smaller codebase with fewer bugs and more minimalist and robust architectural solutions.<p>Dear industry (apart from some maybe very specific niches such as OS kernels, compilers and such), do you really care about the old experienced devs?')
