Modern elephant males periodically go through a process called musth . It’s sort of like the male version of going into heat. Their testosterone goes up like 60x and they become aggressive and even violent. They’ll even attack humans and other animals with little warning. A guide at Kruger national park in South Africa mentioned that they once had a spree of young bull elephants going into musth and attacking and breaking the spines of rhinoceros. I imagine if mammoths also went through musth they wouldn’t be particularly cautious about terrain hazards and the like')
