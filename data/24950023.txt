It is historically done by keeping some supersymmetry (for instance using Calaby Yau Manifolds) to keep the problem mathematically tractable. It is then a problem because no supersymmetry was found at CERN where it should have been (in some models) with this particular Higgs mass.<p>This however doesn&#x27;t mean that the theory has nothing to say. For instance AdS&#x2F;CFT from which this paper uses inspiration was discovered using ST, but is believed to be more general.<p>Also, i can tell you after working 4 years in the field: I think string theory (theories is more exact, there are at least 6) is incomplete: the part we understand is just a sector of a bigger theory where things are nice and geometric. For instance: many people say you cannot get flat vacuum in ST, this is incorrect some perfectly sound ST&#x27;s have Minkowskian vacuum.<p>Now for the hatred of some people against it (including many on this forum): some physicists in the field had big promises that were not kept, and that was a big mistake of them exposing their half-baked models to the public as it was The Solution. ST on Calaby Yau is indeed not the solution. On the other hand people like Lee Smolin and Sabine have overreacted (many times with bad arguments, and i respect their work and some of their criticism but it&#x27;s not like they have perfect models themselves..) to this and the result ugly: An open war and a beautiful field of physics which is now destroyed by personal egos, collapsing funding and no hope for permanent postions.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest, no one understands a thing at this organised mess we call Nature. Not even Witten.<p>In the end, be it MOND, ST, LQG, etc, etc they are just models, some models have no implementation in the real world but might be useful to improve our understanding of the world, this is how Physics works. It is very sad that people now think of ST vs LQG like one should choose her&#x2F;his religion, i find them both beautiful theories personally. It&#x27;s for a reason i left the field i can tell you.<p>Anyway: Nice result &lt;3')
