You can&#x27;t just make a person up; there are voter rolls. Whatever means you find of coming up with a name and address that will be accepted as a vote, you have to do it (here, hypothetically) 16,000 times. If you use real people&#x27;s names, which you have to because, again, voter rolls, many of them have already shown up to vote. The epollbook shows that on the screen, and you&#x27;re standing there being asked for ID by a suspicious poll worker. Meanwhile, you would need thousands of coconspirators, and count on none of them ever leaking. You face the prison sentence to end all prison sentences (we put someone in prison in TX for years for casting an invalid vote <i>accidentally</i>) and, if you pull it off, you have... a chance? of altering the outcome if the election is very close?<p>There&#x27;s a reason this just doesn&#x27;t happen, and it&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t make sense. As a prediction: America is not going to spend a lot of time and energy making you feel safer about it.<p>My advice to you is, next cycle, sign up as a pollworker. It&#x27;s so much more of a shitshow than you can possibly imagine, but I came away from it feeling paradoxically better about the process.')
