The weed burning mission in Far Cry 3 was one of my favorite gaming moments ever!! That mission and the one in Far Cry 4 called Advanced Chemistry bring up a smile on my face I didn&#x27;t wear a lot this year. \nThough they don&#x27;t share the same mechanics I love them. Thanks for bringing this up, it made my night. So looking forward to the new Far cry :)')
