Just recognize you have good fortune not everyone has, and help those who don&#x27;t if you can.<p>I&#x27;m like you, I&#x27;m fortunate enough to work for a company who took Covid seriously and has gone 100% remote, in a market sector that&#x27;s actually up due to Covid (grocery), so no fear of layoffs.<p>When this is over, I hope we&#x27;ll remember that those essential &quot;low value&quot; employees that we spend so much time arguing if they deserve a minimum wage or not were the ones out there every day exposing themselves cleaning the stores and restaurants, stocking our toilet paper, packing our Amazon orders, and generally keeping society functioning while &quot;high value&quot; employees like you and I got to hide away in our houses with minimal risk.<p>Hopefully we as a society can see and that and reconsider if maybe, just maybe we&#x27;re undervaluing these people.')
