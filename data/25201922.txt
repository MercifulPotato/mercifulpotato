I don&#x27;t believe the claims. Despite being in the same location three days a week for several weeks with my fellow classmates, it was only after I gave a presentation to the class and my (unusual, non-English, impossible to spell phonetically) last name appeared on screen that I started seeing my classmates in People You May Know. It was only female classmates and IIRC we didn&#x27;t even have mutual friends. Like you, I&#x27;ve been selective about going to people&#x27;s profiles since then.')
