Do you think the DMCA is working well for copyright holders and users?<p>The abuse of this would be massive. Let&#x27;s say I don&#x27;t like the comments you wrote so I email the host of the forum they&#x27;re on and say they&#x27;re defamatory. Now the host has to decide if they are defamatory (which is often a tough call even for lawyers) and also weigh the risk that I might file a costly lawsuit anyway. Or they just delete the comment.')
