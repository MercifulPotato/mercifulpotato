I was happy to see Amazon produce something similar in the Echo Link, and I&#x27;ve thought about &quot;migrating my Home&quot; to Amazon&#x2F;Echo just because of that, though I&#x27;m no happier about giving Amazon unfettered microphones around my home than I would be to give it to Google. One of the few reasons why I think the HomePod is such a fantastic, unique device; for all the wrong Apple does, at least they demonstrate a care for privacy.')
