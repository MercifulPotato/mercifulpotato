Everything there basically works. Most supported hardware just works out of the box with very little tinkering.<p>Of course there is less hardware supported than Linux and support can lag a bit, since there are few people writing drivers. But modern Thinkpads work quite well.<p>All that said, I have found Gnome to feel a little slow on OpenBSD compared to running on on the same hardware on Linux. So on OpenBSD I mostly use dwm, which feels super fast.<p>Generally most everything you want can be found in the ports tree.')
