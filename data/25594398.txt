Item(by='Volrath89', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609433834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developerjobs.world" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developerjobs.world</a><p>It&#x27;s a job board site specifically thought for developers. All the jobs are scrapped from companies&#x27; carreer sites.<p>I stopped adding companies&#x2F;countries because the visits to the site are underwhelming, not more than a couple per day. I unexpectedly got &quot;many&quot; visits from Nigeria even though there are no jobs from that country. Maybe I could try adding Nigerian jobs; if anyone has a github link with tech companies from Nigeria similar to the ones that exist for other countries I could scrape them')
