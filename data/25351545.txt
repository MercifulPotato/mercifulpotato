There is also photostructure, but they don&#x27;t seem to be planning to make mobile clients any time soon :|<p>One thing I&#x27;ve actually not seen is E2E contacts &amp; calendars.  Everything seems to be based on CalDAV &amp; CardDAV which I think forces you to sync them with a server in plaintext.  Email is mostly a lost cause, the closest you could approach it is something like protonmail AFAIK.<p>Also as far as &#x27;good&#x27; VPN providers, I think PIA &amp; Mulvad have fairly good reps.  Mulvad even lets you pay in mailed in cash.')
