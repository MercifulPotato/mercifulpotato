Item(by='darawk', descendants=None, kids=[25601786], score=None, time=1609483896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599472, text='I mean sovereignty in the sense of actual control. When you put your money in a bank account, you give up control of it to that bank. The money may legally be yours, but they physically possess it, and can keep you from transacting with it whenever they wish. I in fact just had this issue the other day. I have a company, and due to a clerical error with the state its registered in, my company was listed as being &quot;not in good standing&quot;, and because of this, Wells Fargo froze my accounts and wouldn&#x27;t let me transact for two weeks until I got the whole thing cleared up. That could never happen with a crypto wallet, because I have actual sovereignty over my crypto wallets, nobody can freeze them for any reason.')
