Thus it doesn&#x27;t fix the problem globally.<p>A hybrid solution might be possible if all (or most) service providers agreed to certain baseline restrictions on algorithmic optimization for engagement. Probably unrealistic, because there would be <i>all</i> incentives to cheat any such agreement in subtle ways.<p>While I don&#x27;t like various problems associated with it, I support the principle of freedom of speech.')
