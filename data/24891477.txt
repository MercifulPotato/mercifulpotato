There was a 700mhz penalty in that generation (3.5ghz vs 4.2ghz for the 7700k), but I kept it pegged for hours and it was rock solid.<p>Most laptop cooling is awful, but you can certainly find laptops that are well built if you look for it.<p>Not sure you should weigh bloatware, either. You can trivially install a fresh Windows or Linux and you have to on a custom built PC anyway. If you buy a premade PC, it probably comes with the same crap.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I switched to a desktop once the core race heated up - now I&#x27;ve got a 12 core 3900X.<p>I can&#x27;t believe how much faster it is when it&#x27;s using all the cores. Night and day. Highly recommended. And 12 cores is barely scratching the surface of the crazy workstations you can build these days.<p>For tasks 4 threads and less, it would be a bit faster than a current gen Intel laptop chip, but I don&#x27;t think it would have been worth the portability penalty to me personally if that&#x27;s all I did with it.')
