That&#x27;s why the best estimate, for me, is $0. The first thing to do is to do no more harm, and as we see from the enslaved-Germans example, reparations can end up being <i>another</i> injustice that needs to be repaired.<p>I am not opposed to fixing the unfair deficits caused by slavery, but I don&#x27;t think we need to (or that it&#x27;s ethical to) look at history to do that. We can simplify it to, &quot;Who was born with fewer opportunities? Who has fewer opportunities now? Who is discriminated against now?&quot;<p>In many cases, the most deeply affected parties will overlap with the people affected by the legacy of slavery. But we&#x27;ll also cover people who had generations of near-slavery (e.g. white Appalachian sharecropper who became timber workers and then coal miners), as well as people are suffering deeply from modern atrocities like the opioid crisis.')
