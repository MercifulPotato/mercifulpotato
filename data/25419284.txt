I would of course agree that these are useful to the individual.  Now coding - again the skill is neutral.  But what you code might not be.  Why do you code what you code?  Should you code in a bank, a facebook algorithm, etc?  Are you actually undertaking your life in a positive way, or are you making gains at another&#x27;s expense?<p>Do you think training is a neutral act?  Is it possible that training can be subversive to the trainee?<p>Perhaps you will see my position as a political, anti-statist one.  I see it as an individualistic perspective.  If an individual is trained in academic philosophy, in order to provide &#x27;production of well argued original works of academic philosophy&#x27; why is that valuable?  To me, there is no value there at all.  As an individual, I want to uncover the innate understanding we all already have.<p>Have you ever heard about people who go through half their life, having trained to be doctors, or solicitors, only to then realise that they didn&#x27;t want to do that?  I would say that these are the lucky ones - they have wasted only half their lives, and though they have much to undo, they at least they are honest enough to change their position and try to find something authentic and innate to them.  Most people do not do that.  That is the power of training and education, IMO.  In it for the money, sell your granny.<p>In my view, this is what training at a higher level is to train people NOT to look inside themselves for answers, but to refer to an external authority.  This applies to academic philosophy as much as any other area.  Love of wisdom, becoming oneself, makes way for the production of &#x27;original works of academic philosophy&#x27;.  Beyond the basics, education seems to me about disempowering the individual, for the benefit of some imagined &#x27;collective&#x27;.  In fact, that collective is so individual who has their hands on the levers of governance, but let&#x27;s not think too closely about that.')
