The battery even holds plenty of charge.<p>The App Store and Apple Music work fine.<p>The YouTube app stopped working because the app demands an update that Google didn’t make available for that generation of iPad. Watching YT via Safari still works.<p>My only complaint is that adblockers don’t work because that generation of iPad doesn’t have a 64bit CPU.')
