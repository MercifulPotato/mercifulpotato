Modern advice is to invest heavily in stocks--even as much as 90% stocks, 10% bonds--then withdraw no more than 4% of the original balance, corrected for inflation, per year. Historical back-testing as well as stochastic modeling shows that in this way you can expect funds to remain indefinitely.<p>(The details are a bit more complicated, and you might want to choose a smaller percentage like 3.5% or 3% if you are retiring at a younger age.)')
