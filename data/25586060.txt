I think I probably won&#x27;t use it much yet, as the example you mentioned (messaging apps for link sharing) works pretty well, and often they also have a view where you can just look at all of the links sent. Some ideas of what would make it more likely for me to use:<p>* The ability to integrate with those messaging apps so I could use SeeLink, but then send out those links to friends via different messaging apps. I often send out the same links to multiple people on different platforms, it&#x27;d be neat to be able to track who I sent it to and catalogue them that way<p>* A feature like related links, or some form of automatic categorization of links based on tags.<p>I think Pinterest is great for discovery, so if this is more about link categorization and social sharing, you could take it in either of those directions')
