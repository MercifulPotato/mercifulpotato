So, I&#x27;m quite comfortable at the command line and use it all the time. I think it&#x27;s interesting that there are nevertheless a few tools that I find indispensable which don&#x27;t run in a terminal: obviously, the &quot;big&quot; graphical apps (like those from Adobe) and web browsers, but even my apple track pad for scrolling works so well that there is nothing quite like it.')
