There&#x27;s plenty of math on every page. (It really crams a lot of math in).<p>The Science of Fractal Images is a bit longer. It has fewer colour plates. There&#x27;s a bit less math (or maybe it&#x27;s just spread out a bit more?) and there are some pseudo-code descriptions of algorithms.<p>The other two are much lighter. AK Dewdney&#x27;s books were aimed at general readers of Scientific American who had access to a home computer. Computers, Pattern Chaos, and Beauty is eclectic. There&#x27;s some math, and plenty of pseudocode examples.<p>Being honest: I don&#x27;t know how well they&#x27;ve aged. Other people might have better descriptions, or alternative suggestions?')
