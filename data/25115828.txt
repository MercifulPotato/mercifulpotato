We&#x27;re talking about the subject of a blog post, no?<p>I think the point boils down to expectation management: journalists (and ...) <i>barely</i> understand non-repudiation, much less why each of the following scenarios pans out:<p>* 2006 email + 512-bit RSA, leaked in 2006: probably authentic<p>* 2008 email + 512-bit RSA, leaked in 2012: potentially inauthentic<p>* 2008 email + 1024-bit RSA, leaked in 2008: probably authentic<p>* 2008 email + 1024-bit RSA, leaked in 2016: potentially inauthentic<p>...and so on. In sum: we&#x27;re making life harder for the people doing <i>real</i> investigative work (since they&#x27;re not technical), and we&#x27;re giving fodder to the people who want to conspiracize.  All because we&#x27;re using a <i>spam mitigation</i> technique to provide properties that it was never intended to provide.')
