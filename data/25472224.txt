I use IdeaVim inside jetbrains IDEs and it is awesome. Many popular vim plugins are also supported.<p>I still try to keep vim as close as possible as an open source alternative. Thankfully, a lot of editor features have been abstracted enough that the same software runs in vscode and terminal vim. e.g. ternjs for intelligent autocomplete in JavaScript, and the vim keybindings itself. Still, open source code intelligence isn&#x27;t as good as the proprietary intelligence of jetbrains, so I bring vim inside jetbrains.')
