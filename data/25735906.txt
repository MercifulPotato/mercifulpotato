It’s definitely buggy, I had to restart at one point because the game refused to allow me to reload in the middle of a fight, but claiming it’s fraud or “unplayable” is hyperbole.<p>I think people just got way too excited about from having nothing to do during this pandemic and then ended up really disappointed. I empathize with that but I don’t know, it’s a $60 game. That’s like four movies. I’ve enjoyed it more than the last four movies I’ve watched for sure.')
