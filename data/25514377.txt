The number of deaths from drug overdoses has steadily risen from 20,000 per year in 2000 to over 80,000 last year - with a sharp spike at the beginning of this year.<p>Edit: The paper that is cited in the introduction acknowledges that an increase opiate overdoses may be the underlying factor here.
