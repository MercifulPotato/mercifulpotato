Welfare as commonly understood doesn&#x27;t really exist any more in the US.  The closest is TANF (temporary assistance for needy families) but that requires you to have children and is time limited.  SNAP gives you food benefits but that is limited to 3 months unless you have a job or are in workforce training.  For the most part, your random homeless person on the street isn&#x27;t eligible for these and doesn&#x27;t get benefits.  The loophole is disability but that&#x27;s a pretty tough process to go through.  Not likely that many homeless can muster it.')
