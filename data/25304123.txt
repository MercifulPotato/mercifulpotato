There&#x27;s a fair amount of duplicated information, but both Notion and the Zettelkasten or easily searchable, and it&#x27;s trivial to copy-paste between them.<p>I really like the paper method for day-to-day stuff, but for research or work-related notes, I simply can&#x27;t write fast enough to keep up (particularly if I&#x27;m trying to capture info from a meeting), and the lack of searchability means I can never fully rely on paper notes as a means of retaining information long-term.')
