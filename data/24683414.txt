People have to exist, they need shelter, food, medicine, etc.  If these are denied they are not part of society, and thus the more brutal laws of nature apply.  I don&#x27;t like those outcomes, I vote accordingly.<p>If someone is rich enough to rent things to others, by definition, they have more than they need.  This includes landlords, banks, anyone that holds a legal title to something someone else is physically using to live.<p>Losses and deferments should be taken by banks, land&#x2F;property-owners, and generally the 1%.
