Using Elasticsearch to search your own webapp is not providing Elasticsearch as a service.  It&#x27;s using Elasticsearch to provide functionality in your application.<p>Providing Elasticsearch as a service means allowing people to upload their own data and giving them an Elasticsearch instance to search it.<p>There&#x27;s some grey area where it&#x27;s a question if you&#x27;re providing an application with a search feature or just hosting Elasticsearch.  Like if you provide a way to upload logs and then search them that&#x27;s Elasticsearch as a service.  But if you provide an automated upload, is that enough?')
