You can&#x27;t get this from the article above, but read other books he&#x27;s written, or listen to any of his talks on youtube. He&#x27;s not a humanist and he&#x27;s anti-enlightenment. His entire claim to fame is that he rejects the humanist idea of progress despite &quot;minor setbacks&quot;.')
