You can absolutely legislate the cost to the environment, to health, to sustainability. If making a widget causes $1 trillion in environmental damage to natural resources, legislating that the company is responsible for that damage is the solution. They either innovate to prevent the damage in the first place, raise prices of the product to cover all the costs (which would basically price out products that aren&#x27;t sustainable), or they go out of business and stop damaging the environment.')
