You going to exclude Germany, and have them align with China instead? It doesn&#x27;t make much sense at the geopolitical scale. (I know that some would even say there are no nations who believe in free speech. It&#x27;s just that the subjects that cause police and military in each nation to clamp down on speech are different depending on the society.) The lines are just very difficult to draw. If you exclude Germany on principle, would other EU nations still cooperate with you? It just gets messy.')
