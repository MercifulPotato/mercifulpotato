For rendering, the mesh is constructed and then rendered with some perspective&#x2F;distance&#x2F;occlusion settings etc. for each pixel painted on screen.<p>This format isn&#x27;t a discrete collection of points but some data set where every point queried during 2d painting returns a distance (if it exists) based on some function or ML algorithm, basically returning a point cloud?')
