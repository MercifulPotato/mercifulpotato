That&#x27;s kinda the problem, isn&#x27;t it? Who gets to define &quot;hate&quot;? And why ban speech that is actually legal (even if highly offensive) anyway? And if it&#x27;s worthy of banning on a major platform, why not just make it explicitly illegal? These are serious and important questions (among others) that seem to get conveniently glossed over.')
