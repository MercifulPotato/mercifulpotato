It&#x27;s weak evidence, and generally speaking, stronger correlation isn&#x27;t more evidence.<p>There&#x27;s a gradual process to go from hypothesis to theory to fact, and to get there, you need several types of independent evidence. Correlational evidence is okay as one of those.<p>A correct statement is that correlation is not proof of causation (no matter how strong).<p>Types of evidence:<p>* Correlation<p>* Theoretical basis &#x2F; strong hypothesis<p>* Extrapolation<p>* Interpolation<p>* Small-scale well-controlled experiments (lab setting)<p>* Large-scale less controlled experiments (real-world setting)<p>* Anecdotes<p>* ... and so on<p>You want several of those before you start to believe anything, and some are stronger than others. Correlation isn&#x27;t fundamentally weaker than most of those, though; all of those carry their own methodological issues. The number of times you can have a large-scale perfectly-controlled preregistered randomized control trial with no confounding effects is exceptionally rare (some medical trials, and a few other settings).')
