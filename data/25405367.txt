Item(by='Reelin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607851946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25405032, text='I thought the way you wrote it was clear but these comments got me curious what the various conventions might be so I took a quick look at :help in Vim (since it lists an awful lot of key bindings). I&#x27;m now officially confused and don&#x27;t think you can go too far wrong.<p>In some contexts :help notates things as characters (ex zh, zH, and z&lt;CR&gt;). In other cases I&#x27;m seeing things written as &lt;S-F11&gt; and &lt;C-G&gt;. There&#x27;s also CTRL-H (instead of &lt;C-H&gt;) but I&#x27;m not seeing shift written out like that for whatever reason. Sometimes they get mixed (I&#x27;m not sure what the rules are) such as for hh&lt;Space&gt; and hh&lt;C-]&gt;. Amusingly enough, :help appears to treat Meta-{char} as case sensitive but CTRL-{char} as case insensitive (I assume there&#x27;s a reason). I also spotted a &lt;kPlus&gt; (for the keypad).<p>What an amusingly pointless distraction!')
