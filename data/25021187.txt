But later on there were photos of Hunter Biden released that certainly depicted what I would describe as &quot;bad things&quot; (those things being drugs).<p>So pictures do exist that you can lookup yourself.  Unless you are going to go conspiracy theory about it, and say that the photos, that you can see yourself, are faked.<p>So... In retrospect, even if not everything related to the story is accurate, or there were some problems with it, we can now all but confirm that at least <i>something</i> was released that is not &quot;fake news&quot;, and that came from this story.')
