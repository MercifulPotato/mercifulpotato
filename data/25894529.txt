Here&#x27;s why we are better:<p>1)Inconsistency of the fruit means you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ll get. Each dose of Wozi is pre-measured for consistent results.<p>2)It is important to coat your tongue. With the freeze dried berries most of it sticks to your teeth and unless you are consciously swishing it and moving it back and forth left to right, you won&#x27;t get a great coating - half your tongue will taste sour and half will taste sweet.<p>3) There is no cue to know when you&#x27;ve gotten the full experience with the berries. You could swallow too soon and not get much of a change or waste minutes chewing it. We use pop rocks so that you know when it stops popping you&#x27;re ready to eat.<p>4) The serving size is 1&#x2F;2 berry. Our dose is the equivelant of approximately 2 berries. Also it may be $0.53 for half a berry, but it also costs $160 to get that pricing which is quite the upfront cost.<p>5) Not these guys, but other dried fruits still have the pit inside kind of like an olive. It is big and incovenient. You have to chew around it, spit it out, and if you chew it then you get a bitter taste.')
