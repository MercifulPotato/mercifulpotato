The answer people <i>want</i> is that the fact that measurements are repeatable is because they are giving us information about some kind of objectively real metaphysical reality, and that our measurements are a faithful reflection of that reality.  But that simply turns out not to be the case.  The reason measurements are repeatable is because of entanglement.  When you and Bob look at the output dial of a measurement apparatus and agree that it says &quot;spin up&quot; it is not because there is really an electron &quot;out there&quot; that was spin-up in point of actual metaphysical fact, it is because you and Bob, but virtue of having interacted with the same measurement apparatus, have become mutually entangled, and so you behave <i>as if</i> you were classically correlated systems (because of decoherence) even though you actually aren&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s it.  Like it or not, that&#x27;s The Answer.  And in retrospect it is actually pretty easy to explain why that <i>had</i> to be the answer, why God had no choice but to construct the universe in this way in order to make it work the way it does (or the way it appears to).  People resist this because they don&#x27;t want to believe that the actual metaphysical foundations of our universe are so radically different from our subjective perceptions.  The chair you&#x27;re sitting on just <i>has</i> to be real.  It <i>can&#x27;t</i> be an illusion.  Because if the chair is an illusion, well, then so are you.  And that&#x27;s right.  You are.  At root, you are living in the quantum Matrix, a simulation running on the cosmic quantum computer.  You may not like it.  Einstein certainly didn&#x27;t.  But that&#x27;s the way it is.')
