The majority of people who demand an apology aren&#x27;t the victims. They&#x27;re just random people on Twitter who are just looking for ways to attack people they don&#x27;t like. It may have been a mistake for someone to wear a mildly racist costume on Halloween a decade ago, but there is no reason they should be expected to apologize.')
