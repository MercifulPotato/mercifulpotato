We all know kids that grow up without father tend to have more often various issues in later life (I&#x27;ve seen folks like that everyday in pre-covid times, it becomes glaringly obvious once you know what to look for in their behavior).<p>But then also staying in cold detached relationship ain&#x27;t the best for the child either - they are very perceptive and seeing everyday cold parents relationship affects them negatively too. There isn&#x27;t a nice, quick and easy solution for everybody without some real chance of harm for the most vulnerable - that&#x27;s why it often becomes one&#x27;s low point of life. You know its bad for the person you love the most, and you don&#x27;t have a clear win scenario. Amicable split with good care from both sides is probably best, but unfortunately rarely seen.<p>Fuck I wish we were taught more these kind of things in schools (selection of life partner is tricky, test the relationship and each other hard before having children, but also things like effective communication, teamwork, how to generally thrive in system - ie taxes, how to setup a 1-man company etc.). Imagine nation of people raised like that, instead of memorizing tons of stuff that was forgotten very quickly but spent a lot of time&#x2F;energy on.')
