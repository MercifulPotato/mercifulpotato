It took minutes to &#x27;compile&#x27; the &#x27;scripting&#x27; language for me to run my changes in my development environment. That was as bad as the worst (mixed Java&#x2F;Scala) project compile times I&#x27;d experienced using a JVM language. Some&#x2F;most(?) of that might be asset handling, but &#x27;modern&#x27; toolchains don&#x27;t know their own cost or value.')
