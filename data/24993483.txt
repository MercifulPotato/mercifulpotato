Maybe an operating system keeps objects around for a long time, in which case the overhead of reference-counting diminishes towards negligible. But a web server will typically allocate a bunch of memory and then throw it all away on a per-request basis. If all of this is happening behind ref-counters, I think it will start to become noticeable. Of course, for many kinds of web servers it&#x27;s very possible to accomplish your goal using single-ownership. But it sounded like that wasn&#x27;t true in the OP&#x27;s case.')
