I am waiting for them to get that sorted out before I buy one. We have 2 Porsches now which are fantastic. I am committed to not buying another gas powered car at this point so I am looking forward to the other manufactures catching up with Tesla on their BEV offerings.<p>As a history - old 1960s Mustang, 1990s Dodge, 1990s Pontiac, 2000s MB ML AMG, 2000s Ford(s), 1990s Jaguar, 2000s Suzuki, 2000s Honda(s) (I loved the Element. Great car with small kids - if they made a new one I would buy it!), 2010s MB C-Class, 2010s Porsche(s). Hum. I am missing something...oh well.')
