Or maybe a microcontroller board with a WiFi module in ad-hoc mode.  Maybe coded in one of the education-oriented programming tools that the kid will be able to start using soon.  Or maybe old-school analog circuits over a pair of copper.<p>(Or, if you want the kid employable this year, maybe that means gluing together 10 different SaaSes that snoop on your traffic, building a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud for um reasons, using 3 Web frameworks, pulling in 1,000 NPM dependencies, and throwing in half a dozen third-party trackers. :)')
