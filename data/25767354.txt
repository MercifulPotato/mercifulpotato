Wireguard and Jason&#x2F;zx2c4 are not a non-profit, nor do they advertise as one. Why are you making it sound like he is doing something nefarious?<p>The argument for the ruling being bad is: the app links to the wireguard webpage (not within the app) which contains information on how to donate. That&#x27;s like if in my app, I linked to my twitter profile, and my twitter profile contained a link to donate to me. It shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.')
