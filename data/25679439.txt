Conjuring up CertificateTransparency-like public notaries might work, but who would run them? It would basically have the exact same operational requirements as DNS resolvers. Plus DNS is already &quot;inlined&quot; to the process.<p>This suffers from the same problem as the v4-v6 migration. There&#x27;s simply no good way to solve it other than biting the bullet and laying the new v6 pipes. (Though this is a bit easier, but getting DNSSEC off the ground, the root signed, getting root rollover worked out ... all of that like v6 deployment took more than a decade, and it&#x27;s just getting mainstream.)')
