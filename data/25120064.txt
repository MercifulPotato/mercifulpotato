That&#x27;s rather orwellian and social media platforms should refrain from censoring &quot;bad speech&quot;. Even legally prevented from doing so if necessary. Free speech protects bad speech. And yes, everyone knows these companies are &quot;private&quot; companies.<p>&gt; More fundamentally, however, do we really want Facebook to regulate the speech of more than 2.5 billion people?<p>Of course not. This is the problem with the pro-censorship people who view facebook as being evil and yet want them to be the arbiters of speech for billions of people.<p>&gt; The basic policy question—how to regulate speech on social media platforms—seems inseparable from another policy concern, namely how to deal with the concentration of power in technology.<p>Disagree. Regulating speech and anti-trust are two separate issues. If we break up these tech companies and they all collectively continue to censor &quot;bad speech&quot;, then we are right back to square one.<p>1. If these companies want to be platforms, then force them to be platforms. No picking sides, no censoring content. Whether it is to appease Trump, China, Israel, Saudi Arabia, DNC, etc. No legal content should be censored on these platforms. Make it a crime - meaning prison for CEO, board of directors, etc.<p>2. Maybe we should expand anti-trust from monopoly to duopoly or maybe higher. Why not say having at least 3 genuine competitors in a particular sector or industry is a societal good? So if a sector like search or OS or social media is dominated by 1 or 2 players, we use anti-trust to create more competition.<p>3. Beyond anti-trust, maybe if one company is just too big, even if it is not a monpoly, perhaps there is justification to break them up as well.<p>But the overriding concern at the moment is issue #1. Censorship. Then we can worry about anti-trust.')
