With an alarm we&#x27;d have known they were doing it.<p>Several years later I had someone crawl under my truck, cut the fuel line, and after taking all the gas they could get using a piece of tape to try and hold it back in place (I actually had this in my Facebook memories yesterday), a car alarm may have alerted me to that.<p>Then my mother&#x27;s boyfriend passed away around the same time. Someone flat out stole his decades old beater out of the driveway at night, again an alarm would have alerted them to it. Unfortunately for the thief the brakes barely worked and they didn&#x27;t get very far before plowing into another car and taking off on foot.<p>Car alarms definitely serve a purpose, and I don&#x27;t need Popular Mechanics to justify them or not.')
