For example, I don&#x27;t want all grannies in my town to get swindled out of their property by smooth talking scammers. Your freewill argument would allow for that.\nI think that is individualism taken to the extreme and is very unnatural and inhuman. As social creatures we care about others, especially because it is detrimental to us if others close to us are hurt.')
