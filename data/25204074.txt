In those long-gone societies, did the women really get to pick men based on looks? Maybe they didn&#x27;t get to pick at all, or maybe they picked based on survival resources.<p>In most cases, it isn&#x27;t even possible for male looks and female looks to be separately selected. That can only happen if a sex-specific gene promoter is in front of the gene. Most traits are selected without regard to sex.<p>So if selection by looks is mostly a matter of men choosing women, traits that create attractive women will spread through the population even if those traits are also changing male appearance in ways that women dislike.')
