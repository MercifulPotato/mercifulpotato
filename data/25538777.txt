(e.g. CAs MUST NOT\n  issue “*.co.uk” or “*.local”, but MAY issue “*.example.com”\n  to Example Co.).\n\n  Determination of what is “registry-controlled” versus the\n  registerable portion of a Country Code Top-Level Domain\n  Namespace is not standardized at the time of writing and\n  is not a property of the DNS itself. Current best practice\n  is to consult a “public suffix list” such as the Public\n  Suffix List (PSL), and to retrieve a fresh copy regularly.\n\n  If using the PSL, a CA SHOULD consult the “ICANN DOMAINS”\n  section only, not the “PRIVATE DOMAINS” section. The PSL is\n  updated regularly to contain new gTLDs delegated by ICANN,\n  which are listed in the “ICANN DOMAINS” section. A CA is not\n  prohibited from issuing a Wildcard Certificate to the Registrant\n  of an entire gTLD, provided that control of the entire namespace\n  is demonstrated in an appropriate way.\n</code></pre>\n--<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cabforum.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.7.3.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cabforum.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;CA-Browser-Forum-BR-...</a> (PDF)')
