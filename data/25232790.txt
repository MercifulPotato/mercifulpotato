In most contexts you never need to worry about them.<p>The operations you need to watch out for are addition&#x2F;subtraction, in cases where your result has much smaller magnitude than your inputs, causing loss of significance. Sometimes great care must be taken in implementing numerical algorithms to avoid this. But this is an inherent problem in numerical computing, not the fault of the floating point format per se.')
