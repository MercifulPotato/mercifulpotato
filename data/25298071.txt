Item(by='throwaway2245', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607047207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291654, text='&gt; This is a reasonable problem to teach students about for like 1 week at age ~10.<p>I&#x27;m afraid you have a completely unrealistic expectation of the median student (which is reflected in your other comments as well). I have taught hundreds of students and I would think a handful of them could answer this at age 10.<p>This type of question first appears on the Khan Academy in Grade 7, i.e. targeted at 12-13 year-olds.<p>There is a significant body of prerequisite work in the earlier grades, some of which is limited by what is developmentally appropriate.<p>Students will need dedicated practice to recall this and most won&#x27;t remember it after seeing it or mastering it on one occasion. It needs to be supported in the rest of the curriculum. You <i>might</i> be able to intensively teach it earlier, but it is hardly worth it, because they will completely forget when you intensively teach the next topic.<p>Many 15-year-olds will continue to struggle with this and, if they are well-supported, might be taught it as a step-by-step procedure in order to best score marks in the exam they need to. These students are unlikely to finish without a good concept of what they were doing - and might be more likely to pick it up as adults out of necessity.')
