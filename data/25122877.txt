It&#x27;s really only relevant for the introduction (on the low level that a skia binding is, SWT is surely just going through AWT), but echoes of the omission still bounced around in my head in the later bits, distracting me. A quick dismissal (good or not) would have made the rest much easier to read.<p>Unfortunately I find the last part a bit confusing: is this the lower level of the stack that beneath Compose Desktop? How is skiko related, or is it unrelated? Apparently Compose Desktop is built on Skijo (the github readme is much less confusing). Apparently the skiko build is also consuming skija as a dependency (in some very interesting ways, apparently planet kotlin still does enough java to lombok it), but the presentation on the blog would benefit a lot from a healthy dose of clear &quot;that uses this&quot; bragging.<p>All in all as a slowly greying java guy, it&#x27;s amazing to see this entirely unexpected breath of fresh air for the JVM. In this age of new desktop apps having been given up completely to electron and the like, desktop JVM could see a surprising renaissance as a lesser evil.')
