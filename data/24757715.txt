Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602527325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755557, text='&gt; Rather more of a life-threatening defect when the reason you can&#x27;t get a signal is that you&#x27;re driving through an unpopulated desert where there are no cell towers or other people.<p>Which wouldn&#x27;t happen. This is an anti-theft system. So are you saying that the anti-theft system would engage <i>while the car is being driven for a while by the correct owner</i> ? If that were the case, that would be an egregious defect that should be corrected.<p>The car is not disabling itself just because there&#x27;s no signal, that would be terrible. It disabled itself because it thought it was being tampered with. The fact that not even a Ferrari tech was able to get it going is actually a major endorsement for the system.')
