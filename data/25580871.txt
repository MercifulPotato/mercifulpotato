I strive for some exercise, daily. I really really long for those hours of solitude into the mountain, the physical exertion too. The sweaty and cold days. What you are referring to is mechanical repetition inside a gym or something, because one can feel forced to &quot;work out&quot;. Exercise can have any form and location. You can run, walk, swim, paddle a kayak or bike your way into nature and reap every benefit exercise has to give without feeling pain or tedium.<p>Sorry but you speak like someone who does not exercise a lot and thus perceives movement as a chore.')
