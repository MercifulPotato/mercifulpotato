No part of Oracle&#x27;s suit against Google relied on the claim that &quot;Java wasn&#x27;t open-source at the time Google copied it&quot; (for good reason).<p>&gt; they are really bad at shepharding, just look at the state of android java vs openjdk<p>This has nothing to do with copyright lawâ€•the thing that Google was sued for.  There is no legal argument in this remark (which is the problem with about half the comments that appear saying that Google was in the wrong), just an assertion based on an appeal to emotion that Google deserved to be sued, and then working backwards from there to present a half-formed argument.')
