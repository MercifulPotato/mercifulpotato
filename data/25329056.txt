Homepage hijacking and all the usual goodies.<p>For all the highly paid data scientists google paid, they somehow thought IAC&#x27;s business in this space was consumer positive when every metric must have been screaming that it was user unfriendly.<p>For me a lot of stuff people complain about google don&#x27;t make sense, removing subdomains from URL bar, I can see the argument for safety there. But this was straight google funded crap.<p>I wish some of the enforcement focused more on this type of stuff - straight forward google funded anti-consumer behavior. I wonder what made google decide to finally cut off the crapware.<p>Instead we are told google can&#x27;t cut of the absolute trash from IAC because it would be anti-consumer &#x2F; anti-competitive to do so. Regulators have their heads on totally backwards in this space.<p>Why don&#x27;t they go hard after the crap that clearly and obviously hurts users (there is so much of it).')
