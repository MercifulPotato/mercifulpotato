Even school children understand what Martin Luther King day is about; most American&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t tell you what Labor Day is about.<p>When there was a global movement for class based solidarity, the US found itself on the other side of the fight. (I&#x27;m referring to cold war era communism).<p>Even if a class based approach makes more sense now; there is <i>a lot</i> of institutional and cultural inertia behind a race based approach.')
