Item(by='boh', descendants=None, kids=[25702532], score=None, time=1610204463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700712, text='Oil prices are likely to decrease in the next 30 years (this according to the oil industry&#x27;s own estimates). The capital requirements for fracking are unlikely to change much (since this isn&#x27;t software). Pushing water through hard rock is expensive and technology isn&#x27;t magic. They haven&#x27;t gotten much better at it for the decades they&#x27;ve been doing it. Most of the output from a fracking site is extracted the first year, and then you have to find another site and setup again--this is expensive. The perceived success of fracking is due to private equity being able to fund a non-profitable business and then selling their share of the non-profitable business on the public markets that eat the losses. This trick hasn&#x27;t been working lately, so unless the price of oil dramatically increases, the fracking industry is going to have a difficult future.')
