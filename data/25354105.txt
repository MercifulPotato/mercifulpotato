Please excuse me if they are in jest...<p>&gt; I&#x27;d be willing to pay more taxes to help the economy, but most people are against this<p>They are against this because paying more taxes does nothing to &quot;help&quot; the economy. Where do you think tax money goes? It doesn&#x27;t go to people&#x27;s bank accounts to pay for rent, groceries, car payments, utility bills etc. or any of the places that would directly contribute to the economy.<p>&gt; In the mean time I do my part by eating out more often and visiting small businesses.<p>And as already discussed below - you are also screwing over the employees at those businesses. Quite literally costing them money they could make by serving someone who will tip... so they can, you know, pay for rent and contribute to the economy.')
