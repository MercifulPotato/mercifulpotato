Of course, an art historian might assume Leonardo&#x27;s mathematics was as great as his artistic ability.<p>In practice, no one has the time or the ability to be equally great in all fields of knowledge.<p>This paper : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00004-007-0055-9.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s00004-007-005...</a> talks about what mathematics he did<p>&gt; . The equation a^n + b^n = c^n does not have a solution in integers for \nn &gt; 2 . But this theorem had yet to be demonstrated. It was not before 1753 that Leonhard \nEuler demonstrated that the equation a^3 + b^3 = c^3 does not have a solution. And the final \ndemonstration of the so-called “Fermat’s third theorem”, which is that the general equation does not have a solution for n &gt; 2 , was given by Andrew Weil in 1993.<p>So its fairly impressive that Leonardo was on a path that leads to Euler and then to Weil. Of course, Euler himself was a &#x27;mathematical polymath&#x27; as it were, with a wide range of proofs across a number of fields.<p>To critise Leonardo da Vinci for not being good enough at mathematics is a little like complaining about Euler&#x27;s drawing skills.')
