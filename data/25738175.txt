Some iron-clad, dull, unbiased news channel isn&#x27;t going to solve anything. People like Taibbi will just pretend it doesn&#x27;t exist as it gets poor ratings.<p>We have right leaning people jumping ship from Fox News for not being pro-Trump enough. I would love for people like Taibbi to address how to reach those people, not rehash the same tired argument of complaining about the media.')
