It feels part of the system in a way a disk-loaded monitor does not.<p>Yes, the Apple II had several so-called &quot;copy cards&quot; that allowed you to interrupt a running program, explore memory, dump it to disk, etc. Very useful for debugging, and as you say, automatically cracking single-load programs. My Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;e had a Senior PROM installed, which provides similar features without taking up a slot.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can compare the hardware accessories for the C64 with the wide variety of expansion cards available for the Apple II. You could really customize your hardware. My Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;e had the above-mentioned Senior PROM, a CP&#x2F;M card for running Turbo Pascal, a 4 MHz accelerator, 9-voice music card, an EPROM burner, and a &quot;Quikloader&quot; card that allowed me to put my most-used programs on EPROMs and have them instantly available at a moment&#x27;s notice. Not quite like having a hard drive, but close. Later, I removed the CP&#x2F;M card and music card I didn&#x27;t use anymore and added 1 megabyte of battery-backed RAM.<p>&gt; The Apple II did not have the ability to talk to a printer or external disk drives without an interface card.<p>And that means you could connect it to your choice of a parallel or serial printer (just get the appropriate kind of card), or go with third-party disk drives that had 2x or 4x the capacity. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Man, I feel like I&#x27;m 16 again, arguing with my Commodore-owning friends about who has the better computer. Thanks, this is fun.')
