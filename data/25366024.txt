One of the most important things for weight loss (and anything else for that matter, up to and including break ups, as was in the original example) is <i>support networks</i>. I learned that lesson rather harshly when I went through a really ugly break up earlier this year.<p>Humans are social creatures, after all, and I can&#x27;t fault you for your original response.<p>We <i>need</i> others around us who are a positive influence.')
