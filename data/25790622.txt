A feline has better sight at night than a human. Any north-pole-searching human that (hungrily) goes out in the middle of the night might be attacked by night predators.<p>No &#x27;gaming&#x27; or &#x27;outwitting&#x27; or anything like that. And I don&#x27;t know much about &#x27;games&#x27; you talk about. It was no my intention to &#x27;game&#x27; you or to look smarter. But, please, if you need to, write a comment to this message to vent out anything you need to vent out. I promise I won&#x27;t care.')
