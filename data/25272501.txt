That&#x27;s the nature of people. They are not &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. They are just humans. Their actions are sometimes &quot;bad&quot;, sometimes &quot;good&quot;, but rarely are their actions consistently the one or the other. That&#x27;s just the nature of being human. In fact, it&#x27;s the entire reason we talk about &quot;justice&quot; in the first place.')
