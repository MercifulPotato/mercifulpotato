Most welfare states.<p>I cannot find any recent reports of anyone starving to death in New Zealand, for example. It would be national news if it happened and (rightfully) generate a lot of hand-wringing and introspection.<p>Just that the implementation gets complicated and politicised for various reasons.<p>Distributing food nationally is hard (consider cold chain, warehousing, distribution, managing expiry, dietary requirements, demand), so most welfare states distribute money instead and rely on the private sector to provide the infrastructure.<p>Giving people &quot;free money&quot; has it&#x27;s own problems. It gets political. People moralise. Beneficiaries never have enough, they might not spend on food, and they often have worse food choices available to them.<p>Since the government distribute money and not food directly, they have to add strings to stop people &quot;rorting the system&quot;. Those conditions can be a problem.<p>See for example &quot;food grants&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workandincome.govt.nz&#x2F;eligibility&#x2F;urgent-costs&#x2F;food.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workandincome.govt.nz&#x2F;eligibility&#x2F;urgent-costs&#x2F;f...</a><p>Food banks and free kitchens have to fill in the gaps where people inevitably fall through the beauracratic cracks in the welfare system.<p>People do go hungry when the system fails.<p>But the public view (multi-partisan) in well-off welfare states is that of course people have a right to live, and access to food is a part of that. It would be political suicide to suggest that anyone should be left to starve.')
