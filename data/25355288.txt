They didn&#x27;t.  The fact that they took control of it then changed it, even the web page, and then are not effectively killed the reason people are using it, is the thing I&#x27;m upset about.<p>If I effectively took control of the EFF and then a couple years later changed the website copy to say that the EFF is a vehicle for litigating cases that kbenson thinks are important, and then actually changed its actions to do so, would you argue the same points?  How is this any different?  Something that was a net good for many people has been taken over and eventually killed.  I think we&#x27;re all worse off for that.')
