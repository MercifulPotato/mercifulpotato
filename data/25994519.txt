If you&#x27;re the kind of person who hates them, you should.&quot;<p>It seems obvious after it being mentioned, but I noticed a useful corollary: a list of done tasks actually makes me unhappy. So I avoid todo pages where a done list is visible. Hiding done tasks (i.e. archiving done cards on Trello, deleting a row on your todo list instead of strikethrough), etc. has led me to use it better.<p>This isn&#x27;t your problem, clearly, but just wanted to share a useful tip.')
