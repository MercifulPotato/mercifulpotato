You think as a collective and as an individual at the same time.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of budget. When you do things that don&#x27;t matter too much to you, you are damn happy to think exactly like the next guy, reusing the existing knowledge as is without a second thought.<p>For instance: how do you boil an egg? For all I care, I leave it in boiled water for 10 minutes. I am more than happy to never challenge this conventional wisdom because I&#x27;m spending all my time trying to think out of the box while searching for a new sorting algorithm.<p>Now put a chef in my place. They could have their own specialized&#x2F;unconventional boiling technique while saying all sorting can be done with bubble sort.<p>Always restrict your conclusions within the appropriate context. For every person different things matter, you can&#x27;t think for yourself for every piece of knowledge. There isn&#x27;t enough time. If people didn&#x27;t copy and follow along (while inovating in their special domain) we would still live in the stone age')
