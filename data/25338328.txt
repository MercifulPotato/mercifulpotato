Then come to you, seeking for an answer.</i><p>&gt; <i>A quick read of such code becomes impossible. And when there’s a typo… Ummm… We’re stuck for long</i><p>&gt; <i>A fellow programmer who wants to work with elem in the second half of the function will be surprised… Only during the debugging, after examining the code they will find out that they’re working with a clone!</i><p>&gt; <i>First, the code becomes longer and less readable, and the second, a fellow developer may spend a long time trying to figure out what the underscores mean.</i><p>You can argue that the chapter is inappropriate, but I don&#x27;t think you can reasonably argue that it&#x27;s misleading.')
