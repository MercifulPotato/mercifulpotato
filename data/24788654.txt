These questions feel like they&#x27;re written to make the authoritarians look unreasonable. Which I feel they are, too, but the way it&#x27;s written the only way to give the more authoritarian answer would be to be either truly delusional or performing as if one were.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless, but it does mean that the midpoint is arbitrary. If nobody scores above 100 it says more about your test than it does about people.')
