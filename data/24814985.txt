Item(by='blisseyGo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602985993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24788974, text='Are there any examples when big tech has &quot;made a mistake&quot; or &quot;banned&quot; someone on the lefty leaning side by mistake? I have countless examples of right leaning views get banned and censored &quot;by mistake&quot;. When mistakes always happen to one side, the right loses faith in the system.<p>Simply pointing out a couple executives being republican doesn&#x27;t have anything of value. This isn&#x27;t about democrat vs republican. This is about democrats + RINOs vs Trump supporters. Having people like Mitt Romney or John McCain type republicans is of no value. Vast majority of Trump supporters dislike them.<p>I will give a couple examples - the Biden campaign keeps tweeting the same lie again and again about Trump not condemning white nationalists at the Charlottesville incident. This is an easily verifiable lie. Yet twitter nor Facebook ever marks this as &quot;debunked&quot;.<p>Another example - In October 2016 and October 2020, NYTimes put out articles claiming to have the tax data for Trump. They didn&#x27;t disclose any sources, nor was it verified. And if the data they had was correct, they obtained it illegally. Yet Twitter nor Facebook banned this on their platform.<p>Another example - last week, media ran stories with secretly recorded audio of Melania Trump. This wasn&#x27;t banned either.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from a few hour ago where FB deleted a post and restricted monetization by BabylonBee (satire) for &quot;violating our Community Standards.&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;The_Kyle_Mann&#x2F;status&#x2F;1317496668007231488" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;The_Kyle_Mann&#x2F;status&#x2F;131749666800...</a><p>Yet these platforms are now claiming the NYPost story cannot be allowed because it&#x27;s &quot;hacked&quot; data. It&#x27;s not hacked data plus even if it was, they don&#x27;t apply the same standard to news which might hurt Trump.<p>As for not being able to comment on the same thread, if that&#x27;s the case, then this is a very poor UX. Not being able to interact at all (I wasn&#x27;t able to for at least a day) on a topic you are passionate about makes the site pointless.<p>EDIT:<p>It&#x27;s strange how someone seems to be monitoring this 3 day old post on HN and flagging and downvoting my comments instantly.')
