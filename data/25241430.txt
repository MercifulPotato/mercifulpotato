You can hire more of them, so that they don&#x27;t have to work overtime. You can buy them better tools. You can rent a working space that actually contains rooms with doors. Etc.<p>Different people have different preference here. But if you have an open space, <i>and</i> zero budget for tools, <i>and</i> chronically understaffed projects, <i>and</i> the salary is kinda average... well, you send a loud message.<p>Try it the other way: let the veterans have their own room with doors, give them the tools they need, maybe reduce their work time to 6 hours a day while keeping their salary competitive... and most of them will be happy to stay.<p>Or be honest and admit that you prefer it the way you have been doing it so far.')
