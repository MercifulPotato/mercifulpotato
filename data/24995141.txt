A YubiKey essentially. This step is optional, but allows ballots to be assigned remotely.<p>- Election commission creates and maintains their own key pair.<p>- Ballots are assigned remotely to eligible voters by encrypting with citizens public key, or assigned in person. Ballots themselves are key pairs, and the commission throws away the private keys after assigning them. The list of ballots is published signed by commission’s key.<p>- Votes are the position + a secret encrypted by a voter’s private key, signed with the ballot. Votes sent to the commission and published.<p>Everyone can see which ballot voted which way, verified by the ballot public key. Voters can verify the commission didn’t keep the private key by verifying their encrypted secret. Votes are anonymous, cryptographically verified, and if a citizen ID system is used ballots can be assigned remotely so the entire election is remote.<p>No blockchain or specific applications are required for this system, just agreed upon key algorithms. The downside is keeping private keys secure is difficult compared to watching over physical ballots.<p>A system similar to this was used in the recent Hong Kong protest election, with the ballots issued in person.<p>Estonia’s system is insecure, relying on private closed systems to store, transmit, and tally votes. They have made changes, but AFAIK they don’t provide a way to publicly cryptographically verify votes or vote counts, and voting has to be done through a specific app.')
