Not so great for paying rent, attending college, or going to the hospital.<p>Pushing back comparisons to the 16th, 17th, or 18th century will produce a flattering comparison, and people should be aware of how much things have improved since then, but in a conversation about Amazon it&#x27;s not relevant. Companies like Amazon and Walmart have led to monopsony (buyer advantage) dynamics that have gutten communities, stifled innovation, and led to stagnant wages. The issue is that these companies wind up not just competing on their own comparative strengths, but take advantage of their size and market advantage. I notice you&#x27;re not singing the praises of, for example, Spectrum (formely Time Warner), because the obvious market power and complete lack of competence or innovation in that sector is hard to talk around. Amazon&#x27;s Bezos is actually pretty savvy, and Amazon leads to some lower prices for consumers and occasional innovation, so the damage to competition in various markets is easier to ignore. But these companies are dangerous, in that they can turn market power and cash in hand into political power, and they do. Size matters.')
