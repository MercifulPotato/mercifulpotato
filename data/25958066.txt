Turns out they don&#x27;t right now.<p>Fundamentals never matter &quot;right now&quot;. Fundamentals are about long-term investing and growing money over time.<p>Day trading is about speculation, not investing. WallstreetBETS has nothing to do with market fundamentals or investing money. This is the point of the Keynes quote &quot;The Markets Can Remain Irrational Longer Than You Can Remain Solvent&quot; - Markets don&#x27;t rely on the the &quot;fundamentals&quot; in the short term, only in the long term.<p>&gt;Everyone talking about what GME is &#x27;actually worth&#x27; is spouting bullshit.<p>That&#x27;s because in the long term, GME&#x27;s value hasn&#x27;t changed. GameStop the company is just as valuable as it was a month, meaning it&#x27;s basically worthless. Which means before too long the stock is going to crash and the majority of people who bought it are going to lose a lot of money, while the few who bought earlier will make out.<p>Whether it&#x27;s the legal definition of &quot;pump and dump&quot; is pretty irrelevant, because in practice it&#x27;s a pump and dump scheme, and is going to leave the majority of people involved with a lot of regrets.')
