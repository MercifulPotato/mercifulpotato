We could easily design them for longevity if we wanted to: lower the clock speed so that passive cooling is all that&#x27;s needed.  Make all the PC traces five times fatter than they need to be.  Use non-electrolytic capacitors.  The resulting computer would be big and slow but it would last forever.<p>In fact, it would not surprise me a bit if you could run a Raspberry Pi Zero for 100 years.')
