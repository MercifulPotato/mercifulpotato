Currently, a small minority of authoritarians (management is authoritarian by nature - and that&#x27;s okay) get to decide how much of the company profit is shared with employees. Now, employees get to decide alongside them. This reduces the power differential between the groups. Now they can decide what fair is on a more level playing field.<p>This is simply about improving the power differential between management and labor. If that means more money, so be it. It may well not. It might be more about working conditions or projects.<p>I guess my question to you is why do you demand democracy in government, but accept authoritarianism at work no questions asked?')
