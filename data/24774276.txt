Think direct insertion into higher-altitude orbits, in the style beginners in Kerbal Space Program do it - i.e. going straight up through LEO and only then turning sideways to gain orbital velocity.<p>The risk will be much lower (you&#x27;ll be spending very little time in the band filled with hypervelocity bullets), but it&#x27;ll also be <i>much</i> more expensive. You&#x27;ll need a much bigger rocket.')
