It&#x27;s driver-assist, which places it in the same category as navigation or cruise control.<p>If you compare Tesla to the other companies working on self driving, the only meaningful milestone where Tesla leads is the number of fatalities. The reason why Cruise and Waymo have not been as aggressive as Tesla in rolling out features to the general public is caution.<p>When it comes to gauging self-driving progress the most meaningful metric to look at is progress towards regulatory approval in more markets. It doesn&#x27;t matter how _capable_ they are, if they can&#x27;t demonstrate to regulators that they&#x27;re able to safely operate then they won&#x27;t be in the market. Tesla needs to step up and start making progress towards legally operating actual self-driving vehicles.')
