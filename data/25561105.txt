It would almost certainly have to be very vague and prone to being abused by malicious prosecutors. How would you set it up such that it&#x27;s illegal to sell an exploit to a supposedly malicious actor, but not illegal to sell or negotiate prices with the company maintaining the software or some other company that they deem to be their agent for managing security reports, per current White Hat practices?<p>Conspiracy convictions usually require proof that the suspect had created a plan to commit a serious crime and has taken active steps towards the execution of that plan, even if they haven&#x27;t committed the actual crime yet.<p>We&#x27;re already perilously close to US Federal Prosecutors being able to lock up anybody they don&#x27;t like indefinitely. It&#x27;s so exorbitantly expensive to fight Federal charges that hardly anybody really does, much less does successfully. The last thing we need is more vague Federal criminal laws with poorly thought out evidence and mens rea requirements.')
