Meanwhile our government (the Netherlands) tells their employees to use Signal. Good luck telling your forces in the Middle East: &quot;Please use this app that has breakable encryption, but it&#x27;s not breakable by the bad guys, at least, we are 98% certain they can&#x27;t break it. Also, we&#x27;re pretty sure the master key never leaked. Yeah we know how that went for the New York subway but we are better. It&#x27;s fine, don&#x27;t whine, even if they break the encryption, they don&#x27;t understand your Dutch conversations with your loved ones anyway. I mean, what have we got to hide anyway.&quot;')
