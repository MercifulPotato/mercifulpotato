People seek doctors precisely because they are supposed to have experience. Medical school is many years long precisely so you can build that experience.\nIf you just execute algorithms based on evidence you are a prime target for automation.\nThose in my profession (software) will automate your role away and do it better and faster and more available and more reliable. Because you make it easy for us. We may be cursed to solve only 80% of any problem but if you solve even less, we still end up ahead.<p>My point, all of the interest and investment in AI diagnosis (IBM Watson comes to mind, but the field is decades old) is caused precisely by the poor practices in the medical field. It is of course naive to think we will solve medicine with software. But we only need to be better than average just like self driving cars are not aming to be perfect, just better than average.<p>Be a HUMAN doctor and we will need AGI to replace you. Be a robot and you will be replaced by an actual robot.<p>(note: I do not believe technology is the solution here. I am just a bit pissed after  a doctor prescribed stuff without even touching or looking at an acquaintance.)')
