Opening the box to check its contents might significantly decrease the box&#x27;s value.<p>Opening collectors&#x27; items would be more akin to a museum trying to run a pristine old engine to test if it&#x27;s genuine instead of letting it sit for display. It&#x27;s the untouched nature of the objects that&#x27;s making these little bits of cardboard worth more than half a dollar.')
