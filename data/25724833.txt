They think this is the end of the road for a candidate that received 72 million votes. Even the Dems are desperate to impeach him so he can&#x27;t run again. Why else even bother with 2 weeks to go...<p>Trump will be back, that&#x27;s guarantee and he will be more popular than ever. These companies like Twitter, FB, etc are finished if he runs in 2024 and wins. He would have won this election if it wasn&#x27;t for a herculean effort by every Democrat and their supporters and add to that Covid 19, he would have won another 4 years.<p>This economy is going down the shitter real quick. Biden and his camp are in a lose lose. Only a mad man would have wanted to take over in these conditions. It is a guaranteed fail in the next 4 years...')
