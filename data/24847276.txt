Is there a reason to do graph-style algorithms in SQL?<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s such a far-off fit from the relational database problem. Any time you have a table with a relation to itself, there&#x27;s the potential to do graph-style algorithms on that data.<p>&gt; If the situation is delicate enough we need the database to be doing graph operations, why would we pick SQLite?<p>Perhaps it has nothing to do with the situation being &quot;delicate&quot; and it is just a simple matter of it being less work and less lines of code to use a graph-style query in SQL, rather than re-implementing the graph algorithms in your application code or having to bring in an entirely new database system just to process one query.')
