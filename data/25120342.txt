I&#x27;d summarize DDD as making Domain Concepts and Behavior primary, instead of the Data (and databases) being the focus.<p>That take is disputable.<p>Arguably, the focus of DDD is indeed the data, because the data structure is designed to reflect functional requirements dictated by the domain, thus serving as a model of said domain.<p>The focus of DDD is to implement that data structure that allows to model the domain, and from there drive the application design.<p>Databases are not relevant, though, as they are just an implentation detail of an external service. In fact, databases follow a persistence model, which more often than not is significantly different as it&#x27;s dictated by implementation details.')
