(Editing a parent post to reply to a child makes the conversation rather confusing, but I suppose you were rate-limited.)<p>I saw &quot;re-education&quot; in (at least) one of the posts here.  It seemed to be a direct quote.  I took that as being accurate.  I have not gone groveling through every possible tweet that she sent to check the wording.<p>So either the quote was accurate, in which case it was bad wording (at least) and the apology is perhaps a bit lacking.  Or the quote <i>isn&#x27;t</i> accurate, but is someone&#x27;s projecting their own opinion on what she said, and I&#x27;m a sucker for falling for it.  Naturally, I&#x27;d prefer to believe the former, because it makes me not the bad guy, but... you very well could be right.')
