I don’t think any of it stuck because I just didn’t care, it was just a bunch of adults adulting and I had no understanding.<p>It wasn’t until I was in high school that I had any appreciation for the human side of it all and how it was so much more than things that happened before I was born.<p>So, to be fair, it’s entirely possible this was part of our education and I just reserved zero synapses to its retention.')
