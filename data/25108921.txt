Our federal structure was a compromise to keep the U in the USA. So it is expected that each state will do things as it sees fit. China is an authoritarian state that needs tight control in order to maintain the status quo, so of course it was able to quell the pandemic. South Korea and NZ are both small and relatively centrally governed. The UK, Canada, and Australia all have public healthcare or public options. None of it is true in the USA. We have chosen not to have a public option in healthcare for the working age population, so we shouldn’t expect to be able to put down pandemics easily or even with difficulty.')
