During the randomized trials, until the data are evaluated nobody is even supposed to know who received the tested substance and who received placebo. Many people in the trials received placebo and still became infected. Some died. Outside of trials, we know that one and half million people died while the development and the trials had to be done and there weren&#x27;t no vaccines at all. And eventually, not all vaccine candidates pass all the trials.<p>So it <i>is</i> definitely an event of historical significance that should be celebrated. A lot had to be done right so that all of us can now talk about this.')
