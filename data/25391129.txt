We&#x27;re talking enough to reduce visibility to 10 feet over several block areas.<p>This was blocked by a court order, which was skirted by the local police department soliciting the irregular fed squad to do so instead. The feds were overstepping their jurisdiction in doing this outside of the very narrow perimeter of the ICE facility and fed court house, but in the current environment the proper legal channels to address this are willfully deaf.<p>One of the more reprehensible tactics the police bureau used was to deliberately kettle and push protestors down residential streets, delivering massive amounts of gas as they did so. This resulted in children trapped in their homes unable to escape the gas as well.<p>What happened in my town this summer should alarm everyone, no matter your political creed.')
