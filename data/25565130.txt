I find that having arr[-1] point towards the last element of the array can hide accidental off-by-one errors. It&#x27;s also a bit weird how the arrays are zero-based if you access them normaly but one-based if you access them backwards. IMO it&#x27;s more consistent to make the negative indexes behave the same way as an out of bounds access like arr[arr.length + 1]')
