Do you have an contemporary actors in mind that operate on the same level as CIA? Because it seems to me like there is much concern about other &quot;conpetitors&quot;, but I do not know of any. Not to be missinterpreted, I don&#x27;t say there aren&#x27;t spy agencies from other countries trying to do similar things, I&#x27;m saying I am not aware of any that operate on a similar scale and range as CIA. Interested in learning about those')
