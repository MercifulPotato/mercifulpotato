E.g. &quot;2) Covid mortality vs. flu mortality&quot; section appears to put IFR for covid of those at age 80 at 0.16%? Yet, we have entire countries that aren&#x27;t far off from that number for population fatality rates, let alone infection fatality rate.<p>Wait.. I was just assuming this had to be an IFR comparison, because for something like this, anything else would be disingenuous. I should assume less. It looks like it is comparing annual mortality of flu with the current mortality of Covid-19.<p>1. We&#x27;re still far from a year into notable spread of Covid-19.\n2. Normal flu seasons don&#x27;t have lockdowns, masks, bans on large events, etc.\n3. In digging a bit more, this uses the 2017 flu season as a baseline, which was one of the worst.<p>This site is actually a great example of Covid-19 misinformation. It has a veneer of authority - Swiss Policy Research as a name sounds like it might be credible. And, it presents what, on first glance, appears to be claims grounded in science (and hey, nice graphs and all!).<p>But, one starts digging into the claims, and it starts to become clear the flaws.<p>jasonv: there are a lot of pseudoscientific resources out there with respect to Covid-19. This looks to be one of them. It&#x27;s more essential than ever to vet what you&#x27;re linking to these days.')
