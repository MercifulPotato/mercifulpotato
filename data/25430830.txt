I think people do currently feel societal pressure to be accepting of LGBTQ people. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily good or bad by itself - it just reflects the changes in society.<p>Should parents feel pressure to be accepting of their children&#x27;s lifestyle if they come out as LGBTQ? Yes.<p>Should parents feel pressure to be accepting of their children&#x27;s desire to transition if they identify as a different gender? No, because that&#x27;s permanent, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll later come to view that as a mistake. If they still want to do that as an adult - then that&#x27;s when they can do it.<p>To try and get back to what I think you&#x27;re digging at - should girls be pressured into sex acts in porn which used to be seen, or are still seen, negatively because they&#x27;re more normalized now thanks to porn? - No. I don&#x27;t think people should be pressured into sex acts.')
