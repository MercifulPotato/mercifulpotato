Your job goes, you go.<p>The problem is you will forget this at some point and start thinking a particular date actually cares about you personally.<p>Do yourself a favor to save your future self some pain.  Take your CV, in paper form, roll it up into a cylinder, and dip it into latex.  You should have a latex wand of about 8 inches in length.  Wrap it with a few hundred dollar bills, gift this to your date and run away as fast as your feet will take you.  You’re welcome...you’ve just saved yourself 10s to 100s of thousands of dollars and many hours of misery.<p>Details may vary depending on gender, economic status and the local currency.')
