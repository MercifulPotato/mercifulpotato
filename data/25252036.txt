Item(by='sbuk', descendants=None, kids=[25252239, 25252563], score=None, time=1606727531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251158, text='&gt;Yes, we are talking about that Apple which integrated soft fuses that can be triggered remotely, and will brick your device physically.<p>Care to expand on that?<p>&gt; We are talking about that Apple which sued a recycling vendor in Canada because they recycled devices instead of trashing them.<p>That&#x27;s incorrect. They sued the company because they were supposed to take the devices apart and recycle&#x2F;recover the parts. Not resell them as manufacturer refurbished.<p>&gt; We are talking about that Apple which bribed judges in the US to deny its endusers the right to repair.<p>Again, please expand on that.<p>&gt; We are talking about that Apple which removed even the audio port of a device to prevent its competition to breakout of the locked hardware with their &quot;upgrades&quot; like better cameras, or even payment systems that wont be supported by Apple.<p>Arguably, for the 2 things you have mentioned, the Lightening port would be much better suited. They took out the headphone jack because wires are a pain in the ass and the state of the art for wireless headsets is good enough for the majority.<p>&gt; We are talking about that Apple which even changed their goddamn shell from the BSD fork because they didnt want to &quot;open source&quot; (Apple thinks this is zip file dumping) their own bash, which was the only reason bash was outdated for decades.<p>So brief history of the defaults shells in macOS. First 3 releases it was tcsh (BSD - inherited from NeXTStep), then for a while, it was the GPLv2 version of bash (last version to be released under GPLv2 was 3.2), more recently they moved to zsh (MIT). The critical part to get here is licensing. The GPLv3, like it or not, is a controversial license. Apple have an issue with GPLv3, so they avoid software that uses it. Frankly, when bash transitioned to GPLv3 is when Apple should&#x27;ve made the change, but that is a different discussion.')
