It&#x27;s a misguided move that will only make users more helpless and the web more mysterious for them.<p>I&#x27;m increasingly encountering users that have trouble understanding that they should copy the URL to someone if they want to share a web page with them. Humans are logical creatures: if they see a part of the system that is constant, they will deduce that it could not have had an impact on the part that is changing. In the case of the URL this is an incorrect conclusion, but the UX from bad actors like Apple and Google is steering the user towards it.<p>If the intent is to show the host more prominently, then the URL should be visually split into the (more prominent) host part and the path part. The path part should not be simply hidden.')
