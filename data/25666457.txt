I don&#x27;t care for these people or their politics, but the way the media, politicians, and the public are reacting, this is going to only make this so much worse.<p>They truly believe there&#x27;s a deep state that rigged the election. Throwing around using the 25th Amendment, calling them <i>all</i> terrorists committing treason&#x2F;sedition, is only going to reinforce that the deep state is not only real but using every tool they have to attack them. The constant attempts to silence them by deplatforming and a whole host of other shadowy methods is confirming that the media, big tech, higher education, is full of people that not only despise them but with they would go away forever.<p>If we keep going down this path I guarantee violence is coming. 50 years from now we&#x27;ll end up seeing the Oklahoma bombing as the opening salvo to what came next. McVeigh went full terrorist after Waco&#x2F;Ruby Ridge. Don&#x27;t give these people the confirmation they&#x27;re looking for.')
