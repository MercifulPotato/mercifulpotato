Item(by='masklinn', descendants=None, kids=[25621668], score=None, time=1609680432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621458, text='&gt; In US weeks more of W53&#x2F;2020 lies in 2020 than in ISO weeks<p>Your error is in assuming every week is uniquely identified as a week-year, but that&#x27;s only true in ISO week numbering.<p>In ISO, every week-year is exclusive and whichever week contains January 4th is the first of the year, so 2020-12-28&#x2F;2021-01-03 is 2020-W53 and 2021-01-04&#x2F;2021-01-10 is 2021-W01<p>But in the US whichever week contains Jan 1st is the firstâ€¦ and whichever week contains December 31st is the last of the previous year. Meaning the same week can be <i>both</i> X-W53 and X+1-W01 (aka the US system has overlapping &#x2F; partial weeks at both start and end of year).<p>This is exactly the case this year (and most years, really), the week from December 27th (Sunday) to January 2nd (Saturday) contains both January 1st and December 31st, meaning it&#x27;s both the last week of 2020 and the first week of 2021.')
