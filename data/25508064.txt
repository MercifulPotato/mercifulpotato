If you are (as the article states) using Signal as a protester to &quot;communicate securely with their teams marshaling protestors, discussing tactics...&quot; I would definitely enable self destructing messages in short time frame.<p>Also in order to get to the Signal data storage you would first have to defeat the encryption of the device itself (ie. the encryption used by Android &#x2F; IOS). I would assume that anyone who uses signal and really has something to hide has disabled fingerprint or face id and uses either a passphrase or pincode. It&#x27;s going to be hard to ever access the signal storage that way.')
