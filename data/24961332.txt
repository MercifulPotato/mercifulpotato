Item(by='dathinab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604254764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961256, text='Yes, also just after posting I noticed you can&#x27;t have unsized values living across await in generators without some major changes or something.<p>The problem is that when you create a generator it doesn&#x27;t yet know the unsized field it only knows it when creating it in a `poll` call. But it only will call poll after pinning the generator at which point you can&#x27;t really grow the size of it for a bunch of reasons including that growing might move it in memory (realloc) which you can&#x27;t due to self references...<p>So you would need the size of the generator when generating it.<p>Which could somewhat be possible but not really with current rust features, i.e. it would need a lot a special care.')
