Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610531838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745847, text='I refuse to buy or wear any clothes with prominent branding and I would never privately wear branded merchandise for a company I work for. Work stops the second I walk out the door to go home, I am not an advertising billboard. If they want me to wear branded clothes at work, I&#x27;m not going to buy it myself.<p>In general, a big flashy logo signals that the brand itself and people&#x27;s reaction to it matters more than the quality of the garment. I&#x27;ll grudgingly accept a small stitched design on a polo or dress shirt, at least those tend to be very minimal. Stitched designs can <i>sometimes</i> be carefully removed, but often the tight embroidery stitches will have distorted or ruined the fabric underneath.<p>Luckily it is still possible to find good quality clothes with no (or very minimal) branding, but you have to completely avoid fast fashion and main street stores. I&#x27;ve been able to completely excise all clothes with prominent branding from my wardrobe and I&#x27;m never going back.<p>The only exception I make graphic designs is for band shirts, but I feel that&#x27;s different from corporate branding.')
