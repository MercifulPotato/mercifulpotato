Take a traffic dump! Use strace!<p>I have encountered a fair amount of cases where that does not work.<p>- debugging a super large program ? loading gdb may take two minutes while recompiling to add a printf only 3-4 seconds.<p>- not an admin on the machine you are and the person with the admin account is not around ? sorry, you can&#x27;t debug on macos (and likely in some linux distros)<p>- likewise, no traffic dump (and I&#x27;d assume no strace) if you don&#x27;t have root access')
