Then the answer is likely yes.<p>Federally, the US EEOC has a page listing the &quot;Prohibited Employment Policies&#x2F;Practices&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eeoc.gov&#x2F;prohibited-employment-policiespractices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eeoc.gov&#x2F;prohibited-employment-policiespractices</a>). It makes no references to political orientation or social causes.<p>Also its not covered under the &quot;Civil Rights Act of 1964&quot; as well.<p>Certain states have protection against job discrimination for public employees based on political affiliation which would cover your &quot;Do you vote Republican?&quot;. However as you said its a consulting firm, so not applicable.<p>NOTE: IANAL, my SIL does HR and that was her quick answer.')
