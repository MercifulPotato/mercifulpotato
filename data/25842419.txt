The DMCA mentions “linking”. And while it’s a big stretch to say that a torrent or magnet link is a “link”, they do tell you “how” to find something. If that something is copyrighted, I could see an MPAA lawyer arguing that a torrent “links” to the infringing content. Although, OTOH, if I told a friend to “go to thepiratebay.org and search for $movieName”, it would be harder to prove I’m infringing. It’s a very gray area.')
