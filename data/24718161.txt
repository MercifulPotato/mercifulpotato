I&#x27;ve heard about studies that talk about the negatives of caffeine, as well as some that talk about the benefits.  But none of that <i>seemed</i> to be pushing an agenda.<p>Practically everyone around me thinks they <i>need</i> caffeine to get through the day.  I&#x27;m one of the only people I know who are caffeine-free.<p>Long ago, I thought caffeine gave me headaches, and I refused to drink it.  Then I started having trouble staying away during the day and nothing the doctors did mattered.  So I turned to caffeine reluctantly, and it helped for a while.  Eventually I was drinking so much caffeine each day that I was getting sick from it.<p>So I cut back, and then I was falling asleep during the day again.  (Or at least feeling exhausted and that I needed to sleep and kind of took a waking nap.)<p>So I cut off the caffeine again and, no big surprise, it&#x27;s the same as when I was drinking caffeine.  Except that I don&#x27;t get any caffeine-withdrawal headaches when I can&#x27;t get enough or forget to drink enough.<p>I know from the past that telling people they don&#x27;t <i>need</i> caffeine doesn&#x27;t work, though.  They just won&#x27;t listen.  They have to figure it out themselves.<p>So yeah...  If there&#x27;s an anti-caffeine education here, it&#x27;s very subtle.')
