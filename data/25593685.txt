The Hindenburg was 200,000 cubic meters, so $48,000 of hydrogen.<p>So, hydrogen production facilities can fill very large balloons and send them off into the sky with little altitude controllers like the Project Loon balloons. They can then do their best to navigate the Earth&#x27;s air currents to move themselves to pass over energy consumers. When an energy consumer needs more hydrogen they can send a powered airship up to grab a nearby hydrogen balloon and bring it down for harvesting, paying the producer in the process.<p>Really the best part of this solution is that it will create an underworld caste of sky pirates who use their airships to steal hydrogen. We can only hope they wear vaguely Victorian clothing and wear goggles.')
