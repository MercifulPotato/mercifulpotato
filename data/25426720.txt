Item(by='viraptor', descendants=None, kids=[25426863], score=None, time=1608003909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25426407, text='&gt; Q10 is at least a little bit secret sauce.<p>I wonder what&#x27;s really the limit in Q10a. For example companies will have huge recommendation models built, likely very automated without manually assigned labels. If they never ask for &quot;“yes,” “no” for whether the natural Person is of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin&quot;, but one of the automated recommendation dimensions is close to 1:1 match for that question, would they have to disclose that? (i.e. give statistics per-dimension)<p>This applies to the rest of Q10 too. 1000 top attribute values? Does &quot;around vector (0,0,0.3,0.9,....)&quot; count? Because barely anyone asks explicitly for the real user attributes anymore.')
