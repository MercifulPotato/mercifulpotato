And charged like 1000$ for it ? Have you used that crap ? My wife has it and I was laughing my ass off at how terrible the device was - the viewing angles on the screen were better on 400$ HP devices.<p>Apple keyboards have long been subpar, they have no touchscreen or 2in1 offering which is a perfect form factor for my mobile computing (iPad pro is nice but iOS only that&#x27;s a deal breaker for almost any professional).<p>And the beloved macos was super rough in Catalina.<p>I need to develop for iOS occasionally so I&#x27;m forced to use a Mac or swap arround, but I&#x27;m sorry - Apple laptops were a bad deal for a long time from most perspectives - I would personally get an X1 over any previous MBP.<p>M1 and pricing change that for the first time in a long long time - I would recommend this laptop to anyone buying a device in this category.')
