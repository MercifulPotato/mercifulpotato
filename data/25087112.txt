In particular, unlike most historic statically-typed languages, TypeScript gains no performance advantage from types; it literally compiles down to JavaScript before running. The only possible advantage is developer productivity stemming from type checking and other tooling it enables.<p>TypeScript is extremely popular.<p>Obviously there is some subjectivity here. Different people can have different opinions. Different kinds of projects may call for different approaches.
