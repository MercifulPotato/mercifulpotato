As Tim Cook said, &quot;When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don&#x27;t consider the bloody ROI&quot;.<p>Aside from the monetary benefits (or lack thereof), if one product focuses on accessibility and another doesn&#x27;t, the small subset of users who need those features may encourage or force a larger number of users to use the more accessible product.
