Our brains pick up and zoom on details subconsciously (and &quot;compress&quot; the uninteresting background) so you remember the details &quot;bigger&quot; than they are in reality.<p>That&#x27;s why medieval cities on paintings have often towers twice the height compared to a photo of the same view. Same thing happens when you look at the Moon and then make a photo of it (without zooming). You have to zoom 2 or 3 times before it looks as big as &quot;in reality&quot;.')
