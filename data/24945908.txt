I mean, yes, if you have a third party candidate <i>in isolation</i> then whoever that third party is going to &quot;steal&quot; more votes from is going to oppose it.<p>So democrats would oppose a Green or other progressive candidate in (most races in) New York, sure.  That&#x27;s just self-interest.  But for the same reason they&#x27;d clearly welcome a libertarian entrant.  That&#x27;s not responsive to the discussion.<p>The claim upthread was that &quot;both&quot; parties oppose ranked choice voting.  And that&#x27;s simply not true.')
