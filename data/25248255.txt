It was effectively adding support for a new Radeon variant chip of an existing GPU generation. There was definitely a deep dive into the platform and I reverse engineered the proprietary Radeon firmware CPU architecture in the process (which nobody had done before), though, so I think I get some credit for that. But e.g. the userspace side &quot;just worked&quot; after a few trivial library patches; AMD&#x27;s entire userspace blob GL&#x2F;Vulkan driver worked completely unmodified once the kernel side was fixed up.<p>This would be adding support for a completely different GPU, which is a whole different ballgame and order of magnitude of complexity.<p>That said, as many hours as went into the PS4 Linux project, it was a hobby thing and I&#x27;m pretty sure if you add up the hours spent on the GPU side it wouldn&#x27;t hit one month&#x27;s worth of full-time work. I&#x27;m also offering a whole different order of magnitude of time investment here.')
