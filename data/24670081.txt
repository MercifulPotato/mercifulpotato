Optoma makes several 4K models, and you can buy a screen of whatever size you want (silver ticket on amazon for instance). They’re fairly inexpensive if you just want a 1080p or even one of the lower end 4K models, and none of them have any ‘smart’ tech. No malware, no anything. The immersiveness of a 100+ inch screen beats any TV, and if you want, you can hide the screen when you’re not using it. I would never buy a TV again. You also get to use real speakers, and because the system is much more modular, you can upgrade components much more at your convenience. Your friends will be jealous of your movie and gaming experience, but in the end you’ll probably have spent the same as you would have on a TV anyway.')
