Lobbying for guns and interest group cooperation is not a  conspiracy in that sense.  Propaganda, PR and political influencing is not conspiracy in the conspiracy theory sense.<p>School shootings are not part of anyone&#x27;s plan (except the shooters).<p>Moore tried to reveal the extend of influence and manipulation, not to reveal some new sinister group with secret plot or &quot;everything is connected&quot; in some completely new way that explains shootings.  Advancing ones own interest and that having a negative side effect of school shootings is not a conspiracy theory.<p>Conspiracy theories have the  belief that certain events or situations are secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful forces with negative intent.')
