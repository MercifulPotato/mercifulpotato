And then you&#x27;re at the mercy of the software and anything (such as the OS kernel) which that software depends on.<p>We do teach Computer Science &#x2F; Software Engineering students not to do this, showing them e.g. the Therac-25 incident as an example of why software control isn&#x27;t enough - but well, check out how many HN regulars are proud that they either didn&#x27;t pay any attention in class or never attended and are &quot;self-taught&quot;.<p>SANE (the Free Software document scanner software) has run into cases where it&#x27;s just cheaper to have code that checks &quot;Is this the end of the bed? If so, turn off the motor&quot; than spend five cents on a limit switch or one cent adding a stop so that the scan head physically can&#x27;t fall off. Somebody reverse engineering a driver sends &quot;Move scan head&quot; and, to their astonishment, it falls off its rail and their scanner is broken. Oops. Now, who feels comfortable shipping that to users knowing if your finished driver didn&#x27;t catch every edge case you might destroy their scanner?')
