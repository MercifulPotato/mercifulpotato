I then spent a year jobless, due bad health and social skills. I was 2 months ago diagnosed (after an assessment) with autism spectrum disorderd and bipolar disorder type 2. Since 2 years I have a job at an electronics assemblage company. However there are some problems at work. There are just 5 people who do some design&#x2F;programming.<p>In September, I was transferred from the design department to the production &#x27;test&#x27; department due bad performance at my job. Projects being over budget, while I wasn&#x27;t aware of what the budget or expected timespan was. A lot of things to went wrong. At the same time, I did a lot of programming work during my free time for the company. During April 2020, I was officially on unemployment benefits due to Corona, but I did work 10 full days anyway. I feel like a scapegoat at my company, because I&#x27;m the programmer at an electronics production firm and they are the electronics people. My boss didn&#x27;t like that I did software must of the time, but that&#x27;s what my team asked from me.<p>Now I have to do manual, repetitive work like testing: taking a PCB, check if it works and put a label on it. That has been my life last months. I haven&#x27;t seen a schematic or oscilloscope closely the last months, while they said that I will &#x27;learn electronics&#x27;. I feel miserable and depressed at work. The only thing that kept me reasonably sane was a &#x27;hidden ear piece&#x27;. \nI use this to listen to podcasts about cryptography, programming, bioinformatics, finance, electronics, just anything that interests me.<p>My question is: how I could pivot myself away from this job into some other job&#x2F;career? I started contributing to a Qt open source project during my weekends. The idea of going freelance seems alluring, but it also something new.\nOne thing I find hard is that I feel numb most of the time.')
