Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605412648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098037, text='&gt; An incorrect perspective.<p>No, it merely emphasizes things that you do not consider and ignores things that you consider relevant.<p>&gt; Fascism is sacrificing one set of the ownership class for another, diverting populism directed against a hostile liberal economic system to only part of that class while giving more power to the rest of it. Fascism is characterized by privatization, not central planning<p>Fascism is characterized by an alliance between state and corporate leaders. Its not truly private if the state still controls your production.<p>&gt; I can critically examine them and always have been able to.<p>Good, then you should be able to respond to arguments that question your preferred perspective on property rights by defending it rather than assuming it to be the case.<p>&gt; Should I interpret this to actually mean, &quot;until you change your opinions on them&quot;? I figured there would be an accompanying pushback about them, but I don&#x27;t see one.<p>You should interpret it as a gentle nudge towards considering the pushback you have already received in a new light.<p>&gt; Again, this seems to just be, &quot;I disagree&quot;. A fruitful conversation would be one where we can have a discussion and real exchange, not vague dismissiveness.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in debating over the factual accuracy of the deplorable conditions in the soviet republics and satellite communist nations. I consider that (alleged) fact to be settled, you do not, there&#x27;s nothing to be gained here.<p>&gt; Historical and economic analyses are rarely simple matters of fact and this is a subject where dealing with other perspectives is a necessity.<p>This is true.<p>&gt; None of what we&#x27;re discussing is at the level of simple facts, they are interpretations depending on a large set of suppositions and historical knowledge.<p>The factual dispute I referred to is our disagreement on the quality of life of the soviet and communist citizens under state controlled economies. I&#x27;m uninterested in your revisionist account alleging that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t that bad.&quot;<p>&gt; But I welcome a discussion.<p>Lets return to the issue of property rights. How do you justify imposing your opinion on property rights on other people who don&#x27;t share that opinion?')
