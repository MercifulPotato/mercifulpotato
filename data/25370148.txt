One feature which would be nice: extend line segments to the whole plane. Right now, only partitions created by the line segment alone are counted, so even if you begin a line ‘before’ a dot but inside an island which would partition that dot if extended, partition is not counted.<p>In other words: For all points on an island which are either the beginning or end of a line segment, extend the segment from that point to infinity in the other direction. Maybe show this extension while the line is being drawn.')
