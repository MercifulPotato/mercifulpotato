Item(by='danbruc', descendants=None, kids=[25822054], score=None, time=1610976877, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810015, text='I have known this perspective on time for quite some time but never really thought about it much further until now reading this article.<p>Doesn&#x27;t this imply that presentism is the right view or at least the one Occam&#x27;s razor would suggest and not one of the block universe models? One could say without a fundamental time dimension there are not enough dimensions for a block universe to begin with. All of the universe would really exist in the same moment, a kind of true now, while each observer could invent his own frame-dependent time dimension and assign time coordinates to events in the normal way so that the laws of physics formulated in time become simple.<p>Not withstanding this the evolution of the state of the universe could be fixed - ignoring the complications of non-determinism or probabilistic laws for simplicity - by the laws of nature so that one could still think of the universe as a block universe once one has established a time dimension.<p>It still feels very weird to me to think about the evolution of the universe without any time. I understand that I can rexpress a circular motion x(t) = (r cos x, r sin t) as r² = x² + y² without reference to time but how do we recover the ordering of positions as time progresses without time? Just saying that from position X you will end up in position Y given some specific velocity at position X seems somewhat problematic to me as the velocity is a time derivative and time we do not have.<p>On the other hand it doesn&#x27;t really matter because the idea alone of the state of the universe changing without any time for the change to occur in doesn&#x27;t compute in my brain. And if there was such a time, wouldn&#x27;t a time for the universe to involve in have to be a different time then the one we can invent inside of the universe to write simple equations? But couldn&#x27;t we then link those times and arrive at a unique global time within the universe after all, some kind of preferred foliation of spacetime?')
