There are no UB sourced &#x27;optimizations&#x27; being implicitly disabled and none have been expressly enabled. As long as valid code compiles it&#x27;s on the humans that wrote the code (or that triggered it&#x27;s writing in some higher level synthesis tool).<p>Expanding on this; I don&#x27;t want compilers _making_ optimizations based on UB.  I want them educating the programmers so that the UB can be eliminated at a human level and correct outcomes are the result, optimized if it makes sense.')
