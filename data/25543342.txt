I started using google a long time ago before bing was even a thing and now I know that i use google mainly due to inertia. The weird thing is over the year my searches have gotten much more narrower, and i usually end up viewing results from reddit, amazon, stackoverflow and a hand full of megacorps. I&#x27;m really not even sure how hard search is when most of the information people want to see is concentrated in a few websites. Google used to be a lot more useful back in the day when i would scour page after page looking for information from obscure one off websites.')
