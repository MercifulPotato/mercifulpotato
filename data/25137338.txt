Japan had invaded Manchuria (which had never been Japanese territory)in 1931. Japan had secured some rights from Imperial Russia to operate the South Manchuria Railway Zone. They leveraged this to expand their foothold in China and Manchuria; the Chinese government was too weak to really contest this and eventually the Japanese directly attacked China.<p>There&#x27;s no way to paint the conflict in the region as justified. The Japanese were clearly seeking to expand their empire, after having tasted victory defeating Imperial Russia. Just because countries stood in their way doesn&#x27;t justify their actions, and simplifying it down to fighting Mike Tyson isn&#x27;t very critical thinking.')
