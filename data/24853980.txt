Are you describing &quot;opt-in&quot; vs &quot;opt-out&quot;?  I.e. all advertising would be made illegal unless the user explicitly consented to seeing it, which could be done in exchange for free access to services?<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;d be compatible with e.g. the first amendment (especially the unfortunate recent ruling in Citizens United).<p>And I&#x27;m curious as to what exactly your system would look like in regards to such currently ad-supported services as Google Maps, Gmail, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, etc.  Would your expectation be that most of these would have to become subscription or pay-per-use services with no free tier?  Because I don&#x27;t see any world in which all of the free services would continue to exist as-is without any ability to monetize themselves through advertising revenue.')
