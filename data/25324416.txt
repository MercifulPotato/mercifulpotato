Similar applies to contracts in general, where a party tells the other party that at some future date, and&#x2F;or under some condition, they are committing to exercise some clause in the contract.  It&#x27;s almost as if the message is a courtesy notice, an advance warning, of what the first party is <i>going</i> to do.  They haven&#x27;t done it.<p>In &#x27;at will&#x27; locations the effect is much the same as quitting the same day because the company has the power to &#x27;let you go&#x27; without giving a reason anyway - although the company must still comply with the contract, discrimination law, its normal operating procedure etc.<p>But even though the effect is much the same as quitting immediately - you are let go and employment ends - for anything where the difference between &#x27;resigned&#x27; and &#x27;terminated&#x27; matters, for example rights to government support, or loss-of-job insurance payouts, the company deciding to terminate early is a &#x27;termination&#x27;.')
