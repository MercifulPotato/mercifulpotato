I asked a couple times what triggered it and they simply didn&#x27;t asnswer that part.<p>So it was some ML black box. They themselves don&#x27;t even know why they did it.<p>Same thing is probably the case here, only with even fewer or shittier humans in the loop, and holding something hostage that you can&#x27;t take elsewhere.<p>Actually hostage isn&#x27;t even the right word because even kidnappers&#x2F;hackers respond to the email and return your stuff for a price. These guys aren&#x27;t even doing that.')
