I see lot of people coming to conclusions such as &quot;drivers don&#x27;t matter&quot; after reading such articles. I don&#x27;t agree with that.<p>No one is gonna put Albon or Giovinazzi in the Mercedes and think &quot;he&#x27;ll be fine, we&#x27;ll still win&quot;. Hamilton and Schumacher kinda put themselves up there to be in the position to dominate with the right team of engineers. They put themselves up there with their driving and team building skills.')
