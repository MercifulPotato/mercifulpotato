Masks did become mandatory elsewhere. Mostly in targeted spots in the cities such as the zeil in Frankfurt and Potsdamer platz in Berlin and I can tell you that it is met with strict enforcement and that people are adhering to the rule ardently with very few exceptions. The article and much of the science leaves much to be desired.<p>It is my opinion that the “all or nothing” pro mask people are actually obstructing the science. Their intolerance to confront or question evidence that is contradictory or unexplained anomalies in the data such as this article is dangerous to actually having the right response to covid leads to nonsensical draconian rules like the California mayor suggesting requiring wearing a mask 24 hours a day and only removing between bites when eating.')
