He was not alone:<p>&gt; <i>David Eddings, an American novelist who was most famous for his epic fantasy books, once gave the following advice to new writers:</i><p>&gt; <i>“My advice to the young writer is likely to be unpalatable in an age of instant successes and meteoric falls.

At that point, you’re ready to begin.”</i><p>&gt; <i>That same advice has come from a number of other sources—it’s tough to determine just who said it first.
