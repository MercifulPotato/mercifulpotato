I think it really depends on your personality. Engineers tend to be conscientious, orderly, industrious types. Being industrious typically means being a self-starter who takes the initiative and is probably self-taught.<p>That said, intelligence (g factor) isn&#x27;t simply being conscientious. Being intelligent means that your personality is flexible and you&#x27;re able to apply different aspects of your personality depending on what the situation calls for. Conversely, less intelligent people are generally stuck with the personality they have and are less able to modulate their behavior depending on the context.<p>Anyway, I used the StackOverflow analogy because it&#x27;s more likely to resonate with the HN audience. The point was more about knowledge and relying on others as a crutch to avoid having to think for yourself. It&#x27;s not inherently a bad thing, but doing it too much has consequences that may not be obvious.')
