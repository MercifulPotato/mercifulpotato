Even while they live their lives in  are often no picnic, whether they&#x27;re in a shelter or in the wild.<p>Also, if you have, say, a cat and you don&#x27;t get them neutered and you let them out what are you going to do with all the kittens?  If you don&#x27;t let them out, the endless confinement could be argued as a form of misery itself.<p>Then you could argue about having pets at all, but then what about all the cats and dogs that live miserable lives in shelters or are unwanted or abused in other homes?  Wouldn&#x27;t they be better off with you?')
