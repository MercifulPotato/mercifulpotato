They want the &quot;Historic&quot; label, but in reality it&#x27;s Fantasy. Modern fantasy is a fertile ground for fun, diverse and &quot;history inspired&quot; stories. But trying to rewrite history with the excuse of &quot;but it&#x27;s fiction&quot; is wrong, and I agree with the author, irresponsible and dangerous. But I guess the marketing is too tempting, AC:Valhalla should instead be positioned as Skyrim, not as a &quot;moderately historical accurate game with more diversity&quot;.')
