I&#x27;ve seen it happen at a couple of companies where someone high-ranking suddenly &quot;retired&quot; or &quot;resigned&quot; and it was obvious that it was a face-saving way to get them out the door. I could see the word &quot;resignated&quot; being used for these face-saving faux-resignation&#x2F;retirements.')
