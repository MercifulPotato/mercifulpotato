The effect can be heard when you&#x27;re in the center position between many speakers and the content is produced for that. But, if you move your head while wearing the headphones (which should help you figure out where the sound comes from) the change that gives you the idea &quot;where something is&quot; won&#x27;t be heard if the headphones aren&#x27;t able to &quot;know&quot; that you moved your head at that moment and adjust the sounds accordingly. For adjustments, typically a lot of computation is needed. In VR or AR the same effect could give you a direction information of everything virtual around you. The virtual door on the right of you scratches, and as you approach it you hear the noises louder, as you turn your head, the noises are obviously from behind the virtual door... etc.<p>Edit: to answer the &quot;stereo&quot; question: so it&#x27;s about the audio mixed in more than 2 channels, or VR and the like effects.')
