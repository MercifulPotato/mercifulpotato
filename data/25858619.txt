Doing so forgets a basic principal of archology&#x2F;anthropology:  The people of the past weren&#x27;t all that different than us.  Go to any city in the world today and you will find ancient coins from all over the world.  An ancient roman coin in Vancouver doesn&#x27;t mean that ancient Romans visited Canada.  Even if that coin is found buried in a landfill, we would assume it traveled to Vancouver recently and is tied to a museum, collector or tourist.  Why then do we think any different when we dig up a coin from the past?  People and coins moved about then just as they do today.<p>How about the inverse: a modern coin found buried in an ancient location?  That would be DoctorWho level &quot;odd&quot;.')
