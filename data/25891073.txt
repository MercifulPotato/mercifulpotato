You try to pay something with contactless but there&#x27;s a long processing delay. The terminal will then time out and ask you to insert the card and enter PIN, and you will get something strange printed on the receipt like &quot;CVM: offline PIN&quot;. You may then see the transaction pop up in your notifications a few hours later, or early the next morning.<p>Also, some merchants do offline or semi-offline transactions as a matter of course. London Buses, for example, accept contactless payments via bank card. But the transaction must be processed very quickly and the mobile data connection is not entirely reliable - the bus could be in a tunnel or a coverage black spot. So what really happens is the transactions are batched and processed at the end of the day (this also allows them to do some post-processing for multiple-journey discounts, daily price caps, etc).<p>Someone like London Buses isn&#x27;t overly concerned about fraud because the transaction values are low. But they do have a way to blacklist cards numbers that are known to be bad.')
