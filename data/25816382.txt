I sold a huge and somewhat expensive 21&quot; CRT monitor on CL and the buyer asked me to deliver it. When I got to his door, he cracked it open and said just leave the monitor in the hall. The apartment was completely jammed with stuff.<p>Making people who need your stuff pay you in stories or &quot;gratitude&quot; does not appeal to me anyway. Even if I have a $5 item to give away and someone just flips it for profit, that is time they spent and I did not, so the item is still gone from my home and someone who actually wants it gets it. The fact that one other person also benefitted doesn&#x27;t bother me.')
