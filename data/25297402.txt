Things will get messy. If you also talk about slavery then you also should not forget all the white slaves of the same time period.<p>I think that the most unfortunate fact about the end of American slavery was that the oppressed did not overpower the oppressors. At least not directly. As such there was no real liberation.<p>I have been thinking if it would have been best if all the black people would have been deported back to Africa. It would have given greater dignity that I feel is something that is really missing in the larger picture. Imagine if nobody in US was there because their ancestors were a former slave.<p>The world is complex.')
