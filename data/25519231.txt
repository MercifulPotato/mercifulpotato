Item(by='amadeuspagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608740709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516573, text='I discovered so many wonderful documentaries thanks to youtube, some about things I had never heard of before. &quot;It’s in YouTube’s interest to keep us watching for as long as possible&quot;, and the way youtube keeps me watching as long as possible is to recommend stuff that I want to watch. I don&#x27;t understand the problem with this metric. Is it that some people watch things they don&#x27;t really want to see, like a trainwreck? But why do these people who compulsively watch things that they don&#x27;t really want to watch keep checking youtube at all? Why don&#x27;t they hit the dislike button? Wouldn&#x27;t that adjust the algorithm?')
