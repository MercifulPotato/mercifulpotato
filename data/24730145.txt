Science is a method of drawing conclusions about data. Sometimes, those initial conclusions can be misguided by incomplete data. The world discovered this virus less than a year ago. It takes some time to determine the different transmission vectors and risk factors associated with each. The CDC did not make a claim based on their &quot;guts&quot;. The initial stance on masks was determined for a few reasons:<p>1) People often don&#x27;t use masks properly. They often touch their masks and their faces. The initial thinking was that the virus spread largely through touching contaminated surfaces.<p>2) Mask mandates are difficult (as we are seeing now) and significant portions of the population refusing to use masks undercuts their efficacy.<p>3) There was a shortage of PPE when the pandemic started. The CDC and NHS didn&#x27;t want to find themselves in a situation where hospitals had a hard time procuring masks because scared citizens hoarded the supply.<p>The anti-science issue in the US appears to have a few prongs to it. There has been a growing distrust of science for quite some time with the anti-vax and flat earth movements. I&#x27;m not sure what caused it, but it sadly appears to be a growing trend. Also, as we are seeing with the Coronavirus response, a lot of people seem to misunderstand that scientific consensus can change as new data is collected.')
