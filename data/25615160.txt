It doesn&#x27;t mean that. The syntax type : lifetime indicates that the values of the type MUST BE ABLE to outlive the lifetime. It doesn&#x27;t mean that they NEED to outlive the lifetime.<p>This means, for example, i32 : &#x27;static even in the case doesn&#x27;t live the whole &#x27;static lifetime. It COULD live, though, if the author of the code allocated it statically.')
