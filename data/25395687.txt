I think it varies based on how good the person performing the intubation is and how long it is in.<p>The first time her voice ended up like minnie mouse, and it was like that for a long, long time. Probably a year before it became &quot;normal&quot;, but definitely not like how she used to sound. It kept slowly getting better.<p>A few years later her voice was mostly back to how she sounded before hand and had been for while, then she had more health issues and was intubated again. This time she was fine - no voice change and no pain that she reported. A few months later, intubation, but this time her voice was pretty bad and it never got better before her passing.')
