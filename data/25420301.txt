There is a very high degree of polarisation and conformity in the media and among public figures. I don&#x27;t know that the population is actually that polarised. The media would like us to think so, so every Trump voter is presented as a caricature of a Trump supporter, and every Biden voter is a caricature of a SJW activist. But that&#x27;s not actually how people voted. People rather voted to the centre at this election. There is some correlation but I don&#x27;t think you can call it a camp.')
