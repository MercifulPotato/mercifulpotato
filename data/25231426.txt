Nothing on the ARM, Qualcomm, or MediaTek roadmap is even close.  The Cortex X is a baby step in the direction of the M1, but the M1’s architectural advantages (gigantic memory bandwidth, 8-way decode, re-order buffers twice as deep, specialized instructions for x86 translation and reference counting atomics, and so on) remain untouched.<p>Hopefully this lights a fire under some of the other chipmakers and they’ll adjust course, but we’ll see.<p>In the meantime, it’s almost embarrassing for the rest of the industry just how far ahead Apple’s chips are.  It’s been that way in smartphones for a long time now, and now it’s coming to laptops and desktops.')
