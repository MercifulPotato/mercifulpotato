I don&#x27;t care as I would just like something like it for my own use. Some credit would be cool. This took me all of 5 minutes to think about so it isn&#x27;t like a great effort was liquidated.<p>Call me a google aficionado. Or google fan (is that even logical?). I would like to see google beat my idea over the head of Amazon. Since I know they have wanted to do something like it for a while now. So here is the plan drawn against the Amazon corporation:<p>Google Maps Menu<p>a story<p>So you search for a business on google maps one day.. and you notice a button beside most businesses in the results list, labeled &quot;menu&quot;. Intrigued by this new button, you click on it and it shows a rounded rectangle scrollable box. In the box you see items which you can purchase from this business. Thinking.. hey this is google, this is cool, you select a quantity of your item(s) and checkout with google play. During checkout you agree to flexible delivery costs but you set an upper limit. You are told you have to set an upper limit to delivery. You are told at that point that if you make more purchases the overall delivery fee will be lower. You are like man, I should buy everything this way to get covid free deliveries. You make a bunch of orders, services, products, food. The web page tells you&#x27;ve saved 33% on delivery costs.<p>In the next scene, where the order is received: the shop keeper gets the order bagged and ready, and sends the ready signal to google. The munchins inside of google&#x27;s computers dispatch the driver to pickup deliveries in all those make shift drive throughs popping up everywhere.<p>In a reasonable amount of time later, you get your orders.<p>The end.<p>Until tomorrow')
