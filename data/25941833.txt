They could easily spy on their political opposition, dissidents, or simply work out where and how to most effectively target their political campaign for the next &quot;election&quot;, so they can stay in power. Heck, even collecting just the metadata could have serious consequences.<p>Because, who checks the government and makes sure that the master key is not abused by those in power? The scariest part is that it all can be done silently, behind our backs, without us ever knowing what&#x27;s really happening. You will never find out if your message was decrypted and read.<p>Remember, it all starts with the banner of &quot;fighting organized crime and terrorists&quot;, but that is just an excuse to an even bigger treasure trove of information these people want. I&#x27;d say giving these people that much power is much more dangerous than anything else.')
