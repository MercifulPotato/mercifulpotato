So to sum up, the world was always complex, but recently we started to uncover this complexity, and in order effort to uncover and manipulate the physical world, we&#x27;ve introduced our own complexity and systems. Makes wonder, once most of human needs are met and we stabilize with the ecosystem, will the complexity we introduce to the world also stabilizes?')
