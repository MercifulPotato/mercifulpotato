Complaining about the syntax tends to suggest less about the Lisp than about the person complaining, viz. that they have not learned Lisp, or that they have and did not enjoy the experience.<p>By the same token, if we go searching for code in a 20-years-dead language and make wisecracks comparing some random sample, to something that&#x27;s had many years of development since; irrespective of whether it is representative (and it isn&#x27;t, particularly), this still doesn&#x27;t say much about what might&#x27;ve been.  As a more equal basis of comparison, I remember working with the CSS and HTML of twenty years ago, and this was invariably excruciating.  The CSS we work with today is the result of two decades of polishing, and it&#x27;s still mediocre, inconsistently implemented, and still riddled with issues and oh-for-heavens-sake-why-can&#x27;t-it-just-do-X moments.<p>Back to the point, however; the canonical DSSSL application was DocBook, and we can still visit the much more lovely DSSSL source at its resting place in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docbook&#x2F;dsssl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docbook&#x2F;dsssl</a>.')
