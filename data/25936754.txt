They are subject to manipulation by a single compromised person in a voting precinct through the system&#x27;s &quot;adjudication&quot; process. In some precincts, DVS machines were failing at a rate of 70%, leading all ballots to be sent to the precinct overseer who literally just clicks and drags ballots into whatever candidate they think the person voted for. Doing this actually changes the record. Yes, the original ballot record gets destroyed and a new one gets created. It&#x27;s that insecure. These machines also require USB transfers between ballot machines and a central machine. In some cases thousands of votes were found a a USB thumb drive weeks after the election. DVS is that convoluted and that bad.')
