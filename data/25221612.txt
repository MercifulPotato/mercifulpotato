The point of these code systems was not to keep a secret but to significantly reduce the cost of sending telegrams which charged by the word (and were handled by humans so you couldn’t save money by omittingspacesbetweenwords — the clerk taking your order would just put a stroke between the words and would declare the charge.<p>I originally learned this because, back when we had paper appointment books, they also often included appendices with handy info: time zones, common abbreviations, etc and when I was a kid, vestigial telegraph codes. Dictionaries often had sections with stuff like that to, and these were quite important in translation dictionaries.<p>Into the 70s phone trunks were quite limited and you often had to reserve a long distance phone line ahead of time, so telex&#x2F;telegraph survived quite late.
