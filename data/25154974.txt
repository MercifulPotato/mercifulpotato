One of the great things about WSL 1 is that I can run Linux tools on my laptop without the memory overhead of a VM. My laptop only has 8GB of ram which is not enough for Windows and a Linux VM to comfortably share, but plenty to run the Linux tooling I want under WSL 1.<p>On my desktop with 16GB of ram I can just run Virtualbox. WSL 2 solves nothing for me. Like the author I am very skeptical that WSL 1 will be maintained going forward but I hope it is.')
