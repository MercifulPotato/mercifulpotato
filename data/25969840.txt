There is no way one can tell from this set of information if the FAA is right or wrong, or if SpaceX is right or wrong.<p>If this was some kind of engineering magazine, then you could expect in-depth details to the systems in place and mechanisms that failed. But this is a Reuters article, so I don&#x27;t expect much technical details from it.<p>Regardless if anyone was harmed or not during an accident like this, standards should be enforced no matter what, if only to prevent the unlucky scenario in the future.')
