My daily driver is a x220 from 2011 I did buy for next to nothing second hand. But after that I cannot see me needing a new one as I have stacks of nice laptops lying around. Where I can see it going wrong is if I have to travel again. These laptops are either too large and heavy andor have no battery life. But if travel does not come back, there is never the need for a new one. And I cannot see why most people do either. Especially people who are doing things that do not require massive amounts of power. I work with large applications in c#, java, js, python and go on this 10 year old laptop and I am no less productive than my friends&#x2F;colleagues who jumped on the m1 hype. At some point it is just wanting the newest things just because they are new I guess.')
