I have lived in communist regime in which secret services terrorised population with phone tapping, public shaming, making agents from your relatives, breaking families, turning careers to dust, while political elites lived in luxury and corruption was a leaders sport.<p>The proposed model for the future is obviously abstraction with same patterns in hand. People will buy it to some extent I guess but the idea of ownership is hardwired to our psychology naturally, ownership is connected to privacy in direct way, I cannot see how Bezos, Gates, Musk will comply with this. What will they do? Will give away all the money they have and live free of ownership? GTFO.:)')
