Item(by='wenc', descendants=None, kids=[25519582], score=None, time=1608741319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516444, text='There are two kinds of mindsets when it comes to learning: a consumer mindset and an autodidact mindset.<p>In an organization, it&#x27;s easy to recognize consumers -- they typically say things like: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this. Is there a training course for this that I can sign up for?&quot; and expect to be assigned to an internal training session or to some external course.<p>An autodidact on the other hand goes: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this. Let me do some research on my own and try to teach myself.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been both at various junctures in my life but I&#x27;ve learned that in order to progress to higher levels, it&#x27;s better to be an autodidact instead of a consumer. When it comes to new knowledge, there&#x27;s rarely someone who will feed it to me -- I have to take the initiative to learn it myself.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong in asking for a clarifying blurb (good marketing aims to make things frictionless for potential customers). But RocksDB is its own universe and it&#x27;s actually pretty well  known. I don&#x27;t work in this space, and even I know what RocksDB is because it has come up a lot in technical discussions about storage engines. When I first encountered it, I had no idea what it was, but I gathered from comments that people were excited about it, so I googled &quot;wiki rocksdb&quot;. It took 2 seconds.<p>Truly curious people are autodidacts, not consumers.<p>p.s. the HN comment section is a great venue to &quot;overhear&quot; what the community is talking about and what they find exciting. It provides a good signal to dive into certain topics. Knowledge acquisition is very much a sociological exercise as much as it is an individual one.')
