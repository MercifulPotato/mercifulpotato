I can&#x27;t speak for everything, but what I try to do when I use it on my iPad just works, so I&#x27;ve never thought about it.  At least on the iPad, the list of keybindings are a tap or two away.  I don&#x27;t see an obvious way to change keys around, though you can move the buttons around.<p>(Don&#x27;t take this as granted, of course, there are still iPad apps that are actively being updated that ignore the keyboard .. if everything that plays video would treat the spacebar as play&#x2F;pause, I&#x27;d be much happier)')
