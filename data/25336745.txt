It seemed to be raising the topic of whether criticism of PG was forbidden on HN, and if so if that would be a problem.  Not necessarily saying I think there is a problem, I haven&#x27;t thought about that long enough to have a firm opinion, but the fact that the question is raised isn&#x27;t really related to the fact that HN is a private forum, since I don&#x27;t believe anyone was advocating that HN be prevented by law from removing articles critical of PG.<p>It&#x27;s much like how freedom of speech gives one the right to say whatever one wants without government coercion being applied, but that doesn&#x27;t mean people cannot discuss whether what is said is appropriate or meritorious.')
