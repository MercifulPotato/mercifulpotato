So by remaining part of the ECHR, the UK is still -technically- bound by the rulings of the ECJ.<p>The rub is, that the ECHR has no enforcement mechanism by itself, so the UK could just choose to ignore any rulings of the ECJ it doesn&#x27;t like. It was the EU treaties that made adherence to the ECJ rulings mandatory, and therefore formed an enforcement mechanism for the ECJ.')
