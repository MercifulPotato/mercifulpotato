Punishing them makes little sense. If one wants a country to behave some way, one should think of how to make it happen, and what&#x27;s the cost to everyone involved.<p>Sanctions should never be part of a punitive system, which at the level of a whole country is inevitably unjust. They should only be part of an <i>incentive</i> system, where you hope to steer the other country to the direction you want. Looked at it this way, we wouldn&#x27;t ask ourselves whether sanctions are warranted. We&#x27;d ask ourselves how <i>effective</i> they are.<p>Oh, and there&#x27;s this question of whether a country should have the right to influence another country to begin with. Not gonna answer that one here.')
