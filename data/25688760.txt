You can distribute a MicroSD card with 128GB of random bits that is used to encode&#x2F;decode messages.  An additional advantage of a system like this is the OTP can be encrypted so if it is captured it can&#x27;t be used to decrypt old messages without further getting key material from the end user (possibly with a pipe wrench).<p>The biggest problem is that no matter what, the OTP ends up being some sort of physical medium that requires shipping to the end user.  But really it&#x27;s a scaled up version of the key distribution problem.')
