Item(by='vtbassmatt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608161950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25448425, text='Up front disclosures: I&#x27;m the parent of a (prenatally-diagnosed) child with Down syndrome, and I&#x27;m pro-choice as a matter of public health and self-sovereignty.<p>It&#x27;s been really nice to see the civil discourse in this thread, with people taking their respective positions and no one being a jerk. Thank you!<p>If you or someone you know has just received a diagnosis of a child with Down syndrome, prenatal or not, please help them find one of the several awesome support organizations out there. When we got our diagnosis, it was devastating and scary. The truth is, there&#x27;s a huge spectrum of outcomes on a large number of dimensions. Heart trouble != intellectual delays != physical delays, etc. So far, raising my typically-developing daughter has been just as hard, just as much work, and just as unknown in a lot of ways as raising my son with Ds.<p>My wish and hope for the world is that every prospective parent makes decisions informed by facts and not fear. Folks who still choose not to continue a pregnancy (or choose to otherwise give up the baby) will receive absolutely no judgement from me and many people like me. But there&#x27;s a lot of misinformation and misinterpretation available to you during one of the most emotional and confusing times you may ever encounter.<p>One such organization is the DSDN [1], which I&#x27;m familiar with because my spouse is currently a volunteer with them. There are others including national and local advocacy groups, Gigi&#x27;s Playhouse, and more. Just please, talk to some new (and long-time) parents who&#x27;ve been there.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dsdiagnosisnetwork.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dsdiagnosisnetwork.org&#x2F;</a>')
