You can&#x27;t polish a turd and make something better out of it. Take VtM: Bloodlines as an example. People stack patches on top of patches from random websites only to be able to play this game in a somewhat acceptable state, and yet it&#x27;s a well-known darling of gaming circles.<p>By impact this is indeed nowhere near minor.
