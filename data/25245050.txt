I can putter away in my basement for years without bothering anyone.<p>Replacing or reforming a political system is fundamentally different because it requires the buy-in of a large portion - a super-majority ideally, but at least a powerful minority if you&#x27;re willing to play violent or dirty - of the population to get started.  And you can&#x27;t just show up out of the blue with A Plan and expect people to all be on board - even if your plan is really quite good, human nature means almost no one will want to commit to someone else&#x27;s plan.  So you have to develop your plan in a group, making compromises that you may personally disagree with to get larger and larger groups of people on board, until, unless there <i>really was</i> a large number of dissatisfied people in your camp all along - which we all want to believe but is seldom the case - you end up politicking your way to a revolution that is barely different than the status quo.')
