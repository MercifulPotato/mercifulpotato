Did you look at the life-expectancy impact of severe economic downturns and compare them to likely excess fatality figures due to your proposed policy? I suspect not, because last I looked for it I didn&#x27;t seem to find much evidence for silently killing economic stress.<p>&gt; This will not stop the ICU beds from filling up obviously,<p>That&#x27;s a bit of a problem, because those ICU beds are also known to be useful for people suffering from urgent non-covid related problems. Even if you managed to turn away all the non-lockdowners (how would you even check? Police patrols tattooing people spotted on the street during voluntary lockdown?), you might still find that just the &quot;legitimate&quot; cases are enough to really mess up urgent health care for a lot of other people.')
