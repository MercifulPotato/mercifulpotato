If the predictions from the EIA a will materialize, weâ€™re going to have a huge carbon problem.<p>The only way EIA will be off the mark is if we get something like fusion. Currently the major geopolitical issue is natural gas pipelines. Major nations wouldn&#x27;t be fighting over gas pipelines if people believed fossil fuels were over.<p>&gt; 1) the EIA forecasts linear growth of renewables, while its been behaving exponentially over the last 5-10 years.<p>And it still amounts to nothing. Solar&#x2F;winds accounts for 1% of energy. And that&#x27;s after 10 years of subsidies in the biggest economies around the world.<p>&gt; 2) nearly all of the energy consumption growth is non-OECD and will require newly built generation. If cost of renewables continues to drop, it might just be economic sense that pushes renewables over coal<p>That will be all fossil fuels. The developing nations aren&#x27;t going industrialize on solar&#x2F;wind. Even developed nations can&#x27;t do that.<p>&gt; 3) at least on the EU side, fossil fuels are increasingly getting a negative connotation. On top of the financial comparison, I expect this could dampen new fossil growth as well.<p>Right... One of the biggest per capita producer of oil is norway.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_oil_production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_oil_produ...</a><p>The 2nd largest oil company in the world is a anglo-dutch company.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Dutch_Shell" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Royal_Dutch_Shell</a><p>And of course europe just invaded and took over libya for their oil. The EU is trying to take over venezuela for their oil. Etc.<p>The EU is one of the biggest direct consumers of fossil fuels ( and the largest consumer directly+indirectly ).<p>Fossil fuels aren&#x27;t going anywhere. That&#x27;s just physical reality. It&#x27;s physics. Sure renewables may slow the rate of growth, but growing more slowly is still growing.<p>The only thing that will cause a decline in fossil fuels is economic collapse or a genuine scientific breakthrough like fusion energy.')
