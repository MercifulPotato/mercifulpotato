Never heard back from them again (even though they said they&#x27;ll reach out when they get headcount back).<p>Saying you&#x27;ll get back to a candidate, especially when that candidate has already been told to expect an offer, and then ghosting is not polite.  Any framing of this as acceptable behavior, be it polite or impolite, is unacceptable.  You can say &quot;oh that&#x27;s just the way it is&quot; and there&#x27;s some truth to that, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t pure fucking bullshit and deserving of condemnation.')
