Internet, cable, and water were included. The highest end apartments I heard of in town were ~800&#x2F;month per tenant in 4 bedroom swanky apartments right across the street from the university.<p>Obviously total comp can more than offset cost of living differences, but the difference in cost continually blow my mind.')
