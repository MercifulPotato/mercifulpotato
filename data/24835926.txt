My elderly relatives use Zoom exclusively, partly because that is what they are invited to use for the 80th birthday celebrations that seem to happen every week. But also because they don&#x27;t have smart phones; they are somewhat comfortable with a desktop computer, but smart phones are just unusable due to lack of dexterity, poorer eyesight and worse user interfaces. I can&#x27;t see a mobile-only solution winning family use cases. Maybe it will do better with business.')
