However, the reported data would be much harder to trust, as it would be obvious for the data collectors and pacients which group they are part of, making it trivial for them to misreport data and symptoms to influence the result in the direction they desire (whether consciously or not).<p>That is the real reason for the double blind study design in most tteatments - fear of fake data, not any mysterious healing&#x2F;detrimental effects from the act of taking sugar pills.')
