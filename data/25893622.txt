The images were indeed captured by a 3D microscope in about 9000 separate captures with non-uniform illumination, so this isn&#x27;t so much a stitching artifact as it is an illumination artifact.  The specular component of the varnish and the different illumination angles of the light sources make it almost impossible to capture a uniformly-colored field without the use of polarization filters, and the best stitching algorithms don&#x27;t do well with different opinions from multiple images about the color of a pixel (they do fine with different opinions about brightness).')
