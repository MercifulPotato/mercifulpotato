Centralization of censorship ability in a small number of platforms is a bad thing for everyone.  Twitter and Instagram or any other centralized censor becoming a &quot;better service&quot; makes our whole society worse.<p>It&#x27;s time to leave Twitter and never look back.  Only assholes tell other adults what they&#x27;re allowed to see or read.<p>I tolerated Twitter deciding what I was allowed to write for a dozen years. When they started censoring search and dictating what I was allowed to read, I deleted my account.<p>Sharecropping on someone else&#x27;s platform is a dead end.')
