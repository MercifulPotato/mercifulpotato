However, it’s not hard to imagine that giving similar time-limited boosts to people such as funding free public college opportunities could help more people achieve the middle-class stability noted above.<p>However, it’s clearly not entirely a matter of external intervention. Some of the life choices require active participation of the people involved, such as choosing to delay having children (in conjunction with good access to birth control and reproductive education) and choosing to engage in the educational opportunities available to them.')
