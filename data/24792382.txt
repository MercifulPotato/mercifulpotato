The parts left unmasked to make them easy to recognize are easy to recognize precisely because they have the most security &quot;entropy&quot; and are the most sensitive parts.<p>SSNs adapted in 2011 and CC Numbers are in the process of adapting (and I suppose Bank Numbers are adapting at a per-Bank rate), but it&#x27;s almost funny how universally this &quot;best practice&quot; of masking these security identifiers started from the &quot;wrong end&quot; and have forced their own generation algorithms to move a lot more entropy into their prefixes and middles.')
