Award all ties to your reviewer<p>A true &quot;tie&quot; is really rare IMO. If it really is a tie, we should all should agree that person putting work into it should be able to decide their own code. Not only does it cut down on discussion, but it cuts down on work and communication needed to get the PR past the finish line.<p>Allowing ties to go to the reviewer can lead to all kinds of discussions about meaningless stuff, like:<p>```\nWe should use forEach(...) instead of for loops, because that is how a most of other code is written.\n```<p>In that example (from a real code review), the code is practically the same, just different style. So now the coder has to go back, re-write, re-test, signal for a re-review, re-discuss etc... All for something that is a tie, and doesn&#x27;t actually matter either way.<p>Alternatively, letting non-issues through without a duel every time, saves a bunch of time and energy on every ones part.')
