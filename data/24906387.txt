I have seen a few proposed patches or improvements to Postgres handling of connections BUT as with other situations it always seems there&#x27;s a small number of core maintainers that seem to shoot these improvements down pretty hard so they end up not going anywhere.<p>There&#x27;s an on-going debate about whether this should be inside Postgres or handled externally (like pgBouncer and co. do). I am firmly in the camp that it ought to be handled internally.<p>Maybe with the pedigree of Microsoft&#x2F;Citus contributing this we might finally see something change.')
