Unlike the busybodies who care more about lecturing people about following the &quot;rules&quot; of &quot;Open Source&quot; to the letter, than about the spirit of fostering contributions to The Commons to further the public good, you clearly understand what actually matters.<p>Don&#x27;t let the annoying minority keep you from doing something you know will make a positive difference in the world. If you set clear boundaries and stay matter-of-fact, the public overall will back you.<p>In the same spirit as the 4 &quot;non-Free-Culture&quot; Creative Commons licenses, I encourage you to check out non-open-source PolyForm software licenses, including a noncommercial license, a free trial license, etc: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;polyformproject&#x2F;polyform-licenses#licenses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;polyformproject&#x2F;polyform-licenses#license...</a><p>Every contribution to The Commons furthers the public good, regardless of whether it&#x27;s <i>technically</i> &quot;Open Source&quot; according to the Debian mailing list.')
