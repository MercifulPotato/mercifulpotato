The books at issue were written under a work for hire agreement, so his original employer owns the copyrights. He was paid for his work.<p>That employer also agreed to pay him out of the books revenues, and that is the obligation Disney claims it did not acquire when it acquired the assets of the company.<p>If the royalty-like payments were part of a separate agreement from the work for hire agreement, Disney would be correct about not owing ADF any money. However, if the payments were part of the WFH agreement then Disney could be wrong, but it depends on how the WFH agreement was written.')
