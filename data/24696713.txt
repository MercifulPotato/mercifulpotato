Item(by='angel_j', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601984816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695373, text='EFF is being disingenuous here, probably at the behest of so many internet service companies, who need your data, and technically own your passwords.  They never have, and don&#x27;t care about your privacy.  Don&#x27;t shill for these companies, not even the ones with good intentions.<p>Your passwords are still protected by your right to privacy, and the 5th amendment. This bill won&#x27;t change that.  It only forced (at your state&#x27;s discretion) that internet services give records to law enforcement.<p>This could weaken internet services, which only pretend to protect your privacy, and then sell it everything else about your &quot;private bits&quot;.<p>It could strengthen privacy by forcing people to get real about their security and take encryption into their own, private hands. Run your own servers, and end-to-end all the things.<p>But the electric sheep can&#x27;t see this, and trust too blindly EFF and the same internet companies that they otherwise despise for their use of your data.  The time to choose in nigh.  Either you let MSFAANG keep the lock and key to your data, full wise that they will give it up for ads and authority, or your realize that the only way to change the web is to adapt and use it differently.<p>These companies never cared about your privacy. We know this because of their willingness to comply to, for instance, Chinese authority.  Ya&#x27;ll have been red-scared all over again, decrying China as a threat to the world, while your own Government eats away at your own liberties in the name of protecting you.')
