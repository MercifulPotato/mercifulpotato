If you look into what he&#x27;s been saying for awhile, you&#x27;ll see this is all part of an effort to integrate Google applications. He&#x27;s given several interviews where he&#x27;s stated this pretty plainly, and I actually buy it. Think about it--over the last few months we&#x27;ve all been seeing that if, push comes to shove, remote work is 100% possible for a lot of IT businesses. If he manages to successfully integrate Gmail, Hangouts Chat, and Hangouts Meet, he effectively uses Google&#x27;s brand and engineering knowledge to compete with Slack and Microsoft Teams and targets this market directly as opposed to letting their various products fall behind how people are actually using productivity tools. He&#x27;s making Google&#x27;s products actually compelling to use by focusing on integrating them (Apple&#x27;s core strength) and making them smart enough to feel as though they <i>get</i> the work you&#x27;re doing (Google&#x27;s strength, by sheer ML dominance).<p>They also get a cool remote work solution to use with their own employees alongside all of their existing infra that lets them allow remote employees to interact with Google securely, or at least auditably (BeyondCorp, CitC, whatever the internal code review tool and browser-based text editor were called, etc). This makes remote work for them possible and extremely cost saving, as the solution they&#x27;d otherwise need to engineering is already being developed as an external product.<p>I know nothing about law, but I&#x27;m also willing to bet making them integrated would also help them defend against the antitrust investigation too. If they roll up all of these seemingly separate products into one offering, by the time the investigation comes to any conclusions they might be so integrated they could argue they can&#x27;t be split. Then if the government decides to do it anyways they&#x27;ll probably split along the Google Search and Google Cloud lines, leaving at least two separate but extremely profitable business units. Each of those business units is even competing with at least two other established companies too!<p>The icon rebranding is probably part of making the integration visual . They know we&#x27;ll all forget about it eventually just like they did last time when they altered the Google logo to use a sans-serif font and everyone lost their minds. Javier&#x27;s strategy builds value for the company not only directly by entering the productivity tool market, but he also saves the company money by giving Google a free option for sustaining a fully remote workforce that they can now pay less and not need to maintain offices for. He also uses his inside knowledge of Microsoft to compete with his largest direct competitor, and simply dwarfs slack in both financial resources and brand capital. Finally, he might even help Google in the antitrust suit.<p>It&#x27;s also possible I&#x27;m an idiot and thinking too much into yet another useless VP&#x27;s attempts to distinguish himself in a marginal way. I personally think they have a winner here though; they&#x27;re hugely committed to a browser-based environment and even stand to control web browsers and http altogether with Chromium&#x27;s dominance and the amount of work they&#x27;re dumping into the stuff it talks to. It&#x27;s a fairly positive and mature future, and speaks to the kind of leadership you get from people who focus on building value rather than building technology.')
