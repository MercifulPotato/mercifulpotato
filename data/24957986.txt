Of the twelve characters cited as &quot;ghost characters&quot;, nine of them had claimed sources, but on further investigation were not in the claimed sources or were data entry errors of similar characters in those sources, while three did not have any claimed sources, of which two were later found in other texts (and one of those is believed to be an error), and ÂΩÅ has never been located in any text predating its input into JIS C 6226.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ja.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97#%E5%85%B8%E6%8B%A0%E3%81%8C%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%8E%E3%81%AA%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ja.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E5%B9%BD%E9%9C%8A%E6%96%87%E5...</a>')
