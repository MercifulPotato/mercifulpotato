The surest way to get congresscritters to unilaterally act is to directly threaten their own personal safety. Furthermore, bringing organized violence to the table completely changes the game - those social media bans are better seen as a reaction to novel <i>criminal liability</i> rather than a mere escalation of the section 230 battle.<p>As a libertarian, what&#x27;s truly disappointing is seeing what was probably our last chance at direct rebellion get wasted to assuage one proto-fascist simpleton&#x27;s ego with a fake narrative of a stolen election. That&#x27;s not the kind of movement that could possibly gain momentum by demonstrating its justness. I&#x27;ve always believed that <i>personal computing</i> is a better hope for freedom than expecting any herd of people to move in a productive direction, and these events just hammer it home.')
