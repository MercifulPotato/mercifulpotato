If I own a store and accept payments via Stripe, Stripe needs information about me to help make sure I&#x27;m not using the money I receive for unseemly things. But if you visit my store and buy something and pay me via Stripe, Stripe doesn&#x27;t need that same information about <i>you</i>.<p>If instead of running a store I&#x27;m running a bank or some other financial service, that all changes - in that case, someone has to verify your identity to fulfill KYC&#x2F;AML requirements. Stripe doesn&#x27;t trust me to do that myself, since it&#x27;s hard and heavily regulated and it would be onerous for Stripe to make sure I and all their other customers are doing it properly. But now they&#x27;ll outsource that responsibility to banks on my behalf.')
