Item(by='xpl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609908688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650988, text='&gt; how can arbitrageurs afford to stay in business<p>Most arbitrageurs cannot stay in the business, it&#x27;s the law of diminishing returns. Economies of scale eventually prevent small individual players to profit from the market, only a few big-ass hedge funds can stay, because due to their investments they can get preference from exchanges (significantly lower &#x2F; zero &#x2F; negative fees, co-located hardware, etc.) which makes the operation reasonable to them. With enough money you can even build your own physical cables between exchanges to outperform the competitors in latency games. I&#x27;m a former arbitrageur, by the way :)<p>Same with AI-generated content. You would have to be absolutely brilliant to compete with AI. Only a few select individuals would be &quot;allowed&quot; to enter the market. Not even sure that it has something to do with the quality of the content, maybe it&#x27;s more about prestige.<p>You see, there already are gazillions of decent human artists, but only a few of them are really popular. So the top-tier artists would probably remain human, because we need someone real to worship to. Their producers would surely use AI as a production tool, depicting it as a human work. But all the low-tier artists would be totally pushed out of the market. There will be simply no job for a session musician or a freelance designer.')
