You&#x27;re informed over and over about the rules of engagement, and when you get there none of it applies.<p>If you don&#x27;t shoot first, then your next to you friend will die. Obviously you&#x27;re going to break the rules in that situation, it&#x27;s what any human would do.<p>Now you have to live the rest of your life, knowing you broke conventions. You should be tried like the war-criminal you are. Or so it feels.<p>While I disagreed with the west&#x27;s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, I have the utmost respect for the soldiers who fought there. They deserve a set of rules can realistically be followed.')
