Good architecture is analysing the requirements at hand and explicitly articulating and weighting the trade-offs.<p>This is quite the straw-man argument. For example, the section [1] whose title you quoted explicitly calls out the need to perform an evaluation first:<p>&gt; When functionality is required, existing IT assets in the organization must be evaluated and used first, unless they do not exist and&#x2F;or are a significant mismatch to the required functionality.<p>The &quot;book&quot; is clearly a draft-quality rough collection of notes, many of which are not fleshed out extensively, but it&#x27;s quite unfair to consider it as a set of &quot;dogmatic rules&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nocomplexity.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;arplaybook&#x2F;businessarchitecture.html#reuse-before-buy-buy-before-build" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nocomplexity.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;arplaybook&#x2F;businessarchit...</a>')
