The core issue that escalated this is that the distribution channel forces additional fees for no value in some cases (i.e. services&#x2F;apps&#x2F;games that have their own payment collection system in place).<p>I don&#x27;t think the fee is there to protect device health. There are plenty of free apps with no fees levied, so that point doesn&#x27;t  make sense.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to charge a fee for using the store as a paid app distribution channel. If Apple takes on the burden of risk, funds flow management, etc. it&#x27;s fair to take a cut.<p>If Epic instead builds their own payment system, they shouldn&#x27;t be charged for it or forced into using Apple&#x27;s.<p>Apple could claim that they need to cover hosting costs or review costs. And I think there&#x27;s an argument here, but it&#x27;s not made, and it would raise additional questions around fairness.')
