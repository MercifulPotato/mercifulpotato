They have our best interests at heart, right? Nothing like this could ever go wrong, there&#x27;s no examples from history or fiction about anything like that. Nope, it&#x27;s always Wonderful Good People that only ban things that Bad Evil People would like, and reality is totally black-and-white, and only Bad Evil People would think otherwise.')
