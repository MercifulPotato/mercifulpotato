The atmosphere is absolutely poisonous there, in the strangest passive aggressive way -- every time I search for help there, I find tons of replies that are useless, and about 5% of the time I find a helpful tidbit. There&#x27;s one user in particular, whose name I won&#x27;t mention, who posts EVERYWHERE with just condescending garbage, and yet they have massive forum points (level 10, or whatever).<p>It&#x27;s very odd -- something about the moderation or something has created a community there that is extremely hostile to accurately identifying and quantifying real issues in software and hardware, and allergic to useful solutions.<p>Developer forums are much better, though.')
