Most people can speak into a phone more quietly than they&#x27;d have to turn the speaker up enough to record it with another device. Not everyone has an SO, not everyone with an SO is with them 24&#x2F;7, and not everyone&#x27;s SO has a spare phone&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;tablet immediately available for them to use. And not everyone wants to ask the caller to wait while they ask their SO to borrow their extra device, and set it up to record. And not everyone wants to go through the process of transferring audio recordings from one device and account to another every time they record a conversation. And many people do actually find themselves in situations with lots of background noise, or enough free hands or convenient surfaces to keep all the devices together, even if you can&#x27;t imagine yourself ever being in such a situation. And not everyone wants shitty noisy low quality analog recordings of their conversations played on a speaker phone, instead of high fidelity digital recordings of the original audio.')
