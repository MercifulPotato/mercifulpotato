The idea, which seemed rather cockamamie at the time, was to come up with something you could feed a BASIC program to and have it come out as a compiled executable. Nowadays, that kind of idea is everywhere, of course.<p>I don&#x27;t know if he ever got it finished (or indeed, if it&#x27;s even possible in a practical sense. The C preprocessor is Turing-complete (edit: more or less, if you&#x27;re allowed unlimited runs), so it&#x27;s obviously theoretically possible).')
