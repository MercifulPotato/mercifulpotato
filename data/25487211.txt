Though Japan seems to have the highest production in terms of population-to-content if I recall correctly, which again coincides with bad economic situations, specifically under-employment and very low marriage&#x2F;fertility rates.<p>Your edit was well timed, as you pretty much echo what I wrote. It&#x27;s so weird... in University you&#x27;re almost encouraged to do it all, but then when you get to the professional setting and you reach low level management position in an office setting you&#x27;re briefed on sexual harassment so much you&#x27;re almost terrified any encounter with the opposite sex will be deemed rape. It&#x27;s horrible and really not that much of an issue as they want you to think it is when you really think about it as most encounters are brief and forgettable if you&#x27;re busy working.')
