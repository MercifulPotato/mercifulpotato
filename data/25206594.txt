It is an acknowledgement of everything wrong happening around us, and over which we have no control; a way to keep your sanity and function.\nSomething akin to rational anarchy.<p>Don&#x27;t escort the big chariot;\nYou will only make yourself dusty.\nDon&#x27;t think about the sorrows of the world;\nYou will only think yourself wretched.<p>Don&#x27;t escort the big chariot;\nYou won&#x27;t be able to see for dust.\nDon&#x27;t think about the sorrows of the world;\nOr you will never escape from your despair.<p>Don&#x27;t escort the big chariot;\nYou&#x27;ll be stifled with dust.\nDon&#x27;t think about the sorrows of the world;\nYou will only load yourself with care.')
