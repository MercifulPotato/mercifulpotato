The liability shield is <i>the whole reason Section 230 exists</i>: to make it possible to have enjoyable communities online, without incurring so much liability that you have to shut them all down for fear of getting prosecuted.<p>If you want unmoderated communities, they exist. Go use them. Stop trying to destroy the concept of moderated communities. (Removing the liability shield <i>would</i> be tantamount to destroying such communities.)<p>Some people want the <i>audience</i> of moderated communities, but they don&#x27;t want the <i>standards</i> of those communities.
