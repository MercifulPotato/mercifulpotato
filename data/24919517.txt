Otherwise it&#x27;s very hard to trick my brain into doing the thing. I don&#x27;t like the &quot;wear running shoes&quot; example either. I have found that when I plan habits like that I maybe do them once or twice, then never again. There is no reward for me without the progress and in the case of the coding example would only bring me frustration.')
