What seemed pretty common was people talking in their heads or out loud to their passed relatives, parents, less so friends. Sharing your thoughts with your gone mother or father, brother or sister, grandparents - and hear back their thoughts - can be nice and assuring. Gives you a sounding board in your head for your own thoughts, to take time off and reflect. Kind of like journaling. They are real in a sense that they did exist, but imaginary because they don&#x27;t anymore.')
