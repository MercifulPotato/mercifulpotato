What scares me the most is that this leadership can be taken from a selfish leaded country and their expansionism program:<p>* Xinjiang\n* Hing Kong\n* Taiwan\n* Inner Mongolia\n* Tibet\n* Spratly Islands &#x2F; Nine dash lane.\n* Northern India\n* Vietnam sea<p>They cannot just be nice with their neighbours.
