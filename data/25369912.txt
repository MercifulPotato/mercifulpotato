I kind of remember it was in the category of games that were launch&#x2F;beta titles for Geforce Now, but withdrew from the service shortly there after.<p>Not sure what is going on there with IP rights and whatever, but I don&#x27;t really care since Google&#x2F;Stadia worked it out.<p>&gt;You can play your existing purchased library<p>Sort of. I notice that Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla and Immortal Fenix Rising are available via Geforce Now if you bought them via Epic or Uplay, but not Steam. Earlier AC games are fine, so this is probably a &quot;latest release held back if you bought on Steam&quot; thing.<p>But the thing is, I don&#x27;t want to pull out a chart of who supports what and deal with this BS. Stadia routes around this problem since their store sells games while Geforce Now doesn&#x27;t and instead sells you cloud access to another storefront, and that storefront can withhold rights.<p>I totally get that, any particular game might have its own plans for cloud or mobile or whatever - for example another favorite of mine, Slay the Spire, in the process of rolling out mobile versions, does not appear in the blessed Geforce Now list. No doubt because Megacrit doesn&#x27;t want to undercut future sales. So I can&#x27;t stream StS to my phone because they want to sell me another copy.<p>Nevertheless it&#x27;s a game in my library, one of many, that Geforce Now doesn&#x27;t let me play. Saying Geforce Now lets you &quot;play your existing purchased library&quot; is not fully accurate.<p>edited to remove extraneous info')
