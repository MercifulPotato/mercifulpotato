Look at the discussion around CEOs having dark triad traits. We simultaneously know that we dont want most people to behave this way, but also gravitate towards those that do.<p>I think there is a spectrum: on one end are sheep and cows where everyone is social and as a group they are dumb but plentiful. On the other end are tigers, where everyone is antisocial, everybody is an apex predator but as a species there aren&#x27;t that many because they dont cooperate. And then there are humans, ants, maybe wolves, where there is a nice mix of conformity and leadership, social and antisocial, that lets us come up with new ideas, but then fall in line behind executing them.<p>So yeah, society full of antisocials is pretty ineffective, but so is a society of conformists.')
