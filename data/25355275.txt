Specifically MongoHQ (later renamed to Compose) and MongoLabs (later renamed to mLabs).  I believe neither of these companies had any specific contract with MongoDB, nor where they breaching the AGPL in any way.<p>However, MongoDB eventually changed it&#x27;s license in a way that explicitly made it impossible for these services to continue to exist without making their entire stack open source, or getting a separate license agreement with them.  In this particular example, the impact may have been minor for these two companies, as Compose got acquired by IBM before this, and mLabs got acquired by MongoDB themselves.  But any other product that effectively ran hosted MongoDB for you would need to get a license from MongoDB.  It is speculated (fairly) that these changes were made so that MongoDB could get a greater market share with their own hosted that they sell, and to block out much bigger cloud providers from finding ways to wrap their services in non license breaking ways, but still not providing much more extra value add other than hosted Mongo.')
