From a dev-infra POV that’s obviously largely impractical.<p>This isn’t impractical – it’s entirely possible to set up a build &#x2F; deploy pipeline to the App Store for mass submission of applications.  It’s annoying in places, but Apple are <i>slowly</i> getting better at providing APIs to make this easier, and there are third-party tools like Fastlane which also help.<p>&gt; Would Apple even allow that?<p>If they were all instances of a single white-labelled streaming application, Apple would probably require the games to be published using developer accounts belonging to the rights holders for the games instead of publishing everything through an Nvidia account.  This is an established requirement in those circumstances.  It depends upon how they view the ownership of what is being published.  Again, setting up a pipeline for this is annoying but doable.')
