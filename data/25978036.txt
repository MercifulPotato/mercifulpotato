I don&#x27;t use Windows much, but from what I hear it seems like a dream to work with; Linux is ok once you figure out how to set up debug info (and I am hoping it can be like Windows in the future) but the situation on macOS is just hopeless because nobody is willing to share symbols. It&#x27;s made even more sad because much of the infrastructure is already there; it&#x27;s just locked up in private API and internal glue and with none of that crucial debug information to feed it.')
