We run many thousands of instances on AWS. Sure, given our scale, every week we get a couple of instance retirement emails. Usually they are issued many days in advance(sometimes, weeks). Per year, we may get a handful of instances that are suddenly unresponsive.<p>And we don&#x27;t care. You know why? <i>Because it&#x27;s just a matter of issuing stop&#x2F;start</i>. Done! Server is back up, potentially even in a different datacenter, but it is none the wiser. It looks like a reboot. Even better, add an auto-recovery alert and AWS will do this for you, automatically. If part of an ASG, add health checks.<p>For the most part, we don&#x27;t even <i>notice</i> when instances go down. Our workloads are engineered to be fault-tolerant. If a meteor destroys one AWS datacenter, it might temporarily take out some instances. So what? New ones will be back very shortly, all the while databases will fail-over, etc.<p>If these were physical instances, someone would have to do the maintenance work, purchase orders, wait for hardware to arrive, and so on and so forth. And, for most &quot;co-location&quot; scenarios, if your datacenter has issues, everything will go down. A single AZ in AWS has multiple datacenters, you might not even be affected if one goes up in flames.<p>But let&#x27;s say you run a massive pet server farm and none of then can go down for any period of time. You have given names and everything, and you celebrate their birthdays. Cool. Run that on GCP then. They do auto-migration. I&#x27;ve never seen an instance go down.<p>&gt; Do you understand that with AWS you still have to setup instances, manage security updates, permission and deal with disaster response<p>This is true. However, if you are running your own hardware, you have to do that IN ADDITION TO dealing with hardware and datacenter shenanigans, with either a specialized (and expensive) workforce, or a barely capable one that&#x27;s shoehorned and doing double duty, with zero economies of scale, probably in a single data-center.')
