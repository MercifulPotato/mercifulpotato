It was absolutely <i>mindblowing</i> at the time. I remember spending an hour or so after work nearly every day for a few weeks just browsing around the globe and looking at places all over the world.<p>There was absolutely nothing like it anywhere, this was even <i>before</i> Google Maps was a thing and most people printed out directions, on paper, from mapquest.com. The Motorola Razr flip phone still hadn&#x27;t been released. This was absolutely impossible technology from the future. Lots of the senior technical people I worked with used to spend their lunches trying to figure out the architecture Keyhole used to stream the map data. And then they&#x27;d spend their coffee breaks trying to figure out how they got all that to run performantly on the primitive graphics hardware we had in the &quot;Keyhole&quot; desktop -- which somebody took to one of our conference rooms and hooked up to a projector and gave people wall-sized flying tours of the Earth.<p>What&#x27;s amazing to me is that even after Google acquired it, the capabilities haven&#x27;t become significantly better than that original tool. Sure it&#x27;s been cleaned up, and better data tiles, more POI, etc. They added 3d buildings and so on. But it&#x27;s still entirely recognizable as that original software -- after two decades.<p>I remember wanting to have it at home, but it was prohibitively expensive, and then NASA released WorldWind [1] which was <i>achingly</i> close but never quite got the high resolution map data that Keyhole did at the time.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NASA_WorldWind" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NASA_WorldWind</a>')
