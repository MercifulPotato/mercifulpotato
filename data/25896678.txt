The whole system is as simple and straight forward as it can be. It didn&#x27;t need many tweaks, and I know everything it&#x27;s doing. Openbsd just makes me happy :-)<p>I&#x27;ve stuck with pre-compiled packages, and that&#x27;s as easy as can be. I&#x27;ve only needed the pkg_info, pkg_add, and pkg_delete commands. There&#x27;s a syspatch command to pull down OS security updates and upgrade to new releases. After new releases the fw_update command updates any firmware packages, and pkg-add -ui updates all packages. The faq pages have more info on this, and a lot of other system setup stuff [0].<p>(Extra info: Packages are pre-compiled binaries from the openbsd ports collection [1]. This ports collection can be installed and used to build stuff from source, and more closely track updates. Each app has a sub-dir under the ports directory with a makefile to download source code and compile&#x2F;install everything to the right place, handle dependencies, etc. Packages are so easy, and I&#x27;ve never needed to get involved with ports. I&#x27;ve used ports on freebsd and can appreciate the value of them, if someone were to need them.)<p>I don&#x27;t have much first hand experience with openbsd containers. The system makes use of chroot [2] for daemons like httpd, running executables as a separate user restricted to a specified userland root directory, and I&#x27;ve played with this. There&#x27;s also vmm [3], which can run openbsd and linux virtual machines. Apparently vmm allows for docker to run on openbsd [4].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;index.html</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openports.se&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openports.se&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;chroot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;chroot</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;faq16.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbsd.org&#x2F;faq&#x2F;faq16.html</a>\n[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@dave_voutila&#x2F;docker-on-openbsd-6-1-current-c620513b8110" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@dave_voutila&#x2F;docker-on-openbsd-6-1-curre...</a>')
