It&#x27;s built for developers who are comfortable with CLIs and YML files, and want their pipelines to be defined in a Git repository so that they get the benefits of DevOps best practices like code review and CI&#x2F;CD.<p>At the same time, we have been working with some members of the community on a new framework for building taps and targets: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2401" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2401</a>, which we have decided to call the Singer SDK: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;singer-sdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;meltano&#x2F;singer-sdk</a>. We are moving as many Singer specification-specific details around things like incremental state replication and stream&#x2F;field selection into the framework, so that individual taps only need to worry about getting the data from the source and can be expected to behave more consistently and correctly across the board.')
