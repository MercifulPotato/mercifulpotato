I follow conferences and read ML papers (DL &amp; DL&#x2F;ML application in Robotics) regularly so I think I have a some grasp on the advancement in the field. GAN sure have been a big step, and have found a great usage. (deepfake etc) but I&#x27;d say it is still highly overblown. Like GPT3 it will see wide adaptation enough to make visible improvement (and problems) in certain industries, just as better classifiers changed a lot.<p>I also don&#x27;t like the blanket term of &quot;automation&quot; because it is like AI: too vague and often used by someone who don&#x27;t fully grasp HOW hard automation tasks are (and how the complexity scale and differs from the <i>task</i> ). Just as optimism in Self-driving car is now more on low-fire.<p>The over-promise of ML is something akin to people expecting &quot;it to just get better&quot; similar to Moore&#x27;s law. If you take a look at <i>what</i> direction the algorithms are improving, what incremental advancements are being made the <i>scope</i> of the speed and velocity become much more clear; and just because cars get faster, doesn&#x27;t mean it will one day fly to space like a rocket. If we one day in short term future see great improvement, it will probably not be the ML improvements, but due external factors (hardware, network speed, etc)')
