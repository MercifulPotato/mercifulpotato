CDPR stock has fallen dramatically and now they are facing punitive action from governments that on a level I&#x27;ve never heard of for a game studio.<p>I&#x27;m not apologizing for them.  They should not have released what they did for the PS4.  But I&#x27;m seeing a bunch of articles about how the number of players one steam has fallen by X% and lots of others stuff not typically reported about on a game.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see if they get acquired at a deep discount by Ubisoft or something.')
