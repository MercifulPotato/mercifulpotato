Putting two [larger] filters in a &#x27;V&#x27; with cardboard to fill the top and bottom pulls the same amount of air through a larger area of filters<p>B. pulling the same volume of air through greater surface area results in greater pressure between the filter and fan than one filter directly affixed to the fan<p>C. The lower air pressure &#x2F; &quot;suction&quot; due to an obstructed intake causes an electric fan motor to fail more quickly.<p>D. Increasing the air pressure that the motor is in reduces the failure rate?')
