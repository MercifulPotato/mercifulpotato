Giving someone 24 or 48 hours is an exploding offer. Giving them two weeks is not.<p>An expired offer letter doesn&#x27;t mean the candidate is rejected. It simply means that we need to move on to other candidates by that date. If someone has pressing circumstances, we&#x27;ll make it work.<p>However, when you have a specific position to fill it doesn&#x27;t make senes to reserve a spot for a candidate who wants to spend months interviewing at many different companies. The longer you reserve the spot for someone, the more interviews they&#x27;re likely to take and the naive odds that they&#x27;ll join <i>your</i> company continue to go down.<p>If you aren&#x27;t in a rush to fill the position and you really like the candidate, it might make sense to hold on. Otherwise, it&#x27;s best to move on to other candidates. If you can&#x27;t find anyone else, you can always regenerate a new offer letter for the first candidate.')
