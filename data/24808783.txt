Some things were indeed better in the past, and it makes sense to want to conserve them. And, similarly, the future or present is not magically better, just newer temporarily.<p>&gt;<i>In this case, were people really more well-read and less ignorant in Sagan&#x27;s past than they were in the mid nineties, or was he simply surrounded more by well-read, nuanced people when he was younger than when he was older?</i><p>The public discussion and politics, and the people involved were more well-read and less ignorant in Sagan&#x27;s past than they are today. How about that?<p>E.g. back then some serious news outlets (with more gatekeeping and quality control and staff in remote areas, paid proof editors, etc) were the average person&#x27;s main option to get their news.<p>Now any random, under-staffed, &quot;news&quot; website (which doesn&#x27;t even have proof-readers, on-field reporters, or anything, and just repeats AP and Reuters news, opinion pieces, and internet gossip, is a &quot;media outlet&quot; anybody can access. And that&#x27;s the best case, on top of random blogs and social media accounts.')
