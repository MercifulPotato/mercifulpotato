I remember a decade or so ago, RT was quite fond of giving time to some of my, at the time, favorite libertarian talking heads.  I think Russia might have an interest in propagating a more federalist interpretation of the US Constitution.  It certainly lines up with the sort of Plutocratic system dominating post-Soviet Russia, and promotes a more isolated American foreign policy.<p>The real saboteurs of the 2016 election were the tone-deaf Democratic leaders.  Supporting a candidate like Clinton in 2016, along with failing to effectively appreciate the threat of a populist like Trump, is really what cost them the election.')
