In both cases there was much evidence the shooters were wrapped up in this insular bubble of right-wing thought and it seems like he missed the danger that others saw because he was blinded by the perception of progressive overreach.<p>He also has a bit of a reputation for twitter toxicity and he later ended up with anxiety issues and consequently an addiction.  It&#x27;s hard for me to not see him as a cautionary tale of why to avoid getting wrapped up in politics and the culture wars.')
