There is really no ambiguity here, HTTP as a protocol expects resources to be organized as an hierarchy and accessed via a path, which is delimited by &quot;&#x2F;&quot; characters. As such the protocol definitely reserves and assigns special meaning to &quot;&#x2F;&quot; in paths.<p>Of course servers are perfectly free to do whatever they want, there is no HTTP police to stop them.')
