Who hires lawyers to try to protect  intellectual proprty rights?  It all starts with one or a few people exercising free will.  To take a more common example than Bill Gates and friends, something as seemingly &quot;non-corporate&quot; as Pi-Hole has become a private corporation and &quot;owns&quot; a trademark.  Regardless of reasons, it is what it is -- individuals poised to enforce &quot;rights&quot; against, to block, others.  The &quot;delusion&quot; is quite contagious.  Not disagreeing with the comment, just pointing out that these problems emanate from wilful participation in the delusion by individual persons.')
