A federal law requiring police interactions to be recorded and submitted to a state entity and requiring it be stored for a certain period would probably suffice.  Then the FBI or whoever investigated an issue Federally (if it got to that) could subpoena it, since it&#x27;s supposed to exist, and be handled by the state.<p>I agree it should be a black box.  Rule #1 for accountability is that you don&#x27;t rely on the entity that&#x27;s being examined to give absolutely correct info.  Whether that&#x27;s debugging a process or reviewing an organization, outside instrumentation is essential.')
