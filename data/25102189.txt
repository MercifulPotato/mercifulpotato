But not because the maintainer is an asshole. It&#x27;s because the maintainer doesn&#x27;t understand the real leverage he has when doing open source. So it&#x27;s actually more sad than bad. Bad for him, in fact.<p>When you write something to solve <i>your problem</i> (which he correctly states), then publishing it &quot;for free&quot; just because the mere act of doing so comes at almost no cost and even consider it as some kind of philanthropy (&quot;You are welcome, by the way&quot;), that&#x27;s all really missing the point. Of course you are free to do that, but you are really missing out on the big lever the open source approach hands you.<p>And that lever is that other people come and help the maintainer _for f<i></i>*ing free_. They encounter a bug and report it -- that&#x27;s free labor right there! They help him make his software better by pointing out a problem that he likely overlooked. And they help him document problems for other users to be aware of. And often times they help him by providing a patch or a suggestion. They do all of this for free. That&#x27;s the whole point of open source. Not providing some piece of software for free. That was there already with &quot;Freeware&quot;. But the real power comes from the lever. Put it out in the open and have the whole world help you.<p>Linus Torvalds understood that all too well, and still does. He&#x27;s not a philanthropist. He&#x27;s pretty rude and selfish (he admits that about himself), and that&#x27;s exactly why the open source approach worked so well for him.')
