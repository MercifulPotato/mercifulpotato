Any time I see somebody fall for that, I will call them out. Any time after I call them out on that, if they say that reduction in privacy is to prevent the spread of malware, I will also call them out because Apple&#x27;s malware track record in the mobile space is worse than its peers. I&#x27;m absolutely fine with people saying that their mobile processors are great because as far as I can tell, that&#x27;s a true statement. It is the parroting of known false marketing claims that I will correct every single time.')
