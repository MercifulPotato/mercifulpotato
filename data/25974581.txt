If elected representatives are behaving in the way they are with respect to encryption and tech anti-trust, then either it is an ineffectual, degenerate case of a democracy – and if the representatives are failing now, as they have been for at least a decade on this issue, when would throwing new ones be as effective as it needs to be? – or it is not fully a democracy.<p>If you want to reason from labels as if they are tautologies, here&#x27;s a word for you: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anocracy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anocracy</a><p>The alternative interpretation to what you propose is running for office. That&#x27;s not out of the question but it&#x27;s a decades-long pipeline with a lot of protections built in by convention. Outsiders are going to have difficulty until the current gen of representatives fades with age, and making headway is feasible only with the hope that the growing sphere of elite replacements are less competent behind the reigns if they decide to maintain their predecessors&#x27; policies.')
