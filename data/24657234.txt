As contaminated water flows through a bed of sand and gravel, sediment gradually clogs the pores of the filter and thereby increases resistance. Reversing the flow flushes out the sediment and reduces resistance.&quot; -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanscientist.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-memristor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanscientist.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-memristor</a>')
