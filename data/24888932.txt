Sony A7ii was really frustrating camera. Used it for for few years or so. The A7rII was a lot better and A7iii is already really good. In many cases I&#x27;m just using continuous focus and reframing the picture whenever I want without any stress about missing the focus. Tthis means I can concentrate on more important aspects of the portraits than the focus. Ofc difficult lighting situations requires more care but it&#x27;s still easy compared to previous models. A7r4 feels even better.<p>Currently it looks like Sony is leading the  mirrorless AF-race by 1-2 generations unless Canon manages to bring new flag ship model with something better as the rumors suggest but let&#x27;s see how that really goes.')
