Looking up other topics and condemning people for their opinions is not cool. It&#x27;s becoming a large problem in a lot of online forums. All of us have a lot of different opinions and they vary. This isn&#x27;t Reddit.<p>&gt; SANS isn&#x27;t some secret government group<p>I understand that, but the video&#x2F;livestream they released at the time was Unlisted on YouTube and had a watermark saying it wasn&#x27;t for general release. I realize they didn&#x27;t intend to have it up permanently and am familiar with the roles SANS has in the security industry. I was just commenting on the video and things I think they got wrong.<p>&gt; Finally, just a tip: if you want to sound like you know what you&#x27;re talking about<p>No need to be insulting. I&#x27;ve heard them called Command and Control servers before. I don&#x27;t currently work in security; haven&#x27;t in years. I&#x27;m just speaking as as developer&#x2F;sysadmin.')
