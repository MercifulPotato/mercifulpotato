If there were some further substance in the public domain (eg. emails, whistleblower, technical analysis, etc.) then adding &quot;allegedly&quot; might be more of a technicality.<p>At the moment, I have no idea whether Facebook &amp; Google did this or not. Maybe they did, maybe they didn&#x27;t. No judges have ruled on it yet. No evidence has been presented. Even the details of what exactly they are being accused of are vague. It&#x27;s purely an allegation at this point.')
