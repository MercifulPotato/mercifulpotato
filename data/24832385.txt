You&#x27;re paying a premium for egress traffic with both of them.<p>This is kind of a false dichotomy, though. I doubt anyone would be developing their own CDN from scratch to distribute their app. In a world where other companies are allowed to enter the app distribution market and compete with Apple and Google, competition could finally drive costs down. There&#x27;s no reason that instead of giving Google 30% of your revenue, you couldn&#x27;t go with a company that is able to distribute your application more efficiently and at a lower cost to you.')
