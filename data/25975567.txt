The employees at the CDC probably never heard of the problems with the obamacare website, let alone had the chance to learn any lessons from the people involved.<p>&gt; They&#x27;re supposed to be the best we have. They won a vote after all.<p>These mistakes aren&#x27;t made by the politicians you elected. They&#x27;re made by civic servants. Civic servants are employed from the pool of people who apply. And the belief that &quot;only stupid people work in government&quot; perpetuates this exact problem - because it ensures anyone who&#x27;s capable of good work stays far away from work that could make the government more effective.<p>I think the right approach to problems like this is to route these decisions through dedicated government departments who are qualified to do IT work. The real question is why the US Digital Services (which knows what they&#x27;re doing) wasn&#x27;t contacted to create this website.')
