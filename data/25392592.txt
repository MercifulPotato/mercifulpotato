Because of this, it is almost a requirement that if you are a company in a hyper-growth phase, you need to be in the Bay Area, otherwise you will struggle to hire enough people. Maybe that will change post-COVID, but I doubt it. Certainly we can expect more companies to be supportive of remote work, and I think that&#x27;s a good thing.')
