Item(by='gtsop', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1608070052, title='Ask HN: Privacy Communal Fund RFC', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='The problem:<p>There are many FOSS projects on which many of us rely on for our day to day privacy. Financially contributing to these projects is very important but can be very challenging to 1) individually put in the time to make a contribution 2) do so annonymously - eg sending cash and 3) make a meaningful contribution for every project, meaning I can&#x27;t send 1$ to 30 different orgs.<p>The solution:<p>Operate a communal funding pot to which anyone can send an arbitrary amount of money (cash - digital - crypto). The fund will support a public list of organizations that meet some criteria chosen by the community. At the end of the month or the year, the communal pot is equally split and contributed to all the projects.<p>Example:<p>Let&#x27;s say the fund supports Tor and EFF.<p>Alice donates 10$ to the pot<p>Bob donates 30$ to the pot<p>Denis donates 1$ to the pot<p>Emily donates 4$ to the pot<p>By the end of month the pot has 45$<p>The fund sends 22.5$ to Tor<p>The fund sends 22.5$ to EFF<p>The vision:<p>- Operate a recognized fund that serves as a mean of aggregating large volumes of small contributions.<p>- Serve as an income stream for the selected orgs&#x2F;projects to either help them survive (for small projects) or relieve pressure from corporate or state funds (for larger projects).<p>Your thoughts?')
