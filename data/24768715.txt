Makes complete sense that criminal gangs use the same agile approaches to innovation that a start-up would use. Of course this is thegruqg writing here, so I expected nothing less. It somehow makes criminal activity seem so much more mundane when I imagine guys at desks writing code against support tickets and user stories.<p>Meta: It&#x27;s nice to see an opsec company get smart and publish some of the better thinkers&#x2F;communicators (like thegrugq) over writing product-tailored in-house content. Maybe security is an easier field to do this for, as being scared (justifiably or otherwise) is generally good for business.<p>EDIT: expanded comment')
