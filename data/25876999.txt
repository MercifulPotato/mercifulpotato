My phone and tablet both on Android simply gave me &quot;no route to host&quot; or timeouts even with data disabled and WiFi only set; this is connecting directly to IPs no hosts&#x2F;DNS. Of course I assumed the firewall was up until I confirmed every other computing device I can access was able to hit it.<p>Why is my phone messing with my networking on my private network?')
