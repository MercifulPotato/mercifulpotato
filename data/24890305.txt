It  states those are estimated numbers culled from the web. AFAIK there is no actual public info on what the dollar amount is (and I certainly don&#x27;t know what it is).<p>I do see everyone running with those numbers as if they were fact though. That&#x27;s the danger of using such made up numbers in the report: everyone else repeats them as if they were fact even when the report says they don&#x27;t know.')
