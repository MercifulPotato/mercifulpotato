It uses a pi so you can use ZigBee etc adapters.<p>They also have their own open protocol. It is WiFi based, I wrote&#x2F;made a simple webthing, I quite liked the experience.<p>At that time, it was not reliable enough. I evaluated it for a business critical timer (turn on 8am, turn off 5pm), really simple. Unfortunately, it frequently failed to turn on&#x2F;off at the scheduled time. Cron and curl would have been more reliable.<p>I imagine it has improved by now. I should give it another whirl.')
