You&#x27;re standing in the aisle of your local CVS, massaging your temples while scanning the shelves for something—anything—to make make the pain stop.<p>What do you reach for? Tylenol? Advil? Aleve?<p>Most people, I imagine, grab whatever&#x27;s cheapest, or closest, or whatever they always use. But if you&#x27;re scrupulous enough to ask Google for the best painkiller, here&#x27;s how your friendly neighborhood tech behemoth would answer:<p>[Screenshot of Google Search Results]<p>Oh thanks Google that&#x27;s just all of them.<p>---end quote---<p>The author immediately identifies that this isn&#x27;t a real problem, by their own admissions that &quot;Most people, I imagine, grab whatever&#x27;s cheapest, or closest, or whatever they always use.&quot;  Yea, most people when they have a headache and know that most painkillers on the market will result in about the same degree of relief, don&#x27;t bother to cross reference a medical meta-analysis, because they have a headache and if the $0.01 worth of aspirin doesn&#x27;t make it feel better they will just take a second pill and eat the penny.<p>I like the author&#x27;s conclusion about how to quickly validate business ideas, but even in the title the author still holds firm to the belief that this was a &quot;fantastic startup idea&quot; even though reality seems to think otherwise.  Was this such a great idea, do most consumers actually want to review a meta-analysis when picking their OTC medicine, or do most people just try a few things, get influenced by advertising, and purchase the most reasonably priced medicine they think will help.  I am just a single data point, but I don&#x27;t normally feel naked and unscrupulous when I just read the symptoms that a medicine treats and pick one, and that strategy generally works just fine.<p>Solution in search of a problem and also in search of humans that act in this weird atypical fashion.')
