Consumer inflation is the go to mechanism for keeping unemployment low. It will keep working even with automation. The government merely has to enact effective policies that keep consumer inflation on track.<p>There is no meaningful distinction between robots and foreign labor when it comes to low employment rates. Both are &quot;not Americans&quot; if your definition of Americans only includes humans that are citizens of the US. Any inequality that would be caused by robots already exists in the form of inequality caused by globalization.<p>You can solve inequality quite easily with the right policies. Change tax policy for the wealthy or create demand for labor through economic stimulus.')
