Philosophical - you don&#x27;t want to get the threat of physical force involved unless there is a very very good reason for doing so. That is, you don&#x27;t want to make things illegal. So we forbid outright lying and fraud, openly misleading customers, but allow things that you describe. If you have a private online platform, why should you not be allowed to or be compelled to moderate its content? Yes, tech companies will try to maximize user engagement, but what else should they be trying to maximize? It is up to the rest of society to develop a proper culture and information hygiene to shape their demand, and tech companies will adapt. It can develop organically and passed from generation to generation, or you can try to expedite the process through schools, media and other mechanisms that exist in a society.<p>2. Practical - people tend to get interested by forbidden things, and they seem to like their biases. In the Soviet Union, for example, perhaps most people were fascinated by the Hollywood movies of the 70s and the 80s, and even the way the Western brands were being advertised. They seemed &#x27;cooler&#x27; to the Soviet products that were mostly devoid of marketing. Try to eliminate most biases, and people will vote with their feet. Arguably a better approach is to allow things, but in good faith educate people on how to best deal with them and why that is the right way of dealing with them. Same way a lot of parents today would explain to their children why they should stay away from cigarettes, for example, or wash their hands before having food.')
