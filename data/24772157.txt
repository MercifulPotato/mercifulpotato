I think in general they&#x27;re a good workaround for getting things passed that the legislature for some reason doesn&#x27;t have the political will to work on.<p>On the downside, repealing these things usually takes <i>another</i> ballot measure (the legislature can&#x27;t touch most of these), so if one passes that turns out to be a bad idea, it&#x27;ll be harder to remove it.  Unfortunately we do have a few persistent ballot measures that have been on the books for years that are detrimental, but there&#x27;s no will to get rid of them (Prop 13, I&#x27;m looking at you).<p>Occasionally I&#x27;ll vote &quot;no&quot; on a proposition that I agree with, simply because I believe it&#x27;s something that the legislature should take up, and doing it through the ballot measure process will end up being too inflexible.')
