Instead we want to get a far more profound understanding of the influence the different parameters have on the breast. \nSo results of the study will be something like: in case of an areola size asymmetry, more people tend to accept the asymmetry then a size correction when you therefore have scars.\nI hope that explanation helps a little bit!\nThank you very much again for your support!')
