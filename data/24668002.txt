They updated the OS so that you can&#x27;t access the main interface (which includes built in Netflix and Amazon Prime, among others) unless you agree to a ToS giving them access to all kind of information I don&#x27;t want to give them.  So I factory reset it and now I only use my Apple TV with it and am all the more happy having done so.  Screw Vizio.  They&#x27;ll never get another dime of mine.')
