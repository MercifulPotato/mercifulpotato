Since when has violence been a body-centric term? Looking at the etymology doesnâ€™t help your case either:<p>&gt; late 13c., &quot;physical force used to inflict injury or damage,&quot; from Anglo-French and Old French violence (13c.), from Latin violentia &quot;vehemence, impetuosity,&quot; from violentus &quot;vehement, forcible,&quot; probably related to violare (see violation). Weakened sense of &quot;improper treatment&quot; is attested from 1590s.')
