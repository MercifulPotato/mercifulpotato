The dashcam video shows current speed from GPS. I usually drive the speed limit where it makes sense. The speed traps here in DK are placed in easily guessable locations and mostly avoided. The chance to get caught by the traffic police is very low in my opinion - 130 km&#x2F;h zones on highways are not policed according to my experiences.')
