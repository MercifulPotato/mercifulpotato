They were absolutely convinced that they had found the perpetrator. In a self-congratulatory frenzy, people began looking for more and more photos to support their theory. Everyone was energized by this apparent wisdom of the crowds, a miraculous use of technology to convert readily available information into a conclusion that (they thought) traditional law enforcement couldn&#x27;t figure out. Later, it turned out they were all completely wrong and the whole thing was a disaster. Police had been operating the entire time on data that wasn&#x27;t available to the public, allowing them to come to the correct conclusion.<p>This is how many of those online health communities operate. They collect anecdotes and combine them with morsels of information from publicly available papers to give themselves a false impression that they&#x27;re on the cutting edge of research. If you search their history, they&#x27;ve usually been doing it for years or even decades. Their past is littered with dead ends that everyone thought was the next big thing. Meanwhile, they&#x27;re all convinced that the latest pet theories or the latest supplement hold the key to unlocking the secrets to their illness.<p>There&#x27;s a minimum amount of online reading that can help direct your own treatment, but getting caught up in the endless posting, negativity, and dead-end theories becomes counterproductive very quickly. Unfortunately, the loudest voices and most frequent posters tend to be the least qualified to be dispensing information. There&#x27;s an added complication where these people start building their online identities around their illness, which can result in weird turf wars intertwining of egos with discussions.')
