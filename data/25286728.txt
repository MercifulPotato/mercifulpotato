One year to become a good engineer and another to become a tech lead. Seriously? Facebook seems like an interesting place to be. Maybe I should also apply there.<p>But on a more serious note. There is no way, no matter how smart you are, to become a Tech Lead (at least not at a reputable company) within two years. It&#x27;s just mentally not possible to learn all the things you need to learn in that time. And that is not even considering the fact that most of the time you don&#x27;t have such ideal conditions that you would be exposed to the necessary scenarios and learning opportunities to pull that off even if it was humanly possible. Perhaps Facebook&#x27;s levels are more based on &quot;business achievements&quot; than actual competence, which is fine I guess. If I make the company 10 million dollars, why should I not get a good chunk of it, regardless of how experienced I am? (I am serious)<p>But the fact that E8 is still about &quot;team of 4&quot; tells me a lot. Principal Engineers at Amazon are responsible for potentially hundreds of engineers and that level is said to be about E7. Doesn&#x27;t make any sense whatsoever.<p>And the author shows that:<p>&quot;E6-&gt;E7 and E7-&gt;E8 promotions were mainly about making something successful. My execution could have been perfect but if the product didnâ€™t work, I would not have been promoted.&quot;<p>Yup, pure business success based promotions, which makes any level based comparison between Facebook and Amazon kinda moot.<p>I would be interested to know if this is just one data point, or if this is how Facebook generally operates.')
