Item(by='waterfowl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610469771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746034, text='LV stuff being leather the costs of an equivalent quality knockoff(if such a thing exists) aren&#x27;t dirt cheap like cotton. The heavily branded stuff(monogram canvas) tends to be on the lower end, entry level luxury aimed at a more aspirational purchaser.<p>Upper end LV and more expensive luxury leather good concerns are more understated, sort of a &#x27;if you know you know&#x27; thing -- Hermes, Celine, Bottega maybe, etc. A Birkin in a non exotic leather with normal hardware is not a very flashy loud bag(unless you know it). There&#x27;s still a lot of status signaling and striver insecurity in this(it is fashion after all) but it&#x27;s slightly more covert and these people are nominally concerned about ostentatious branded stuff being &#x27;tacky.&#x27; The social ideal is less about flashy spending and more imitating serious old money who &quot;just want to pay for the highest quality&quot;(though this is, imo, fiction). Can&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re trying.')
