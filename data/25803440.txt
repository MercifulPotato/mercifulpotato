Instead, they faced heavy regulation, especially in regards to setting prices and passenger routes. Post-WW2, the passenger traffic collapsed due to airlines and highway traffic, while the regulator generally required railroads to continue running money-losing routes.<p>The Pennsylvania RR&#x27;s merger with New York Central in the 70s proved to be a disaster. The result of the Penn Central bankruptcy was the removal of several of regulations, and the transfer of passenger traffic to local commuter rail agencies and Amtrak. Freight companies consolidated like mad afterwards, ending up with what are now 7 major railroads (UP, BNSF, CSX, NS, CP, CN, KCS), and they invested in intermodal and double-stacked container freight, which is why the US has better freight traffic than Europe.')
