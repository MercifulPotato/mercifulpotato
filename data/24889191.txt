Google can&#x27;t return results that don&#x27;t exist.<p>If you Google &#x27;$PRODUCT review&#x27; and only get Amazon-affiliate scam sites pretending to be review sites, it&#x27;s not because Google has been SEOed but rather because there are no actual reviews of $PRODUCT.<p>Aside from a botched update last year, where Google would only return results that were selling things, Google Search is still very good at finding information that exists.')
