It doesn&#x27;t have a professional organization. Your &quot;cred&quot; is reputational and based on work history, not on actual credentials or licensure. It&#x27;s closer in this sense to a trade, like electrical work or plumbing, where members frequently are unionized.<p>Why unionize? Because your facial recognition tech is being used to round up Uigurs, or bomb Yemeni weddings, or bake cakes for gay people. To have actual say over the products you work on, and how they&#x27;re used.')
