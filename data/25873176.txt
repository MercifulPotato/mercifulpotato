At high RPM, or lower throttle positions you lose efficiency. So if you want maximum fuel efficiency you need to put the throttle to the floor, but stay at low RPMs. Thus the CVT is not doing the right thing for fuel efficiency.  (though I&#x27;m not sure if the difference is worth measuring)<p>Obviously the exact numbers varies a bit from engine to engine.')
