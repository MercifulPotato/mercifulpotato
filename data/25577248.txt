Anima Anand kumar&#x27;s tweet displayed an active participation in cancelling and chasing out anyone who does not fall in line with a very narrow definition of equality in society.<p>Yann is still active on twitter. He claimed to leave twitter, but didn&#x27;t for any reasonable definition of &quot;left&quot;. Yet people continue to claim that Gebru &quot;cancelled&quot; him or something. He&#x27;s had like 15 twitter interactions today.<p>Be as skeptical of Yann and Domingos as you are of Gebru.<p>&gt; There is a reason that supreme court justices are lawyers and not activists.<p>Lots of people would claim that many supreme court justices <i>are</i> activists, and depending on who you ask, exactly which judges are activists would change (both Ginsburg and Scalia have been called &quot;activist&quot; judges, not to mention <i>Roberts</i>, which I find hilarious)<p>&gt; The open letter merely points that out and asks for equal representation of ideas without threat of being fired or sidelined in entirity.<p>I&#x27;d think someone calling for this would strongly support Timnit Gebru. That would be the ideologically consistent position, yes?')
