Has surreal trade surplus with it.<p>2. Supports nearly entire consumer spending part of your economy.<p>3. Provides most of your light industry goods.<p>4. Buys a big chunk of your debt.<p>This is why I was saying that China can easily do a blunder, after a blunder, and still outmatch the West economically, and you need something other than simply sanctions.')
