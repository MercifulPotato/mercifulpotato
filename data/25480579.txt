Item(by='pbalau', descendants=None, kids=[25480725, 25481449], score=None, time=1608407575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479163, text='&gt; I agree the writing is exceptional.<p>Can you give some examples? I&#x27;m half way through act 2 and I didn&#x27;t find anything exceptional.<p>What I did find is a lot of gameplay time padding. Wait for this or that to call you (instead of going on with the mission). And you can not actually wait, have to do other missions. Go through this interminable chat with an npc where you are being given options that don&#x27;t alter at all the end state (that milltech lady for example). Have this unsinkable part where you find out all kinds of crap about a character that you met 20 mins before and most likely not going to meet again. Not to mention he tried to kill the protagonist in 2 of the pre(?)-prologues. Why did the fat fixer have to die? Why doesn&#x27;t every vet that panhandles have a story about the wars? I would love to stay a while and listen...<p>I didn&#x27;t play enough Witcher to see if they have the same kind of issues, but I am ready to bet most of the success of that series was caused by the content they had to work with, produced by a real writer. I can&#x27;t stop to wonder if there wasn&#x27;t a better idea to not get Keanu involved and use that money to hire a bunch of sf writers. Is like GoT (the tv series), while they had content to rely on, all was good. Then we got Season 8...')
