The doubled `goto fail;` line was included since the first public revision of libsecurity_ssl, and the (c) of that file is 1999-2001,2005-2012 Apple Inc. [1]<p>Nowadays, due to Apple never using any git or any other version control software for opensourced codes, I could trace it down to Mac OSX 10.4 which was released in 2005. [2]<p>With 10.1, there&#x27;s no libsecurity open sourced, I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;m pretty damn sure that at least 10.2 included the library back then. I don&#x27;t have my old Powerbook G4 anymore, but I swear I could verify this bug on 10.2 (Jaguar) that was running on it at the time.<p>Other versions of (maybe patched?) versions of libsecurity-ssl are located on the same server, with a global directory for everything so it&#x27;s not actually versioned!? [3]<p>At least the version of the file that has copyright 2000-2001 still has the same bug in it, so that is very likely the one that was used in the 10.1 public release [4]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Security-55471&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl&#x2F;lib&#x2F;sslKeyExchange.c.auto.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Security-55471&#x2F;...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;mac-os-x-104.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;release&#x2F;mac-os-x-104.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl-6&#x2F;lib&#x2F;sslKeyExchange.cpp.auto.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.apple.com&#x2F;source&#x2F;libsecurity_ssl&#x2F;libsecur...</a>')
