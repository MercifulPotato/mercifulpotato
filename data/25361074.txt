Some of that is core (TBH, FF&#x27;s engine is old and creaky and webkit-derived browsers out-perform it on all kinds of metrics, though FF has significantly closed the gap). Some of it is that teams develop for Chrome first, because it&#x27;s the first browser shortcut available. Plus, Chrome has all kinds of extensions built in-house at Google to make your life easier, and those have to be rewritten from scratch if someone wants them for FF also.<p>So now when you&#x27;re doing UI development and testing it, your first testbed is always Chrome, because it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re using as a developer. So bugs always get seen first in Chrome, and only seen in FF if your team has acceptance testing requirements or you happen to have a team member who uses FF. So the gap widens: now using Chrome in Google is, maybe, a 5% better experience, because you&#x27;re that much less likely to hit bugs the developing team hasn&#x27;t hit yet. And th positive feedback loop continues.<p>The only way I&#x27;m aware of to stop this is to force teams to put half their engineers on using FF as their primary browser, and I&#x27;ve never seen a team willing to do so.<p>FF has die-hard supporters inside Google, but few are so die-hard they&#x27;re willing to intentionally slow down their own development velocity by using a less-supported browser. Google&#x27;s too competitive to incentivize that.<p>(Note: this applies to bugs that crop up between OS platforms also, because that happens---sometimes, the details of Chrome on MacOS surface a bug that never shows up on Linux. Some teams <i>do</i> require one engineer at least to use Mac, because the MacOS userbase is big enough that there&#x27;s financial incentive to not break it. FF has like 5% market share; there&#x27;s no such incentive there).')
