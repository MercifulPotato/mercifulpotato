Item(by='theptip', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603819596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908675, text='&gt; seems like a high level of collateral damage<p>I do recommend you pick up the book and give it a read (it&#x27;s great), as Horowitz does go into a lot of detail on when the &quot;shocking rule&quot; strategy is appropriate and the considerations. I won&#x27;t do as good a job summarizing here but I&#x27;ll try.<p>It&#x27;s true that this inflicts collateral damage. That&#x27;s part of the point. The fact that you&#x27;re willing to inflict collateral damage to preserve&#x2F;enshrine a norm is shocking, and that demonstrates the commitment to that norm.<p>You definitely should not play this card often (ideally never, but you should have it in your playbook).<p>The action is shocking, and you&#x27;d expect many employees to be shocked. They will discuss the event because it&#x27;s shocking, and so your decision will be well-known and the news will be self-perpetuating. (And maybe some will leave who don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a big deal to call women &quot;bitches&quot;; this is a good thing, you have made your cultural norms clearer, and employees who realize they are not a cultural fit will tend to self-select out at the margin.)<p>Note you can use the &quot;shocking rule&quot; principle in non-ism enforcement too, e.g. &quot;mishandled customer PII =&gt; instant fired&quot;, &quot;plane crashed due to failures in the QA process that was your core responsibility =&gt; instant fired&quot; or even Bezos&#x27;s famous &quot;All Amazon internal services will communcate over public APIs, if you don&#x27;t do this you&#x27;re fired&quot;. Not making any specific claims about whether these are good reasons, but just pointing out that whatever norm you want to enforce that are critical to the company&#x27;s&#x2F;org&#x27;s survival, you can use this principle to fuel a dramatic culture shift. You don&#x27;t get to play this card often though, so be sure that the shift is worth it.')
