You might also be fortunate, like me, to have had parents and a background that laid the foundation for your success.<p>Sadly so many in our communities are suffering in big and small ways right now. From kids that haven’t had school for more than a year, to those barely holding on to tenuous jobs and finances. There’s those of us dealing with direct and indirect consequences of Covid. Even in health care, long seen as a stable job, have had to bare the brunt of Covid with long hours, risk of illness, and furloughs.<p>Anyway, I can’t tell you what your community could use from you. Money? Donations? Volunteer time? If you can do any of that, please think how you can help your community become stronger, not just today on MLK day, but all of 2021.')
