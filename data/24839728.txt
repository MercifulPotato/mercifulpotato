Not all parents have that ability&#x2F;motivation.<p>I think the key is to not have it get into a 7 hours of structured school plus 4 hours of structured after school extracurriculars (i.e. sports, piano or any other competitive zero sum activities etc.) where an &#x27;adult&#x27; is telling what activities to complete. Basically in such a schedule in no part of the day has the child done any activity where they thought for themselves.<p>Would much rather give them time in their remaining 4 hours to provide some structure on how to research an area&#x2F;project for focus and create something self directed.')
