Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609280310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574794, text='The &quot;number of countries&quot; is a misleading metric for landmine treaty - as it includes all the many countries who expect no wars at all and so they&#x27;re not actually giving up anything. The 33 include almost all countries who actually expect to fight any wars and&#x2F;or have serious militaries. Okay, UK, France and Turkey have banned landmines, but USA, Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Iran haven&#x27;t banned them, and those 7 matter far more than the 164 signatories of the Ottawa convention for actual banning of landmines in practical use.<p>And of course, the roadside IEDs that USA saw in Iraq and Afghanistan would still be legal under the Ottawa convention (it does not ban anti-vehicle mines and remotely detonated devices) so you can&#x27;t really assert that USA is complaining about something they won&#x27;t ratify themselves.<p>If we look at the history of landmines, then it&#x27;s fairly certain that countries are not going to give up a capability that they expect to use, all the universally accepted treaties only ban things that we consider impractical, which do not give a serious advantage (e.g. chemical weapons, which aren&#x27;t competitive with conventional weapons if you&#x27;re fighting against a proper military and not just gassing civilians and&#x2F;or guerillas).<p>So combat robots will be banned only if (and while) they turn out to be useless and impractical compared to alternatives, or perhaps selectively banned by the countries who weren&#x27;t going to use them anyway because they can&#x27;t afford them. If they are actually good for their role, then they will be legal for all the major militaries.')
