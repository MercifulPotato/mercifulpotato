The complaint is that my local newspaper doesn’t need a desktop class application. Nor does my bank, nor does Reddit for that matter.<p>There are vanishingly few websites that need a “desktop application” performance profile. Most websites are just viewing documents. The size of the SPA frameworks is frequently higher than the actual content being viewed.<p>Finally, if matching desktop app performance is truly the goal, the majority of SPAs fail horribly. Poor request patterns and transitions make the pages just as slow as server side rendered html. I would rather wait one second to get a JS-free response than look at another damn spinning circle for 5 seconds as the page sputters new elements in.')
