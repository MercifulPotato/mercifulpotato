It&#x27;s not lewd, doesn&#x27;t play to stereotypes, etc.<p>To me, a basic litmus test is whether you could easily swap the gender without reworking anything. If you can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably offensive, if you can it&#x27;s practically gender neutral (naming aside). It&#x27;s not a catch all, obviously, as it&#x27;s no replacement for awareness of history, culture, stereotypes etc.<p>It&#x27;s easy enough to maintain a rebranded mirror synced to upstream. Instead people seem to want to take offense just for the sake of virtue signaling.')
