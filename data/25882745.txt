They&#x27;re frozen when dying or dead, the process itself causes significant damage (with every mitigation just trading in a different severe form of damage), and even if future technology could undo <i>all that</i> and somehow make this severely damaged body somewhat operational, why in the world would anyone bother?<p>The person is forgotten, replaced, and has nothing in their name any more. There is no gain for those reviving them.')
