I worked on that OS.\n  • Neural networks of various stripes, from scratch or using off-the-shelf libraries\n  • PyTorch, TensorFlow, MCT, Accord because life is too short to constantly be writing your own frameworks &amp; libraries these days\n  • Internet scale video content distribution pipeline *7\n  • Game Development on consoles &amp; mobile &amp; PC\n  • Firmware &amp; embedded systems in compute &amp; memory constrained environments because the PM was too cheap to spring for an extra 4gbit flash chip on the board.\n  • OpenWRT development &amp; drivers for SBC&#x2F;SoC &amp; router devices because your CTO was too cheap to license a commercial router OS\n  • Technical Project Management &amp; Team Leadership with agency+startup+mid-cap CTO experience, but only seeking individual contributor role.\n  • Co-founded a few companies. Co-raised $60M+. Generated $2B+ in lifetime value.\n  • Significant contributions to mobile apps &amp; games with downloads (combined) measured in the (low) millions\n  • Windows &amp; Linux internals &amp; kernel &amp; device drivers\n</code></pre>\nRésumé&#x2F;CV: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;justinlloyd" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;justinlloyd</a><p><pre><code>  » 20+ years of experience *8\n  » Bachelors Computer Science\n  » Masters in Software Engineering\n  » Masters in Artificial Intelligence\n  » Masters Project Management\n  » Masters Entrepreneurship&#x2F;Marketing\n  » Masters Business Administration\n  » Diploma in Electronics\n</code></pre>\nEmail: justin@justinlloyd.io<p>I am gainfully employed. I am open to opportunities that are interesting and different.<p>NB: No agencies, no third-party recruiters, no CRUD apps that can be done with GraphQL &amp; no-code&#x2F;Expo.io, no free&#x2F;volunteer work, nothing for exposure, no &quot;hoping to raise&quot; start-ups, no military, no spook agencies, no Facebook, no Amazon, no weapons systems.<p><pre><code>  *1. Sometimes the hardware talks back but I refuse to admit I worked on that line of creepy robot toys\n  *2. No, really, I wrote some computer vision software that identifies coprolites.\n  *3. I used an industrial medical robot arm augmented with tele-presence and Amazon MechanicalTurk so I can pay someone 25 cents to clean my cat&#x27;s litter box.\n  *4. I don&#x27;t do military stuff, work on anything that is specifically designed to kill people or projects that have the potential to be weaponized\n  *5. Also, those creepy wrist bands you wear at theme parks and on-board cruise ships. I *happen to know* you ain&#x27;t jogging at 4AM in the morning in your state room and I have the data analytics that will back me up. *9\n  *6. I built a multi-touch game for my cat with a artificial intelligence virtual prey learning from the cat&#x27;s predator actions. I wrote a paper on toe beans rejection.\n  *7. I built the first iterations for the backend of a popular video streaming website that a large majority of your employees have spent &quot;alone time&quot; with.\n  *8. No, I&#x27;m not interested in doing a Leetcode before I get to talk to a human being.\n  *9. I have an anecdote about two wristbands belonging to people of opposite genders climbing a lot of stairs in the men&#x27;s restroom at a major Florida theme park.</code></pre>')
