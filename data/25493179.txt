Especially in anything related to alcohol&#x2F;substance abuse, there most often is no objective &quot;truth&quot;</i><p>I dunno, sounds pretty objective to me:<p>&gt; <i>Out of the 20 patients the Sobell study claimed were moderately drinking, only one arguably was still moderately drinking a decade later.</i><p>Of course, to conclude from a 20 person study that moderate drinking can never work is another thing. But simply ignoring the study can&#x27;t be the solution either.<p>&gt; <i>What does help however is &quot;housing first&quot;</i><p>This is probably true, but you didn&#x27;t give any empirical evidence for that either. Also, not all alcoholics are homeless.')
