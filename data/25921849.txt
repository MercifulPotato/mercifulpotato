The thinking there is that if we were to solve these problems, we&#x27;d <i>have</i> to get closer to a true artificial intelligence (the kind that today we&#x27;d call &quot;AGI&quot; because &quot;AI&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything anymore).<p>This line of thinking has been shown to be pretty faulty. We&#x27;ve come up with engines and algorithms that can play Go and Chess, but we aren&#x27;t any closer to anything that resembles a general intelligence.')
