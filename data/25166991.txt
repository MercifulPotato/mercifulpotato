It&#x27;s not hard to find these areas when you have the fortune of hindsight. These past 2 weeks I took CI from ~40 min to ~2 min and not only improved everyone&#x27;s lives at the company but also made it way cheaper to host beefier CI machines. If 1 build takes 20 minutes &amp; 32 GB of ram vs 1 minute &amp; 32gb of ram the costs are way different. At previous companies re-architecting core systems to allow better binpacking saved similarly large amounts of money (15k&#x2F;month -&gt; 1k&#x2F;month).<p>At way smaller companies (2 people), though, this is way harder unless someone has done something really wrong.')
