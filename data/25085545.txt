Those in the community who care more about just making a good encyclopedia are eventually forced out by those who are interested in power games and process.  I&#x27;ve heard it mentioned before (I forget if it has some formal name or not) in regards to companies where the people who primarily want to prioritize the goal of the company are eventually replaced by those who primarily want to implement and navigate bureaucracy because they can outcompete them on the local level, even if the company is worse off in general.')
