Instead, they represent FAO figures for carcass mass availability (with &quot;carcass mass&quot; for poultry estimated as ready-to-cook mass),[2] divided by population. The amount eaten by humans differs from carcass mass availability because the latter does not account for losses, which include bones, losses in retail and food service or home preparation (including trim and cooking), spoilage and &quot;downstream&quot; waste, and amounts consumed by pets (compare dressed weight)</i><p>So, in short, human meat consumption in this stats is always overstated (for good reasons, we produce it anyway, it&#x27;s not coming from outer space).<p>&gt; <i>For example, the FAO (2002) figure for Denmark, which has one of the highest meat export rates compared to its population, was 145.9 kg (322 lb) (highest in the world). More recent FAO figures (2009) have taken the earlier discrepancy into account, resulting in a significantly lower 95.2 kg (210 lb) for Denmark (13th in the world). When further adjusted for loss, calculations by DTU Fødevareinstituttet suggest the actual consumption was 48 kg (106 lb) per adult</i><p>But your cat instead eats 300 grams of meat everyday, there&#x27;s no margin of error, multiplied by 365 days it amount to 109,5 kgs.<p>Make no mistake, your cat could be <i></i>actually<i></i> eating 2.28 times more meat than the average Danish person.<p>&gt; the cat food is usually between 40 and 90% meat while the rest is fillers<p>While instead humans eat only filet and steaks, no bones, no fat, nothing else, only steaks, right?<p>Well, haggis would like to show you something.<p>Also, the centenarian Italian tradition of cooking entrails would like a word.<p>If you seat at a table with my mom and her four sisters, they constantly fight to eat the neck and feet of the chicken.<p>While my sister prefers the liver and the giblets.<p>I, on the other hand, love the &quot;fagioli con le cotiche&quot; (beans and pork rind) cooked in the pignata and served with a tomato sauce cooked together with an ham bone.
