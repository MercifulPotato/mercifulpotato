The article mentions heavy duty trucks.<p>We don&#x27;t have to guess. If you go to Volvo&#x27;s site, you can see exactly what sort of trucks they are talking about. We&#x27;re talking about:<p>=&gt; &quot;A two-axle truck with a gross vehicle weight up to 16 tonnes and an excellent working environment for the driver. Volvo Trucks can deliver complete vehicles for urban transport like deliveries.&quot;<p>AND<p>=&gt; &quot;A three-axle truck with a gross vehicle weight up to 27 tonnes and a comfortable working environment for the driver. Volvo Trucks can deliver complete vehicles for demanding types of urban transport like waste collection, light construction transports and deliveries.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvotrucks.com&#x2F;en-en&#x2F;trucks&#x2F;alternative-fuels&#x2F;electric-trucks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.volvotrucks.com&#x2F;en-en&#x2F;trucks&#x2F;alternative-fuels&#x2F;e...</a><p>&gt; Even in the last mile delivery case, a limited 300km range is a problem because that means the same truck cannot be shared by workers in following shifts.<p>Pretty much all delivery companies have sub 12 hour routes which run during business hours and into the evening. There is very little demand for package delivery at 2am. Likewise, construction is a 9-5 sort of job. Garbage collection (which is specifically mentioned) is almost always a once&#x2F; per day route.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is demand for autonomous 24&#x2F;7 vehicles out there, but there are also plenty of commercial vehicles which are parked over night as well.')
