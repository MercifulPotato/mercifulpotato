Item(by='pjmorris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602383962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24742234, text='&gt; Shifting the moral responsibility from the human&#x2F;user&#x2F;corporation to the technology itself seems illogical.<p>Sure, it is people who make decisions, and so they have moral responsibility (at least in my model of the world and in yours.) Consider our examples; whether it&#x27;s ships and guns leading to the colonization of the US, nuclear weapons leading to the threat of nuclear destruction, or TCPIP, HTTP, HTML, etc leading to the societal effects of Google and Facebook, there are unintended consequences that wouldn&#x27;t be present if the technology were absent.<p>&gt; Democratization might work, but isn&#x27;t there a risk for the user to corrupt its intended purpose due to the inherent darkness of human nature?<p>&gt; What do you say of missiles, and as extension, nuclear weapons? Do you want dictatorships to have them as well?<p>So, again from our examples, in your view, &#x27;we&#x27; (the ones with the technology) are the &#x27;good guys&#x27;, and &#x27;they&#x27; (the ones without the technology) are the &#x27;bad guys.&#x27;  Is there something besides the technology that actually makes us morally superior, or are all humans created equal? I don&#x27;t see how you can have it both ways. To me, it looks like technology is the difference, making its case for neutrality suspect IMO.')
