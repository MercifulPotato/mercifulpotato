They don&#x27;t try to look for niche sources and articles and just gently correct your query to pertain to something more popular or trendy. We don&#x27;t need more of that.<p>&gt; <i>What if instead these algorithms were tuned to serve us direct websites or text that could provide our next source for inspiration?</i><p>Sure, I like that. But how do we ensure it would also not be used for ads and tracking again? I feel companies are just too easily tempted and can&#x27;t be trusted.<p>&gt; <i>Seems like we got to a search bar that can answer any question we type in but haven&#x27;t thought beyond it.</i><p>IMO a lot of us here thought about it but (a) it&#x27;s not easy, it&#x27;s likely a rather gigantic undertaking and (b) nobody funds such research and (c) we can&#x27;t do it as a hobby while maintaining a $dayjob so in the end we are the mercy of the corps.')
