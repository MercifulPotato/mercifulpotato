Item(by='vsareto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609888394, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650907, text='&gt;Poorly formatted log statements&#x2F;errors can become harder to debug\n&gt;UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.<p>The GUID vs Int problem is incidental to the real problem: poorly formatting logs. An integer or other key type without context is no more helpful.<p>&gt;At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the ergonomics of GUIDs across all languages, but C#&#x2F;MSSQL makes them pretty easy to handle when they have been chosen as keys.<p>So the answer, as far as ergonomics go, is not settled depending on your stack.')
