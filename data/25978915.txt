The Australian response was not nationally coordinated and each state has been doing their own thing. They have land borders between each other and yet the Victorian outbreak didn&#x27;t spread to either NSW or SA because they implemented border checks by lining the roads with police and fining people who attempted to circumvent them, while WA implemented a hard border even earlier as soon as there was a non-zero number of cases.<p>The Australian states are geographically larger than many European countries, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s an island. The only effect nationally was hotel quarantine for arriving flights which is possible for landlocked countries as well.')
