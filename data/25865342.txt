There&#x27;s not a single left politician elected to any federal office anywhere in the nation, for example.<p>Hollywood (the industry funded by the US Military to put pro-military-industrial-state advertisements into movies) is not &quot;left leaning&quot; in any meaningful way. &quot;News Media&quot; all lean either slight-right (MSNBC, NPR) to hard-right (Fox News, NYT, WSJ). Silicon Valley is primarily driven by right-leaning &quot;libertarian&quot; conservative types (at both big corps and small startups). Democrats are largely all conservative (in that, Democrats of 2021 mostly all hold identical views to what Republicans used to hold in the year 1998)<p>We do have a few centrist politicians and groups (Bernie Sanders &#x2F; AOC+Squad, etc), and a few centrist movements (rights for LGBTQ+, or &quot;Defund the Police&quot;, for example, is largely politically-centrist initiatives).<p>But I&#x27;m not aware of even a single left-leaning politician in any federal elected office. For example, no elected federal politician is advocating for the nationalization of all private corporations, or elimination of all for-profit entities, or for a complete cap on individual wealth, or for giving Hawaii back to the aboriginal Hawaiians, or anything like that, that could be considered a full-left position. (But meanwhile, on the right, there <i>is</i> a meaningful ultra-far-right political movement arguing that we should ignore replace democratically-elected officials with dicatorships, for example. And that group <i>has elected members</i> sitting in the House + Senate <i>today</i>)')
