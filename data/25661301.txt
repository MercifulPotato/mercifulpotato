Most of us do it not because we love interviewing but because 1) It&#x27;s a way to check the &quot;citizenship&quot; box on performance reviews. 2) A director or VP sent a mass email exhorting us to join the interviewer pool. Everyone I know in fact views interviewing as a chore that takes away from one&#x27;s day job. But, there&#x27;s standardized training and emphasis on objective tests and rubrics to minimize bias. Given this assembly line process and the fact that most interviewers want to be elsewhere, there&#x27;s very little reason to expect a random interviewer to want to sell you on continuing a process that you consider yourself above.<p>If a candidate proclaimed that they didn&#x27;t agree to the terms of one of my interviews midway through, I&#x27;d certainly exchange a few words with them to try to make them more comfortable, but in the end I would by fine with bidding them farewell and being glad that writing up that interview feedback would be easy.')
