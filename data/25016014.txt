I remember having a C library for some user interface component that I compiled to C and then disassembled to optimise (by hand) because the C compiler was &quot;useless&quot; and improve on.<p>Of course the Amiga got other interesting languages, like AmigaE (whose author is probably better known for FlatBuffers these days, but AmigaE was a usability revelation at the time)')
