I don&#x27;t think CS fundamentals are &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;nonsense&quot; by any stretch. There have been times in my career when I wished I had a stronger background. In particular, I&#x27;ve worked for NASA and in finance, and in both cases, I&#x27;d have benefitted from stronger statistics and math knowledge.<p>My comment was that most (I would say the vast majority) of software engineer roles don&#x27;t require a computer science background (emphasis on the science), and wouldn&#x27;t leverage it even if you had it. If you <i>do</i> have a strong CS background, it opens a lot of doors, and in particular opens doors to--in my opinion--more interesting and challenging work. There&#x27;s nothing bad about getting a CS degree. It&#x27;s just not required for a software engineering job. I&#x27;m not being dismissive of the education. I&#x27;m skeptical of the idea that it&#x27;s important for most roles.')
