Gmail for example. They even allow accounts! Now maybe Google wants to argue that Gmail qualifies for the personal communication tools exception. But wait, GitHub doesn&#x27;t block Iranian IPs either! They allow free accounts as well! Call in the feds!<p>Is there any government guidance or legal precedent that says IP blocking is required? There is not.<p>Any evidence that the government warned companies privately? And is this the way things are done in the US? Private threats while the citizenry at large is left on the dark about what the law requires?<p>A Gitlab executive facing prison time over failure to block Iranian IPs would be unjust even with clear guidance, on the import of the offense alone. But given the lack of legal clarity, this would be banana republic stuff. One of my main points here is, Americans should not accept such a state of affairs.<p>It&#x27;s bad enough that there is so much over compliance, it&#x27;s disappointing to see people running to normalize the idea that fear of jail time in the face of legal uncertainty is a way to run a country.')
