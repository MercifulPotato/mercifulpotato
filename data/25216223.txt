I&#x27;m a graduate student and this realization has crushed all hope I had to succeed in my field. Either I&#x27;ve become dumber, or somehow every task - even simple house chores - has gotten way more time consuming and hard. I used to study difficult courses with lots of math and I would learn them easily. Now? I spend a whole day trying to read a couple sample questions and even without solving them, it takes me hours and hours to just read the solutions which are already there. Or for example, I used to read a text&#x2F;paper&#x2F;article and be able to retain what I read. Now I get lost in the sentences and can&#x27;t find my way through the text. I&#x27;m 29 and this shouldn&#x27;t be happening to me. Honestly, this situation, along with the pressure I feel from the faculty and the PhD program, has made me seriously reconsider dropping out. But I know even in the industry I need to be sharp and quick. Have you experienced a similar thing? How did you cope with it&#x2F;fix it?')
