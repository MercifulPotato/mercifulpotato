Diversity efforts can work to offset biases and enable getting closer to meritocracy. For example hiring the best in your network coming from a high-class university doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re hiring the best overall. The diversity effort may be for example to make sure that the job offer is visible to the brilliant person who wouldn&#x27;t even find it otherwise. Or it may be an effort to ensure a less biased review (masking names?) Or it&#x27;s making sure that people do behave well internally, so the company isn&#x27;t avoided by the best people for hiring racist assholes for example.')
