Item(by='Grimm1', descendants=None, kids=[25756304], score=None, time=1610496805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755964, text='I think we may be passing each other on the word tech workers -- do you mean everyone who works in a tech company, including customer support, sales, marketing, operations etc or are you defining tech workers as just the people who work with tech, ie engineers, analysts etc. and possibly on the accessibility and rarity because pretty much anyone can get hired at a startup and most startups fail.<p>Most people in startups are not lucky (relatively to others in the US economy of similar job positions) they actually generally make less than people in established companies and if they don&#x27;t have a favorable exit are almost always numerically worse off than those who chose the stable path.<p>The reason I see people typically working in startups is more impact, freedom, the ability to quickly level up etc, but unless your company exits and you get paid from that exit no dice.<p>I&#x27;ve had friends who&#x27;s shares were worth less than they paid for them when their company had an exit.<p>I continue to work in startups because I really find satisfaction in it, (right now trying to get my own off the ground) but I would triple my total compensation as an employee in most cases if I went to go work for one of the big players and that compensation is a real tangible thing not anywhere close of a gamble. It&#x27;s actually somewhat of a problem right now in how do founders attract good talent for that reason.<p>I think you simply have an inaccurate picture of the majority of startups and the types of money in them.')
