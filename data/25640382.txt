Estimates show millions, if not over a billion, of these things will make their way into oceans. That&#x27;s massive environmental damage:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;28&#x2F;more-than-1-5b-masks-will-pollute-oceans-this-year-report&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;28&#x2F;more-than-1-5b-masks-will-poll...</a><p>They have a high social cost. They are causing fear and adding stigma. People are judging one another for mask usage out of pure religion reasoning. If they are not very effective, we&#x27;ve watched State mandates around the world cause a new ideological divide between people. pro-Mask people literally have voiced threats of violence against those who do not see their benefit.<p>They hide our facial expressions and our primary way of seeing each other. Long before COVID, medical masks were used at Gitmo as one of the many means of dehumanization and torture:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=masks+gitmo&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;?q=masks+gitmo&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;...</a><p>Human rights groups have long been critical of the full Burqa as a way to dehumanize women. There is a psychological effect of not being able to see people&#x27;s faces, and therefor not seeing them as human.<p>There are people who have PTSD from trauma, rape or sexual abuse who can not wear a mask without panic attacks. I know such people who cannot go into stores or restaurants and must order everything online. There are exceptions in the law, but most stores will not allow of it and the shame of walking around in a store without a mask where 99% of people do also induces panic.<p>Masks have a cost. It is not low. It is not near zero. It is much higher than you think it is.')
