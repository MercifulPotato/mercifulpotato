They&#x27;re being laughed off because of things like press conferences held at &#x27;Four seasons total landscaping&#x27;, attorneys making wild claims in press conferences and the meekly walking them all the way back in actual courtrooms, and bizarre public and private statements - like the President calling state officials in Georgia and spending an hour begging&#x2F;threatening them to find votes for him.<p>Your downvotes aren&#x27;t proving a point. Trump&#x27;s and his supporters&#x27; complaints about the election were given extensive public airing but none of them have been sustainable under closer scrutiny, and many claims about procedure, constitutional law and so forth have ben flat wrong. I don&#x27;t understand how you can claim Trump supporters don&#x27;t feel listened to when there has been a non-stop barrage of accusations from them over the last 2 months. Why don&#x27;t <i>they</i> listen to the opinions that come out of the courts?')
