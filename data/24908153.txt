Good cache control and offline usage are great for battery usage.<p>&gt; <i>Apple refuses to implement it in Safari</i><p>Wrong, Safari supports them. What Apple doesn&#x27;t do well is enabling webapps that you pin to your homescreen (&quot;PWAs&quot;) to work (they allow it, but from what I hear it&#x27;s buggy and has weird restrictions), because they&#x27;d rather force you to make a native app.')
