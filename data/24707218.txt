You could not build a Firewire device with a single die because of the high voltages. This added cost to the USB device (memory stick, etc) meant it would never be price competitive with USB. I was a member of a USB working group and was amazed when a member from a large Japanese company explained that to me. Up to that point, I had not been exposed to the low-end (as in price) of the USB market and didn&#x27;t realize the significance of this issue. These manufactures would bring the 5V straight into their IC and drop the voltage on-chip. That is actually fairly difficult in the age of such small chip geometries, but basically impossible for Firewire which is 8V to 30V. The USB market is driven by the low-end, so Firewire never had a chance because of an engineering specification.')
