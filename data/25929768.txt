I admit I don&#x27;t know how useful it is on a website and I thought a bit about whether to include it - ultimately I left it becuse it felt &quot;magazine-y&quot; and part of the goal was for the site to feel more like a magazine, with issues, and less like a blog that scrolls endlessly. But I admit it is mostly an affectation that may not serve any real purpose.<p>Thanks for reading btw!')
