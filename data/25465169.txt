If someone has a web browser they can read what you say. The only thing that suffers is engagement, which you&#x27;ll have a hard time getting regardless what website you use to publish if you&#x27;re just starting out. But engagement is either meaningful or noise, and meaningful engagement comes from thoughtful words, not the size of the website.<p>So don&#x27;t worry about critical mass. Pick where you want to publish based on what is important to you.<p>I almost exclusively use FOSS, federated networks to publish my thoughts, the only exception being this site. I engage here pretty often because I like the quality of the discussion and the rule of only contributing if you have something constructive to contribute, but ideally this website wouldn&#x27;t be a silo.')
