That&#x27;s just not true, his team haven&#x27;t filed anywhere close that number.of lawsuits.<p>Well he does keep changing who &quot;his team&quot; is. But the all the Guilliani lawsuits have been thrown out, and all the ones he has tweeted about have been.<p>&gt; Second, the evidence wasn&#x27;t yet presented, allegedly because the courts didn&#x27;t gave them the chance to do so yet.<p>Citation needed. The cases I&#x27;ve read (and yes I&#x27;ve checked because of people like who do the fake lazy &quot;oh I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;ve heard..&quot;) say the evidence doesn&#x27;t support the claims.<p>Here&#x27;s a typical judgement against the claims:<p><i>One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens.   That has not happened.  Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.</i><p>Note &quot;unsupported by evidence&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.pamd.127057&#x2F;gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.202.0_1.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3OX5VUvIdZRPgZ79ZD8ZJXrG9cXyE-N_tYCVf5UYBgb7uce67vwB8mohs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.pamd.127057...</a><p>&gt; And could you please look again at that Nahshon Garrett affidavit, exhibit 2? Doesn&#x27;t that mean that &quot;he&quot; in fact did voted in AZ?<p>No, that appears to be a voter registration record. Is there something on it you think indicates he voted?')
