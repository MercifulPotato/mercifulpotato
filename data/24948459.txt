My house, which I bought 12 years ago, my neighbors house, which they have been in for 22 years, my other neighbor, who has been there 45+ years, the neighbor two over who bought about five years ago, and the neighbor two over the other way who bought two weeks ago.<p>If my tax bill is X, the rates are as follows, for nearly identical houses, all valued nearly the same on Zillow&#x2F;Redfin:<p><pre><code>    2.3X\n    0.4X\n    1.0X\n    0.1X\n    2.0X\n</code></pre>\nThe two lowest payers don&#x27;t have kids in school, so an argument could be made for them to have slightly lower taxes, but they still use the police, fire department, parks, and they have access to the senior center, which I do not.<p>The rest of us have kids roughly the same age.<p>So basically the people who just moved in are subsidizing the rest of us significantly.<p>It&#x27;s completely unfair.')
