Heck this company is trying to overhaul the entire monetary system. If succeeded this will effect the lives of billions of people. Recruiting people with this premise, and then telling them actually, you don&#x27;t have any say in what the company actually does, and the ways it changes the world, that actually it was all a joke, and so just shut up and do what the board says because they own all the power and rights is pretty disappointing.<p>I never believed the whole &quot;change the world&quot; SV nonsense, and always knew it was nothing more than cynical marketing. But at least in places like Google the employees who were brought on that premise, fight to achieve it, and make it real.<p>Coinbase is still hypocritical, and I wouldn&#x27;t expect much more.<p>But this whole, &quot;you are only a serf and the whole of power morally belongs to the board&quot; reveals an unsettling feudal mentality.')
