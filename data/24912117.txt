That we will be having people chase feature size numbers that don&#x27;t actually result in a proportional increase in chip density.<p>Transistors per square millimeter is closer to a measure we actually care about (speed of light and clock speed) instead of a bench number that doesn&#x27;t measure anything except perhaps instructions per watt.')
