Over the last few years we’ve switched from old school single css file to css in js, and while that helps with the class spread issues, by lots of other measures it’s inferior. This was solidified for me last week when we rebranded our app and I needed to hack in both new and old code. Editing is js controlled css in the browser is just too painful.<p>Anyway, couple of weeks back I needed to make a website for a mate and decided I’d give tailwind a spin. My god does it make css fun again. I’m not sure how you look after sprawling styles in a bigger app (though I’m sure I’ll figure something out) but having the right combination of safe css, everything right there and responsive styling locally is a dream. I’m totally sold.')
