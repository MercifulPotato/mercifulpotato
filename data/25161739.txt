Some key findings:<p>- Countries are losing over $427 billion in tax each year to international corporate tax abuse and private tax evasion. That’s nearly 34 million nurses’ yearly salaries lost every year, or one nurse’s yearly salary every second.<p>- More tax is lost to tax havens ever year due to corporate tax abuse by multinational corporations then due to private tax evasion by individuals. Multinational corporations short-change countries out of $245 billion in tax every year while people who mover their wealth offshore short-change their governments out $182 billion less in tax every year.\nHigher income countries lose a lot more tax than lower income countries, but the impact of those tax losses are far greater on lower income countries public spending. Higher incomes countries tax losses are equal to 8 per cent of their public health budgets while lower incomes countries tax losses are equal to over half their public health budgets.<p>- Almost all responsibility for global tax losses falls on higher income countries. Higher income countries were responsible for 98 per cent of all the tax loss countries around the world lost, whereas lower income countries were responsible for just 2 per cent.')
