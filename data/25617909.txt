Especially with larger training corpora or vocabularies, the negative-sampling tends perform better - &amp; I don&#x27;t recall notable situations where the HS mode is better.<p>(I recall seeing some hints in early word2vec code of an HS-based vocabulary that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> based on mere word-frequency, but some earlier or perhaps iterated semantic-clustering steps, that I think managed to give similar words shared codes. But I&#x27;ve not seen more on that recently.)')
