This is why the vast majority of IPOing shares RISE in price early on.<p>Partly this is countered by the competition between banks, if Morgan Stanley tell you they can IPO you at 50usd but Jefferies say 55usd, you go with Jefferies.<p>It&#x27;s also good news for anyone who continues to hold equity (CEOs, founders, early&#x2F;angle investors etc). Only the initial equity sold goes at this discount. For this reason many companies will start by offering small amounts of equity and later issuing more at the market price.<p>Of course, its also a very hard question to answer: how much is a share of company X worth? When there is no market to reference. So the discount is also a risk premium both for fraud and for mis-valuation.<p>I actually think IPOs are one of the hardest parts of finance to fully understand and to do and so are one of the most interesting. That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t conflicts of interest and dodgy activity. Just that there are 101 moving parts.')
