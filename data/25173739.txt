The really beautiful thing about ObjectiveFS is that it&#x27;s distributed, but the user doesn&#x27;t really have to be concerned about that. A user can mount the same S3-backed ObjectiveFS filesystem on multiple machines, and they will somehow coordinate their reads and writes to that one S3 bucket, without having to communicate with any central component besides S3 itself and the ObjectiveFS licensing server.')
