I&#x27;m <i>extremely skeptical</i> that either job descriptions or resumes can be scoured for subtle indications of fit between jobs and candidates. If your new job isn&#x27;t quite what you expected or your new employee isn&#x27;t working out quite the way you wanted, it&#x27;s probably not because you didn&#x27;t scour resumes and job descriptions minutely enough.<p>Resumes are a very impoverished indicator of a candidate&#x27;s abilities. So you &quot;have experience&quot; with a technology. Did you make the original decision to use it? Or were you asked to use it? Or was it in place when you got there? Were you only a consumer of its benefits? Do you understand its internals? Have you had to extend it? A technical project may take months or years, but your resume will represent it as a single line of text at best. &quot;Year NNNN -- Company Foo -- Role Bar -- Implemented X using technology Y.&quot; Until resumes are structured like interviews, interviews are essential for getting this level of detail.<p>Job descriptions are a very impoverished indicator of what a job is actually like. &quot;We require N years of experience with X.&quot; Is that because this is your generic job description boilerplate? Or because your entire tech stack is inextricably tied to X? Will the candidate join a team that has inherited a legacy project that uses X? How is that team&#x27;s morale? How is their turnover? If the candidate hates being on that team, how easy will you make it to switch? Are you hiring the candidate specifically with the goal of throwing people at a messy problem? Is it your responsibility to make sure the candidate succeeds? Until job interviews spend as much time revealing the company to the candidate as they spend grilling the candidate, back channel communication is essential for getting a job you like.<p>I can&#x27;t believe that ML and NLP offer new insights in this exchange. If I&#x27;m not willing to tell you something, you won&#x27;t get it from me using NLP either. I&#x27;ve reached a point where recruiters telling me about using &quot;cutting edge AI&quot; results in their email getting deleted immediately. The last such service I responded to (Celential.ai) spammed me for a long time, and every job they sent me was garbage. Garbage to such a degree that it was my first experience with getting on the phone with a hiring manager and one or both of us saying, &quot;No, there&#x27;s really no point in us having this conversation, thanks,&quot; and hanging up.')
