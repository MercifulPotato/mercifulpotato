What does that even mean?<p>Someone smarter than me once wrote “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.”<p>If you can point out that someone in authority is wrong, without fear of death or persecution, then you have freedom and from that germ everything else can be reformed eventually.<p>Dictators know this and it&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t let people laugh at them even when they clearly look stupid.')
