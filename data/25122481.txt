For me, I have drawn that line at Scientific Consensus because it has proved the most robust tool humanity has ever found for determining what is actually true&quot;<p>Well, I agree with the scientific consensus on a general base. But since science was not always right, I don&#x27;t see a valid argument from there to censorship.<p>You want to censor ideas not covered by scientific consensus?<p>&quot;and their answers should sit uncomfortably in all humans&quot;<p>Because, also no. I do not feel uncomfortable. I am strongly against censorship. Open, unrestricted exchange of ideas.
