I think it&#x27;s a mix of exec and management dont fully grasp the job and its implications if you shortcut too much. At the same time, too many data sci are in it for the keyword&#x2F;sexiness of the job and are not of the personality type to take hardline stands. Inexperience leads to a lack of trust from higher ups. A lack of backbone from the experienced results in performing more incompetence. Which results in more lack of trust. Experienced personnel leave, more inexperienced comes in and do things the cheap, shortcut, buy bad data way, plus no backbone to combat against this when seen... and you see how this can spiral into a shitshow that I&#x27;ve been noticing in some consulting projects I&#x27;ve been in.<p>But yes, data collection should be part of their job. I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding why the person who analyzes the data should have a good word at least in what data is collected.')
