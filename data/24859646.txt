Just like the Japanese number system (as distinct from counters for objects) where 1000&#x2F;10000 are special units.<p>Even in English, the counting was not consistent. Isn&#x27;t billion supposed to be 1 million million in the UK ?<p>Lots of the urban population in India is adopting US millions and billions in everyday language too, so I&#x27;m sure the global American monoculture will eventually overwhelm the local counters at some point.')
