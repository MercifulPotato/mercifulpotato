It&#x27;s the same for socal. Socal has about 2-3 weeks in the summer where the temps become sweltering.<p>Even within LA the temperatures vary, the closer you are to the coastline the better the weather.<p>I know because I grew up in the south bay, I lived in SF for 2 years and lived in LA for 10 years.<p>What&#x27;s overall better in socal is that the winters are much more mild. In the south bay the worst you can get is ice in the morning and really cold nights. Socal winters just has a very slightly lower temperature than spring.<p>Not trying to say NorCal has better weather than Socal. I&#x27;m saying NorCal has some of the best weather in the world despite it not having the &quot;perfect&quot; weather that Socal has. The entire CA coast line is afterall still in the mediterranean climate zone.')
