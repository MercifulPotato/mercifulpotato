If not Intel, some other company? It feels a bit weird that many different companies are designing their own bespoke chips. I can see how the biggest companies may have this expertise. But for everyone else, shouldn&#x27;t there be someone they can purchase these Apple-like chips from? Maybe that company already exists?<p>Or maybe there&#x27;s something about full integration that makes a custom-designed chip just so much better than a more general purpose chip?')
