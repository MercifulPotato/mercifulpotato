It&#x27;s basically a suggestion, but say you have a dir with a bunch of cached web assets; it would be useful to drop a .nomedia file in there. So really this seems like a bug in the screenshot tool for being too strict (it isn&#x27;t supposed to prevent writing, only reading). Like the screenshot tool tries to create the dir when it already exists (but can&#x27;t be seen), fails, and gives the wrong error message.')
