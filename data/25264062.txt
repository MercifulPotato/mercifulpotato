Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=[25265383], score=None, time=1606818809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25260148, text='&gt;This to me is one of the really big but less talked-about implications of Apple Silicon<p>Yes. Everyone is too busy hyping. No one is asking questions. ( Hype has die down a bit and we are now starting to see <i>some</i> quality information and discussions going [1]  )<p>It was basically Apple admitting defeat. I mean even Steve Jobs didn&#x27;t write off PC completely[1]. Or Intel is partly to blame because their roadmap were off by 4 years. The MacBook 12&quot; in 2015 was designed with the hypothetical 10nm in mind.<p>People keeps talking about Tablet taking over PC, Phone taking over Tablet etc. It really isn&#x27;t the form factor. It is the default input devices, and how they are <i>optimised</i> for. The PC is <i>strictly</i> optimised for Keyboard and Mouse. And for lots of task, business conducting activities, Keyboard and Mouse remains the best option. Business are not switching to Tablet, or Tablet with Keyboard. In fact they are switching <i>back</i> to Keyboard and mouse for lots of the task they thought Tablet were better. In other sectors, AutoCAD CEO mentioned ( sorry cant find the video , it was about 2-3 years ago asked by Emily Chang on Bloomberg ) in certain fields ( I remember it was construction ) all of the their customers has literally moved to Tablet &#x2F; iPad. So it really isn&#x27;t a once size fits all solution.<p>And the PC market is still growing. A very low single digit number, so 2020 will be an outliner. But it didn&#x27;t slump to 150M or 100M unit a year as many predicted. Something somehow even Horace Dediu refuse to admit.<p>And since the PC market ( WorldWide, so you could argue China and India or other countries are picking things up ) is not shrinking by any definition, there are still innovations to be made. Estimate of 1.5B of PC Worldwide ( You wont find an actual real number, since even Microsoft doesn&#x27;t have clue and keep changing it ), 750M of those are business. Compared to ~110M Mac, there are plenty of space to grow. In 2015 I wrote about Mac should be at least 150M and really should be pushing for 200M by 2020 if they continue with momentum, which they didn&#x27;t. Luckily Apple was only really competing with itself.<p>The new Mac will have lots of user switching or coming back. There seems to be enough margin for an even cheaper MacBook Air at 11&quot; or 12&quot;. Depending whether Apple follows the iPhone playbook where they have 16&quot; and 14&quot; for Pro, then the MacBook Air will be 14&quot; and 12&quot;. That is going to be quite disruptive for a 12&quot; MacBook Air at $799 and for Students $699.<p>Having said all that, whether Apple remains committed to Mac in its ideal as a Personal Computer, or a lock down iPad Appliance remains to be seen. It seems Apple execs are unsure. I could only wish a Mac remains a Mac.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25257932" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25257932</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YfJ3QxJYsw8</a>')
