I think people frequently underestimate how useful it is to do the &quot;boring&quot; parts of engineering (or any discipline). The unfortunate reality is that a lot of learning (that can be applied generally) comes from failure &#x2F; mistakes, and you don&#x27;t really get that if you&#x27;re taught &quot;this is how you can make this particular cool thing&quot;. In other words: I don&#x27;t think you can learn how to do the stuff Rober does on YouTube by Rober telling you how he does the stuff on YouTube. He is capable of that precisely because he studied engineering in school and worked at NASA etc and experienced failures and setbacks which, though not obviously related to making a glitter bomb or w&#x2F;e, taught him lessons and skills that are helpful under the surface. This is generally why I&#x27;m skeptical of anyone that thinks they can distill down their success in a given field into a single book or video series, when invariably their success is a result of 10+ years of experience, practice, and overcoming obstacles.<p>2. Creativity is near impossible to teach, which effectively just makes this a 30 day engineering course, in which case see point (1).<p>Hopefully my skepticism is misplaced though and this is a very worthwhile course for a lot of people!')
