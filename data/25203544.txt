If that was true, then you can freely mix and match cloud services from different vendors.<p>Alas, this relies on many things, not the least of which are peering agreements between cloud vendors that do not punish the consumer for using a service on one cloud with services from another.<p>It is possible to an extent today, but for competitive reasons, cloud companies do not seem to have a built in incentive to collaborate.  Perhaps the cost of switching and lock-in will force cloud providers to work together in the long one, else they risk alienating customers, and then lack the ability to capture a larger market.<p>In other words, competition is good as long as people can realistically take advantage of it.  I think cloud vendors have an obligation to see that this competition is encouraged and supported.')
