And then they added a STRAIGHT LINE tool. No more abusing the right click menu! How far this game has come!<p>&gt; After years of development, after some more collaboration with that Line Rider friend, and after connecting with the owners of Line Rider, it wound up becoming the official version on linerider.com. This version resolved many of the issues I had with the original version<p>I&#x27;m so curious to hear more about this. That&#x27;s like a geek dream come true.')
