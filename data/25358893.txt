Asking as someone who&#x27;s never tried it.<p>For example, most of what I do on my phone is saved to the cloud. That&#x27;s why I can mostly migrate from one device to another without actually directly copying anything over. Contacts, photos (if you pay for e.g. Google One), user contents of virtually all apps, etc. Last time I did it, I actually moved over the call log, SMS history and maybe that&#x27;s it? Can&#x27;t remember.<p>So what benefit is there to using an alternate phone if you sign in to the same accounts? And if you don&#x27;t sign in to the same accounts, then your alternate phone is more than just for travel. You&#x27;re using it (or accounts associated with it) to plan your travel, for example. You&#x27;ve now got to have two parallel &#x27;digital identities&#x27; continuously in use, which gets complicated fast.<p>My strategy for dealing with this is not to worry about it, but to only travel to countries where I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. I&#x27;m not a journalist, a politician or an activist, so the list is quite large. The countries where I could get in trouble, I won&#x27;t travel to anyway (because I don&#x27;t want to be arrested for being a member of a cultural organization they deem &#x27;extremist&#x27;).')
