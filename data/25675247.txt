Which will inevitably delete the thing, once it serves its use. Which is to provide presence in some kind of defensive strategy.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to use as my primary financial institution now. I have an account with my local credit union, but their app is mediocre. Simple&#x27;s high quality app was the main reason I used Simple.
