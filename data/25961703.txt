I think it is more useful to talk about specific elements of capitalist or socialist governance and then map those to the countries that feature those elements. This way we can speak more precisely about things like tax policies, free market competition, safety nets, etc. in isolation rather than wage a broad war of labels and fearmongering.<p>With that in mind, I think in the US what a lot of politicians on the left are advocating for when they preach socialism is not so much socialism, but transferism: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;transferism-not-socialism-is-the-drug-americans-are-hooked-on&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;transferism-not-socialism-is-the-dr...</a><p>&gt; Transferism is a system in which one group of people forces a second group to pay for things that the people believe they, or some third group, should have. Transferism isn’t about controlling the means of production. It is about the forced redistribution of what’s produced.')
