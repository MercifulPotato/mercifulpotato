Recently I got to know, there is a huge discrepancy in the compensation. A lot of co-workers ( including juniors) are getting paid more than I do. I am not getting promoted too. My performance has been very good. I have always got high ratings. But I never discussed compensation related things with my manager. Only those who make noise are getting rewarded.<p>I can say, I am financially independent. Even if I get a promotion, it wont make any significant difference to my net worth. But others (many undeserving ones) making more than me hurts me. How do I handle this situation?')
