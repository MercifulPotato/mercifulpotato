In the office they have incredible standard of food and drinks and the off-sites are awesome.<p>My friends at British companies have to be at their desk at 0830, get 28 days holiday and not an hour more, have to take a sad sandwich to work because nothing is provided, and the off-sites are depressing.<p>If you&#x27;re a supermarket shelf-stacker I&#x27;m sure work-life and benefits are better in the UK than in the US... but we&#x27;re not talking about shelf-stackers we&#x27;re talking about tech companies.')
