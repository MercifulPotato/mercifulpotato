Custom images don&#x27;t necessairly do much for fixing the last 10% either - I&#x27;ll typically want CI-specific:<p>1.  Build matricies.  I was running windows builds on appveyor and linux builds on travis for a long time (faster builds &#x2F; iteration &#x2F; feedback.)  Regression testing against multiple rustc versions can be done from within a script, but doing so via CI-configuration makes for easier to read CI results that flag individual builds as failed instead of an entire script that you have to go log diving into.<p>2.  Custom runners.  Be it custom hardware or licensing-burdened custom software, I frequently need to own the actual CI hardware, and using the native solutions for CI runners is typically easier than merely <i>configuring</i> whatever custom infrastructure I might come up with.<p>3.  Images.  Using prewarmed cloud-ci-specific images is often faster to spin up.')
