The consequence for failing to comply with legal requirements are often sudden and disrupting; Epik really should have planned for this.<p>Continuing to service Epik despite a failure to follow AML laws actually exposes PayPal to risk, which is why they did a hard cutoff and not a phased shutdown. “We thought they were money laundering and kept serving them for a few weeks” is how you get prosecuted too.')
