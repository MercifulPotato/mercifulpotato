And I bet it was more work to configure Emacs to write C++ in the 90s than it was to just use Borland. But which one is still around?<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s more time wasted when you have to change editors every few years because of changes in the funding model of the corporate patron of the product and relearn how to use the entire environment with &quot;sane defaults&quot; versus creating some custom keybindings that you like essentially one time and then using them for 30 years in an editor that has a license and community that makes it unlikely to suddenly cease to exist.<p>People act like there&#x27;s all this extra work to using software like Emacs over corporate IDEs, or GNU+Linux over corporate OSes, but I contend that it is merely different and better-documented work. The corporate environments just make more promises, and then everyone is surprised when the promises are broken.')
