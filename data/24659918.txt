Only merged PRs with the tag hacktoberfest from maintainers should count.<p>It&#x27;s absurd that even closed prs count, and absurd they put the burden on maintainers to actively flag spam and auto-include all repos, many repos simply don&#x27;t want changes of any kind.<p>Yes this means it won&#x27;t apply to lots of repos and less people will be involved. That&#x27;s ok.')
