I&#x27;d argue that some of my political beliefs are as firm and unchangeable as my sexual preferences.<p>But to play along with your logic here, what if someone was a member of a feminist organisation? Do you believe it would be acceptable for a company to refuse to do business with people who are members of feminist organisations?<p>And if your argument is that it&#x27;s possible to pretend not to be a feminist, can the same not also be said for someones sexual orientation?')
