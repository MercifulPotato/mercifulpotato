Understand what they are looking for and make their job easier - and they will be your biggest advocate.<p>It helps to understand what their job is exactly (and their success metrics) depending on where you are in the process.<p>For example, early on you may be dealing with a sourcer whose job is to fill the funnel with qualified leads - while later in the process you may be dealing with someone whose job is to close the deal (get you to accept that offer).<p>Communication is key. Do not hesitate to ask for advice, for guidance every step of the way, and ask how you can make the process easier - and it will become easier for you.')
