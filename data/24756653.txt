While the views here won&#x27;t normally be as insane as an average &quot;hot take&quot; on FB, there were definitely some heated arguments (about higher-level fundamental ideas, not technical matters) that swayed my opinion one way or the other, despite those arguments clearly not really changing the minds of people actually involved in those arguments.<p>Yes, this is just anecdata and not a peer-reviewed study, but I have a belief that this experience is not that uncommon at all.')
