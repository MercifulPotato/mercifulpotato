I use a AppleTV for streaming content.<p>Once in a while I check the manufacturer&#x27;s page, and if there&#x27;s a firmware update, I factory reset my TV to remove any cached info about my usage, and then update the firmware via ethernet, and immediately remove it from the network.<p>A while ago I noticed that my old Insignia TV refused to use  the pi-hole connected to my network, and it was constantly phoning home, that&#x27;s when I decided that I&#x27;m never connecting a TV to the network. Thankfully I&#x27;ve been able to confirm that the Apple TV does not bypass my pi-hole, since it doesn&#x27;t load anything when the pi-hole is down.<p>I know at some point I need to trust some entities with my data. I prefer choosing those entities to the best of my ability, rather than leaving that choice upto my TV manufacturer.')
