It could be also a standard structure tagged with an unknown id, but either way I don&#x27;t really see it as much more than json `{&quot;uid&quot;: &quot;blob-data&quot;}` in practice. If it&#x27;s unknown data, you can do almost nothing with it apart from passing it on. If I recall correctly, x509 doesn&#x27;t even want to deal with any complicated tagging and embeds each extension value as a serialised DER itself.')
