Not that you get large-scale parallelism just with OpenMP.  A recent keynote of Jack Dongarra&#x27;s covers replacing the decades-old use of fork-join for (or course) dense linear algebra:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwomp2020.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;iwomp-2020-K1-Dongarra.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iwomp2020.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;iwomp-2020-K1-D...</a>\nIt&#x27;s significantly in the past, not the future, of large-scale computation of the sort Julia particularly targets.  I don&#x27;t know why Julia should be stuck with that, though.  Parallelism isn&#x27;t new to Lisp-y systems, of course.')
