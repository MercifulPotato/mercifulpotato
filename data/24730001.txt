This is no worse than if you were to have totally-not-evil.example.com give you the bash script on a floppy disk or something. If you suspect they might actually be evil, or just incompetent, that&#x27;s on you either way.<p>But for some years curl didn&#x27;t make any effort to confirm it was getting this file from totally-not-evil.example.com. Connect over SSL, ignore all this security stuff, fetch the file. So then it&#x27;s like you just accepted a floppy disk you got in the mail which says it&#x27;s &quot;from totally-not-evil.example.com&quot; but might really be from anybody. That&#x27;s <i>definitely</i> worse. Today you have to specify the --insecure flag to do this if you want to (Hint: You do not want to)')
