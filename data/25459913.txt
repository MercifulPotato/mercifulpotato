From reading the website briefly and the announcement above, this seems like a &quot;super library&quot;.<p>If there&#x27;s an auth spectrum, from:<p>roll your own -&gt; use a language specific library -&gt; use a full featured solution like Auth0, Firebase or FusionAuth<p>it seems like SuperTokens is in between the library and the full featured solution.<p>I guess I&#x27;d ask, if I don&#x27;t want a full featured solution (the use case you&#x27;ve identified), why wouldn&#x27;t I use a language specific library (devise for rails, passport for js, etc). Or is the value that you&#x27;re providing a modular integration so I don&#x27;t have to integrate authentication + authorization + user management + API auth myself?<p>Anyways, congrats on launching. We need more auth solutions and I&#x27;m glad to see an interesting approach in the open source world. The other major contender, KeyCloak, is, I&#x27;ve heard, a bear to run and extend.<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m an employee of FusionAuth.')
