I&#x27;m less familiar with Haskell, but languages like Scheme&#x2F;OCaml are routinely used to teach programming to beginners.<p>Also there&#x27;s no need to see a dichotomy between &quot;IRL productivity&quot; and &quot;CS&#x2F;FP&quot;. Even if you don&#x27;t use Haskell directly, ideas from FP make their way to mainstream languages, either as constructs, or libraries, or simply programming style.<p>Overall, the more programming paradigms you know, the easier it gets to learn new languages.')
