E.g. high energy physics. The standard model has something like 18 free parameters.<p>A new theory, which could be &quot;more correct&quot; and provide, in the long term, better predictions, might require time and manpower for this fine-tuning and tweaking to occur.<p>However, as it did not provide <i>better</i> accuracy of prediction in its initial stages, is said to be not worth pursuing or even directly pseudoscience or quackery.<p>This used to not be the case because, 100 years ago, relatively simple theories workable by 1-3 solo scientists provided a large enough breakthrough in prediction power to be seriously considered.<p>It may be the case however that nowadays, with the amazing level of precision measurement we are able to achieve, we&#x27;ve optimized ourselves into a corner.<p>We&#x27;ve fitter our quite-a-lot-of-degrees-of-freedom theories into a local maximum <i>so hard</i> that finding a theory that predicts <i>better</i> is, at least, impractical.<p>And through this process we&#x27;ve blinded ourselves from any new and disruptive ideas.<p>Again, look at the standard model. It&#x27;s got so many damn dials to tweak that no wonder it fits reality so well. And if it ever doesn&#x27;t, we can just shove supersymmetry in there.<p>We need to be able to dedicate resources to theories <i>that do not provide better predictions, but that provide new perspectives</i>. A moderate amount of resources. But calling those scientists quacks does no good.')
