We had to wait debhelper 10 for it to not be a hack in packaging (2016).<p>Migration away from python2 is wanted by doko, the Python maintainer. If he didn&#x27;t want that, nothing would move. We were stuck for a long time with Python 2.6 because he didn&#x27;t want to migrate to Python 2.7. As he is also maintainer of gcc and Java, nobody wanted to vote him out.<p>I may have missed the headlines around the new source format. Ack for repeatable builds.<p>What about bikesheds&#x2F;PPA? Many discussions a few years back but mostly blocked because FTP masters want it to be integrated into DAK and under various other non-technical constraints.')
