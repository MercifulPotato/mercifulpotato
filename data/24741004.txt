Doesn&#x27;t the problem usually start when they ask to be treated in a special way, that is, compel others to do things (which tends to collide with the fundamental idea of not-being-forced)?<p>I&#x27;m not sure that cancel culture-people actually had to fight a lot. It seems to me that people who are similar to them in some regard had to fight, but they themselves did not. And those who came before them and had to fight for their rights are usually not among those who seek to cancel others, and will sometimes find themselves on the receiving end of a struggle session, administered by the sons and daughters of their revolution.')
