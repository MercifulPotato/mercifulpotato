Childcare is a job that, while difficult and stressful at times, is not particularly intellectually challenging, nor does it require very much expertise or physical strength. It&#x27;s also relatively parallelizeable (the added effort of taking care of an extra simultaneous child is sublinear).  Those characteristics make it a perfect job for both past-working-age people and older children.<p>We still utilize this dynamic some through grandparents and babysitters, but it&#x27;s not nearly as prevalent as it would have been in an earlier era where multiple generations (and familial leaves) lived in a single household, with a wide range of children.')
