But I would have been very upset if you would call that &quot;spending money on a woman [..] in hopes of sex&quot; or &quot;a polite form of prostitution&quot;, because I&#x27;ll usually share my food if I have visitors, no matter which gender or intention.<p>My opinion is that most of the dating that you see in movies is quite impractical, because all of it prevents an honest and intimate discussion. Plus I don&#x27;t know any couples who met that way.<p>Shopping? Noisy, crowded, too many distractions.<p>Cinema? It&#x27;s either too noisy, or everyone else will hate you for talking.<p>Restaurant? Why make things unnecessarily awkward by having a private discussion in front of 20 strangers?<p>In short, my impression was that the woman sizing up the man if he will be a good provider only happens after the blossoming relationship is already working on a sexual level. And I&#x27;d say that is reasonable and not offensive. If you plan to move in together or want to have kids in the future, you&#x27;ll want to have a teammate that can support you.')
