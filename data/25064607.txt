I can&#x27;t find it on that page.  The energy guide[1] states 87 kWh per year at 5 hours per day so roughly 48W per hour rather than 118W so drop that yearly cost down around $100.  Also I don&#x27;t want to sound like I am shilling for Samsung, but there are various power saving options on the device.  I&#x27;m not sure if those are included in the estimate.  Either way, even in the markets with the most expensive electricity costs, it would take several years if not over a decade for this approach to match the initial price of the e-Ink option.<p>Also both these options are wasteful in the grand scheme of things.  Yes, the LCD option will likely be more wasteful than the e-Ink version, but neither is particularly justifiable if you are concerned about waste.  I would also venture a guess that on the full spectrum of environmental waste those two options are much closer together than either is to just throwing up an old fashioned art print on your wall.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;image-us.samsung.com&#x2F;SamsungUS&#x2F;PVI&#x2F;20200606&#x2F;common-energylabel-qn32ls03tbfxza-energylabel.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;image-us.samsung.com&#x2F;SamsungUS&#x2F;PVI&#x2F;20200606&#x2F;common-e...</a>')
