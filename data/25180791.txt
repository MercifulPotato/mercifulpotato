The quality of the manufacturing and materials is outstanding. Also, the bike company doing research and development to design a frame, prescribe a carbon layup for that frame, service and warranty that frame, and distribute that frame is only going to sell 4-figure and sometimes 5-figure numbers of those frames on complete bikes.<p>My general understanding of the economics on the product side of the bike business (which isn&#x27;t as deep as my understanding of the retail side) is that the manufacturers aren&#x27;t making much money either. They&#x27;ve got lots of hands in their pockets, a lot of pricing pressure thinning margins, and a low barrier of entry for new competition in the marketplace.<p>In regards to Chain Wiggle, I&#x27;m not surprised they are struggling. The graveyard is full of businesses that won on price and their is no business strategy easier to emulate than being the price leader.')
