Obviously, when managing a country of 1.4 billion people, it is a major challenge to get every single directive in a precise and timely manner. Many of these directives need to be carried out by regular citizens and professionals so a lot of interpretation is left to the lower level leaders.<p>By only giving a high level ideology&#x2F;direction, the top leaders give themselves room to manuver when things go sideways and can shift blame onto the lower level leaders&#x27; execution.<p>The system also seem to over penalize under-execution rather than over-execution.<p>Many examples can be found clearly demonstrated in Hong Kong as the integration with mainland China get sped up by the National Security Law. The recent freezing of exiled HK lawmaker Ted Hui&#x27;s bank accounts along with his parents and family members accounts which was making global headlines and causing attention.[1]<p>It seems like the move was part of the high level &quot;exterminate HK pro-democracy figures&quot; but after the headlines, Ted Hui&#x27;s bank accounts were unfrozen for a while which subsequently allowed him to move some of his funds. Shortly afterwards they were re-frozen [2].
