I seen million dollar NYC apartments that where it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have separate room for work and the work &quot;room&quot; is more of wide hallway combined with the kid&#x27;s beds.<p>A more fair options would be to still allow the room option for simplicity but also allow you to deduct things by the square foot so even if your office is just a corner it could count, though that is really mushy and people don&#x27;t like mushy tax laws.')
