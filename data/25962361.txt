If Pony were to move more of its hardest concepts to standard libraries, it would be a far simpler language, even if it maintained the actor&#x2F;behavior concepts.<p>Much of Pony can be done with Arc&#x2F;Mutex&#x2F;&amp;&#x2F;move in Rust, but with special syntax, and it&#x27;s that special syntax that kills the language frankly.<p>You can implement actors in Rust pretty easily. I&#x27;ve done it multiple times, including in a way that provides a pony-like nominal interface. It isn&#x27;t as powerful, and it isn&#x27;t as efficient, because frankly I&#x27;m not very good at this sort of thing and don&#x27;t have time to work on it, but it&#x27;s possible.<p>What pony gives is some syntactic sugar in some important places (the actor keyword, the be keyword) and a very strong runtime.')
