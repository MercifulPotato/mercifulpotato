Baez didn&#x27;t explain how one would go about searching for this proof, he just happened to know that repeatedly using the differential operator on a seemingly random differential equation would create a pattern that resembles the original equation after using substitution repeatedly.<p>In other words, this presentation doesn&#x27;t seem to teach me how to think like a mathematician, it seems more like showing me how mathematicians can find solutions that nobody else could ever find in a million years.<p>I guess that&#x27;s the point when the topic is about Ramanujan, maybe?')
