Item(by='nootropicat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609469469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598107, text='Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t store anything, you can only get real wealth back for it if someone decides to trade. Then they are in the position of holding a worthless token that they have to dump on somebody else, ideally higher - and people only buy if they expect that to happen. Theoretically pumps and dumps could continue indefinitely, but in reality people are going to get bored of it and move to newer and more shiny ponzis.<p>Real wealth has value regardless of what other people think about it and has it by itself. A profitable company is a form of wealth even if nobody wants to buy it - because it generates profits. Same for farmland. Things with direct utility have value in that utility. Utility is ultimately defined by physical needs, which makes it an objective metric of value that can only be estimated better or worse by humans. Value isn&#x27;t subjective - people and societies that are too wrong about valuations for too long wither and die (possibly conquered). The West as a whole is definitely on that path.<p>Gold was a store of value when governments forced people to pay taxes in it - selling what they had for gold - for thousands of years. It&#x27;s not a store of value as that ended. Some people just didn&#x27;t get the memo yet, but new generations are visibly unenthusiastic about gold, so it&#x27;s only cultural inertia.  \nIt has some utility in itself, so it&#x27;s better than bitcoin, but its price based on that demand alone would be much lower.')
