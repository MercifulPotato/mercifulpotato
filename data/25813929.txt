Item(by='stretchcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610911219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813614, text='It being Florida is enough reason to presume guns might be present in the house.  Note that contrary to the expectations of many foreigners, Florida does not have a list of all Floridians who own guns.  In fact it&#x27;s actually illegal for the state to create such a list.<p>The children seem to be irrelevant; if children weren&#x27;t in the house I doubt you&#x27;d suddenly be fine with what the cops did, so the presence of children doesn&#x27;t contribute to your point.  Furthermore some of the narratives about what happened are greatly exaggerating the situation, claiming that cops pointed guns in the faces of children.  I&#x27;ve seen no evidence of this happening, so I think some people are cynically pointing to the children in an attempt to emotionally manipulate others.  I don&#x27;t see any other reason to mention the kids.  They simply aren&#x27;t relevant to the story.')
