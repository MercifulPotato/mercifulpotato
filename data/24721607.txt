A company with vertically integrated silicon, compute, networking, cloud, AI, Enterprise etc. seems like it could have such an edge if only they had focused those engineering capabilities on consolidated, high-margin end products.<p>I see the other big players going the opposite direction.  e.g. Google and Amazon are building their own silicon for an edge in Cloud and AI.<p>So-called SexyIBM is just another cloud company without a distinguishing barrier to entry.  Sure, their growth will look good on paper for a few years, but when Cloud becomes commoditized (which I think is already happening), the capabilities which could have created the kind of real innovation that opens up whole new industries will have all been cleaved away.')
