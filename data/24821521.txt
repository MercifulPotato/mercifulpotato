Such content is rendered automatically, and asynchronously (using emacs-aio), as the cursor moves in and out of the content blocks.<p>So it&#x27;s a replacement for the preview-latex functionality in auctex (but other than that, it is intended to be used with auctex). It&#x27;s intended to be used with plain .tex files, but you can also use it in org-mode.<p>There are several other features aimed at making working on math-heavy documents pleasant and you can also execute Sympy and Mathematica code to produce symbolic results as LaTeX-typeset images.<p>A video demo of Xenops is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GNS-ZFVaFM4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GNS-ZFVaFM4</a>')
