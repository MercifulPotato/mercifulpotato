The first Nissan Leaf came out in 2010, the Tesla Roadster began development in 2004 and launched in 2008. Other modern consumer EVs came out in 2009 or earlier. You could say &quot;new compared to internal combustion engines&quot; but research (and functioning prototypes, even consumer-adjacent builds) on electric cars dates back to the early 1900s of earlier.<p>I think people need to stop cutting car manufacturers slack on this stuff, they&#x27;ve had time to get it right.')
