Item(by='pfranz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605256066, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25078929, text='&gt; What makes it good at media creation?<p>Technically, probably nothing unless you&#x27;re tied to something like Final Cut. I like little things like obj (geometry), abc (geometry), and exr (image&#x2F;textures) files can be previewed in Finder&#x2F;Quickview out of the box. Quicktime is way better than what Windows offers by default (I miss Quicktime 7)--I&#x27;m not sure Windows can open Apple ProRes movies (a fairly common working format) without additional software.<p>ILM, Sony, Pixar, DreamWorks, and Disney aren&#x27;t great examples since they all use Linux. For the few artists that need it, they have a second Windows or Mac box just for Photoshop. Because of their size they use Linux and <i>a lot</i> of in-house proprietary tools. There&#x27;s like 10-30 companies in the world that work like this so it&#x27;s not a great comparison for someone doing motion graphics bumpers for the web or making TV commercials--I would not recommend Linux for them.')
