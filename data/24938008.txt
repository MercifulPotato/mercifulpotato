Had a group of ~5 friends since about 4 years ago, where we subscribe to pretty much every streaming service out there and share the accounts within the group. This way we get every single subscription, while paying for the price of just one each (on average).<p>And streaming services realize that a lot of people use it that way, so they have nice individual profile functionality within a single account, so my shows and my recommendations don&#x27;t get mixed up with those of other people using the account. Not every single streaming service had that feature at the beginning, but by now iirc they all got it.')
