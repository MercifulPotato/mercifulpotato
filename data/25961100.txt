Come off it. The &quot;science establishment&quot; repeats things because there&#x27;s compelling evidence and scientific rigor supporting those things. It&#x27;s not some &quot;Big Science&quot; conspiracy.<p>Particle accelerators have exploratory experiments like hunting the Higgs boson with LHC but they run lots of other experiments as well. There&#x27;s also lots of particle accelerators (of varying capability) around so if you devise an experiment needing one you likely have several options unless you literally need the LHC.<p>With large telescopes there&#x27;s far fewer available and the sky is pretty big. Radio SETI is a long shot search and optical SETI even more so. It&#x27;s not that they lack merit but getting funding for telescope time is a lot harder when the chance of any positive finding is very remote. A lot of SETI funding actually piggybacks on other research using the same telescopes.<p>The chances of SETI finding positive results isn&#x27;t necessarily from a lack of things to find but from physical limitations. Our <i>best</i> radio telescopes could only detect Earth&#x27;s more powerful radio emissions from a few light years away. Broadcasts like TV and radio wouldn&#x27;t be detectable outside the solar system. The inverse square law is a stone cold bitch for interstellar communication. SETI&#x27;s best hope of finding signals are ones intentional ones.<p>Even with billions of dollars SETI would have similar chances of detecting an ETI as without. It&#x27;s a needle in a haystack search with warehouse sized haystacks. More money doesn&#x27;t necessarily get it done much faster or better. There&#x27;s a limited number of sites for large radio telescopes and they have limited fields of view and stars are only in that FOV for a limited time. More money might let you search the warehouse sized haystack a few times faster but it&#x27;s still a vast search space.')
