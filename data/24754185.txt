Water imagery, reincarnation, myth becoming reality which becomes myth, and of course the return of Odysseus to Ithaca. It’s just so masterful and was obviously premeditated to a huge degree. It’s got to be, Joyce mines the same symbolism in Finnegans Wake (even the titles are saturated with it, more so with FW.)')
