Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605527632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095185, text='&gt; Don’t try to take credit for things that the company, as a whole, accomplished.<p>Skeptical about this one. Ostensibly, any result of value is achieved by the &quot;company, as a whole&quot; -- this seems like a tautological statement. Have you considered that committing to (and following through) being part of a long initiative that directly increases revenue for the company as a whole &#x2F;is&#x2F; something worth mentioning on the resumé, and not merely par for the course?<p>It seems pretty pessimistic to reduce that to &quot;awkward attempts to implement generic Internet resume advice.&quot; and I wonder if that has anything to do with what you see as a hiring manager. That is to say -- are you sure you&#x27;re not scaring away candidates who actually &#x2F;do&#x2F; accomplish these things? A technology arm of the organization that has increasing amounts of P&#x2F;L responsibilities is par for the course at many quickly growing startups. As a hiring manager, I would be a huge fan of seeing these lines on resumés provided the follow up conversation I had with the candidate wasn&#x27;t full of BS. If you&#x27;re not, what does that mean?')
