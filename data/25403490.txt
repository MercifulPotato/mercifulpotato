It&#x27;s a sad state seeing the current offerings of pads. Basically the only company manufactured pad is Stepmania X with long wait lists and limited supply or very DIY solutions like the L-Tek pads or used stuff.<p>I want to start playing again but I literally can&#x27;t get any decent pad in Europe, which makes me sad. Almost easier to just buy an older cabinet.')
