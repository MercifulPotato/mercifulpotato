Item(by='ponker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603748396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24899445, text='This is such an egregious violation of trust because end-users don&#x27;t even choose to use Expensify. An exec makes that decision and everyone in the company has to use it, so when Expensify spams an end-user, it&#x27;s like Expensify has violated the trust between the employee and their leadership, the trust that leadership will carefully choose the partners that receive access to user data and contact information. If this email had just gone to the Expensify admins, the people at the company who actually had a relationship with Expensify, it would be vastly different (still annoying as fuck, but not a <i>your company should not exist</i> kind of trust violation).')
