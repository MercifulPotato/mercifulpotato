As someone new to the technology, you definitely don&#x27;t want to sift through ELILO to find out how Linux uses UEFI.<p>If I did this again, which I&#x27;m sure I will, I would not use GNU-EFI. I would use a cross-compiler to build a PE executable for the EFI executable directly, without using GNU-EFI. Still, GNU-EFI is a good place to start. It&#x27;s much easier to work with than EDK2.<p>Forgive my self-promotion here, I feel it could be relevant to interested parties here.')
