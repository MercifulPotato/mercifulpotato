All of them are fascists?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure people in Germany though they were stopping the fascists by supporting the Nazis. You have no idea who the &quot;they&quot; is until it&#x27;s too late.<p>That&#x27;s why the freedom of speech covers everybody. In America, we are not afraid of ideas. My dad survived a civil war, got his degree and immigrated here legally to be a part of that America. It&#x27;s the America I grew up in, and that America is slowly falling from the grips of rationality and embracing real true fascism.<p>You think Trump was fascist? Just wait for the next four years. You are about to see freedoms and civil rights disappear like never before.')
