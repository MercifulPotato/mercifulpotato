They basically say that not forgetting git committing and pushing is too difficult. I don&#x27;t think that it is actually that bad. They also claim that they do not need version control, because they never go back. Well, the thing is that you don&#x27;t need to go back until you do. And when you do and you don&#x27;t have version control, you can start redoing things from the scratch. Overall, they really did no convince me that putting all your code, data, figures etc. on DropBox is really that great of a deal. I think that they should instead hire a guy to create proper git-based processes for them and then train their people to use them.')
