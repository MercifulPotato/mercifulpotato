If people are <i>relatively</i> expensive , as with US retail, you use fancy retail scheduling software and you maybe share a maintenance or a bookkeeper with other businesses so they&#x27;re not sitting around twiddling their thumbs most of the time. Ditto for household helpers. If, on the other hand, relatively unskilled people are cheap relative to your salary or a businesses profits, it&#x27;s easier for you just to keep them around all the time even if it&#x27;s not as efficient.<p>As someone else noted, there may also be value in specialization. Rather than have a full-time all-around handyman, it may make more sense to just call a plumber if that handyman isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> cheap relative to the [plumber anyway.')
