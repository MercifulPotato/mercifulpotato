For me suggestions are broken altogether, but if you randomly get them to work and type &quot;Ecample&quot; it will not suggest anything because there are no words with that prefix. It also doesn&#x27;t look at the previous word to bias which are likely next words (either in general or combined with the characters already typed). It&#x27;s the dumbest keyboard ever, which is very nice on virtual terminals (hence it being a hacker&#x27;s keyboard and my having it installed), but it&#x27;s not useful as a general purpose keyboard.')
