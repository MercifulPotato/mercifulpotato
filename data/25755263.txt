While no person, country or company is perfect... maybe Uganda witnessed this and decided to take a more formal position, like BigTech decided:<p>- Stacey Abrams claimed election fraud and was never censored on social media.<p>- &quot;protesters should not let up,&quot; \n- &quot;This is a movement, I’m telling you, they’re not going to stop, and everyone beware, because they’re not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they’re not going to stop after Election Day,&quot; she said. &quot;And everyone should take note of that, on both levels, that they’re not going to let up, and they should not, and we should not.&quot; \n- Vice-president elect Kamala Harris<p>- &quot;there needs to be unrest in the streets.&quot; - \n-  &quot;You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there’s unrest in our lives.&quot;\n- Rep.
