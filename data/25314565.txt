Individuals do have imagination.  But in this case, no imagination is even required - as you point out there is the previous 9 months of data.<p>What we find is no interest in improving the situation of those in the worst position.  Have you considered the possibility, that it is government that creates these situations in the first place?<p>More broadly, I object to the commonly held idea that government is there to help us at all, despite that being what we are taught in its schools.  It is there to rule us.<p>You can confirm this if you can break down the word &#x27;government&#x27;.  &#x27;Govern&#x27; (has root as kyberenetes) means rule with authority. &#x27;-ment&#x27; means relating to minds, like &#x27;mental&#x27;.  The word literally means &#x27;rule minds&#x27;.')
