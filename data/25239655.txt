Such a measure when in fact collapse society not just at an economic level<p>So again you are claiming this is just &quot;reasonable government measure&quot; to wear masks, but the reality on the ground is far far far far different where governments are ordering businesses to close completely, and imposing other far more draconian measures on public.<p>if we are going to debate government response to COVID it must be about the governments ACTUAL, and ACTIVE response not simply about the non-controversial measures that have become controversial and politically precisely because of the over action and other draconian measures put into place by that very same government<p>Your final argument &quot;when the individual should be allowed to create mortal risk for others&quot; is also a false one and a dangerous one.  The other problem with your argument is that your position that Person A that leaves there home is involuntarily subjecting &quot;everyone else&quot; is possible sickness, yet everyone else has assumed some level of risk on themselves that they may be exposed to sickness, but is COVID or the Flu, or the common cold every time they interact with others.  They also have the option to limit to eliminate their contact with others, just as Person A has that option. If both parties have voluntarily agreed to the interaction, then both parties have consented to that by assessing their own personal risk.<p>For me,  I have stopped in person shopping, stopped attending social and family events, etc.  My risk assessments preclude me from participation in those things, however I have no either right to force other people to live under my personal risk assessment,  thus if others choose a different path and want to take that person risk well that is on them<p>This is all with out getting into the fact that the CDC data says there 99.97% survival rate for all Americans between the ages of 20-49. So the &quot;mortal risk&quot; you have used to ethically justify the government intervention is debatable as well,  as if that is the bar for extreme government intervention then we no longer have any civil liberties at all and must impose complete Authoritarianism upon all')
