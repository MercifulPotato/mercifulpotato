I&#x27;ve been in a similar price range and recently updated my pricing from $10.99 to $23.99 a month.<p>While MRR has jumped, be careful with churn, trial conversion rate, and even chargebacks.<p>Where people love the service and see the value, moving up market means new issues. Also LTV is better but not dramatically as people may let the lower cost subscription ride longer out of laziness or whatever.<p>I like your idea, and could use it.  I could see highlighting use cases and making tiers for those.  &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Marketer&quot;, and &quot;Developer&quot; come to mind.<p>I say dev as I can&#x27;t test my onboarding easily as Stripe doesn&#x27;t honor gmail&#x27;s + extension and testing is a pain without new email accounts.<p>Hope that is useful.<p>GL')
