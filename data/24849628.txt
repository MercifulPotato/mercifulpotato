For example in TV it&#x27;s NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN vs Fox. but last month Fox News hit record numbers, and was the most watched primetime network.<p>&gt; No conservative I know or have heard from feels like Facebook is on their side.<p>So as a conservative, I always thought Facebook was a place to read things from my family &amp; sources that I follow directly. I didn&#x27;t imagine them to have a &#x27;side&#x27;.<p>This view of conservative america as some kind of embattled minority is very strange to me. We <i>own</i> the Senate. We <i>own</i> the presidency. We <i>are the majority</i> of the Supreme court.<p>We are not the underdogs.')
