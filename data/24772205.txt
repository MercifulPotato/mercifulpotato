Amazon and Google have been all over this market for years and there&#x27;s just no big value prop. 99% of the use is just as a smart speaker. I&#x27;d bet very few do home automation. Some are doing a bit of voice commerce if they&#x27;re bought into the Amazon ecosystem. Apple doesn&#x27;t offer much beyond cool product design. If someone was going to bust open this space it would be Spotify.')
