My DAW, my drivers, and my plugins are all written by different developers and they all need to update for me to get fully back to work (In fairness, I made the mistake of upgrading eagerly to macOS 11, which is on me).<p>At the same time, working on a Mac in general has been so, so much more reliable than working on windows. I used to have endless problems with dropouts or latency problems on windows, regardless of the driver, sound card, or buffer size I used. I’m sure things have improved in the time since, but I’ve been so much happier making music on the Mac. I’ve used my 2013 laptop at plenty of live shows and haven’t had any sort of problem yet. We’ll see what happens in the next year, but I’m not ready to count macOS out as an audio workstation OS.')
