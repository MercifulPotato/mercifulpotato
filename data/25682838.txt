A person in that country does not have the tools to get the work that the person in the first world country can. They don&#x27;t even have the tools to maintain that working relationship once set up. The person orchestrating the outsourcing is transferring money from a rich country to a poor country and is essential in doing so. You can say that they should send virtually all of the money they get to that country but it&#x27;s hard to argue that they&#x27;re doing something unjust.')
