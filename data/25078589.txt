For any feature, ask ‘what are 4 critical things this thing must do to be deployable’. Then ask for 3 ‘nice to have but not critical’ things they need.<p>Always, always, deliver the mvp - critical things. Then negotiate your timelines for nice to haves. Keep your communication lines limited unless to clarify something critical, or make clear that part of the feature is not feasible.<p>Follow this process and you’ll start to align quickly with what they want, while building credit towards negotiating auxiliary timelines (nice-to-have’s).<p>It’s a process, don’t be too weirded out by the feedback. Systematically solve it.')
