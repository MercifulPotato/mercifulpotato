Indo-European languages share a lot of structure and roots, similar ways of thinking even if phrasal structure are very different between Germanic and Latin languages, the same for Slavic ones.<p>I choose to do with my own time whatever I prefer, card tricks have been part of it, yoyo tricks in my childhood&#x2F;teens, and so on. I&#x27;m not wasting years learning Swedish because I live in this country and I&#x27;m becoming a citizen, it&#x27;s been a fun endeavour that I started with the mindset that in the worst case it&#x27;d be a party trick.<p>This is my experience, instead of being an ass, try to improve on top of it, you help nobody.<p>Now please, try to behave as is expected by the rules of this forum, I try to come here to have civil conversations and not expecting this place to devolve into some other cesspool subreddit.<p>Cheers.')
