Not a knock against anyone who worked on the project, other than senior management at Apple.<p>Speaking for myself, I didn’t add any Swift to any codebase I worked on until after 3.0 shipped because it was pretty clear that the language just wasn’t quite ready yet.<p>I’m genuinely surprised no one ever thought to just email Chris Lattner or invite him out for a drink to say ‘hey, confidentially between you and me we’re thinking about rewriting our app in your new language. Are there any other apps with this order of magnitude of LOC written in Swift yet?’')
