Your body and your mind are _made_ to desire and act, there is no sense in denying this and Buddha sure as hell did not.<p>What you&#x27;re looking for is lack of <i>attachment</i>. Desire is no problem, it&#x27;s the attachment to it (and it&#x27;s the same with everything). The belief in an <i>I</i> that is doing the desiring, that is what is causing trouble, not desire itself. It is nature doing its thing, there is no problem there.')
