When you replace money with time&#x2F;effort you still have to do the math to see if it&#x27;s worth it to you. I think most of the time that math checks out, but there certainly have been times when it wasn&#x27;t and I didn&#x27;t bother.<p>There are places where I usually do follow your philosophy of &#x27;just walk away&#x27; for example: websites that don&#x27;t display basic content without javascript or need you to disable ad-blockers. 9.8 times out of 10, I&#x27;ll just click away because I really just don&#x27;t care that much. Everyone has their own tolerances for putting up with broken things.  Mine my just be higher than most in some areas but they are defiantly lower in others.')
