I mean, sure, at machine code level, you&#x27;re ultimately doing sequences and conditional jumps one way or another, and most imperative languages do still provide general sequence, selection and iteration structures. But in the mainstream languages, numerous other control structures from exceptions to pattern matching on algebraic data types are in fairly widespread use, and tools like concurrency, asynchronicity and using higher order functions are also widely relevant.')
