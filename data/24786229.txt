Before it became a popular term, it was intended as a <i>criticism</i> of arguments of the form, &quot;A will lead to B will lead to C, so A is bad.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not bringing this up (just) to be pedantic; the overwhelming evidence to date is that it is <i>extraordinarily</i> difficult to get any of these modern media giants to make any kind of move on any subject at all. You can say very nearly anything you want on YouTube&#x27;s network, or Twitter&#x27;s, or Facebook&#x27;s, and in all cases, the most common forms of censorship are from the DMCA, not politics.')
