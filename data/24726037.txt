Executive Order 12333 grants authority to the FBI (among others, with few exceptions), specifically as it relates to foreign intelligence and counterintelligence (EO 12333 1.7(g)(1)).<p>I&#x27;m not even sure where they are getting the &quot;unconsented physical searches&quot; and &quot;physical surveillance&quot; line from. EO 12333 specifically states, &quot;Elements of the\nIntelligence Community are not authorized to use such techniques as electronic surveillance, unconsented physical\nsearches, mail surveillance, physical surveillance, or monitoring devices unless they are in accordance with\nprocedures established by the head of the Intelligence Community element concerned or the head of a department\ncontaining such element and approved by the Attorney General, after consultation with the Director.&quot; It then goes on to infer the FBI is the only one who can conduct unconsented physical searches and physical surveillance on United States persons, except in specific circumstances.<p>In other words...EO 12333 specifically authorizes activities for the FBI as they relate to foreign intelligence and counterintelligence activities; the FBI may use unconsented physical searches and physical surveillance to support their investigations into the previously mentioned activities; and they are the only ones able to do so except in specific circumstances. Lastly, the protests in Portland would not be considered as part of literally any of the FBI&#x27;s authorities in EO 12333, it would be from their authorities related to conduct of criminal investigations, which would require a warrant or consent to a search.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of all this necessarily, but the fact checking in this article is mind-blowing.')
