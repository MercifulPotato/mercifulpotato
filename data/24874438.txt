The RIAA has used this same complaint to have other sites&#x2F;tools taken down. I&#x27;ve looked into the implementation, and it turns out the Youtube is at most merely rearranging the characters of the CDN url of the video, and they send you JS code in the page to correctly arrange the characters of the URL so you can download it. Youtube-dl is using the Google-supplied JS and a JS interpreter to transform the Google supplied URL into the URL they need to download the videos. Youtube is asking Google what to do, and Google is saying &quot;here&#x27;s how you download the video&quot;.<p>I explained the full RIAA complaint, with links to prior complaints and the youtube-dl source code, here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24874111" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24874111</a>')
