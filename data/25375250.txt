Expenses were around ~$5&#x2F;mo. so just kept it on maintenance mode.<p>I decided to sell primarily because there were lots of enterprise companies&#x27; interests with people reaching out for bulk pricing and stuff, but I&#x27;ve really lost motivation on this project at that point so put it up for sale if anyone&#x27;s interested to take it in that direction.')
