There is no rhyme and reason on HN or anywhere else for that matter. Sometimes I think people just downvote to avoid facing the reality.<p>I understand it is not politically correct to say most cars are not the problem (or at least not the most of it).<p>In ideal world we would not be driving petrol guzzlers but instead have cars that run on electricity from our own home solar panels.<p>But the reality is that a well maintained car emits thousands times less harmful stuff than cars from couple decades ago. The new norms that automakers are facing are really crazy restrictive and sometimes hit the very limits of physics and thermodynamics.<p>The problem is when people get around these rules, drive unmaintained cars, drive cars that are way larger and more powerful than is needed or cheat by removing converters and installing them only for inspection.<p>Especially the last one. Here in Poland this is practically the norm and people treat this as part of life and feel proud they &quot;saved&quot;. Then they complain we have bad air.')
