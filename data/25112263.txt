I&#x27;m well aware some of the comments I leave on the net about certain products (be it applications, os, hardware, tools, literally <i>anything</i>) might come over as smugness (though I do my best to just state facts without putting an extra undertone in it) but at least I realize that; it&#x27;s just a natural reaction when you see something you like getting bashed - especially if that bashing is not entirely just or even completely wrong. But it&#x27;s baffling to see people not realizing they&#x27;re being dragged down by cognitive error and it makes them blind. We&#x27;re humans, we can be thaught to self-inspect, it&#x27;s unfortunate this doesn&#x27;t get done in education enough.')
