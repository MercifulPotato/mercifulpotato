My only complaint about the design is that if there is an air-gap between the apartment building(s) and the parking garage, the garage tends to accumulate a ton of dust&#x2F;atmospheric fallout due to the surrounding building restricting wind currents. The garage floors are almost always disgusting, and cars parked inside become filthy much quicker than if they were simply parked outdoors.')
