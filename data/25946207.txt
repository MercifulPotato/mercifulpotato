An extra if-statement, etc. Please don&#x27;t add features or redesign anything or &quot;fix my code&quot; at a cosmetic or architecture level.</i><p>Another way of putting it might be to encourage them to describe the problem or other desired change rather than send code, and let you deal with it as you see fit.<p>For instance: instead of raising a PR to fix an open injection vector, raise an issue that says &quot;when responding to X your code doesn&#x27;t properly sanitise input Y meaning Z can happen&quot;.<p><i>&gt; I know this sounds kinda whiny and entitled and anti-free-software</i><p>Not at all IMO. The word &quot;free&quot; covers many overlapping concepts, and your way of thinking about the freeness of your personal project is no less right than many others. You aren&#x27;t stopping anyone doing what they want, you are just choosing to be selective about how you interact (which you are, or should be, free to do). Giving other people freedom to do things with your code does not mean you have to give up the freedom to do (or not do) what you want with it.<p>A long as you are up front and polite about it, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. If anyone did have a problem with it, it is their problem not yours!<p>If I ever pull my finger out and make progress on my many possible personal projects to the point where there is something worth sharing, for the most part I&#x27;ll probably take a very similar stance.')
