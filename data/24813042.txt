If you are a prescriptive linguist from Newcastle you will presumably expect everyone to use a short a in &#x27;castle&#x27; but someone from the south would use a long a.<p>It occurs to me that in an alternate universe, the answer could be &quot;both spellings are correct&quot;, because logically speaking, if both <i>pronunciations</i> are correct, shouldn&#x27;t the same apply to the written version?<p>Come to think of it, the idea that a word with many correct pronunciations has only one correct spelling is actually <i>totally weird!</i> Why should writing be more prescriptive than speech?')
