Useful life of a internet media device is generally significantly less than that, but also relatively cheap to replace&#x2F;upgrade every couple years. (Aside: my 5 year old Nvidia Shield still gets updates and works perfectly, but that&#x27;s an exception compared to all the other media devices I&#x27;ve owned).<p>The one smart tv I own is crazy annoying. I used Plex, Netflix and YouTube on it, and about once a week either the core software or one of them would get updated, constantly nagging me with &quot;update available, install now?&quot; prompt, and then blocking usage for several minutes when I finally relented and said yes. That TV now has a Chromecast and all built in network connections disabled.<p>I won&#x27;t even get into the adware&#x2F;malware nonsense others have already talked about.')
