I think Signal does this right, 1. by supporting all major platforms, 2. by showing standard SMS as &quot;dull grey&quot; and allowing you to choose your own color for a contact (otherwise having a random color) when the conversation is Signal enhanced. On that note, I have hopes that Signal can become The One True Messenger after they iron out a few more quirks.')
