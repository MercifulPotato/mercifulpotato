Designing a superscalar application processor requires an enormous amount of work by engineers who are experts in their field, and that work needs to be compensated somehow.<p>The ISA may be open, but there is no requirement for the microarchitecture implementing the ISA to be, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine anyone doing the work to produce a performance-competitive chip and then giving it away. Even if there is a &quot;consortium&quot; model where multiple companies benefit from a single design, they would likely set up some sort of licensing arrangement to prevent free-riding by companies that did not contribute to the design.')
