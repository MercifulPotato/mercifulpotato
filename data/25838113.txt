It&#x27;s not a subjective issue, it s a statement of fact that these licenses are not open source. There was a recent attempt to change this within the OSI, which badly failed.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t think consensus is possible and even a 2&#x2F;3 supermajority on a license change seems out of reach. I can imagine some are pushing for permissive licenses like MIT&#x2F;BSD, others for GPL&#x2F;AGPL, others to remain as Apache 2.0, etc.<p>Correct. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they can choose to change the license anyway. That means that changing the license is not right in the first place.')
