However I think the UI is not really ready yet. I would love some transitions on the popup elements, as well as a keyboard control over the forms :)<p>Since I couldn&#x27;t find any tool that did the job for me, I ended up creating a very simple (open source) timetracking tool that suited my needs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;corentinbettiol&#x2F;634b6f95928ccb702ac790f16a584caf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;corentinbettiol&#x2F;634b6f95928ccb702ac7...</a><p>(pros: not in a browser, start when you start your work computer, can sort content with grep, can count hours of work on a task with grep + wc -l, cons: no fancy ui, fixed delay)')
