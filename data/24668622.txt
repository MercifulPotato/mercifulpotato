Yes, of medieval french literature.  Good, what do you think of my blood pressure medication?&quot;.  Or people looking to their local TV meteorologist for climate-change-isn&#x27;t-real expertise.  Or &quot;he&#x27;s a Scientist!&quot;.<p>The press gets excited when say first-tier business school students don&#x27;t know what causes Earth&#x27;s seasons.  But if the last time they touched a topic was middle school, it shouldn&#x27;t shock to find a middle-school-ish understanding.  Asking a protein chemist a quantum chemistry question is perhaps like asking a years-ago &quot;I hate studying for quals&quot; graduate student.  If something isn&#x27;t a focus, there&#x27;s little selection pressure to prune misconceptions.<p>But perhaps one expects a 5-year old asking &quot;What color is that Sun ball thing?&quot; of first-tier astronomy graduate students to go well?  Doesn&#x27;t.  And many of the few who get it right, learned it discussing common misconceptions in astronomy education, rather than from their own.<p>As you move away from people&#x27;s active focus, understanding can become ramshackle startlingly fast.')
