Item(by='rbecker', descendants=None, kids=[24681941], score=None, time=1601841298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24681644, text='&gt; Your first “scenario” completely ignored what happens after a resold device’s life ends.<p>Why would anything different happen to a &quot;resold&quot; than a &quot;sold&quot; device? Is there any market that Apple doesn&#x27;t sell to because their consumers don&#x27;t recycle enough? No, there is not, and I am beyond tired of dealing with the pretzel-like contortions of reasoning you twist yourself into to believe continued use of a device is somehow more harmful than stripping it for parts, for the sole reason that money changed hands without Apple getting their cut.<p>And whether Apple <i>on the whole</i> is better for the environment than other companies is a different question than whether <i>this practice</i> is bad. But with introducing wasteful technologies like AirPods, soldering SSDs and RAM to motherboards, and fight against right to repair, I&#x27;ll take their environmentalism with a massive grain of salt.')
