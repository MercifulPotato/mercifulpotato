If you provide a bug report in good faith, and don&#x27;t act entitled or snotty, you&#x27;ve done your part, and have behaved within the terms of the implied social contract.  If the maintainer chooses to react in an unwarranted manner, that&#x27;s on them, and I think that sort of bad behavior <i>should</i> be exposed for others to see.<p>Personally, as a maintainer, I find that unnecessary fluffy language makes it harder to get to the meat of the problem, and it annoys me.  If you&#x27;re risking a bad reaction either way, why not choose the way that&#x27;s objectively the most helpful?')
