The byte offset in such pointers were stuffed in to the upper unused three bits. This meant that address arithmetic had better be done with pointers, and not casted to integers.<p>Also I&#x27;m pretty sure ints were 64-bits.. it&#x27;s possible that shorts were also 64-bits, but I don&#x27;t remember.')
