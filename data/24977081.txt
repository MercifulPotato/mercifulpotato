With its excess cash reserves, if Apple paid tax, absolutely nothing about its business would change.<p>The more profound perspective is, who is really the tax collector then? Who is playing that economic role? Obviously these giant tax-evading companies. They are accumulating huge stockpiles of cash they cannot spend, a long-running surplus, they can&#x27;t even effectively give it back to shareholders, and it&#x27;s not because of tax policy. It&#x27;s because they <i>are</i> the tax.<p>That&#x27;s not controversial, some people call it simply rent seeking, but Summers should be going a few steps further: can we characterize the exact amount of non-tax compulsory payments (NTCPs) we are giving to Apple? Is there a policy process to convert the beneficiary of NTCPs from private ownership to the public, i.e. make it just a plain old tax?')
