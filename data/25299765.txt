I had gigabit fiber and while it worked pretty well for the most part, I still got quite a few gamebreaking lag spikes and fps slowdowns. It stuttered like a youtube video: freezing, then resuming in 144p quality which made the in game text completely unreadable on my screen. And that&#x27;s on a beefy internet connection, imagine the situation for the median American or someone reliant on a mobile data plan. People can scarcely tolerate playing a game with high ping as it is.')
