If you have a Type-C port, use the dongle. If you have HDMI, use the direct HDMI cable.<p>This $30 dongle is cheaper than upgrading all the projectors to support Type-C, and still allows older PCs to use HDMI.<p>Not really sure what&#x27;s unreliable about USB-C to HDMI dongles... sure if you buy a crappy one they have issues, but good ones aren&#x27;t expensive these days (at least, for projector resolution. YMMV if you&#x27;re trying to do 4k or something)')
