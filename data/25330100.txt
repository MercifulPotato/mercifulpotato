His intentions were to give very basic interactivity to the plain documents that was the web. And for that purpose javascript is fine. For anything beyond that, it&#x27;s simply retarded. I&#x27;ve worked in large corporations for most of my life and in all instances stunts like javascript-only development or react were the consequence of either someone from management being a javascript &quot;developer&quot; or management blindly trusting their &quot;top engineers&quot;. Just open up history books and look at how many times humanity has been wrong. Hell, just turn on the news and look at the political landscape - the people who were democratically elected, and you&#x27;ll instantly see what I&#x27;m on about. My argument remains equally valid for the people developing those frameworks. The fact that their barebone examples eat up 200 megabytes of memory and basic navigation pumps up my cpu to at least 40% is a clear indication. And my personal computer is not a raspberry pi gen 1. Far, far from it. Look around HN and you&#x27;ll see a growing support for my message: javascript is crap and needs to be abolished.<p>As for javascript being &quot;blazingly fast&quot;: lol. Compared to what? calculating 924^42 with pen and paper? Yeah, in that respect it&#x27;s fast. For anything beyond that it remains a paper plane. Wasm initially terrified me because it potentially opened the floodgates for all the &quot;developers&quot; to jump into what are real programming languages and make a mess out of them too. For the time being it&#x27;s fine though: Jumping from<p>this.prop.element.parent.third_degree_cousin.grandParent.neighbors_dog.value.get_value().toInteger() = this.prop.element.parent.third_degree_cousin.grandParent.neighbors_dog.value.get_value().toInteger() + 1;<p>to<p>type ConnectionError = Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync + &#x27;static&gt;;<p>is not humanly possible... For now...')
