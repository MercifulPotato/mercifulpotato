That&#x27;s not how it works.  The vaccine makers themselves have no interest in distributing unproven vaccines.  I myself was highly confident (and posted such on HN) that we would have a successful coronavirus vaccine, based on the scientific information available early in the pandemic.  But it wasn&#x27;t a surety.  You must have a randomized trial or you risk very very bad outcomes.  Some experimental vaccines (e.g., dengue) actually make the viral infection worse.  Some don&#x27;t work at all (e.g., Sanofi&#x27;s covid vaccine).  Heck Sanofi&#x27;s vaccine is likely the easiest to manufacture and distribute.  If we followed your &quot;plan&quot;, it would likely be that most got the ineffective Sanofi vaccine and we would be moving dead bodies around with bull dozers as &quot;vaccinated&quot; people failed to practice social distancing.')
