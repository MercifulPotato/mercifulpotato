On the other hand, they do need to eat, use toilet, peacekeeping from time to time, etc., so, it&#x27;s a whole day duty. Luckily for me, I work for myself (a startup), so I can work anytime I want. For wife it&#x27;s a bit different, she&#x27;s 9-5 in normal circumstances, but with kids, it extends to the whole day.<p>It&#x27;s not easy, but I love them.<p>Btw, my kids are 5 and 7 - to those of you with &lt;4 years old kids, don&#x27;t lose hope. As they grow and get more independent it gets easier. You&#x27;ll have more time to get back to your side projects.<p>Look at this situation from the bright side - you are there for them now, when they need you the most, when their personalities are formed. Enjoy every moment, it will pass quicker than you think. Before you know it they&#x27;ll be kicking you out of their room. And you&#x27;ll be sad about it. ;)')
