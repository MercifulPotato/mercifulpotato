We didn&#x27;t understand electricity and magnetism for a long time but we were creating all kinds of devices and materials via trial and error. The arrow of discovery has a strong record with experiment first, theory later. Metallurgy was pretty much figured out by trying shit out first, later came the formalization and explanations for why strain hardening is a thing, or doping and microstructure for example.<p>For the humanities, yeah I have no idea. I didn&#x27;t specify but I meant the science and engineering parts of academia. I think math doesn&#x27;t have a reproducibility crisis since it should be all logical proofs that don&#x27;t require infrastructure, so I guess math is fine as it is.')
