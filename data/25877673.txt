But still, I’m seeing a lot of ability to mimic waveforms being passed off as “custom hardware protocols”. It’s a cool peripheral, but IDK about any type of “game changer”.<p>If we look at Cypress’s PSOC, that’s real FPGA fabric on their micros and it’s barely capable of making some hardware protocols. I’m pretty sure there isn’t enough there for CAN going back to that example.')
