I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more every month in a meeting to vote on stuff I usually don&#x27;t care about.<p>- Unions cost money, and while 200$&#x2F;2 weeks (which is what one big union in my country charges) might seem reasonable to you, I don&#x27;t like being forced to do anything.<p>- Unions usually end up with rules regarding who gets promoted and who doesn&#x27;t. Broke your back working OT to help out the company? Well tough luck Martha came in one month before you and has priority on promotions.<p>- Unions make it harder to fire under performing employees. While that might fit in your ideal society, I prefer working with overachievers.')
