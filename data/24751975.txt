Very fun experience, not seeing the sun for a week straight.<p>The downside of Svalbard though is that it&#x27;s very difficult to randomly explore on your own. There aren&#x27;t any roads outside the settlements, and you need a rifle and a snowmobile and government registration to go anywhere outside it. Snowmobiles can be bought but are almost impossible to rent; rifles can be rented but if you don&#x27;t have skills you can&#x27;t expect to suddenly have them when faced with a polar bear in a life-threatening situation. There is zero infrastructure outside the settlements so it&#x27;s not a joke.<p>So ultimately I was mostly confined to the town of Longyearbyen and vinicity but it was fun anyway. I managed to get to Bjorndalen and a couple of other nearby places via some locals who I found on Facebook, but that&#x27;s about as far as I was able to get.<p>Don&#x27;t expect the same level of exploration freedom you could get by, say, renting a car in Canada or whatever.<p>The thing I found most fascinating about Longyearbyen, ironically, is how <i>normal</i> life was there at a town so close to the north pole. People had gigabit internet access, a couple of bars, and a supermarket. Nothing was out of the ordinary, really, except for the lack of the sun.')
