The tree of life is a lie.<p>...or at least a very simplified model that breaks down as you move towards simpler and simpler forms of life. That&#x27;s because horizontal gene transfer is a thing, and when you go all the way back to prokaryotes, there&#x27;s so much of it going on that any &quot;tree of life&quot; is a statistical picture that&#x27;s valid only for a select genetic marker that&#x27;s used to trace dependencies. Pick a different marker, you&#x27;ll get an entirely different prokaryotic tree of life.<p>Life ultimately forms a graph')
