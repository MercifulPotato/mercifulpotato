They got stuck in the sand, had no water, no food and no means to get out. The were on their way to Las Vegas and wanted to see the tubes. they just followed Google maps.<p>Another time in I encountered another tourist in the middle of nowhere in Nevada, totally lost. Again, blindely followed Google Maps.<p>In Death Valley I crossed  tourists in a rented SUV who wanted to cross over the Lippincott Pass to get to the Racetrack Playa, again following Google Maps. I talked them into turning around, there was no way they were going to make it. Also, they were not prepared at all (no water, food, etc.)<p>In Ecuador, Google Maps lead me down a mountain road which turned into a mountain bike track. I made it out in one piece, it made for a good story[2] but it is pretty damn dangerous.<p>If you are in a remote area, always double check google maps suggested, eg. with an OSM based map.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;mojave-lava-tube" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;mojave-lava-tube</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bueti-online.ch&#x2F;talks&#x2F;overlanding-and-sre&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bueti-online.ch&#x2F;talks&#x2F;overlanding-and-sre&#x2F;</a>')
