It&#x27;s been very helpful to me in seeing the world more the way it is rather than in the negative light you&#x27;d get from watching sensational media only.<p>I actually made a preview of iirc ~10 pages that I found to be very powerful near the beginning of the book, but I don&#x27;t just want to post it to avoid copyright issues. Shoot me an email at factfulness202012@lgms.nl (just link this comment in the subject or so, no body needed) if you are interested.')
