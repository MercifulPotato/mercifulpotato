In the past Iâ€™ve been contacted a few times randomly by journalists who - by the tone of the conversation - are trying to get me to tell them something confidential that they can form a story around. I am not a lawyer but leaking confidential information or breaking an agreement with your employer can be a criminal act you can be taken to court for, and I would think someone (like the press) aiding in the dissemination of confidential information is also engaging in a criminal act. Why should the press get special protection above any other citizen in this regard?')
