Mounting the docker socket into the container.  Podman is <i>daemonless</i> which means that won&#x27;t work.  There is work going on right now to allow Podman to be driven in a similar way if needed, but I recently tried to set it up and hit a bug[1].  CRI-O brings a daemon, and it is used extensively in Kubernetes and OpenShift, but not so much outside of that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8323" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman&#x2F;issues&#x2F;8323</a>')
