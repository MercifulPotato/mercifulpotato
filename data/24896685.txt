The did the same for Antifa though, so at least they are somewhat consistent.<p>This particular article seems less about Proud Boys and more about Epik using an &quot;alternative currency&quot; called &quot;Masterbucks&quot;...<p>&gt; The right wing has long accused tech companies of anti-conservative bias. Experts say the claims are unfounded.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting situation. Facebook particularly I would say has an <i>overwhelming</i> conservative bias. At least, I saw an article the other day on how the top X trending posts on Facebook are always dominated by pro-conservative pieces. However, I&#x27;ve also seen a ton of anti-conservative partisan fact-checking on Facebook (i.e. it&#x27;s obvious the factchecker was doing everything possible to label an unfavorable article as &quot;false&quot; or &quot;partly false&quot; on a small technicality). So in my opinion, the situation is that (in the case of Facebook), the userbase and content is right-leaning, while the fact-checkers&#x2F;employees are left leaning and are trying to combat their own userbase.')
