The cost should come down over time as patents expire, research costs are recouped, etc. etc.<p>The biggest advantage that this vaccine seems to bring to the table is logistics. The mRNA vaccines produced so far require extremely cold storage temperatures which makes logistics harder and slows down actual administration as each shot has to be heated up, administered, wait for allergic reactions, and then re-frozen again.')
