You don&#x27;t wanna round it when squatting or deadlifting (but the Barbell Medicine folks will tell you it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> big of deal, most of the time). If you&#x27;re just moving your body on its own, you should absolutely do things that involve rounding your back, like touching your toes. If your back wasn&#x27;t meant to move that way, it probably wouldn&#x27;t move that way... or at the very least your body would immediately give you warning signs to make you stop doing that (like when you try to bend a joint the wrong way).')
