In America, the state <i>is</i> public behavior. The government is at best a time-average of the will of the people. When you ask for the government to flex its muscle, you are asking for the people to exercise self-control, and if they were doing that, the government would not be necessary. At most, a large majority can police the behavior of a small minority - but to be honest, given the history of when that has happened, we might be better off if even that was not possible.')
