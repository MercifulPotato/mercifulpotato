Item(by='kevsim', descendants=None, kids=[25110195], score=None, time=1605520577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109828, text='We adopted GraphQL from the get-go with our startup [0] and I won&#x27;t say that we&#x27;re worse off per se, but I will say that I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a huge benefit for our core application from it.<p>We ended up going offline-first (or rather we&#x27;re working on being offline-first) so the application roughly looks like: download all the data, store it locally, operate on it locally, sync changes back and forth. For that, GraphQL is not buying us a whole lot. In a few places it even gets in our way (for example, there are currently not union types for inputs so we end up having a more verbose than necessary schema). We&#x27;ve also battled the famous N+1 problems and have had some performance problems with the client side cache performance (we use Apollo). There are a few niceties when it comes to automatically checking the validity of requests and some code generation we&#x27;ve been able to do with Typescript that&#x27;s pretty nice.<p>Most importantly, I still like it for our 3rd party API - we&#x27;re an issue tracker&#x2F;product management tool and GraphQL fits quite nicely for exploring our data and for third parties to just fetch what they need.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a>')
