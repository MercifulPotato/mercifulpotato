The CARES act appropriated $130B for health care providers, including hospitals. The followup appropriations bill allocates $69B for vaccines, testing, health care providers, and mental health.<p>One might argue that that&#x27;s not enough money, but at least make the argument that they should have spent more rather than falsely claiming they spent nothing. Congress&#x27; direct payments to the healthcare providers in these two bills totaled $199B. Broken down by department, only two agencies are allocated more than $199B next year, the DOD ($695B) and the VA ($243B). And that&#x27;s <i>just</i> looking at direct payments to medical providers, I didn&#x27;t even mention the remaining $2.1T from the CARES act.')
