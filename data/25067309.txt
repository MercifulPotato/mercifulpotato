It was a lot of fun digging into the OS like that, especially at a young age, but definitely slow considering itâ€™s emulating another instruction set.<p>Not long after I got a relatively successful hackintosh going (read: accelerated graphics and working audio), which, besides Linux, helped brew my respect for Unix, BSD, and unique macOS internals.<p>Altogether it lead me to purchase roughly 5 Macs over the years. I recently got back into it for fun, and the scene is thriving. Will be interesting to see what happens post-AS.<p>Doing things for the heck of it is, for some reason, a great motivator and educator.')
