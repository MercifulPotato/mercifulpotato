Item(by='0xffff2', descendants=None, kids=[24836152], score=None, time=1603143102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24829953, text='You can still get that kind of furniture if you want it. It just costs a couple of orders of magnitude more than even &quot;expensive&quot; Ikea furniture.<p>It seems very plausible to me that there was plenty of crappy (probably homemade) furniture that wasn&#x27;t any better than Ikea historically. Heirloom quality furniture takes real skill, time and materials to make. I can&#x27;t imagine that the average pre-Ikea family would have been able to afford for all of their furniture to be of that quality. Not being any kind of historian, I have no idea how they filled that gap.')
