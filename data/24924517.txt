But everywhere else, Command-Tab is intercepted by the window manager and tabs through the local applications.<p>Same for other hotkeys that are usually universal, like the one that takes screenshots and screen recordings (which are both done really nicely in MacOS by the way), or the one that lets you search for anything.')
