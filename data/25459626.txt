Also, it often claims to be developed in a more collaborative way, &quot;all bugs are shallow when there are many eyeballs&quot;, etc. If you want a specific name, someone who used to vocally make this kind of claims was Open Source&#x27;s advocate Eric Raymond.<p>- There is then the onus of <i>proving</i> this assertion. Is it true that Open Source is, <i>as a norm</i>, technically better than proprietary software as some of its more vocal advocates claim? Is it true that its development is more collaborative?<p>- The article states that no, as any user can plainly see, Open Source is not always <i>technically</i> better than proprietary software. Open Source is often more difficult to use, or unpolished, or has a worse UI, and critically, many open source projects are maintained by a single person, so it&#x27;s not really always developed more collaboratively.<p>- The article states that this is not a problem for Free Software, because Free Software doesn&#x27;t claim to be always technically better than proprietary software. It&#x27;s not even its goal. Free Software claims to protect user&#x27;s <i>freedoms</i>, even at the cost of being less polished or lacking some features.')
