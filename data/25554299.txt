Who knows if it’s actually using the fine grain control I paid a lot of money for?<p>My first thermostat also died in the first year when the power went out.  What happens in 10 years when it’s no longer made?  I have to dump the whole system and start again?<p>Also whole features are poorly implemented - Quiet Mode limits speed at night, but not until after startup (or, I think when defrosting)<p>I’m a bit unhappy with Trane&#x2F;Nexia at the moment and would absolutely not recommend')
