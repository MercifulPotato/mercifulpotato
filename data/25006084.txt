But that&#x27;s why soft skills are important, especially in leadership roles.<p>I tried my best to be a supporting lead, everywhere i was in that role. I believe in leading by example, but i recognize the necessity to _let_ people do things themselves and not just hog power because &quot;i know best&quot;. Let people implement imperfect designs. They&#x27;ll own it, learn, and fix them in time. Your job is to lead, to give direction and not let total crap be put into prod, not keep people under your &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; heel.')
