It tends to give a &quot;solution&quot; without motivating the design decisions.<p>After reading about 80% of SDI and not much else, I failed a system design interview when I provided the &quot;right&quot; answer of putting an async task on a messaging queue, but couldn&#x27;t explain how at-least-once delivery could be used to deal with a flaky task.<p>I think I&#x27;ve filled a lot of these gaps now (passed L5 system design at Google for example) but there wasn&#x27;t really a single efficient resource that helped me do so. DDIA is awesome though.')
