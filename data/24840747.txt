How can I argue that &quot;AI&quot; is a hype bubble to a layman while simultaneously acknowledging that we&#x27;ve seen the development of self-driving cars, music identification, Siri and Google Assistant, search by image, etc.?<p>Obviously this isn&#x27;t all &quot;AI&quot; in the historical CS sense of the word. It&#x27;s a mix of progress in things like signal processing, computer vision, NLP, neural nets and transformers, and the raw computer engineering that has made all of that practical on modern hardware.<p>Are you and I sticks-in-the-mud for not just going along with calling this &quot;AI&quot;? Is there actual worthwhile nuance by calling things their proper names rather than just kowtowing to the word that normal people have latched onto?')
