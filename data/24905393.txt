Very annoying to majority population for variety of reasons.<p>And this is why the Allemansrätt-law was made as thus: &quot;You can camp on King&#x27;s land, but not more than 3 days&quot;. Which totally destroyed the nomadic lifestyle.<p>Tromsø for example was one big tent town. There is still a large empty field by the river for the tents. When Nelson Mandela was visiting Tromsø there was big festival on this field. And I think the field was then named &quot;Field of Human Rights&quot; or something like that. Very ironic, nicht wahr?')
