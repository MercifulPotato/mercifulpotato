How can upper class family or individual ever need to borrow loans and also not have assets?<p>Because student loans, at most points, have has extremely favorable rates at initiation (substantially below, e.g., long-run average S&amp;P 500 returns), an upper or middle class family might well choose to take them to maximize net expected returns.<p>If that family then experienced financial ruin for some reason, they might be left with the debt without any longer being upper&#x2F;middle class (or, an individual who becomes cutoff from the family and it&#x27;s assets might be in similar straits to what would happen has the family bien ruined.)<p>It&#x27;s also possible that the author has confused a relatively high income (or high value of non-productive assets) working or middle class existence with “upper class”; it&#x27;s worth noting that the “upper class” understanding of the previous cicumstance was an epiphany reached through homelessness.')
