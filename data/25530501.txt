You really can&#x27;t expect these people to understand the full consequences of stuff like encryption, offline vs online media and more.

Use the HIPPA lockbox software and it should be good right?<p>In the past before computers they would be putting these in files on a large file folder shelving units with colored folder tabs behind a counter and the only real security was a receptionist that would stop you if you tried to interact with it, and they locked the door to the office when they left.   If someone broke into the office back then too, your medical records would&#x27;ve been stolen &amp; unencrypted (beyond the illegibility of most doctor&#x27;s handwriting) and as a society, we were ok with that security level.')
