I don&#x27;t need to find any others. That single event also showed how ineffective Apple&#x27;s malware scanning was because Apple relied on third parties to find the affected apps even after being given some examples. That process took even longer because Apple does not allow third parties to do this effectively.<p>&gt; The lack of fragmentation, and the centralized control and ease over updates<p>As I said, if you&#x27;re choosing a device to run, you don&#x27;t select one at random from the set of all Android devices. You select one that receives timely updates. On the subject of ease of updates, Android is even better because system app updates do not require a reboot and instead happen silently in the background while the user continues to use the device. This is especially important for apps with large attack surfaces like web browsers, and this is why malware markets have priced mobile Safari exploits as essentially too cheap to meter.')
