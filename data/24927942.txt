Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=[24951487], score=None, time=1603953999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24918669, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know enough about TPMs to know what stops an attacker from installing an OS on another hard drive on the same motherboard and using that to access the TPM<p>The TPM cannot prevent that, you need secure boot. That will prevent the machine to boot into another operating system. But only if you delete Microsoft&#x27;s public keys from your machine. Otherwise the thief can boot Windows and all Linux distros that have a Microsoft-signed shim. Deleting Microsoft&#x27;s key on a machine that is supposed to run Windows as dual boot would mean that you need to sign Windows yourself. Probably doable, but yet more hassle.<p>So probably disk encryption with TPM, i.e. no manual disk password raises the bar enough for the average thief bringing the device to a dodgy backyard shop. But not for a somewhat dedicated attacker. No state level resources needed here at all. Given enough time I might succeed, and I have zero practical experience which such attacks, I am just a normal software developer (having worked a bit with system boot, but not a whole lot).')
