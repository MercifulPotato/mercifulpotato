He, like every other rich old person, is probably setting up a complex will to control how his wealth functions after his death (the cold hand from the grave).  If he gives a song to someone, that person can do what they want with it.  They could keep the money.  Sell the song.  Or just sit on it and let it never be played again.  The dead man would not be in control.  But if he convert that song into a pile of cash, and inserts that cash into a trust, then the dead man can exercise more direct&#x2F;itemized control for many years to come.<p>Give your house to your son and the day after you die he can sell it.  But fund a trust to &quot;administer&quot; the house and you can tell the kid he can live in it but never sell it.  Even decades later, the dead hand still controls the house and behavior of the child.  Rich people do these things.  When I was a law student working at a legal clinic, maybe 1&#x2F;4 of the clients were old people who wanted to leave their house to their daughter but didn&#x27;t want her to sell the day after they died.  My advice was always to not do this because it burdened the daughter immensely.  They didn&#x27;t care.  They wanted the house to continue in the family forever regardless.')
