It felt magical the first time where you can deploy a service without spinning up a server so I put up with all these annoyances. But then docker gains popularity and suddenly there is no practical advantage in using serverless anymore, at least for me. I rewrote the service in django, packaged it as a docker image, then run it on any platform that can run docker.<p>On the other hand, I use cloudflare worker on a bunch of my projects. Unlike aws serverless, cloudflare worker is actually useful because it can do many things that can&#x27;t be done by traditional backend, such as running and intercepting requests on the edge servers that sit between your server and your visitors.')
