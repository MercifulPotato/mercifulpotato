It’s the technical interview portion which is the trap. You are expected to think on the fly while being scrutinized by someone who doesn’t want to be there and who’s seen failure after failure and fully expects you to fail too. Meanwhile they have all the right answers to the questions while you’re floundering around. All this undue pressure and your then expected to solve some esoteric question and put it in the form of an algorithm.  If you’re able to do this  than at this stage you’re well on your way to actually landing the job.')
