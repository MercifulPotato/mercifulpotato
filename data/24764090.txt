(It seemed snarky.)<p>I&#x27;m not talking about hand-rolling solutions. WinAmp was just an analogy. An analogy.<p>Spotify sucks because it&#x27;s a draconian walled garden. Yes, they have millions of customers. But there are no alternatives. They all want to lock you in. It sucks.<p>Back in the day, people were building tools left and right that were interoperable. They were writing importers and exporters and playlist managers.<p>It wasn&#x27;t just music - there were tools for RSS and everything else you could imagine.

And we don&#x27;t get to change the paint.<p>The world is less flexible, less free. Want another analogy?
