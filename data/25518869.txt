When I first started investing&#x2F;speculating I made the mistake of putting in market orders without checking the spread. That resulted in me paying $1 or more per share above the last quoted market price. E.g. the last market quote was $65, but the going ask was $66. After-hours market orders (even on large-cap stocks or high AUM ETFs) can also cause some nasty surprises.')
