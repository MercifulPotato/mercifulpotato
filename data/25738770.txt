Insurrection cannot be left with no response. Their &quot;movement&quot; is entirely based on lies. I understand that you&#x27;re trying to get people to &quot;think like them&quot; but it&#x27;s also paving over the vast gap between reality and delusion that these people have. They have been emboldened to do very stupid things in very public places and that can&#x27;t be allowed to stand, or society will collapse under their stupidity. Just imagine being on an airplane with a bunch of ravenous Trumpers and they get into some argument with some liberal. Violence is contagious in a big group (as has been proven time and time again. The Capitol riot is a great example, the violence was started by a relatively small few) and people will do despicable things if their social surroundings deem it ok. Society, as a whole, needs to excise this despicable behavior or it will be consumed by it.')
