The entire thing comes across as white is bad.<p>Further evidence of how academically overboard he is is illustrated by the fact that he links to a video about colonialism in minecraft.  I am reminded of the insufferable people I have had the displeasure of knowing in life who act like they are on the cusp of something profound when in fact they seem to be just trying to get laid.  Equating actions in a video game with actual colonization is borderline perverse if you ask me.')
