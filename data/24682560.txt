I mostly wanted to suggest that diagrams or notation changes in general can be very useful.<p>It’s true that variable renaming comes up in other parts of mathematics but scope matters a lot less in most other mathematics, so much so that it is basically implicit and left to be inferred based on the mathematical context. You wouldn’t normally rename a variable to avoid a conflict so much as you would avoid giving it a conflicting name in the first place. The recursive nature of the lambda calculus means you can’t avoid the problem this way.')
