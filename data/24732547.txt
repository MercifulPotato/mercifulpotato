It is literally there to make the assembly line workers more productive, so it takes fewer of them to do the same work. Now, you can say that the workers contributed nothing to the improvement, so why should they benefit? But the system is set up so they <i>can&#x27;t</i> contribute improvement---they can&#x27;t accumulate the capital it would take to upgrade the machinery and infrastructure because their wages are minimal, and there&#x27;s no mechanism in place for them to capture the benefits if they could. Sure, there are token rewards for assembly line improvements, but those kinds of sporadic rewards are generally minuscule compared to the long-term benefit realized by the company.')
