I have worked at different sized tech companies, from startup to medium sized, to giant.  And I have worked in several capacities, from line engineer, to middle manager, to director.  In my experience, it is impossible to measure an engineers performance with an error less than +&#x2F;- 20%.  I have worked on side projects that large and my manager never noticed until I demo&#x27;d the results.<p>Generally, if your manager is not shit and not under unusual time pressure, they should have no problem with a project that doesn&#x27;t significantly impact the primary work and has some chance of benefiting the company.<p>Google is interesting as they have an explicit 20% policy, but in practice it doesn&#x27;t really matter one way or another.')
