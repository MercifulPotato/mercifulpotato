YC doesn&#x27;t imply success, and obviously not all YC companies are successful. But I have enough of an &quot;upper-echelon&quot; network (UCLA, Berkeley, USC, Caltech, LA startup scene) to know how priceless a network like the YC founders one would be. Having smart, motivated, critical people willing to give you the time of day is pretty key in refining ideas, reaching out to potential customers, or hiring. Not to mention getting funded (if you need&#x2F;want to).<p>IMO, one of the key mistakes of technical founders is not networking enough. Wish I could go back 10 years ago to my early 20s and tell myself to just go out more and network.')
