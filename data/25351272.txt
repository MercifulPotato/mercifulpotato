Even after years of training many, if not most, police officers miss close-up shots more often than they hit. There&#x27;s a surveillance video somewhere of a security guard and a perp shooting their firearms at each other from about 3 feet apart: they miss every shot. One had a revolver and the other a semi-automatic. It is somewhat reminiscent of the &quot;apartment scene&quot; in Pulp Fiction but even wilder and less believable:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y6YBKdmOlM8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y6YBKdmOlM8</a><p>Shooting a target at a range is very different from drawing and shooting at real people who are moving toward&#x2F;away from you, possibly with ill intent and possibly armed.<p>For police, entering a building with a search warrant is not something to be done with a firearm holstered. You have no idea what you&#x27;re up against in that situation.')
