Americans buy way more large SUVs and trucks than the rest of the world, even those with fewer than three kids (or no kids). The idea that car size is a meaningful barrier to the number of children one has, especially compared to housing and education costs, simply does not pass the sniff test to me.<p>From a pure financial standpoint, I&#x27;d look more to the cost of education, healthcare, and housing. All of which have been growing <i>much</i> more rapidly than the cost of cars or gasoline.')
