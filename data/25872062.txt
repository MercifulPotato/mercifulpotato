Item(by='mszcz', descendants=None, kids=[25878196, 25875361, 25872579], score=None, time=1611327033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25871654, text='&gt; because the range is broad<p>You make it sound like if they don&#x27;t tell you what the range is, they are somehow doing you a favor. No, if they don&#x27;t tell you the range it&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re nice or whatever, but because they&#x27;re trying to get you to sign on for the lowest amount possible. If you hear the range is larger than what you were expecting, you&#x27;re gonna try to hit that upper bound. Both positions are understandable from their own points of view, no hard feelings here. But, in general, the recruiter is not your friend and not there to help you. Them not disclosing information is to their advantage, not to yours.')
