Item(by='nromiun', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606837382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265796, text='&gt; Masks worked the same at the beginning of the pandemic as they do now, but the government did have terrible messaging about masks being (potentially) more likely to infect you, and encouraging people not to wear masks.<p>That is my point. Masks (the same type) always work the same way. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they are in the beginning or ending of a pandemic. My problem is with people who put science on a pedestal and suppress anyone who disagree. They did the same thing at the beginning of the pandemic. Masks have been used for decades but apparently they were now reserved only for the govt. After the pandemic started taking off this position was flipped. Now you have to use anything you have to cover your mouth. Some of the early infected might have died just because they heard in the TV that masks are not safe.<p>My frustration is with people who abandon their common sense just because some &quot;experts&quot; on TV told them to. (There were plenty of others who said that masks will work, but they were also attacked by fact checkers who cited these experts on TV.)')
