Timelines for Covid-19 vaccine are already compressed.  Even this data is just preliminary from Phase III.<p>Limiting factor is safety and testing for safety.<p>They started trials with two people, one gets vaccine one gets placebo. They look for side effects then add more and more people while constantly observing those vaccinated for side effects.<p>Vaccines are not inherently safe, they are safe because they have gone trough huge amount of volunteer testing. If there are unwanted side-effects, vaccine is withdrawn. Since vaccines work with the immune system, you must look for autoimmune reactions, neurological symptoms etc. Some of them can emerge weeks or months later. With new mRNA vaccines there are even more unknowns.<p>Emergency authorization they seek means taking calculated risk. With covid-19 epidemic taking that risk is acceptable.')
