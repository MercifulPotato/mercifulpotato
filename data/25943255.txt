Which it might not be.<p>I think they do - but that&#x27;s good! We need a language like Rust to write operation systems, databases, proxys, webservers, hey maybe even browsers. All the things that are widely used and need to be high performant and secure.<p>Maybe you are using Rust, but you actually really want a different language, one that doesn&#x27;t focus so much on low level &#x2F; performance?<p>Haskell or Scala or F# come to my mind. I&#x27;m listing statically typed languages, because I assume you like those (otherwise, why Rust and not sticking to Elixir).')
