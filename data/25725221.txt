I wish there were more people like you and it&#x27;s a characteristic I hope I can be more like as well.<p>I respect that you are willing to admit you don&#x27;t know the full history and implore others to understand why for example, certain decisions were made. It seems as if many people love to theorize about what these are, making correlations which are usually driven more by their feelings than reality.<p>I feel like character assassination was a phrase that I feel aptly describes how I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people treat people like Lennart Poettering. I feel as if some people are unable to separate person from their opinions. Not considering that person like they are more likely to do so if they were in person.<p>I sometimes feel like this attitude is more strongly felt by some people in a community where there is freedom to take a project in another direction if they desired (I know that not everyone has this option).<p>I do think however that the article of this thread expresses their opinion on an issue in a way that it explains how it effects them without resorting to emotional attacks towards the project and it&#x27;s something I really liked about reading it.')
