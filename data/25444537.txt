It works, for sure, but I always felt a bit iffy when doing a massive update after a while, and I felt like I was being dragged along with their choices instead of making my own.<p>This was my experience with Arch as well. It left me feeling like I needed to check the wiki to see if there were any new warnings before updating.<p>I switched to distros that release ~6-12mo, and I have found my environment is much stable. Currently on Fedora, but considering trying out Suse Leap.')
