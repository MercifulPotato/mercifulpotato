No. At the same time, the self-anointed &quot;Social Justice Warriors&quot; shouldn&#x27;t assume that a white, male, STEM major isn&#x27;t &quot;woke.&quot; Paradoxically, this toxic behavior is increasing the obnoxious &quot;tech bro&quot; phenomenon.<p>EDIT: Something you may not be aware of is these young, white males are being targeted by white supremacist groups on college campuses. Of course they don&#x27;t call themselves that. When these young men are isolated from their peer group and derided solely on the basis of their sex and race (ironically enough) then they can fall prey to these groups that will take them in and tell them this derision stems from the SJW&#x27;s jealousy of the white male superiority. That&#x27;s how these white supremacist groups are recruiting these young men on college campuses, and according to my son it&#x27;s disturbingly effective. This is not progress.')
