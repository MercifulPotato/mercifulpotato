While the financial cost was neglible I still issued a note to Blizzard&#x27;s helpdesk - expecting nothing to happen. They answered in LESS THAN 24 hours and reverted everything bad that had happened. That&#x27;s <i>good service</i>.<p>Since Facebook links Oculus to their services they absolutely should be prepared to offer similar quality service for account problems.')
