Once I got an iPhone 7, carrying around a camera with comparable image quality just wasn&#x27;t worth it anymore. I have an 8 right now, and the only cameras that substantially better quality cost about as much as a 12, which also has a good camera. Unless you are willing to splurge, the superior battery life, size, and utility of your phone will probably outclass any camera you are looking at.')
