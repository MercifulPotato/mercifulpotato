To me it was proof that 99% of the Bitcoin community (such as the Bitcoin subreddit which had an absurd amount of influence, thus why taking it over and censoring discussion was so effective) didn&#x27;t care about Bitcoin as a currency and <i>had never once used it as a currency</i>. They just bought it on Coinbase and never even transferred to their own wallet.<p>Meanwhile people like me who actually cared about using the damn thing, would be paying a $60 transaction fee on a $20 purchase simply because the powers that be decided that increasing the blocksize, (aka increasing the arbitrary global transaction throughput cap) was somehow antithetical to bitcoin&#x27;s decentralized design.')
