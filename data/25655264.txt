From my testing, Fluttershy, Applejack, Twilight, Chrysalis, Rise, and Kyu (and a bunch of other characters that I&#x27;m surely forgetting) seem to perform phenomenally well. Especially Chrysalis, her emotions are extremely believable, and Fluttershy&#x2F;Applejack&#x2F;Rise&#x2F;Kyu have almost zero noise for every generation. This might be the most impressive site I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>Oh, I somehow forgot all of the TF2 characters. Some of them do struggle (Medic the most, I think) but everyone else seems incredibly good.<p>And the Daria characters, too. Honestly, the vast majority of characters are already near-perfect.')
