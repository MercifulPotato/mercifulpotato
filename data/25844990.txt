Item(by='bvrmn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611140983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844934, text='&gt; with 1-based indexing lower is 1 and upper is one greater than the number of elements.<p>Do you see +1 tweak? Also consider that &quot;for loop&quot; can&#x27;t be expressed as &lt;&#x2F;* interval and always expressed as &lt;=&#x2F;* interval. So 1-based indexing have to be either 1 &lt;= i &lt;= N (closed interval, bad, N - 1 != number of iterations) or 1 &lt;= i &lt; N + 1 (half open interval, good, but +1 tweak).')
