The vast majority of corporate research labs just don’t fund research doubting their own ethics in the first place. Company leadership should choose an ethical stance and defend it. It’s an abdication of responsibility to say, well the ethics are an open question, we’re going to fund some research into it. And now Google is being punished for their abdication of responsibility. If they had simply established a corporate policy that said, we believe facial recognition is good when XYZ conditions are met, and defended it, they wouldn’t be in this situation.')
