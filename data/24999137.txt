In Serbian people try to make the distinction by using &quot;Srbi&quot; and &quot;Srbijanci&quot; (citizens), basically Serb vs Serbians, though it is a linguistic stretch (just like we&#x27;ve got Bosniaks&#x2F;Bošnjaci for a nation to oppose it to Bosnians&#x2F;Bosanci which includes anyone from Bosnia and Herzegovina).')
