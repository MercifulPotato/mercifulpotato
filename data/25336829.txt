It would be different if I was wanting to buy a house. I actually like my apartment in the bay area, but when the office did shut down I looked at what it would cost. I wouldn&#x27;t save much money because I wanted to stay in California.<p>My employer is becoming more WFH friendly. But they are explicitly saying post-covid fulltime remote will require an adjustment for base salary and future equity grants. I don&#x27;t think that would be a good financial decision for me. Even if my compensation didn&#x27;t get cut I would probably end up needing to take a pay cut or move if I wanted to change jobs.')
