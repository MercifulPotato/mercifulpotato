I know he&#x27;s never going to kill anyone. I know nothing about the stranger.<p>But yes, I would regret it if he went and killed someone after I chose his life over a human&#x27;s.<p>I would also deeply regret it if I chose a stranger over my dog and then that person turned out to be a Bad Guy.')
