Item(by='mmglr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608101301, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438817, text='My house has a Carrier Infinity system where the compressor and air handler is fully variable. It can retrieve weather data over the net and adjust heating&#x2F;cooling. The compressor and air handler are &quot;connected&quot; which is HVAC lingo for a proprietary protocol. The brains are in a $700 thermostat with a buggy touch screen that has the resolution of a lite-brite and it cannot work with virtual assistants.<p>One benefit I did see in the manual, is that if the air handler was gas combined with a heat pump you can enter the price of electricity and the price of gas and it can compute which heating method is best: gas&#x2F;heat pump&#x2F;resistive (usually when heat pump cannot provide requested temperature). But I don&#x27;t have gas.<p>ROMs are available for these systems distributed as hex files on Carriers website. So its been on my todo list to reverse engineer the software.<p>Someone with time combined with a Raspberry Pi + Raspberry Pi Display (around $80 USD) could build a much better thermostat than what Carrier has done.')
