For one, it&#x27;s resembles the most recent conflict between two super-powers, and, for the other, it also carries this notion of capitalism vs socialism on the other.<p>Yet, I feel this misses the point and, more concerning maybe, also downplays its potential danger to the world. In my opinion, the situation that most closely relates to current state is the rivalry between Germany and Great Britain in the late 19th century and then throughout the early half of the 20th century. While I think the similarities between the UK back then and the US now don&#x27;t need much explaining, the similarities between Germany and China are also pretty stark: both gained traction as exporting economies. Both states are characterised by strong central leadership and the idea of a homogenous ruling people (not referring to modern Germany here). Both were&#x2F;are a little late to the game of Empires, playing catch-up. Germany had developed more efficient and streamlined forms of bureaucracy that allowed the state to develop greater reach into society, similar to modern day China.<p>Interestingly, even though both Germany and the UK were fully aware of the devastating effect of machine guns (since they both used them to suppress uprisings in their colonies) they discounted their impact when they decided to go to war in 1914. I fear a similar situation could arise with today&#x27;s nuclear weapons, and the rivalry between the US and China.')
