For Linux users it is definitely better buying an AMD discrete graphics card than Nvidia, and it has been for an eternity. Just google &quot;torvalds Nvidia&quot; as an example of how the community feels about Nvidia. Is it even possible using Nvidia cards with Wayland?<p>Nvidia has a history of problems in Linux. I can still remember having to log out of my X session just to change monitor layout; which is something you do alot with a laptop and external displays. Took them several years to fix!<p>I&#x27;ve experienced intel boards where I had trouble getting anything but the newest fedora with custom kernel parameter to even get the installer running. But most of the time intel has very good upstream support, so it is normally a pretty safe bet.<p>With AMD there are sometimes delays getting full support for a new generation upstreamed (e.g. hdmi audio and such), so it is usually good to Google for Linux reviews first.<p>In general AMD has superb open source support for their cards, if not immediately at launch, and I recommend them for Linux users who want the least amount of hassle.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people recommending Nvidia to Linux on YouTube (and now here), and I honestly think it&#x27;s a disfavor to anyone interested in Linux.')
