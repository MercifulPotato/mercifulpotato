Cost of living adjustments are literally that: salaries adjusted so that you get the same lifestyle whichever city you happen to be living in. To argue against a cost of living adjustment in a downward direction means you want to live better elsewhere.<p>Which is really the elephant in the room in these conversations. People want to live like kings in a $500&#x2F;mon 3 bedroom house in the middle of nowhere while making a salary level that only exists so that those people could afford SF housing. Basically, people want to get rich.<p>Which leads me to my real unpopular rant: this is the same group that generally believe CEOs make too much money. Yet when given the opportunity to make the argument that we should be making closer to the same as those around us, they don&#x27;t want equality; they want their turn to be on top.')
