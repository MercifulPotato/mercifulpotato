You want an eco-system of tools that have been built around the idea of a minimal fixed base instruction-set with extensions.<p>Essentially: the modular nature of Risc-V and  tooling&#x2F;ecosystem built around it, with first class extension support.<p>ARM is closed, too complex and not friendly to extensions, while custom ISAs mandate a huge amount of extra work.<p>I only dabble in this field, but I see the ecosystem rapidly maturing. The open nature also leads to a general propensity to open source designs and tooling, lowering the barrier to entry and reducing cost.')
