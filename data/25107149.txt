Face down with streamlining they can do up to about 300MPH.<p>So someone starting with a deep dive in a wingsuit can level out and get very fast horizontal movement.  There are a few videos of people doing this and reaching almost level flight though their slowing down.  Itâ€™s maintaining speed that requires thrust, but speed is enough for level flight.<p>Also, while you could effectively balance on a jet engine to hover, that amount of thrust would also allow you to do not just level horizontal flight but rapidly gain altitude, making it kind of a meaningless from a minimum speed to requirements for minimum thrust perspective.')
