A good part of the world&#x27;s email infrastructure is decentralized, and doesn&#x27;t run on providers who update software well and often. If Google were to publish their keys after rotation, a new class of attacks could emerge where attackers could successfully forge authentic emails from Google that would look secure to an outdated provider. Nigerian prince 2.0 if you will.<p>Decentralization is one of email&#x27;s biggest strengths. I agree with the premise here, but I don&#x27;t think the solution is to publish keys. Perhaps moving to a protocol that explicitly provides non-repudiation while keeping backwards compatibility would work.')
