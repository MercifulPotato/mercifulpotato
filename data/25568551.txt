We should (again) focus more on producing energy that&#x27;s too cheap to meter. I want my flat-rate power subscription, and I want it yesterday!<p>We&#x27;ve invented this artificial energy scarcity problem by refusing to use the cleanest and safest solution out there, even traditional 60&#x27;s era nuclear power kills fewer people per unit of energy produces than any other source of energy.<p>I put this down to virtue-signalling more than anything else, but even so, nuclear energy is what I&#x27;m surprised we&#x27;re not working on more.')
