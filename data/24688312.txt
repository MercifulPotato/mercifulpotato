From different assumptions, different conclusions follow.  But the existence of an objective reality is not an axiom, at least not a scientific one.  It is an <i>explanation</i> for the <i>observed fact</i> that science is possible in the first place.  It is an explanation of the observed fact that there are things that nearly all humans agree on, e.g. the fact that there appear to be lights in the sky, the fact that everyone more or less agrees what the repertoire of lights is (one very bright one, one not-so-bright-one, and lots and lots of much dimmer ones), and that they move with enough regularity that their future positions can be predicted with astonishing accuracy.  No axioms are required to make these observations, nor to come up with the explanation that the reason that everyone agrees on all these things is that there are, in point of actual fact, sources of light out there in some objective physical reality.')
