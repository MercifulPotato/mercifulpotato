I found that caffeine really helped with alertness during the day. So for the last 6 years I’ve been having exactly 10 oz of cold brew coffee each morning. That seems to work perfectly for me - no headaches, and it’s enough to keep me alert during the day. I still tend to drink around 4-5L of water most days, just due to thirst (replacing the soda).<p>Before I stuck with it, I had quit a few times before. Quitting cold turkey was probably the sickest I’ve ever been, with vomiting and extreme migraines. But I found that if I just cut back to a single 20oz bottle of soda for a couple of days first instead of quitting completely, that tiny of caffeine bit was enough to keep most of the symptoms at bay. YMMV')
