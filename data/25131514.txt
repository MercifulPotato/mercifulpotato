Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=[25133698], score=None, time=1605657406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25128026, text='&gt; The US Pharma market is full of &quot;found $20 bills&quot; that just shouldn&#x27;t exist if markets were as efficient as people wishcast they would be<p>This presupposes that the US pharma market (and healthcare writ large) constitute an actual market. It&#x27;s really not, by just about any measure. The only thing remotely resembling a &quot;market&quot; is the fact that insurance is predominately provided by the private sector for profit. Outside of that, the industry is ridden with the worst combination of distortionary incentives and regulations. The fact that healthcare is tied to employment didn&#x27;t happen by accident, it&#x27;s the net result of WW2-era wage ceilings, followed by 1970&#x27;s tax deductibility for employer group plans, followed by the ACA employer mandate. I&#x27;d describe the US as combining the worst of public healthcare systems with the worst of privatized systems. PBMs and every other horrible inefficiency of US healthcare aren&#x27;t some accident of a functioning market.')
