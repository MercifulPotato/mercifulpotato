Mine offers QR reading as another selectable mode, in addition to the &quot;Still photo&quot; and &quot;Movie&quot; modes. My previous phone had it integrated in the &quot;Still photo&quot; mode: it would simply detect and read QR codes automatically when pointing the camera towards one.<p>But, the phone I had <i>before</i> those two, had a Camera app which didn&#x27;t read QR codes. So maybe it&#x27;s a matter of expectations now: old Camera apps were just for Camera, while modern ones are now generally expected to be able to read QR codes? (I would, anyway)')
