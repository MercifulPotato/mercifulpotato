Erlang is very eager in copying almost everything you put in a message to a process (with the expection of big binaries, etc).<p>Whether this is has a big impact on running systems remains to be seen, Erlang is very good at quickly collecting data.<p>Another thing that I would say Pony has that Erlang doesn&#x27;t is an easy FFI mechanism. You can write NIFs for Erlang, but in my experience writing native code or wrapping C libraries has been much easier in Pony.')
