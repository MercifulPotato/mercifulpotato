Take RSA encryption for example. People don’t implement it from the patent, but independent invention was extremely rare.  People’s implementations generally trace the idea back to Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who publicly described the algorithm in 1977.<p>Yet, overhear the idea in passing and it’s implementation is obvious. Actual secure crypto is much harder than a simple implementation though.  RSA is interesting because an equivalent algorithm was independently discovered in 1973 at GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency, and only declassified in 1997.<p>So in effect it’s disclosure not invention that shaped public crypto. I am not saying patents are a great fit for software, but I am saying disclosure in one form or another is.')
