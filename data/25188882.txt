Seems likely that it could&#x27;ve been missed entirely had England&#x27;s history been slightly different. E.g. part of why the industrial revolution was possible was because an argricultural revolution preceeded it. So there was a temporary increase in capital accumulation (since agriculture was more productive) followed by a rise in population (families could be larger), so this capital could be deployed in new industries using the cheap labor that had recently been born and wasn&#x27;t needed to produce food.<p>Had the industrial revolution not followed this agricultural revolution it seems possible that society would&#x27;ve been stuck in another Malthusian trap and there would not be enough surplus for the industrial revolution to get started.')
