There&#x27;s a pretty big mental block when it comes to touch, and I think that&#x27;s made my life materially worse. Do others experience that? I grew up in New England for context.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat fortunate that if I get particularly lonely or touch deprived, I can hop on grindr&#x2F;scruff&#x2F;hornet and resolve that situation pretty quickly in most cases. I hear the situation for single heterosexual men is significantly worse, but I&#x27;d like to hear others thoughts. Are there outlets for straight lonely people in need of touch?<p>Gay dating apps have a reputation for being very sex focused, but many of the profiles I see are specifically seeking out touch&#x2F;cuddling as a primary or even exclusive goal.')
