Given that, the 1st data allotment should include the cost of the last mile connection, and any subsequent data allotments should be significantly lower cost, closer to incremental transit costs (which aren&#x27;t very much). Commercial internet connections are often billed at a monthly fee based on the interconnect type, and then a per Mbps fee for 95 percentile usage.<p>Most residential customers don&#x27;t really want that though, they just want an unmetered connection that works, with a monthly price they can count on; and one where the more they pay per month, the faster it goes, and the more stuff they can do. A flat cap set across all of the tiers doesn&#x27;t make sense. And how are consumers expected to control all of their devices to make sure they don&#x27;t download hundreds of gigs of updates overnight?')
