Particularly if you&#x27;re working with other people.<p>Once you are collaborating, there is simply more to good code than what you our your peers know about the code or the language. Working well and effective with others has a huge impact on you, your peers, the &quot;company&quot; and in the end the product.<p>Further, I know <i>a lot more</i> about my cars than just how to change the tires. E.g. there are know issues with certain popular car models. Knowing about them does help, not every random mechanic does.<p>Also, if my car does certain things (surprise, they do all the time, they are complex nowadays) that are easily explainable or even somewhere in the manual, I am not going to ask for help every.single.time. I have stuff to do, be somewhere. I am not going to put my car in the dealership all the time.<p>Git for me is a productivity tool, in particular when I&#x27;m working with others.<p>You sound like the guy I once collaborated with that didn&#x27;t want to use git (because why should he learn it now?) and instead sending the whole code via skype every day.')
