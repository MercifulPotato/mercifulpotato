That really started to chew through the battery, especially when running Dolby Vision content through Netflix in Safari. I ended up buying USB-C to DisplayPort adapters that also supply power in the same cable so I wouldn’t take up both the USB 4 ports with such activities.<p>Normally though, I’ve had battery life hit up to 22-24 hours in light usage and the battery doesn’t drain much while it sleeps so that can sometimes mean multiple days of battery life.<p>I find for programming the biggest limitation is the 13” screen when on the go, as it has been an adjustment for me from having a larger 15” or 16” screen. I’m looking forward to seeing the new 16” Apple Silicon arrive in June, if you can believe the rumours. Apparently they’ll be adding native ports for HDMI. Cross fingers that it natively supports HDMI 2.1 for example...')
