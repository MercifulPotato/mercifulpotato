Item(by='l33tman', descendants=None, kids=[25536155, 25536085], score=None, time=1608896120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535324, text='It&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> anthropocentric reasoning, like &quot;the cost is too large&quot;, &quot;you lose control of the hegemony&quot; etc. And that there are &quot;colonists&quot; that &quot;die off&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure any of these assumptions are applicable given billions of possible origins of life at various stages of development. Even at Earth, and with extremely conservative estimates, given 100 more years of nanotech&#x2F;biotech&#x2F;AI development, we won&#x27;t die off, and could certainly send autonomous robot probes. When you don&#x27;t die anymore, 8 years roundtrip (or more) suddenly doesn&#x27;t seem so long.<p>BTW in the fiction arena, I suggest reading David Brin &quot;Existence&quot; if you&#x27;re so inclined which is related to this :)')
