They have zero to do with my day-to-day. Which is nice. I bargain pay on my own etc., same does everyone else. Don&#x27;t even think my employer knows I&#x27;m a member.<p>However, the union has pushed for better regulations. When I started my career 5 years ago for instance, I had to sign a non-compete. Almost every offer had one, as an individual I couldn&#x27;t do much. The union however helped pass legislation so those general non-competes are illegal, and can only be used for very specific purposes. When I got offers, they would also look over the contracts, tell me what I should be expected to be paid etc, giving me more knowledge and backing as a rookie (vs big cos). The yearly salary statistics is detailed and useful for me every year.<p>The union also collectively bargains for other stuff. For instance my mortgage rate is far lower through their offer than anything else I&#x27;ve found. The member fee (~400 yearly?) pays it self many times over just from this.<p>So I think this works great. Everyone on here always paints unions as these monoliths, but they don&#x27;t have to be. I am still valued as a singular, but for the big stuff we&#x27;re numerous.')
