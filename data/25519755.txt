That’s a much larger difference than the amount of savings they have.<p>Anyway, <i>95 percent of today’s House members and 100 percent of the Senate’s have a bachelor’s degree or higher.</i> 1&#x2F;2 have a law degree and they include several doctors etc.<p>So, based on their current salary and likely professional background having 500k vs 300k of savings actually seems kind of low IMO.  I mean running for congress takes more drive than the average person, so presumably higher net worth should be expected.<p>By comparison the net worth of the top 1% for all 60 year olds, collage education or not is over 4 million.')
