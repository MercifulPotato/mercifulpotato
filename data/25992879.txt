I really admire what theyâ€™re trying to do. However, as some other people have observed, their example applications are quite awful and not very useful(?) and they seem to be marketing it to end users, not developers. In my experience, most end users do not care about privacy and security until 1) they either lose a lot of money or other valuables 2) some hacker comes knocking on their door for extortion and they lose a lot of money or other valuables.<p>It would be so much better if they just made it so easy and simple for developers to use that it becomes their default, and not rely on hope that end users will suddenly start using decentralized apps in the name of privacy.')
