I found a recent article [1] talking it in more detail:<p>&gt; &quot;There were all of these compelling mysteries and so we were saying, ‘We wanna have this stuff answered by the end of Season 1, this stuff answered by the end of Season 2, and then the show basically ends after about three years.’ That was the initial pitch, and they were not even hearing it. [....] they [ABC] were just like, ‘Do you understand how hard it is to make a show that people want to watch? And people like the show? So why would we end it? You don’t end shows that people are watching.’”<p>You can&#x27;t keep dragging out the mysteries forever, you have to eventually resolve something. You also can&#x27;t just keep introducing new ones forever, because it doesn&#x27;t make sense. You can&#x27;t keep showing the same flashbacks, and you just can&#x27;t introduce major new chunks of history to people&#x27;s backstories that have never been brought up before.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comicbook.com&#x2F;tv-shows&#x2F;news&#x2F;lost-ending-original-plans-damon-lindelof-interview&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;comicbook.com&#x2F;tv-shows&#x2F;news&#x2F;lost-ending-original-pla...</a>')
