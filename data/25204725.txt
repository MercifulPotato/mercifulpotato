Their progress bar would go steadily up for quite a while, and then suddenly spend 3x as long on just one or two percentage points.<p>It didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that the progress bar measured bytes written to disk, but when it was seemingly &quot;stuck&quot;, it was creating a lot of small files.<p>Instead of bytes written, what I really cared about is &quot;how done are you?&quot; and that would have been better represented by a function of both number of files created _and_ bytes written. I don&#x27;t think the weighting of those two had to be very accurate to be a big improvement.')
