If the device doesn&#x27;t work with any other universal charger that is their problem. Likewise if I use their charger on something else and it breaks my other device that is their problem.<p>The purpose of universal is everything works with everything. whoever breaks that is at fault and should pay the price.  If Nintendo has used some other port I wouldn&#x27;t have the expectation, but they used a universal port so they need to be compatible.')
