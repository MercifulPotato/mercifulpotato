I&#x27;ve built apps that have been rejected, gone through their review board, etc. and ended up never being allowed because of a rule that didn&#x27;t even apply to us. On a call with the Apple reviewer, they stated, &quot;it is a private store and we choose who will be on it.&quot; Kinda sums it up.')
