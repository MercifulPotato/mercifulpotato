Homeless people also will claim their pet is an emotional support animal. They are often homeless because they are disabled but being homeless means &quot;Good luck jumping through bureaucratic hoops to register anything.&quot;<p>Sometimes someone&#x27;s life comes unraveled because their disability has never been properly identified and accommodated. Being able to say &quot;I need this&quot; without having to jump through hoops to prove it can help such people make their lives work better.<p>Most studies suggest that something like one in five people has a disability. One study that asked about user needs and challenges in using stuff intentionally avoided using stigmatizing words like &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;handicapped&quot; and more like three fifths of respondents said they had some degree of trouble doing various things and more accessible design would benefit them.<p>People who are only moderately disabled often try like hell to avoid getting labeled as disabled because it is stigmatizing and people start treating you like you are stupid and worthless rather than like you just need special accommodation in some areas to make your life work. Those who qualify for an official label of &quot;disabled&quot; are equally hostile to seeing only moderately disabled people being granted the label that grants special status and special accommodation.<p>The reality is that disability occurs along a continuum. It isn&#x27;t an on&#x2F;off switch where if you fall on this side of the line you are &quot;normal, healthy and able-bodied&quot; and if you fall on that side of the line you are &quot;disabled.&quot; We try to categorize it like it works that way but it doesn&#x27;t really work that way.')
