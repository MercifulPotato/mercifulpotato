You can control a sea without a single ship. The US is a naval power. The US cannot project power into the South China Sea without the use of Naval Power.<p>China, however, can. Easily, in fact.<p>Indeed, if you look at the J-20, you will notice that it is significantly larger than the F-22 and F-35. Why is that? In order to store very long range weaponry, and much higher amounts of fuel.<p>This design aspect reflects the doctrine of sea control via air and missile power, not naval power.<p>So, if for some reason there were no way to sail a vessel near the SCS, the China automatically, decisively, gains control thereof.<p>Moreso, China and Russia are significantly ahead of the US in hypersonic flight technology.')
