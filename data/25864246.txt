Both companies are not perfect, but if we must choose the lesser evil...&quot;<p>It&#x27;s very fast for a low power, laptop-focused processor and even then only truly excels at single-threaded workloads.  It&#x27;s out classed by AMD mobile offerings (4900HS and 4800U) in multi-threaded workloads on most tests[0].  If you step up to desktop processors, the top end processors like the AMD 5950X are in a different class of multi-threaded performance.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s an exceptional processor and incredibly fast for its sub-25W TDP.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>')
