GSuite, the same thing as Gmail and using the same address for most aspects, have IP blocked endpoints.<p>This is where the misinformation is: many providers outright block Iranian IPs and in the other thread I linked you to services who do just that.<p>Just because the most well funded consumer facing personal services don&#x27;t outright IP block or account block doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not standard for everyone with a tighter budget.')
