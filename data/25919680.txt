I can see why it appeals to Silicon Valley types&#x2F;HN readers; after all this website is a content aggregator so it makes sense we all have a shared interest in written work. That said I think that the blog &quot;industry&quot; is dying more than it is growing.<p>To me, media seems to be trending towards quick, consumable, visually stimulating content, ie YouTube, TikTok and the like. The reason such content is more engaging and profitable is because it&#x27;s a lot easier to turn it into a feed: one does not scroll through a newsletter for hours on end, and long form content tends to be the type that you put more thought into reading instead of simply moving on to the next piece.<p>Advertising runs on eyeballs but subscriptions do not, and it feels to me like Twitter seem to think that creating a well integrated platform to drive more Twitter discussion is a good idea, but really to me it feels like blogs and Tweets run perpendicular to each other: anyone who&#x27;s read a decent amount of Twitter conversation knows that deeply thought out and sensible it is not.<p>Maybe they see being able to be &quot;in&quot; conversations about paywalled content will incentivize people to pay up, and will subsequently start pushing Revue content on people&#x27;s feeds to try and create such a mentality? Or maybe Twitter don&#x27;t care about making Revue &quot;part of&quot; Twitter and just think it&#x27;s a growing market worth capitalising on. Only time will tell.<p>In a way it sort of reminds me of podcasts. They work well only for a group of people who have the time to consume long content, and while it works as a large niche, I can&#x27;t see it growing into a Twitter-scale mass market, so I wouldn&#x27;t trust it to be around for a particularly long time.')
