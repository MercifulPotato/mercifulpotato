Ultimately I see such bad actors trying to integrate themselves into the system - to game the system - to be simply increasing waste or inefficiency. So while such behaviours may be slowing growth of the system, so long as there aren&#x27;t unmovable blocks introduced, and everyone&#x27;s mostly aligned to leading metrics - then it should be fine; potential blocks include things like unions, which is why I&#x27;m still juggling thoughts and reasoning as to whether unions are good or not - likely industry wide they are. A failsafe in this scenario is contract workers can all be let go easily - minus the domain and systems expertise they have - and you&#x27;d need the main controller, visionary&#x2F;founder, to be paying full attention and make course corrections when necessary, hopefully finding trusted co-captains along the way that are passionate with the work more for than financial gain.')
