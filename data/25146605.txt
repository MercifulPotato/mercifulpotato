If this were to hold up then any royalty obligation could be shuffled off to a shell entity?!<p>Why would this be surprising? If that was hired work (instead of licence for IP) for company A, then IP owner is company A and obligations to author are just contractural payments unrelated to IP ownership. Company A then may sell IP ownership to company B, while keeping contractual obligations to pay for contracted work to author.<p>It seems not much different to a case when you buy a house from a developer, while the developer is still owing money to contract workers &#x2F; builders.')
