How can you do that with Alipay?<p>Which are essentially funded through merchant fees. CC&#x27;s will gladly give you $2k in cash back for all of the fees that it charges merchants. If those fees didn&#x27;t exist, your overall cost of goods would likely be ~3% cheaper.<p>Looks like Alipay has disputes and fraud: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intl.alipay.com&#x2F;ihome&#x2F;user&#x2F;protect&#x2F;memberProtect.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intl.alipay.com&#x2F;ihome&#x2F;user&#x2F;protect&#x2F;memberProtect.htm</a>')
