We have bash&#x2F;zsh&#x2F;sh, glibc&#x2F;musl, apt&#x2F;pacman&#x2F;yum, systemd&#x2F;runit&#x2F;OpenRC, GNOME&#x2F;KDE&#x2F;XFCE, i3&#x2F;wmii&#x2F;xmonad, chromium&#x2F;firefox etc etc. Even kernel is interchangeable - HURD [1], kFreeBSD [2].<p>Distribution is a collection of such parts, you may think of it as &quot;proprietary top-down control attitude&quot; but it is just a collection that suits someone needs. It may not suit you, you may replace parts, you may create another distribution. For example as Arch Linux user my install does not include graphical system, no one forces me.<p>The point I see is that Wayland got something useful. So useful that distributions started to switch their default. If anything it conforms that X11 has some problems, that it was harder to achieve same result there. Maybe it does not cover your needs but it covers someone needs better.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;hurd&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;hurd&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;kfreebsd-gnu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.debian.org&#x2F;ports&#x2F;kfreebsd-gnu&#x2F;</a>')
