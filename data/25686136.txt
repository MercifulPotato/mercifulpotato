I never eat more green vegetables than when I am on a keto type diet. They are everywhere and I even have slight variations into vegetables I do not normally consider.<p>However one point most people miss, you don&#x27;t have to cut out BBQ or other meat condiments. You would be amazed how far that tablespoon actually goes and you still stay way under your carb limit. Once I discovered this the dieting got immensely easier. Same goes for types of salad dressing; I tend to the mix it yourself variety from Good Seasons.<p>I do not let myself slip into reasoning &quot;just one slice of bread&quot; is okay though. You do however need to look beyond foods you are used to. Eventually it became a game for me which made the whole process more fun')
