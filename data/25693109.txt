It is about time.  Having said that, these actions ring hollow to me.  He could have been banned a long time ago; this week&#x27;s events are a culmination of brainwashing the weak through social media that has gone on for over four years.  All of these Republican senators and representatives falling over each other to denounce him this week had the opportunity to remove him from office in February (or at least call witnesses at his Senate trial).  They chose to remain silent, hoping that the political capital they built by supporting a dictator wannabe could be used for their own personal agenda.  This week, they realized that wasn&#x27;t going to happen, so fled like rats from a sinking ship, praying that they should save their tarnished political career or at least emerge with a shred of dignity.  The timing is incredibly depressing, and Twitter&#x27;s action feels the same to me.<p>I am an advocate for free speech and I hate to see mobs forming around people hoping to deplatform and &quot;cancel&quot; their enemies... but I learned this week that I have a lot to think about.  It is sad to me that a veteran who served four tours of duty in the Air Force was shot dead in the United States Capitol, ending up in that unfortunate spot because of a constant barrage of misleading information from social media; literally egged on by the President of the United States.<p>We all have a lot of soul searching to do.  I wish we didn&#x27;t let it escalate to this point just to get some engagement numbers up.')
