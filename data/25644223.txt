It was a hypothetical choice between 2 models, with ECC or LEDs, at the same price. Hypothetical because most boards don&#x27;t offer the ECC support at all, and certainly not at the same price.<p>You&#x27;re making a claim about what people would choose.  If you have no related data, and logic could support multiple outcomes, then a claim like that is basically useless.<p>&gt; You confused manufacturing costs, price of the product, and profit margins.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you think this.<p>&gt; Again supporting my statement that even if presented with 2 absolutely identical parts save for ECC vs. LEDs the vast majority of consumers will go for LEDs because they don&#x27;t care or know about ECC.<p>Sure, if you <i>don&#x27;t tell them</i> that it&#x27;s ECC they won&#x27;t pick the ECC part.<p>If you actually do a fair test, and put them side by side while explaining that one protects them from memory errors and the other looks cooler, you can&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll all pick the LED.<p>When people never even think of ECC, that is not evidence that they <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> care or know about it in a head-to-head competition.')
