This gives you more opportunity to test ideas and test marketing (which is probably more important than your idea). The canonical example of this is probably Pieter Levels [1].<p>Let&#x27;s call this the &quot;Test with Teeny MVP&quot; [2] method as a opposed to the &quot;Test with Landing Page&quot; method. Important note - I suspect that testing with a teeny MVP is easier than a landing page when you don&#x27;t have an audience. Interesting tweet on that from Rob Walling [3]:<p>&quot;Out of nearly 1600 applicants to @tinyseedfund we chose 23 exceptional companies to fund. Of those 23, one (maybe two if you stretch) built an audience before launching their SaaS.<p>Audience helps, but so much less in SaaS. I&#x27;ve been beating this drum since 2012.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.io&#x2F;12-startups-12-months&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;levels.io&#x2F;12-startups-12-months&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: I&#x27;m sure that someone will point out that &quot;Teeny&quot; is redundant here. :)<p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;robwalling&#x2F;status&#x2F;1306591312498405376" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;robwalling&#x2F;status&#x2F;1306591312498405376</a>')
