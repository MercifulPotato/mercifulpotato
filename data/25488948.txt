You get paid as little as it would cost to replace you with a sufficient replacement. Remote work increases the labor pool and lowers that replacement cost for the company.<p>A company may have decided to go remote, but if they were to immediately cut all salaries to the lower remote-rate, they would lose too many expensive local workers faster than they could hire new cheaper remote workers and productivity would severely disrupted.<p>Because of this, they&#x27;re using individuals moving away from HQs as a convenient rate limiter to do it gradually.')
