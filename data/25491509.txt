Overall it&#x27;s been a great experience. The biggest downside for my use case is that it&#x27;s very sensitive to internet quality- internet that&#x27;s totally fine for streaming video, browsing, etc will cause games to be unplayable on shadow since you need such consistent throughput and latency. Related to this, I haven&#x27;t gotten USB passthrough (or the joystick forwarding) to work at all really, and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s also a connection quality issue.<p>For your use case where you&#x27;re using it at home to downsize I think you&#x27;d avoid all of these problems, assuming you have good internet at home.')
