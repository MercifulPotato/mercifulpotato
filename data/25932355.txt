Anyone who starts to make their own furniture suddenly has a new-found appreciation for why furniture costs what it does.<p>That fact that you can easily spend $400-600 on the wood alone for a new dining table is staggering. (And makes you really, really careful while you build it.)<p>(My pandemic working-from-home desk was made of cheap box-store plywood, because I wasn&#x27;t going to splurge on baltic for something that I hope I won&#x27;t be using in a year.
