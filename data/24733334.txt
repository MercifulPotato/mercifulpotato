While I believe Trump is the worst president the US has had in recent history that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d be unwilling to entertain a discussion of anything he may have done that people think it was a good thing. I suspect in most cases we&#x27;ll end up with &quot;we agree to disagree&quot; which is fine.<p>That said, one thing we have to consider is the environment in which the discussion takes place. At work people shouldn&#x27;t have to get stressed with non-work related things, that&#x27;s not in the interest of the company nor of the employees. So even if you know you can have respectful deep conversations of controversial current day politics with your colleagues, a better question would be, should you even have those conversations at work?<p>I feel for people that suddenly need to discuss such topics, it means that they probably don&#x27;t have IRL friends or friends outside of work if they really feel that they have to talk about no-work related issues at a work lunch. It&#x27;s sad.')
