The purpose is to eliminate computer interruptions or temptations so that you can write.<p>Scrivener: for editing and organization. Scrivener is a writing and organization program. It was originally developed by a novelist who was frustrated by how difficult it is to move back and forth in long Word documents. Word&#x27;s Document Map doesn&#x27;t work all that well. Originally Scrivener was supposed to be just a first draft production document but it has grown and can currently be used to create documents in just about any format a writer will need (it&#x27;s a little weak on appellate briefs). It also has a full-screen distraction free mode. If you need to complete a long work quickly you need Scrivener.<p>Also consider: Alphasmart, by Dana. This is a full-size keyboard attached to a Palm(pilot) operating system. It comes with a Word-compatible Word processor. You use SD cards to get your files off the computer. There is also an educational model which is cheaper and has less functionality. Battery life for these is very good: think weeks instead of hours.')
