If updates stall out after awhile, or if the new features don&#x27;t solve anything for you, it&#x27;s not like you can choose to skip an upgrade. And the more you use the product, the higher the barrier to switching away. I agree, Craft looks lovely, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m locking myself into its business model.<p>I say this every time, but this is a solved problem. Developers of software like Sketch and Bitwig Studio have the right kind of subscription model, where you subscribe to <i>updates</i>, not <i>access</i>. If you don&#x27;t care for the latest version, you can let your subscription lapse and keep using the last version you&#x27;re licensed for. Apple has all the pieces necessary to simply gate App Store updates via subscription, but they apparently have no motivation to do so.')
