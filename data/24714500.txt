I find it downright abhorrent, being the kind of sentiment at the roots of every organisation that ever excluded&#x2F;demoralised the folks that didn&#x27;t talk, look, think, or behave like some cookie-cutter template.<p>There is no assertable &quot;fact&quot; that diversity of expression, or the expression of preferences and identity, extends from immaturity or ideology.  On the contrary, it is a mark of organisational and civilisational <i>maturity</i>, and willingness to embrace ideas, that such self-expression is possible, accepted, and encouraged.  The qualifiers I&#x27;d suggest instead are heterogeneity and imagination, and there is no trend to buck; the world is, and always has been, full of complicated, imaginative people.<p>When I am very lucky, I even get to work with them.<p>Sans identity, the individual is a puppet, and sans creativity, humanity is cosmically uninteresting.')
