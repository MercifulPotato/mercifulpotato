I sold that position years before Tesla bought them, but one thing I recall is that there were a few people on the message boards that were pointing out how silly-high the short interest was, and that was, IIRC, in the 30% of float range.<p>As we all know, MXWL wasn&#x27;t bankrupted, but neither did they thrive on their own. GME also has 4 times the short interest that those people were talking about. It also lacks a trove of patents that are worth something even in a fire sale. In fact the only thing they really have, IMO, is ThinkGeek, and the last time I looked they had fucked that up by merging its catalog into their own hamfisted storefront.<p>Honestly, given the current generation of consoles, I think they may be better off rebranding as ThinkGeek and having a Gamestop section at each store. We&#x27;ll see if the new guy has any ideas like that.')
