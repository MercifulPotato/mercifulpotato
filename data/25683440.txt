Sounds crazy and slow and unintuitive, but byte operations on a buffer are way faster than charCodeAt() function calls on a string and this more than made up for the upfront recoding. This came the closest to the &quot;null cipher&quot; imaginary competitor I had, close enough within a few percent, of all the prototypes I tried, so I submitted...')
