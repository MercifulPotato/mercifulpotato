The last time I had to use target disk mode was when the macOS Mojave installer corrupted my fusion drive, in such a way that the host would panic on boot. I was able to save it with target disk mode and a second mac. That machine was not able to enter its own recovery mode, so I don&#x27;t see how it could have been repaired with this new SMB scheme.')
