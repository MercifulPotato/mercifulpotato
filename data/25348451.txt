If the state controls Ant group, that would mean IPO was planned by the state, and you may already know Chinese government do regular long term plans, this incident wouldn&#x27;t happen, also, it won&#x27;t even happen in this way. It would be Ant group withdraw its IPO application instead. I won&#x27;t say any business is fully independent in any country in this age. I am also not claiming Chinese business can be as independent as in US. It is definitely not state-owned as GP suggested.')
