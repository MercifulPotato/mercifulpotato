You have to pay the corporate income tax this year; you can generally defer the capital gains tax for arbitrary amount of time with some structuring to avoid any taxable event; there&#x27;s some overhead involved so it&#x27;s not for small amounts of capital gain, and you need control over the corporate structure, you can&#x27;t do it for capital gains on 0.001% or Apple; however, if you&#x27;d have 0% tax on company profits and capital gains at 40%, then all the billionaires would be paying essentially zero taxes.')
