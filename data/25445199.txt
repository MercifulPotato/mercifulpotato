Item(by='wcarron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608139132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444769, text='&gt; OP’s acknowledgment is not entirely valid - their business models don’t rely on ads per se. Rather the nature of capital and free markets leads to them being snuffed out by bigger ones.<p>As the OP, I would argue against this. I don&#x27;t fully understand what you mean by the &#x27;nature of capital and free markets&#x27; unless that&#x27;s just a fancy term for &#x27;the rich get richer&#x27;.<p>Let&#x27;s take... idk a knitting business for example. A single entreprenuer knits and sells hats. In no way, shape, or form, does successfully selling knit items require tracking people from all over the nation&#x2F;state&#x2F;city, and all the small personal details of their lives, in order to sell them hats.<p>This is not to say advertising is not essential&#x2F;important. But there are many options: A) cold-calls B) networking your friends&#x2F;family C) print and post flyers D) Post on your personal&#x2F;business social media accts E) have your own website F) Rent a billboard G) pay for space in magazines&#x2F;newspapers H) try in-person sales, and so on and so forth.<p>This winner-take-all mentality is bizarre. Just because carhartt, for example, will always sell more hats than &quot;Nina Knitter Co.&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean she can&#x27;t run a successful business.<p>Running a successful small business has never and will never require invading the privacy of your potential customers. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a morally bankrupt POS.<p>Edit: To better address the quoted text: These businesses DO rely on ads, and that is entirely of their own making and their unwillingness to choose other avenues of growth&#x2F;advertising that are not exploitatative on such a massive scale. AND, if they have explored those options and found that it is not profitable to do so, then they are complicit in the theft and violation of privacy.')
