Item(by='gfodor', descendants=None, kids=[25399585], score=None, time=1607791080, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399361, text='OK, lets say that we find ourselves in a situation (again, God forbid) where the Democrats have secured all levers of power in response to a small violent uprising, and the mechanism was not through a vote but through a legal process which barred Republicans from the government.<p>What do you think happens if half of the country sees that government as illegitimate, including many members of the military? Governments aren&#x27;t magic. They exist only if enough people see them as legitimate. The scenario you outline, as supported by polling data, implies to me approximately a third of the country would reject this outright as a legitimate government, with a high bias towards the military.<p>Are you really thinking this through? Do you know how easy it would be for there to be a guerilla war in the US, which is organized in part by military defectors? All it would take would be for enough belief that the country&#x27;s goverment had become tyrannical. This is exactly the premise of the two prior situations where Americans mobilized for war on our own soil. The scenario you outline is precisely the situation that most strong supporters of the second amendment believe it was created for, and why they exercise it - to provide a deterrence and eventually, if needed, a mechanism to overthrow a tyrannical government.')
