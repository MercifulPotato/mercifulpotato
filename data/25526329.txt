Just read about Orson Welles first.<p>Interesting. About 10 years ago I was tired of modern cinema and completely stopped watching new films. After some pause I decided to start watching classic cinema from 1930 onward in more or less chronological order (in the last year i&#x27;ve stopped at ~1800 movies, up to 1995).<p>In general, the quality of 1932-1942 american cinema (and, to a lesser degree, 1945-1950) far exceeded my expectations. And, while Citizen Kane is a very good film and deserves to be seen (it was actually one of the few &quot;critically acclaimed&quot; classic films that I&#x27;ve actually enjoyed), but when seen in context of what was filmed at the time, Citizen Kane doesn&#x27;t really stand out among its contemporaries that much. A lot of technical details (but not all) that are praised by modern critics were more or less a common thing back at the time. I&#x27;d argue that Kane wasn&#x27;t even the best film of the 1941 year (Sullivan&#x27;s Travel was better and H.M. Pulham, Esq its equal) and definitely not the best film of the 1930-1950 &quot;golden age&quot; that ended at a very high point with Sunset Blvd. before plunging into the abyss in 1950s.<p>That&#x27;s all of course only my opinion.<p>On a related note, if you enjoyed Citizen Kane, I&#x27;d highly recommend to see a soviet film from 1962 Nine Days in One Year. One of the most visually stunning b&#x2F;w films in my experience. Thematically different, but stylistically very similar.')
