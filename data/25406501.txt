A typical MOSFET is abundantly capable of switching several amps of current, orders of magnitude more than you&#x27;ll find in a USB system.<p>Also, an SSR (whether MOSFET, IGBT, triac, or SCR based) doesn&#x27;t latch either. Only some esoteric mechanical relays latch.<p>I had a similar requirement to OP, though my USB hardware was fine, it was a third party device that would sometimes fail to connect when the system restarted. A watchdog reset of the uC trivially reconnected my hardware, but I resorted to enabling&#x2F;disabling the AHCI driver to force Windows to re-enumerate USB devices to get that to be reliable.')
