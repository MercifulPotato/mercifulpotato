Instead of technocratic experts, there were priests who claimed a monopoly on truthiness. Members of the laity or even academics like Galileo were declared heretics when they diverged from official truths.<p>Ah this trope again. I am just gonna post this for a more complete picture:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nature.com&#x2F;soapboxscience&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nature.com&#x2F;soapboxscience&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;science-ow...</a><p>&gt; Admittedly, Galileo was put on trial for claiming it is a fact that the Earth goes around the sun, rather than just a hypothesis as the Catholic Church demanded. Still, historians have found that even his trial was as much a case of papal egotism as scientific conservatism. It hardly deserves to overshadow all the support that the Church has given to scientific investigation over the centuries.<p>&gt; That support took several forms. One was simply financial. Until the French Revolution, the Catholic Church was the leading sponsor of scientific research. Starting in the Middle Ages, it paid for priests, monks and friars to study at the universities. The church even insisted that science and mathematics should be a compulsory part of the syllabus. And after some debate, it accepted that Greek and Arabic natural philosophy were essential tools for defending the faith. By the seventeenth century, the Jesuit order had become the leading scientific organisation in Europe, publishing thousands of papers and spreading new discoveries around the world. The cathedrals themselves were designed to double up as astronomical observatories to allow ever more accurate determination of the calendar. And of course, modern genetics was founded by a future abbot growing peas in the monastic garden.')
