Context: I&#x27;ve used both React and Angular extensively on a variety of applications, for startups and the most &quot;enterprisey&quot; of entities claiming to be enterprisey (the government) <i>and</i> came from a .NET background prior.<p>First - GRRR.  What defined this as an &quot;enterprise&quot; app?  Facebook is an enterprise app, dude, with millions of transactions a day.  Just because an app is big doesn&#x27;t make it an &quot;enterprise&quot; app.<p>architect was hired from outside to create a proposal for a team that had no one capable of operating in that role (and apparently the CTO as well)<p>&quot;He already has a development partner in India, but they lack experience in building web applications.&quot;  - this is a massive red flag<p>architect was sent away to do proposals without anyone talking to the development team to get <i>any</i> buy-in<p>architect got the background of the dev team from the CTO but neither architect or CTO talked to the development team (who would be implementing) prior to doing a proposal<p>&quot;the technical lead ambushes me&quot; - this is the first time the tech lead and the &quot;architect&quot; interacted.  There&#x27;s no &quot;ambush&quot; here; it&#x27;s a failing on the CTO+architect&#x27;s part to communicate to the team in advance, and perhaps at least involve the team lead<p>CTO is against angular but his outsourced team is familiar with .NET and Java; why is there even a need for an &quot;outside architect&quot; to make this choice when it&#x27;s only between React and Angular?<p>&quot;the CTO is backing his team, which is normal. He had known me for just two months, while he had been working with his team for many years.&quot; - Why is no one on the CTO&#x27;s team, after many years, capable of investigating and making these decisions?  Why did they need to go outside?   If the plan was to continue using this outsourced team, why didn&#x27;t anyone invest in their training to be self-sufficient vs a direction from on high?  Why was there zero training plan?<p>&quot;And thatâ€™s how we end up with three ways of doing things. There is no consistency anymore.&quot;  Where is the CTO during all of this?')
