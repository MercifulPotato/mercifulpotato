The new data further reveals a stronger link between, indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer.<p>The biggest take away for me has been that the immune system has to work overtime to clear out the lungs. Give your lungs a break and let a filter clean the air, not your lungs and immune system.')
