All a screen reader will announce is &quot;image&quot; plus the alt text, you cannot navigate any of the text inside the SVG when it&#x27;s embedded with &lt;img&gt;. I was always surprised that noone ever talks about this with regard to SVG badges in readmes.\nYou can if it&#x27;s embedded with &lt;object&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt; though, but GitHub doesn&#x27;t allow that in markdown (just like they don&#x27;t allow many useful things like &lt;video&gt;, forcing people to use GIFs instead). &lt;iframe&gt; actually being the more secure option here because you can disallow all scripts using &lt;iframe sandbox&gt; (and GitHub could easily enforce that). &lt;iframes&gt; still can&#x27;t stretch to the content though without using JS even in 2020.')
