I take your point that batteries are a better option for personal automotive applications. However, there are other applications where hydrogen <i>does</i> have advantages. In those cases, using &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen (A) kick-starts the technology, because it is currently cheaper than &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen (B) is carbon-neutral if done correctly.<p>For instance, consider how a renewable-heavy grid relies on gas turbines to step in when there is a &#x27;drought&#x27; in renewable production. Using &#x27;blue&#x27; hydrogen to replace the natural gas for those turbines would immediately get a fully reliable, zero-carbon-emission grid. Then as renewable prices continue to fall, &#x27;green&#x27; hydrogen can close the loop &amp; eliminate fossil fuels altogether.')
