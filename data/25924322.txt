Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611721919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25924163, text='&gt; The First Amendment to the Constitution explicitly forbids &quot;Congress&quot; from &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot; It goes no further.<p>True but meaningless; the text goes no further than that, as to freedom of speech -- actually, it doesn&#x27;t even go that far[1] -- but the amendment does go much further than that. For example, it is considered to be binding on the states through &quot;incorporation&quot; under the 14th amendment.<p>[1] The text prohibits Congress from <i>making laws</i> which abridge the freedom of speech. This is one reason I don&#x27;t really understand the argument that the first amendment should protect Trump from being impeached over a speech which is unquestionably protected by the first amendment -- the legislative power and the impeachment power are two separate grants of authority.')
