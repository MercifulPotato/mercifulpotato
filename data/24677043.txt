Try this:<p><pre><code>  echo $’foo\\0bar’\n</code></pre>\nIt prints “foo”.<p>So practically you can’t have null bytes in bash strings, as it will be mistaken for the terminating null of the underlying C string.<p>In your example read -d ‘’ would work just the same; actually that’s the idiomatic way to iterate on zero-delimited input (or xargs -0). Why does the empty string work? Because -d takes the first char of the string as the delimiter, which for empty C strings is the terminating \\0 - this is how bugs become features.')
