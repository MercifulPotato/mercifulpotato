That&#x27;s a Java game I&#x27;ve submitted bugfixes to, like fixing multiplayer, in just a few hours, despite having barely any Java experience, because it&#x27;s so debuggable and ordinarily architected.<p>&gt; But itâ€™s really challenging reaching that point.<p>Choosing opinionated and well supported languages &amp; frameworks is essentially the lesson there, and they&#x27;ll probably finish that in one week.<p>The real difference here is that this course does not aspire to cram leetcode, which is what you&#x27;re actually evaluated on if you get into Software Engineering. In that framing, they are adopting an extremely contrarian and risky position: if their students perform worse in job hunts after taking the course, and entrepreneurial &#x2F; indie &#x2F; artisanal software development remains hit-driven, students would conclude the course is bad in the long run.')
