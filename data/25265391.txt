Imagine you could deploy code to this machine, and it would be guaranteed to execute in a publicly verifiable way, and nobody could change it or modify it (unless you get several influential people to agree to a fork that changes the rules).<p>I think that&#x27;s basically Ethereum.<p>Oh, also imagine that instead of costing money directly, you instead have to pay somebody to run their car engine at full speed while up on blocks in a garage. Oh, and if they ever stop revving their car engine, somebody else might rev their engines faster&#x2F;more and then they can steal all your money.<p>Edit: Apparently ETH 2.0 has reduced the amount of pointless engine-revving.')
