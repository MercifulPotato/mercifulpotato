I grew up in a small-ish town in Appalachia, and when I ran out of math classes to take in high school I started learning to program. They had put together a little &quot;computer lab&quot; circa 1990 when cash was a little easier to come by for a public school, and hadn&#x27;t updated them since.<p>It was 2004, and their intro programming course was still taught in Pascal. We hacked on a version of Turbo Pascal that might have dated to when the Soviet Union still existed, and I remember that cheery blue terminal interface fondly. It left me with an irrational life-long love of text-based interfaces.')
