Most PMs remind me of that scene from Office Space: &quot;Engineers are not good at dealing with customers. I have people skills!&quot;. There&#x27;s no need to insulate engineers from the products they work on and the customers they work for. Good engineers want ownership, let them have it.<p>A big part of the problem in my experience is that PMs tend to proliferate. I&#x27;ve seen many startups go from hiring their first &quot;product&quot; person to suddenly having a PM team that&#x27;s a third the size of engineering.')
