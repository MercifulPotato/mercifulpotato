The problem is how we got more reliable pcs today is in the context of people who had access to both. Some generation in the future won&#x27;t have access to living human beings for the day the first electronic computer came into existence as we ourselves have access to now.<p>Notice I said &quot;even if left untouched.&quot; Perhaps that was too charitable, as these retropcs, without memory protection, would often crash if metaphorically &quot;touched.&quot; It would happen often with productivity apps, much less so with games. As time has gone on with pcs, this seems to have flipped, a fair trade for the time being.')
