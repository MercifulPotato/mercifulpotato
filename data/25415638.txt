Especially the &quot;mixing&quot; part is important. There seems to be a common mindset that - eventually - one or few languages will &quot;win&quot;, and all existing software will be rewritten in the handful &quot;winning&quot; languages. But old languages never die, they become part of the bedrock that other new languages will be built upon. A successful new language must integrate well with old code, not replace it.')
