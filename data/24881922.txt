Nobody was endangered, the patient was just put in a heck of a lot of pain because the doctor assumed they were lying or wrong and it wasn&#x27;t even worth checking, because their pain didn&#x27;t matter that much to the doctor.<p>The hospital is a PRIME place for systems meant to avoid mistakes. (Although your example with checklists and pilots is odd; the checklist IS such a system, a remarkably successful one. And over the last 10 years, is used more often in hospitals too. I guess you <i>could</i> say that every checklist should have TWO people check it off or something, but it&#x27;s such successful technology at reducing mistakes I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen this suggested).<p>But no system can make up for doctors who don&#x27;t respect patients or care about their pain.')
