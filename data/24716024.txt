Having experienced now some modest amount of self-acceptance, I’ve found that one good marker of it is empowerment.<p>Do you feel like you’re standing on a reliable foundation, and able to exert some leverage to achieve your goals? Or do you feel that you’re best off not striving? Those look like two opposite ends of a spectrum to me.<p>For me, self-acceptance leads directly to empowerment.
