If your adult partner works late a lot, then you should not worry when your adult partner  is coming late. It is very safe to assume that your partner is working late again. In this case, the partner A seems to have too much anxiety or obsession regarding normal schedule of partner B.<p>I mean this 100%. Healthy relationships do not require &quot;ceding authority over own schedule&quot; nor non-stop tracking.
