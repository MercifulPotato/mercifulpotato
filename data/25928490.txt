Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611756969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926246, text='&gt; <i>in any situation and on any public or private property, is far more destructive in my opinion.</i><p>I think this is perhaps a straw man. Nobody is asking to protect unrestricted speech in all private venues.<p>Would it be so bad to make it illegal for large services that have private DMs to snoop&#x2F;censor those, such as we do presently for large services that have private telephone calls?<p>The dichotomy isn&#x27;t public&#x2F;private. The phone company is private and they aren&#x27;t allowed to tap your phone (unless they&#x27;re doing it for the government), and they&#x27;re not allowed to shut off your service because you called members of the &quot;wrong&quot; political party too often.')
