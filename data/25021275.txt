Fixing any errors* and for N=2 (2K prints), the times for some of the languages (running ten times and taking the average) are:<p><pre><code>  C    0.24s (gcc 9.3.0, gcc $file)\n  C++  0.96s (gcc 9.3.0, g++ $file)\n  Go   0.12s (go 1.15.2, go build $file)\n  Nim  0.44s (nim 1.2.6, nim c $file)\n  V    1.37s (v 0.1.29, v $file)\n  Zig  16.9s (zig 0.6.0, zig build-exe $file)\n</code></pre>\nI guess Zig does some optimizations but not sure how to turn them off. Someone should do an analytical comparison for all of them and different values of N.<p>*The generated V test doesn&#x27;t work with the latest version as `;` between expressions throws a bad token error and zig requires `a` to be `.{a}`.')
