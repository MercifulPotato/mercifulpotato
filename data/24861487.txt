You need to build a war chest. Once you&#x27;ve burnt through any carried loss, which happened pretty quickly in our case, we are taxed on the profit we are retaining in order to build up a cash reserve.<p>That cash reserve is needed if we&#x27;re to self fund big projects and in case of down-turn, lawsuit or other unforeseen event if we are to avoid immediately laying people off.<p>The alternative is to raise money which dilutes founders and employees who own stock or vested options.<p>You won&#x27;t encounter this issue if you&#x27;re early stage or if you are &quot;going for growth&quot; by running at a loss and raising money in successive rounds. But it is a huge problem if you are a self funding small or medium sized business.')
