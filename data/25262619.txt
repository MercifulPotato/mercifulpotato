They both showed with extremely low levels of vitamin D and have since started taking 2000 IU daily to try and increase their levels. It&#x27;s so cheap and easy that everyone should be doing it right now. Even if you don&#x27;t want to get your blood tested, I think going on a supplement _now_ is right for everyone. But I guess each person should consult their doctor if they&#x27;re concerned.')
