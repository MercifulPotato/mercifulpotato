With reasonable care, and luck in avoiding damage from above (e.g. trees), tile roofs could last 300 years or more.<p>Slate varies depending on the region it comes from - Pennsylvania slate tends to suffer badly from freeze&#x2F;thaw action, but some from New England can match the 200 year lifetime associated with Welsh slate. Similarly for stone.<p>It is absolutely the case that these materials are not widely used in US construction. But they have lifetimes that more closely match the expected life of even a moderately well-built stud frame house.<p>Metal roofing is rapidly gaining ground in some parts of the USA, and has a theoretical lifetime even beyond tile or slate. Unfortunately poor initial installs in many cases shortens the real-world life to something closer to high-end asphalt shingles.<p>The appliance&#x2F;panel comparison strikes me as apt in some ways, but not in others. While removing&#x2F;replacing roof-mounted solar might be approaching ease of replacement that is in the same ballpark as a typical stove, refridgerator, washing machine, water heater or furnace, it is necessarily more laborious and more dangerous work, and involves a component that to all effects and purposes is totally passive.<p>I wasn&#x27;t commenting on the payoff time, but on the notion that we should be installing this relatively short-lived equipment everywhere we possibly can.')
