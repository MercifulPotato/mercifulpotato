Now the whole country is warned as explicitly as possible,  most probably even with legal consequences to those who act against:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;exclusive-vaccine-wont-free-self-165612950.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.yahoo.com&#x2F;exclusive-vaccine-wont-free-self-1656...</a><p>As you ask what my proposal is:<p>1) You should apologize for spreading the beliefs that can put people in danger and stop doing that.<p>2) Understand what&#x27;s currently scientifically known, and avoid spreading misinformation.<p>3) Regarding what the policy should be: allow the science to do its work instead promoting measures or beliefs that can put people in danger.
