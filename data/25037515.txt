Maybe that&#x27;s actually a great example of core of the problem at hand!<p>You&#x27;re trying to argue a conclusion based on the specific word &quot;donor&quot;, but many of these &quot;donors&quot; (or in this thread&#x27;s case potential &quot;donor&quot;) don&#x27;t see themselves that way; they are not interested in &quot;donating&quot; with no strings, it seems like they are more interested in &quot;patronage&quot; or some sort of &quot;sponsoring&quot;, where their money is not no-strings, but instead conditional on some specific threshold of level&#x2F;quality of support&#x2F;service.<p>Perhaps we just need a bit richer vocabulary for these discussions; if the project author is only interested in unconditional donations, that&#x27;s their prerogative, and you&#x27;re free to fork or fund accordingly. But also recognize that at the margin, &quot;donate with no strings&quot; is a much tougher sell for enterprises than &quot;patronage will buy you X quality of service&quot;.<p>So if you&#x27;re actually making an effort to turn an open-source project into revenue, I think you&#x27;ll probably need to listen to your potential customers&#x2F;patrons a bit more and give them the assurances they are looking for. Again, any open source author is free to do as they please! But as the GP notes, bringing money into the situation complicates things, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable or rational to expect companies to start throwing donations your way without listening to what they want to get in return.')
