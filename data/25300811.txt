I&#x27;ve noticed it with my mother and my girlfriend (separate entities for the record) when I got them a macbook when their windows-based laptops almost died: they couldn&#x27;t get used to clicking and pointing with the same finger, and fell back to their old habits of having a finger on the bottom left of the pad, and clicking that finger if they wanted to click&#x2F;drag something.<p>So it kind-of knows what to ignore and what not to ignore &#x2F; recognise intent of the user trying to do this.<p>When you combine this with &quot;bottom right click = right mouse button&quot; you basically have what you want!')
