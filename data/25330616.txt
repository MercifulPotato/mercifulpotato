I know, this comes from the guy, whos website suffered the HN hug of death, but, look, I could bring it back up within 10 minutes.<p>My suggestion is, to build it as easy as possible, ideally with AWS or something like that, where you can throw computing power at it in a matter of minutes, when needed.<p>Build the stuff first, worry about scalability later, when you actually have proven that you need to worry about it. That&#x27;s the lesson from my first startup anyways. We made the server slick and scalable, but in the end noone cared, because the product didn&#x27;t meet demand. Don&#x27;t waste your time on prematurley optimizing. Just my two cents :)')
