I&#x27;ve started occasionally wearing a night guard while sleeping, and not really minding the decreased libido since dating during a global pandemic is outside of my acceptable risk tolerance.<p>I&#x27;ve also taken Lexapro and had good results with that, too.<p>The benefits are I was able to actually feel pleasure and enjoy things again. At my worst I was suffering from severe anhedonia -- literally finding no pleasure in any activity. Nothing I previously enjoyed brought any modicum of happiness: not food, not sex, not exercise, not work or side projects. It&#x27;s a dangerous state to be in because when literally nothing in life brings joy you can slip into destructive choices.<p>The benefits of feeling better vastly outweighed any minor side effects of antidepressants.<p>There are some people, especially teenagers, who can become suicidal when taking antidepressants. But it&#x27;s very rare and your psychiatrist will help you find a drug that doesn&#x27;t cause those feelings.')
