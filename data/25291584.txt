The price of the land the house sits on might increase, depending on where it is.<p>Land prices in very, very few areas have increased sufficiently to match a risk adjusted return (or even the nominal return) of a broad market index fund, such as VOO or VTI.  Especially considering the liabilities and ongoing maintenance costs with owning housing structures.<p>The labor adjusted return is far better too, you spend minutes and a few clicks investing in an index fund, versus hours and days on real estate.')
