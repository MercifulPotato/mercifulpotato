The fact is, no one knows. Because it&#x27;s up to the market.<p>youre right in that no one, least of all me, can predict future stock prices, but i think youre missing the point. even if GME stabilizes at $150 - which is an unlikely tripling of value - most of the people involved are going to lose most of their investment.<p>the fundamental principal is that a short-squeeze HAS to end in a pricing crash. its the whole mechanism by which the squeeze occurs in the first place. the final price isnt really relevant, the point is that most people have to absorb large losses by definition. I think a lot of the players dont understand this; they think its free money, and are gonna scream bloody murder because they think they only lost because RH did something illegal. RH actions are irrelevant, legal or not, because the trade was bad in the first place.<p>the only way this doesnt happen is if the original market was wrong about GME to the tune of 1000%. maybe the short squeeze happens and GME never crashes, it peaks and stays at $350 and then beats the S&amp;P 500 by 10% YoY for the next decade and everyone that bought long just makes money. if you believe that then well, good luck.')
