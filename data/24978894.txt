This way service A which needs to communicate with service B can just pull service-client-B into the project and call its methods. Most verification&#x2F;errorhandling&#x2F;transport is abstracted away in the service-client library. This library usually also includes model&#x2F;dto classes.<p>This approach only works well if most of your services are using the same language (and sometimes framework).')
