It’s nearly impossible to justify spending money on any other laptop. Unfortunately, I just can’t get past the single external display limitation. I did see there is a DisplayLink workaround to get multiple external displays working, but the performance of DisplayLink is not great and requires purchasing a dock.<p>It’s frustrating because I want to buy a M1 laptop, and the display support is a complete dealbreaker.<p>Assuming Apple addresses the display support in the M2 laptops, they’ll be an insta-buy for me.')
