MAC registration came in handy several times for locating stolen laptops and phones.  I think there may have been an exception for devices that couldn&#x27;t auth but it could have been a different vlan and probably port.<p>We also had adaptive password expiration and complexity policies based on length.  If you used a passphrase (~15+ characters) you could use dictionary words but if it was under that you couldnâ€™t and had to include a number and symbol too.<p>Passphrases had like a 90 or 180 day expiration.  Passwords were I think 30?  You set them in the same text box and the rules were based on your entry.<p>I think the lockouts had a timer with an exponential increase.  You&#x27;d get like five or ten tries before you&#x27;d have to start waiting minutes for the next attempt.  Not sure if there was a hard lockout option.  Phone support was daytime hours in the main office, all times when labs were open (some labs were 24 hour) and email support was 24&#x2F;7.  24&#x2F;7 lab monitors worked the ticket queues as well.<p>It was a great department actually.  Lots of great work being done to make things easier for students.  Relied heavily on students to operate the department and gave a lot of people careers.<p>Back in the 90s a student wrote a ticket management app in Perl.  The university hired him and he was still in the department writing code 20 years later when I was there.  One of the techs I worked with was hired by the law school to handle their IT.  I got several jobs including my first out of school through people I met and worked with there.')
