Which may be caused by the same three issues:<p>1. Doctors afraid of being litigated by patients, doing unnecessary treatments and paying costly insurance.<p>2. Corruption and bribery leading to things like Medicare being unable to negotiate drug prices and doctors prescribing addictive opioids to the tune of billions of dollars.<p>3. Inverted competition: Hospitals run a for-profit business while patients will prefer the best and most expensive service they&#x2F;their insurance affords them. Who chooses a treatment based on price when your health is at stake? Also, somehow, drug prices are much higher than anywhere else, even completely generic stuff like insulin.<p>Nobody looses, except everyone else')
