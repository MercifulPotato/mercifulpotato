If someone you consider &quot;him&quot; asks you to refer to them as &quot;her&quot; it&#x27;s like someone asking you to call them by their full name &quot;Rebecca&quot; instead of &quot;Becky&quot; or &quot;Jonathan&quot; instead of &quot;Jon&quot;. If you like and respect them, you do as they request because things which matter to them matter to you, and being polite to them is important to you. If you ignore what they ask, call them what you want, you communicate that you don&#x27;t respect them and don&#x27;t want to be polite, that you want to dominate and &#x27;win&#x27; instead.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>Pronouns can mean whatever you want them to mean</i>&quot;<p>Only one way. A specific person asking you to use a specific pronoun for themselves is wildly different from you unilaterally and universally saying that all women should feel included by the word &quot;him&quot; because &quot;him&quot; has no meaning anymore.')
