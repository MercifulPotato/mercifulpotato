Beyond securing uninterrupted access to GNSS for Europe and taking away US&#x27;s leverage, it also grants EU a seat at the table for some decisions the US would rather take unilaterally. With a working GPS alternative, the next time US wants to invade someone, they won&#x27;t be able to cut off <i>their</i> GNSS capacity unless they get the EU (and, I guess, Russia) to cooperate.<p>That said, I&#x27;m yet to hear of a large contractor that cares, no matter how critical a project. Private market to me feels, in general, like the school system: with standardized testing and modern curricula, we get consistent but mediocre results, but we achieve that by filtering out anyone who cares about anything other than gaming the system.')
