If you press Ctrl+Alt+F2 &#x2F; F3, you can switch between the login screen and the current desktop.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is the default or if I did something to enable it, though. It could be this only happens if you use the &quot;switch user without logging out&quot; function.<p>Coincidentially, Windows does something similar a lot. UAC prompts run on a different Desktop which is completely separate, the log in screen is separate, as well as the secure attention screen (what you get when you press Ctrl-Alt-Del).')
