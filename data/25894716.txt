I&#x27;m not familiar at all with this &quot;InfoSec Handbook&quot; group but what I&#x27;d like to see at some point is a software platform that allows organizations to spin up fedi presences at their own domain (Write.as does this, but it&#x27;d be nice to have other players in the ecosystem), or even if traditional SaaS vendors would just adopt the underlying W3C protocols to allow for that.')
