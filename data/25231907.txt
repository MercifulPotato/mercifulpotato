I got downvoted for pointing out someone was insulting him rather than criticising the essay.<p>Which leads me to say - I don&#x27;t think HN is particularly fanboish towards PG. His recent essays have been mixed in quality, and certainly not up to Hackers and Painters (which I just reread for the third time) and I do feel that HN has thoroughly called that out. There are nuggets of wisdom but also signs of how difficult it can be to write generally when your life paths constricts you somewhat.<p>I really don&#x27;t see a groupthink towards hero worship. Ironically, it seems the entrepreneur and nerdish need to be contrarian is at work here - looking to push back against PG, and somewhat justifiably so. And I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;d be the first to appreciate the need for that.')
