Most importantly, no advertising since they actually make money off the products, which means no incentive for gaming engagement metrics. They want you to have a good time and sell you another device next year, not glue your eyeballs to the screen.<p>Since there is no “Apple social network” to be spoken of, there would be little reason to include them.')
