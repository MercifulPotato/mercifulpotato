From what I read and if I remember correctly, different studies say somewhere between half and a third of the people did not report LOST while they did have other symptoms (there are also completely asymptomatic cases of course, but that&#x27;s iirc more like 1&#x2F;5 to 1&#x2F;10 of young people). Even if you have no LOST, the model can return positive, despite LOST being very characteristic.<p>I don&#x27;t know why male&#x2F;female or age matters, my best guess is that the younger males in their sample were more likely to have a positive test result. That seems like a pattern which would shift over time as the media claims different age groups cause it, different measures are taken, etc., but I&#x27;m not really qualified to question their results or change the model without (new, or so much as the original) data.')
