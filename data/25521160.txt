If not, wordpress is huge, complicated mess to extend and it is PHP not Python.<p>On the other hand, I found Flask to be dead simple. The website will get you started. You certainly don&#x27;t need a course or a tutor to get going.<p>Django, once you get the hang of how the scaffolding works, is also fairly easy to use. It did take me a weekend of google-ing and head scratching to figure it out though. The Django docs and community is not as easy to work with as flask.<p>On the surface of things, collecting data from the twitter api and displaying it with related data from a database is not overly complex (as long as you are looking at a reasonable number of tweets).<p>VERY important though, you absolutely cannot publicly redisplay a tweet yourself, even if you have collected the details of it from the api. You ABSOLUTLY must use one of the Twitter widgets to do so. Do anything else and you are just asking for your project to be shut down.')
