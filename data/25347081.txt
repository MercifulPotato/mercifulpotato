Item(by='ransom_rs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607443694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346601, text='&gt; This is what I&#x27;m talking about. How do you KNOW that $other_headphones sound better? The Apple model isn&#x27;t even available yet.<p>I feel this part of the discussion is missing. A lot of people seem to love the HomePod for it&#x27;s great audio quality at the price, and I have heard similar things for the HomePod Mini. Apple seems to be getting decent at making high quality audio equipment(per $), I feel like the quality of these headphones could be similar to the competition.<p>Apple for sure has a history of overcharging for certain products (remember, you can get a monitor stand for $1k), but the M1 Macbook Air is probably the best $1,000 computer by a long shot.')
