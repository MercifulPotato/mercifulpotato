At the very least YouTube itself is an advertising platform... people buy ads <i>on YouTube</i> and those ads pay for the massive computing and storage running it. People don&#x27;t buy ads to put <i>in your personal photos</i> and having a bigger training set than the next guy isn&#x27;t enough of an advantage to pay for all your disks. Cloud photos may be smaller than YouTube but it&#x27;s not small enough to &quot;fall in the cracks&quot; and get funded with spare capacity from running other &quot;real&quot; services, it&#x27;s undoubtedly got real, <i>proper</i> funding which is justified because of how it positions Android in relation to iPhone, and how it positions the Google ecosystem within Android.<p>In other words, Google wants Android phones to use the Play Store, and free storage on Google Photos is part of the carrot.')
