Roche and other companies have had a lot of smart people working on this problem.<p>Increasing coverage will definitely help resolve these errors, but the coverage required may be such that it&#x27;s more cost effective to use a more traditional sequencer.<p></i>A homopolymer is when you have stretches of the same nucleotide, and the error is miscounting the number of them. e.g: GAAAC could be called as &quot;GAAC&quot; or &quot;GAAAAC&quot; or even &quot;GAAAAAAAC&quot;.')
