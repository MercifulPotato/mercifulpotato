Of course MS dis not ship one, and of course X is considered deprecated by its own maintainers.<p>But de facto it is more a lack of support as in &quot;we don&#x27;t ship or own implementation yet&quot; than &quot;explicitely it does not work&quot;. It works already, Wayland just takes more effort  and is just way more coupled to all parts of the stacks, as usual (but don&#x27;t get me wrong, this sometimes has benefits too)')
