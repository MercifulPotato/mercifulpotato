For me, it is 300 points or more per day.<p>Yes, a few years back they changed the points ratio on that end. It used to take about 500 points to get a $5 gift card and now it is 5250 points.<p>But they also fiddled with things on the other end.<p>At least for me. Maybe Bill Gates likes me or something and told his people &quot;Make sure that pathetic homeless woman can earn $10 per month as my generous gift to her.&quot;<p>I earn a $5 gift card about once every two weeks-ish. I&#x27;m poor enough that matters to me, so it is something I am very aware of. That $5 gift card is sometimes still all the money I have for the day, though I&#x27;m less desperately poor than when I was homeless.<p>I don&#x27;t know what else to tell you. Your info sounds out of date to me, but ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯.')
