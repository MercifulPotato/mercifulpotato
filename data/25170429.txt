Evaluating &quot;value&quot; of an engineer is also a topic of itself. At the end of the day, this is a team sport. even when a certain project is super successful (and in some cases it might take few month to see business impact) it&#x27;s not always easy to know how much each individual in the team contributed to this success. BTW - same is true for failure.')
