Ever since the advent of agriculture, income inequality has been on the rise. The Belle Epoch in France was the peak of that - then revolutions, World Wars, and Socialism happened. Once that civil unrest stopped, the trend continued back up.</i><p>Its worth noting that large scale disasters (of all sorts) were <i>always</i> great equalizers, a countervailing force to rising inequality. In general, the more you had to lose, the more you lost.<p>We&#x27;ve been getting better at preventing or coping with a lot of these things like plagues, famines, and so on, but we&#x27;ve become even better at insulating accumulated wealth from being destroyed by them (including by financial crises), by privatizing gains and socializing losses.<p>I have a feeling that we&#x27;ve entered a new period of larger scale social unrest <i>and</i> natural disasters which may or may not significantly destroy and&#x2F;or redistribute wealth to level the playing field again somewhat.')
