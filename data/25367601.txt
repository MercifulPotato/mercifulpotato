I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s argument here hinged on such a distinction. If it did, and to that extent, it&#x27;s relevant. But the heartland of this whole conversation has to do with a conception of speech as a principle that&#x27;s broader than just U.S. law.<p>So we should be clear about the extent to which this is, or isn&#x27;t, speaking to the conversation that everyone else is having.')
