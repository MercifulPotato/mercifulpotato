If cloud is their Softlayer acquisition, I am not impressed.<p>I would love to see them build out a real cloud solution, perhaps even using datacenters full of their z15&#x27;s.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone competing with that on commodity hardware in terms of deployment speed and connectivity speed between instances in the same location. It would be crazy expensive though and I doubt they would ever consider it and someone at IBM would have to write a web interface &#x2F; API into the system that mimics the options of all the current cloud providers.')
