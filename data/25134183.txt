I did the same, without having a degree. Telling companies why you fit and why they should hire you has a huge effect, especially if you compete with people who come from a university with a degree in their pocket.<p>Explaining a company why you are a great fit and directly write the responsible person in HR shows, that you:<p>1. Did not blindly sent out hundreds of applications\n2. Gathered information about what the company does and evaluate your fit in consideration of your skillset\n3. Contact the right person<p>The 2. point is the most important one. Now, where I am in the position of hiring people, I would gladly take someone who tells me, thoughtful reasons of why we should hire him. But also don&#x27;t underestimate the 3. point. Don&#x27;t message the head of HR or similar persons. Instead write the people who will potentially be your lead.<p>But it also depends where you apply. A big corporation? A startup? Government? Something else?<p>The parent comment is correct regardless: Target-focus')
