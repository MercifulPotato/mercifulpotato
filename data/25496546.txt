Other countries seem to have solid solutions for &quot;socializing&quot; medicine. I can&#x27;t think of any highly functional system that is a free market. I don&#x27;t even think that one is possible without people dying in the streets.<p>The government is perfectly capable of ensuring access to a market without regulating it to death. The SNAP program (Food Stamps) is a great example of how this works in a separate market with very little elasticity in demand.')
