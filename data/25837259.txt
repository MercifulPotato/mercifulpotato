Been a programmer since the seventies (last century!). I do personal projects, freelance projects and job projects. I love programming.<p>And I would be perfectly happy for quarantine to last forever, at least as far as I am concerned.<p>The only thing I have done to adapt is that I bought an Oculus and play Beat Saber and Pistol Whip to pretend to get exercise.
