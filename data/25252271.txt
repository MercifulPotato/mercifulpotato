When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, our bandwidth demand skyrocketed. Right now we’re getting over 1.5 million daily unique visitors and storing more than 70 petabytes of data. We build and maintain all our own systems, but we don’t charge for access, sell user information, or run ads. Instead, we rely on individual generosity to fund our infrastructure; we&#x27;re powered by donations averaging $32.<p>&gt;Right now, we have a 2-to-1 Matching Gift Campaign, tripling the impact of every donation. If you find all these bits and bytes useful, please chip in.<p>&gt;—Brewster Kahle, Founder, Internet Archive')
