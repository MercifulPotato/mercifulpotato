I tried moving friend groups to signal some years ago and even managed to do that for some large ones but the group chat just didn&#x27;t really work. Keys changed and somehow the group got into a state where some people got messages and others didn&#x27;t and the only way to fix it seemed to be creating a new group which, for large groups, isn&#x27;t really an option and everyone ended up going back to whatsapp.<p>I&#x27;d love to use signal with more people but that, and the ux around changing phones means I can&#x27;t really recommend it to anyone but the most technical of my friends.')
