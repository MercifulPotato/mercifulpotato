It’s long-obsolete and needs to die. By supporting it, you help to keep it alive, which makes trouble for all of us. (“Why doesn’t your site work on IE? Their site does!”—and all of a sudden there’s pressure for you to support IE.)<p>If you don’t have any evidence that you need to support it, I strongly recommend deliberately removing support for it, whether that means just not caring if it works or not or actively breaking it (though please implement that as an IE blacklist, not a certain-browsers whitelist). If you do have evidence that you need to support it, push to remove it, even if you can’t remove it just yet. If you can stop supporting IE, it will make your life easier and it will make my life easier.')
