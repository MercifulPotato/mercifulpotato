Of course Google, FB will continue to acquire startups just fine, but the pool of acquiring money just got a bit smaller. If large companies continue to leave, they pool will get even smaller over time. I think it represents a potential problem for SV. These departures affect B2B startups so far. But, what happens if Twitter moves HQ? I remember Jack Dorsey saying the SF workforce does not reflect Twitter&#x27;s user base and he was considering to adjust that.<p>I think that talks of the wealth tax in CA, is another problem. Now that the possibility has been put forward, the high-net individuals may not be waiting around for that to happen. High-net individuals are funding a lot of startup ecosystem as well. I think that might be a problem.')
