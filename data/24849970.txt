Item(by='planetis', descendants=None, kids=[24850256], score=None, time=1603300865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849693, text='&gt; Is this a typo? I would certainly hope that a search for &quot;prolog web framework&quot; would not include results about a web framework written in Nim named &quot;Prologue&quot;<p>Unfortunately not. It&#x27;s caused by fuzzy matching and happens with other words (and languages) too. Annoying but I don&#x27;t think we should start avoiding certain words because google search (and some people apparently) can&#x27;t make the distinction.')
