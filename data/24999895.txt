I’ve been hoping that Stephenson would rewrite it with 20 years of updates.<p>It describes the landscape better than anything else I’ve found as Stephenson is a user and a great writer, I think. Most other accounts are by people who make their living in journalism, or hardware, or software.<p>Stephenson is also an example of someone who is really into computers, and programming I suspect, but has a primary goal of writing.
