Item(by='mason55', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605111740, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058952, text='IMO this argument blurs the line between two separate concepts.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say that a company shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sue you or have you arrested for doing whatever you want to a device that you have purchased.  For example, see the John Deere lawsuits where they are trying to DRM repairs to tractors and make it illegal to work on them.<p>What I think is less fair is arguing that a company has a requirement to make it easy or possible for you to work on your device.  You&#x27;re entering the world of engineering and end-user trade-offs and starting to talk about forcing companies to add or remove features that might be in the end-user&#x27;s best interest.<p>Would a screw with a proprietary screw-head be ok if the company could argue that it made assembly easier?  Would you require that they prove there is some tangible engineering benefit to all decisions?  What&#x27;s the line between &quot;general purpose computing device&quot; and &quot;electronic toy&quot;?<p>You could probably write a law that made it illegal to add restrictions whose sole purpose was to prevent the user from modifying or repairing their device but the only way you&#x27;d ever be able to enforce it is if someone was caught writing incriminating emails.  Pretty much anything could have some imaginary engineering justification behind it.<p>If you can crack a proprietary protocol or re-create a proprietary screwdriver then more power to you, you shouldn&#x27;t be arrested or sued.  But telling a company they&#x27;re not allowed to use a proprietary screw-head is a messy road to start down, and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying when you&#x27;re asking for companies to be forced to allow you to do what you want on your device.<p>Vote with your wallet and if the choice you vote for doesn&#x27;t win then you&#x27;re free to go create your own.  But don&#x27;t outlaw business models or legislate engineering choices.  You should have a right to repair, you should have a right to get your data, you shouldn&#x27;t have a right to tell me what my engineering choices need to be.')
