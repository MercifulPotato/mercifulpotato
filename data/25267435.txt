At the same time, creating task definitions for one-off tasks in ECS or similar is also kind of a weird workflow if the task is shortlived or event-driven.<p>Using an actual container orchestration platform when you need it, and a lambda to run the same container image one-off when you don&#x27;t need orchestration, feels like a best of both worlds.<p>I like the idea of &quot;serverless&quot; being more &quot;your packaged execution environment, running with no regard for the underlying host&quot; than &quot;your code, running with no regard for the underlying execution environment&quot;.<p>EDIT: Disregard.... see the AWS team&#x27;s responses in this topic for the full story, its not quite as convenient as anything packaged via standard container being able to run on Lambda')
