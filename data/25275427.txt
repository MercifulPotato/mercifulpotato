Like so many, got hooked via first-hit-is-free Azure credits. It doesn&#x27;t even run end user facing services, just does software development, yet somehow after a few years of being a startup the cloud bill was millions of dollars a year. Why: because engineers would create a fresh VM from scratch rather than just logging in and using their accounts on pre-existing VMs. They&#x27;d forget to delete resources. They&#x27;d use expensive services like managed Kubernetes because why not.<p>There was also a more subtle cost harder to account for: Azure machines are dog slow so significant engineering time was wasted trying to work around that problem.<p>There has to be some friction to push people into using pre-existing hardware instead of acquiring more. If there isn&#x27;t you end up with an absurd IT footprint well beyond anything justifiable in engineering terms.')
