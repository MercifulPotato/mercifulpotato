Its hearsay, gossip.  Or even, lying.<p>I don&#x27;t say check every case.  That&#x27;s impossible.<p>I&#x27;m saying be a bit clearer about what you know and what you believe.  Don&#x27;t say &#x27;I know&#x27; when you haven&#x27;t verified whatever it is.  To say you do, is in fact, a type of lie.  You are simply re-stating what you have been told was true.  The effect is that you may deceive others.  Why should they be deceived because your threshold is to trust whatever is being presented to you as true?  You don&#x27;t know, but you say you do.<p>If you like, I can deconstruct this a little more.  It hinges on the verb &#x27;to be&#x27;, &#x27;is&#x27;.<p>Contrast these statements:<p>&quot;The earth is a sphere&quot;.<p>&quot;The evidence that I have seen indicates that the earth is a sphere&quot;.<p>The first statement is not verifiable personally.  It is parroting a line, and is a very common linguistic shortcut.  The effect is a form of lie, where you are overstating the case of what you know.<p>The second statement far more accurately reflects what I at least know.')
