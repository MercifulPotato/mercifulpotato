This is the core of antitrust jurisprudence: markets only work in presence of vigorous competition, but big incumbents are highly motivated to obtain so much influence that significant competition does not have a real chance to grow and threaten them.<p>There is a longish recent staff report on the Web of the Congress regarding behavior of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook (almost 500 pages) [0]. I actually read most of it.  These platforms have already engaged in a lot of stuff that is anti-competitive. And the latest purge of Parler is, among other effects, also a suppression of a potential competitor.<p>Of course, the tech giants say that they weren&#x27;t officially motivated by a desire to suppress a competitor, but they acted against potentially competing firms so many times already that one should be wary about their explanations.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;judiciary.house.gov&#x2F;uploadedfiles&#x2F;competition_in_digital_markets.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;judiciary.house.gov&#x2F;uploadedfiles&#x2F;competition_in_dig...</a>')
