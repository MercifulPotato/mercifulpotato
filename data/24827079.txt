If your local feed is important, it&#x27;s not a great plan to have users start on a suboptimal server and then have to make a new account on the one they want.  If that&#x27;s the case, I would generally expect to be able to migrate to a new server and have all my old posts, etc come with me, and that my user page on the old server would redirect to my new one.')
