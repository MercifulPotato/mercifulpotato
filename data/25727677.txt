It is awkward to have a warehouse full of TVs no one will buy because they don&#x27;t handle somebody&#x27;s new AV1 streaming format.<p>I bet most don&#x27;t plan to let customers upgrade that way, instead of buying a new TV. I expect they will sell the same hardware with a different model number and just new firmware. They like changing model numbers frequently anyway to frustrate reviewers and people consulting them.')
