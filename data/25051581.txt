You know, the simpler times without dentistry and plagues that make COVID look downright pleasant. Simpler times of backbreaking manual labour, shovelling ditches by hand.<p>A typical computer can now process 10 billion general-purpose instructions per second. It is a <i>power tool</i> for the mind. Its entire purpose is to eliminate manual labour.<p>The fundamental concept of computerised <i>information</i> technology is to automate away the processing of information as much as possible.<p>If you don&#x27;t <i>get</i> this, then you don&#x27;t <i>get</i> IT at all.<p>There is nothing at all good, or somehow more &quot;pure&quot; about programming with Notepad, or VI, or whatever text editor you fancy.<p>This is like turning off the million dollar backhoe, stepping out of the cabin, and digging the ditch with your hands because you feel that it brings you &quot;closer to the dirt&quot; or something.')
