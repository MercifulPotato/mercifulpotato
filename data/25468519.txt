Let&#x27;s look at this guy&#x27;s situation:<p>&gt;He wasn&#x27;t working; he had enough money to comfortably pursue this as a full time effort, including paying his tuition, fees, and &quot;room and board&quot; without going into debt<p>&gt;He was able to establish a routine which included self-care, meaning that he was unhampered by external obligations, mental illness, or material need<p>&gt;He was able to sequester his studying physically (having a separate home office) and temporally (again, being able to establish a routine which didn&#x27;t include studying during the time he&#x27;d set aside for other things)<p>&gt;He was studying something he was interested in, with prior knowledge respected and support forthcoming from resources (through a paywall, of course)<p>If successful study is a function of focus and progression over an extended period, it makes sense that these factors would contribute to that success, as they would have been essential for his ability to achieve and maintain focus (he says as much, in that he mentions never getting close to burnout). In many ways, I think much of what we have in terms of material and presentation is already adequate; the problem is that so many people (including many children) are kept from circumstances conducive to effective learning. People complain about a hypothetical, robust social safety net being an attempt to secure &quot;equality of outcome,&quot; but it&#x27;s evident that successes and failures tend to compound due to the way that outcomes serve as a foundation for the structure future endeavors take place in.')
