Educational Testing Service happened to have done a study of representative high school students within a year or so of when he took the test. I derived an IQ of 125, which is the 95th percentile.&quot;<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;I think you&#x27;re safe in saying that Dubya&#x27;s IQ, based on his SAT score, is in excess of 120, which puts him in the top 10 percent of the distribution, but I wouldn&#x27;t try to be more precise than that.&quot;<p>&gt; The standardization report by Miller and Valentine says that the &quot;officer population&quot; that provided the percentile scores was about one standard deviation better than the average 12th grade male on the Verbal subtest and about two standard deviations better on the Quantitative test. This suggests that the 50th percentile among the norm group of Air Force Academy applicants had an IQ of about 123, thus putting Bush in the 125-130 rangeâ€”a little better than his SAT score would imply.<p>Are students at Stanford Business School really so far below the 95th percentile nationally?')
