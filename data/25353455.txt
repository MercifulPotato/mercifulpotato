The airpods pro don&#x27;t sound good and cost $250. Incredibly muddy vocals, bass is washed out, and they just don&#x27;t make music sound good. I need to crank the volume sky-high before they start to sound ok. A $15 pair of sony wired earbuds beats them out in terms of sound quality. The ANC is meh, I can still hear people talk in the background, and theres a decent amount of audible static. For the good reviews, I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed.<p>Their laptops do sound miles better than the competition though, and the homepod is great for the size. I don&#x27;t know if I have a defective pair or what, because they don&#x27;t sound good at all.')
