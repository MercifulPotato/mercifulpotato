Item(by='vkou', descendants=None, kids=[25950896], score=None, time=1611875241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25950825, text='&gt; Robinhood sent this email not long ago to me, but this is also what analysts on TV were saying, basically they likley had to halt trading because the company may not have been able to exist and pay its obligations if it didn&#x27;t temporary suspend these volatile trades.<p>I smell bullshit. These are long positions, these aren&#x27;t options, or trades on margin. Robinhood, and its settlement network (As well as other exchanges, who have stopped retail traders from buying GME) carries effectively no risk for settling buys and sells in them.')
