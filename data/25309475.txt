You have to put players with different ranks in a server. If you just sort everyone by their skills, you get good teams that crush the rest of server. It will be annoying for low rank players, and boring for high rank players.<p>There are servers tiers, but they can&#x27;t always fill a server with same rank players. How many players are online on the same region that want to join a server at a given time...<p>So there will be always some randomness to it.
