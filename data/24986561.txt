If they sollicited you, listen to their offer. If you sollicited them, do your pitch. Acknowledge and clarify that you understand their position; communicate yours. Courtesy doesn&#x27;t hurt.<p>I&#x27;d focus your pitch on what you need and want. You may think you don&#x27;t want something but quite often it&#x27;s just because you don&#x27;t know much, and vice versa. That is unless you know exactly what you want and what you don&#x27;t, but that certitude is too common to mean anything except for those who toute it as one of the important traits of great founders in a continual pattern recognition that glosses over serveral biases (survivor, selection, salience).')
