It was just to learn how eth&#x2F;solidity worked, but to my surprise people actually started buying and selling the items. It made me around $20k in a few weeks (took a small % of transactions). Eventually, I realized it was basically just a bunch of crypto wales playing hot potato and at times using bots to bid things up. No one really thought these items would have any long term value. Not much different than most alt coins I guess. It died out on its own and I was happy do be done with it since running an online casino wasn&#x27;t what I wanted to do with my life.')
