But yeah, different runtime. Ratchet is built on top of ReactPHP which is an event-loop runtime (think nodejs).<p>It&#x27;s helpful to be able to reuse some domain code between the two if necessary, but IO cannot be done the same in ReactPHP because it needs to be async. Good news is ReactPHP has a ton of really great async libs (mysql, redis, etc.) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactphp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactphp.org&#x2F;</a><p>As others have said, Swoole is also an option, it&#x27;s more like Go (coroutine style). Personally, I think it&#x27;s super cool, but not something I want to use, because the majority of the userbase is chinese and the docs and ecosystem suffer from the language barrier.')
