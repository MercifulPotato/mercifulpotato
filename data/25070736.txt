The majority of many tech workforces are broadly Asian, along with over half of the global population.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to lump them all in together.  It may be acceptable in other industries in the US where Asian representation is in line with the US standard of ~6%, but certainly not in tech.  If a single bucket accounts for more than half of your entire sample, and that bucket can trivially be broken down further into sub-buckets, then you should absolutely do so.<p>This is something that tech in particular just keeps getting wrong over and over.  E.g. look at the 2019 Google diversity report [1] -- on page 52 it shows that 55.5% of new tech hires in the most recent year were Asian, vs 0.7% for the smallest category (Native American).  Break out that 55.5%, please!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kstatic.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kstatic.googleusercontent.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;25badfc6b6d1b33f...</a>')
