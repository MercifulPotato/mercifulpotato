Item(by='ralfn', descendants=None, kids=[25364945], score=None, time=1607545761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25360900, text='&gt;Do you have any examples of large scale corruption inside EU?<p>It doesn&#x27;t happen with the one large corruption scheme taking all of the money. Its hundreds of small corruptions like a locust.<p>Here is a fair and neutral attempt to catalog all the schemes in play:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;gov&#x2F;ethics&#x2F;prevention-fraud-corruption-european-funds.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd.org&#x2F;gov&#x2F;ethics&#x2F;prevention-fraud-corruption-...</a><p>In return:\nDo you have an example of where the EU paid anywhere below 200% of industry standard price for anything?<p>I&#x27;m not arguing its more corrupt than say the US Congress. Its on par, with some weird extremes. For example: Berlusconi, a prime minister, spending public money on under age prostitutes, serving today freely as a member of the EP. That kind also owned most media companies in his country and implemented favourable regulation and tax exemptions for himself.<p>Here in the Netherlands, there is something referred to as the &#x27;job carousel&#x27;. Where favourable regulation by politicians is rewarded in the future (after a political carreer) by very highly paid gigs in the industries and companies they favoured. Technically legal, and very hard to legislate against. Its a refined form of corruption, but it has all the same downsides. During Corona for example, the Netherlands had trouble getting its testing in order. Turned out we had excluded big commercial labs from consideration because we had represenatites of the &#x27;small artisinal labs&#x27; in our taskforce lobbying. A small scale corruption, with heavy economic distortion as a result!<p>I&#x27;m also not perse blaming corruption on the politicians themselves. We are all together responsible for the corporate and governance culture we breed. Yet we shouldn&#x27;t pretend we currently have the ability to spend&#x2F;invest money effectively and fairly as a collective.')
