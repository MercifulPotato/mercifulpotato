Unfortunately given what Intel has done to Pat during his last tenure, I am not sure if he is willing to pick up the job, especially the board&#x27;s Chairman is Bryant, not sure how well they go together. But we know Pat still loves Intel, and I know a lot of us miss Pat.&quot;</i> [2] - June, 2018<p><i>&quot;This is the same as Intel pushing out Pat Gelsinger. The product people get pushed out by sales and marketing. Which are increasingly running the show at Apple.&quot;</i> [3] 30 Days ago.<p>And numerous other reference since 2009. Many more around various other forums and twitter. I am getting quite emotional right now. I cant believe this is really happening. ( I am wiring this with tears in my eyes! ) I guess Andy Bryant retired makes the decision a little easier. And Pat has always loved Intel. I guess he is pissed those muppets drove it to the ground.<p>This is 12 years! 12 years to prove a point! Consider 4 - 5 years of work in lead-time since he left in 2009. That is 2014. Guess what happen after 2014?<p>May be it is too little too late? Or May be this will be another Andy Grove &quot;Only the paranoid survive&quot; moment?<p>The King is Back at Intel, despite being a fan of Dr Lisa Su, I am little worry about AMD.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4804875" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=4804875</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17391707" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17391707</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25435150" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25435150</a>')
