Many people don&#x27;t realise that decriminalisation&#x2F;legalisation is meant to reduce the drug problem, not &quot;make it legal to be a junkie&quot;. The three main points I usually give to people are: \n - regulating production and distribution will make drugs safer for existing users, \n - the money from that regulation (taxes, fines...) will go towards education and rehabilitation, \n - the money and time cops save from not chasing after stoners will go towards catching actual criminals.<p>Add to that the potential medicinal benefits that will be better-studied and available to more people and there&#x27;s really nothing to lose. DUI is still illegal, as is showing up to work high. Children will of course not be allowed anywhere near drugs and what grown adults do in their free time is really none of anyone else&#x27;s business.')
