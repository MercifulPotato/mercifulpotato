Apple’s new M1 chip has a ‘neural processor’ that works with Tensorflow to provide a speedup. They thought it was worth the added complexity. They also have 4 low power cores for background tasks.<p>Alot of DSP and networking tasks are handled by the modem itself.<p>Software and Compiler toolchains are often quick to optimize for any improvements that a processor provides but the bottleneck generally is cost and complexity which don’t scale linearly.')
