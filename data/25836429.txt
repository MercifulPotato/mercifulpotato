But I find it irritating how rarely people resort to it. For example if I was a father and somebody killed and raped my daughter. I&#x27;d like to think of myself as someone who&#x27;ll kill that person if he receives anything less than a life sentence - or maybe even anyway. I&#x27;d be aware that this is a crime and I&#x27;ll have to serve a prison sentence for it myself - I&#x27;d even see the point of it - a society cannot tolerate revenge. But I&#x27;d non the less feel morally obligated to do it. The only possible good reason not to resort to revenge would be if there is a possibilty of being wrong about the identity of the culprit.<p>That this doesn&#x27;t happen more often just shows to me that most wo:men are cowards. Not just that - our society even systematically rewards and encourages cowardry by reframing it as smartness or sober-mindedness. But this is true in a more general sense and not restricted to revenge of course. This can be observed on a daily basis at work, at school, pretty much anywhere.<p>---<p>Of course, I get downvoted - but how do you argue against my point?')
