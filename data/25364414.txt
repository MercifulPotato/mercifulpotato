Twitter was built for off-the-cuff comment-type communication and Facebook was built for sharing posts and content with close relations. And yet the exact same &#x27;curation&#x27; is being done there as well. So no, I don&#x27;t agree there is some magic difference between video and text.<p>&gt;Finally, you took the one example where the evidential basis is exactly there!<p>NO it&#x27;s not. You saying it doesn&#x27;t make it so. You&#x27;re impugning a motive on Facebook that you have no evidential support for. But that&#x27;s not the salient point in this discussion, because your opinion about the level of evidence that you feel you bring to the argument is immaterial to social media &#x27;curation&#x27;. What matters is what the minimum-wage, 20-something intern that is making an editorial decision feels about your post.')
