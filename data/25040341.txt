It is often a political reason why things are they way they are(making everything 10x more convoluted for on staff devs)...and people profit more from having external contractors do the work. Parts of govt I&#x27;m in..contractors can use cloud services but our teams cannot, and we have to rely on internal systems and bureaucracy.. it&#x27;s honestly all bullshit.')
