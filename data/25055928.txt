I&#x27;m curious exactly what mental model of the world the GP has.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the dismissive attitude GP portrays, but in the USA vs. China situation we appear to be stepping in as a planet, I can&#x27;t help but recognize that there&#x27;s something going on, some war for the minds via public influence campgains, and it&#x27;s probably not being done by only one side of the equation.<p>In this way, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that GP is being down-voted to oblivion: how can we see dissenting voices if they&#x27;re being hidden because they come across as shocking&#x2F;incendiary? We say that HN isn&#x27;t a platform to discuss politics, and yet &quot;Xi Jinping is fighting a new enemy â€“ Genghis Khan&quot; is clearly a political piece.  Of course all this would be easier to discuss if GP wasn&#x27;t attacking everyone.<p>Anyways, food for thoughts.')
