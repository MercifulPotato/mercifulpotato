Users have to weigh up their own time and priorities too, so for users to give up their free time to put work into documenting issues &#x2F; feature needs, that is a bunch of free labor given to the project maintainer. Any maintainer who sees bug reports or feature requests as a time drain instead of free product research is completely wrong.<p>&gt; Odd, I don&#x27;t need attention for my projects.<p>Then why are they open source?<p>&gt; You explicitly spell out that maintainers owe user listening to them and helping them for their &quot;free labor&quot;.<p>No, I never said anything like that, in fact I said the opposite. Maintainers are perfectly free to ignore users if they want. It would just mean it’s reasonable for users to see that as a shitty owner and express frustration about it. Maintainers don’t owe anyone anything, and I never said otherwise. But it’s perfectly legitimate for users to express frustration over badly managed FOSS projects, neglected feature requests, etc.<p>In other words, “if you don’t like it, leave” is unjustified, and users <i>should</i> express frustration. It doesn’t mean a maintainer is going to listen, but that’s beside the point. The original comment I replied to proposed that users are ingrates or should possibly be banned if they “complain” - that if they have a problem, it’s not the maintainer’s problem.<p>These are just wrong attitudes. Maintainers aren’t obliged to do anything. Irrelevant. Users should still complain and lobby maintainers to fix things, as that’s far more helpful and reasonable than “take it or leave it.”<p>&gt; If said users indeed invest quality time and I as a maintainer feel like their presence enhances my project, sure, giving and receiving is a good idea! Now, we both know how often that happens :)<p>No, this is up to the <i>users</i> to decide, as they actually use the project. Users decide if filing a bug report, asking for a feature, or pushing back on a roadmap is needed, because it stems from the problems they experience as users. Of course the maintainer doesn’t have to care or even read it, but that would be horrendously undiplomatic of the maintainer, and users would have every justification to express frustration about it.')
