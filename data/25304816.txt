After work I couldn&#x27;t wait to work on Advent of Code, so I did some problems from previous years until the new problem was available. Then, when I couldn&#x27;t sleep, I installed an IDE on my phone and did some more in bed.<p>I can think of a lot of reasons why. The AoC problems have a bite-sized satisfaction that a messy real world app may lack, for one thing. But mostly I think it&#x27;s yet another symptom of procrastination.')
