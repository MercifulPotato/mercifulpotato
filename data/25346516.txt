HD 6XX + Magni&#x2F;Modi is about the most cost-effective you can get, and with shipping you&#x27;re looking at about $450 all told. Worth it for sure, but it&#x27;s pretty rare when you get into this kind of stuff that you&#x27;re <i>just</i> paying for headphones.<p>(That said, an HD 598 or whatever replaced it in Sennheiser&#x27;s line is a great intro - the quality of reproduction is very much in the same ballpark, and you don&#x27;t need specialized equipment to drive it. Considerably cheaper, too.)')
