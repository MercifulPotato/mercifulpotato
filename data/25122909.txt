Item(by='crossroadsguy', descendants=None, kids=[25125290, 25124488], score=None, time=1605615790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121555, text='I would advise everyone to stay away from services that also provide and allow use of an email address on their (provider) domains i.e. user-name@service-provider.tld (e.g. name@mailbox.org) but don&#x27;t have any free tier (even the bare minimum). So the moment you stop paying you are cut off and if you had been using email on their domain you might be less inclined to migrate away even if better competitors are around at better prices.<p>So, mailbox.org (my current mail host), posteo (they don&#x27;t even allow custom domain!) and the like should be avoided. It&#x27;s nothing but lock-in.<p>Because you will eventually start using it. the domain sounds very easy and tempting and it is easy to tell someone &lt;4 letter name&gt;@mailbox.org rather than &lt;4 letter name&gt;@&lt;9 letter first name&gt;.com.')
