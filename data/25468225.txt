Shut down for reboot, and never came back up. None of the troubleshooting steps worked. Apple won&#x27;t budge since it was out warranty and wants $725 to fix it. They literally told me that maybe I should consider getting a new one. Such a joke.<p>Really stuck, tbh, as i&#x27;m not sure if I should just fix it or forget it and leave the macbook world.')
