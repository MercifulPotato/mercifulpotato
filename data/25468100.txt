There are so many different types of jobs and opportunities.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sick of wasting time writing worthless tests<p>You can find a codebase to work on that aligns with your testing preferences<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sick of endless meetings and documents and time tracking tools.<p>I found a gig without heavy process.  It was one of the main criteria in my job search.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sick of reorgs.<p>There are well organized, flat companies that don&#x27;t suffer from endless team reshuffling.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sick of everyone above middle management having the exact same personality type.<p>Tech lets you work remotely and choose who you interact with. I live in a middle class Colombian neighborhood.  When I finish Zoom calls with Americans, I can walk out my door and am transported to a different world.<p>I&#x27;m glad OP found a new city and job that work better.  Not sure they needed to leave tech.  They could have started a bootstrapped small company (no VC), or gotten a corporate sponsored open source gig, or whatever.')
