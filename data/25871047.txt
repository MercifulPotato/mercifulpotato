They have vendor lockin on customers, an enormous war chest they can (and have) used for predatory pricing and they control, like, 1&#x2F;2 the hosting market.<p>&gt; With all that they can almost murder elastic search in their sleep without providing a better service.<p>&gt; That will not just be bad for ES it will be bad for everyone who isn&#x27;t Bezos.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of businesses with a lot of budget who want to use ES and don&#x27;t want to go near AWS. Let&#x27;s not pretend there&#x27;s not an enormous opportunity out there for a good hosted ES platform not on AWS.')
