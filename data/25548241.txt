You have to go through a vendor (I fucking hate that). You can buy some model online on ebay and other places, but they are expensive. You can search for &quot;pro:idiom TV&quot;. pro:idiom is a encryption protocol that TV provider uses. TVs are connected directly to the provider cable without a cable box. Pro:idiom is required for HBO.<p>Its very easy to obtain a digital copy but HBO still requires that their channel must be encrypted.')
