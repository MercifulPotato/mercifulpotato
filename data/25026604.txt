It was a ground breaking company 30 years ago when they introduced the Computer Musical Instrument (CMI), but they went through hard times due to the incredibly high cost. The company was reformed several times, was bought and sold several times, and no doubt had some vaguely valuable IP coming with it. But their sound editing software has never been a leader in the field, and wasn&#x27;t widely used. Being a part of Resolve will likely result in <i>more</i> exposure and use of any technology that gets reused.')
