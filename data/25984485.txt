Finally.</i><p>I&#x27;ve noticed that this is mostly down to the cashier recognizing you and not some kind of policy change.<p>At my regular EDEKA some of the cashiers know me and know I don&#x27;t do points collection, so they usually don&#x27;t ask but sometimes still do just out of habit.<p>Cashiers that don&#x27;t know me will still always ask.<p>Another EDEKA, where I only shop every couple of weeks and nobody recognizes me, I always get asked for the card.')
