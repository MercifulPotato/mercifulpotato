If you are concerned with the fact that minorities are underrepresented in a top school due to having lower scores, how about you volunteer to give extra lessons to these kids, try to popularize science (and math in particular) among them, and otherwise help them compete on par in a completely unbiased and merit-based system.<p>But instead, left-leaning activists insist that affirmative action is the only solution to the problem, ignore its downsides (such as increased tension between social groups when you apply different rules to them), and when faced with well-substantiated objections, they burn the Rome by completely dismantling the merit-based system. And, of course, fully blame conservatives for the consequences of a decision they did not make. Especially, the head of the federal executive branch that has zero jurisdiction over the matter.')
