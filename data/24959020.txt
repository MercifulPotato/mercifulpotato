I think your comparison with Toronto is probably fair, but I would say Montreal has a greater share of corruption than most major Canadian cities.  Why?  The presence of organized crime is probably a big factor.  When you have crime families who have been established in Montreal for decades, I think that breeds more corruption than a city that has a less organized set of criminal elements.')
