It feels like the difference between a photograph and a painting.<p>My biggest complaint with non-fiction is that it often starts with a person with a story, who may not be the best writer. Thus, despite the content of the material, the prose can be rather drab. Additionally, no - fiction also falls into the trappings of &#x27;why not just read the synopsis?&#x27;.<p>The non-fiction I love tends to often just be compellingly written textbooks. Eg: DesignOfDesign or Indian after Gandhi OR Blogs (Derek Lowe, Sinocism, SSC)<p>Fiction simply has a LOT more freedom to experiment with ideas and lets the author disto ideas in a way that non-fiction never can, due to its constraints.<p>I am good at suspending disbelief, so the emotional attachment for both mediums is pretty equal for me. I know many friends who can&#x27;t read fiction, because they simply can&#x27;t get invested in a &#x27;not-real&#x27; story.')
