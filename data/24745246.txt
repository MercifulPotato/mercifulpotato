In contrast one of the specific concerns that I do remember was that the Japanese 5th generation project would leave the western computing industry in the dust, not that it would create a surveillance nightmare. I also remember concerns that the (then) approaches to AI (e.g. rule-based expert systems) would lead to brittle decision making, or that it couldn&#x27;t scale to real-world problems.<p>Can you name some of the authors who were publishing panopticon concerns then, or the media they were publishing in?')
