Despite being in a rather narrow field, only focusing on trauma radiographs, the complexity of the task is hard to overstate. We have piloted our software with our radiologists at the hospital, but the amount of features you need so that the clinicians actually feel that there is any benefit, are huge. At the moment we&#x27;re training 480+ different labels and I still think we&#x27;re not even half way for trauma radiographs.')
