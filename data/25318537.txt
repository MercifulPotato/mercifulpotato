What ends up happening is that people who are on the brink of poverty keep losing their (inherited) land because the government deems it an income generating asset, even though it is not (it&#x27;s either their home or some dilapidated piece of land without much actual income generation prospects). \nOften they also get screwed on the selling because they are under pressure and because they are not experienced in selling property, and end up losing money in the process.\nSo it&#x27;s like crabs on the brim of the bucket being kicked back to the bottom.')
