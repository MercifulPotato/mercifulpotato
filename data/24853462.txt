You can immediately tell because he&#x27;s able to explain complex concepts in a simple and easy to understand fashion, and make them intuitive, which to me is a distinguishing trait in people who understand, and don&#x27;t merely parrot memorized jargon. So no, he&#x27;s not a &quot;charlatan&quot; at all. He&#x27;s likely one of the most informed people in the industry.')
