It&#x27;s like &#x27;violence in games&#x27;, if you refer to it everyone will nod, but how it became such a widely accepted fact is at best unclear.<p>I&#x27;m sure some cases of it happened somewhere, there are some papers, and some appeal to authority is a given, but do we really know if WFH equals mental health issues en masse?<p>For example, I wonder if: long commute, all the preparation before&#x2F;after a work day, and resulting overall diminished free time causes more mental issues or not.<p>What about constant interruptions, loud neighbours and that white light above you, even though you&#x27;d rather have it yellow? All the inconveniences of sharing a place with other people, wouldn&#x27;t any of this take a toll?<p>Seems to me when &quot;office&quot; is heard everyone thinks of that one nice summer evening after work and had a few beers yada yada, nobody seems to remember that cold-ass winter day where you would rather stay in 5 levels of blankets yet had to go to office, then slipped on ice and landed on your ass.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s true and WFH will turn most people to madness. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s not an established fact of life, and opposite is also very much possible.')
