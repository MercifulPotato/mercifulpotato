Metrification and creating a &quot;fubini&#x27;s theorem&quot; for a specific problem to measure something (indeed category theory is useful for building a localized &quot;global wire&quot; with appropriate &quot;gauges&quot; of interesting where optimization methods will work (to achieve the non-equilibrium control-theoretic orient-folds of interesting of whatever &quot;the soln&quot; is) with enough &quot;space&quot; to &quot;try&quot; pull-backs and push-forwards as needed (for a class&#x2F;family of physically analogous of data).  I thinking looking at things trough Joseph Fourier&#x27;s eyes is pretty englightening. He sees to have ideated both the heat transfer problem (and being able to apply modern methodology by forming distributed or sparse representations of it, then assessing the non-linear dynamics of it modern robotics and mathematics senses to it, which would be very much applying pfaffian dynamics to me, and being able to know about cohomogies is a blessing such that the appropriate physical effect where the maximum likelihood is constained). is important in both scale free systems, fibers of networks of systems that need to be localized (this is approximately global sections of global optimization but then model indentified), mass effect which require some sort of techno-economic analysis (think the climate resilience problem) and (historically, I think COVID will shift that) lack of progress towards applied coding in the life sciences vs information sciences. What&#x27;s pretty surreal to me is that exploring (and documenting some of interesting blurs between fields), say like math, physics, statistics, computer sciences, signal processing, natural language (even of language of scientific discourse), renormalization methods, naturalizations, socializations, and what are global&#x2F;local laws lets you almost do a approach it as a &quot;reverse Robin Hood&quot; problem.')
