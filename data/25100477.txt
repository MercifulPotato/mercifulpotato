With repeated meditation, yoga or other exercises like slowing down and being intentionally bored, you can at any time recall that feeling and focus. So meditation is not just an activity you do to calm down, but to train your mind too.<p>Avoiding being too hectic is good too though, or it becomes more of a mental gymnastic. The benefit of that is calmness and clarity to make better decisions and priorities.')
