Item(by='cttrhow', descendants=None, kids=[25244383], score=None, time=1606647025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244275, text='&gt; I am sure the flat earth stuff and the 5gs are manufactured conspiracies, for the sole reason of developing a mechanism to basically discredit any public suspicion once something gets slapped the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; term.<p>Also &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot;. There was well documented fiasco around swine flu vaccine (pandemrix) that seems to have given narcolepsy to some people, but more often than not bringing that up labels you as an anti-vaxer and noone wants to listen. It&#x27;s ironic that article speaks about &quot;thought-terminating cliches&quot; where some conspiracy theories are used as such to cover actual issues.<p>My point here is that most issues are subtle: I&#x27;m happy I was given polio vaccine when I was a child, but I don&#x27;t trust pharma that much and I&#x27;d rather not take anything that didn&#x27;t go through years of testing and I think big pharma&#x27;s bad reputation is well-earned.')
