I&#x27;ve been programming in python for more than 4 years and I&#x27;d like to try something different.<p>I took a haskell class back in the day but just the basics, didn&#x27;t even learn monads.<p>My goal is not to master the language itself but learn enough to make a better programner.<p>One thing that has been holding me back is the lack of  real world examples. I get demotivated when only solving toy problems.<p>This looks like a great resource. I have heard a lot about Haskell From First Principles but there&#x27;s too much stuff in there.')
