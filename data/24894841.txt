The first one was replaced under warranty. Since half the screws have fallen out of the back and since I only got 2 good years out of it, huawei is off the table. Can anyone recommend a super thin powerful laptop for dev work? I actually loved the huawei with Ubuntu but the manufacturing quality was so poor I just can&#x27;t go back. Was thinking of going back to Macbook air but I&#x27;d like to plug in to 3 vga monitors at the office. Thanks for any recommendations.')
