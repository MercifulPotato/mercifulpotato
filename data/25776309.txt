It&#x27;s actually illegal to arrest a member of Congress on their way to the congressional floor.<p>Hypothetically, if they shoot someone dead on the steps, and then disarm themselves so they aren&#x27;t a threat anymore, then the police must still allow them to go into Congress to finish their debate. Congress itself <i>can</i> self police, but it&#x27;s immune to being controlled by the executive branch (i.e. the police).<p>If you could just arrest Congressmen on their way to the chambers, then you would see in a close vote that some Congressmen will never make it to the chambers because the police &quot;found&quot; something on them (or a police dog smelled weed on them).')
