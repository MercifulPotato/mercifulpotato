To much time wasted infront a screen, days passing, not feeling alive. I was a decent dev but as the time went by, my passion just blew away and i didnt care anymore. I had to make a change because this trade made me unhappy. So I decided to go with something more practical. Im currently back in school doing HVAC&#x2F;electrical stuff and it feels good. It was a hard decision leaving a good salary&#x2F;security&#x2F;status and be back at zero. But I feel better and its fun to learn something new&#x2F;doing stuff in the real world. Life is short and fragile, spend it doing somehing worthwhile, for you!')
