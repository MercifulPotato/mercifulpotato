Say I wrote a book and titled all of my chapters the same as another book, the book was given a different title and the chapters themselves where very different on the inside but naturally my table of contents looks exactly the same, would this be considered infringe in the publishing world (I don&#x27;t know)?<p>Also based on that:<p>If it would why would API&#x27;s be different?<p>If not how was it applied differently here?<p>What if in the above scenario, I added some extra chapters so the TOC has all the chapters the other book had, but the TOC is not a 1 for 1?<p>If my analogy is wrong, what am I not seeing?<p>I know as someone who writes software, API&#x27;s not being copyrightable is preferable, but I would like to understand how the law sees it when dealing with real physicals works and understand if the law is applied the same when it moves to less concrete works.')
