Error build-up I&#x27;m not sure should be a big worry when you can have 53 bits of precision for a window a couple thousand pixels across.<p>&gt; As you describe, this is the &quot;easily solved&quot; way<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understood what I meant.  I was saying that when possible the compositor should round the window to the nearest pixel, then have the client render at that resolution, so then the compositor would not do <i>any scaling at all</i>.')
