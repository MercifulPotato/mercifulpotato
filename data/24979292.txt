So it would need to be as high as needed to fit the public government spending. In some EU countries that would be above 50%, in the US may be roughly 40%. That may seem like a lot but averaged it would be the same than the average tax payer paid before, except more evenly distributed so likely median tax payer would be benefited.<p>UBI by itself is progressive, a simple flat UBI creates a progressive effective rate. You can tweak the numbers to obtain your desired target tax curve; increasing or decreasing UBI, having different VATs for different products. As John Von Neumann said, &quot;with 3 parameters I can draw an elephant and with 4 I can make it wiggle its trunk&quot;. There is enough free parameters to make the taxation more or less progressive.<p>I&#x27;m not prescribing those details because I think there should be ample room for fine-tuning. What size government spending should have in an economy and how progressive should a tax system be are questions that different countries have answered differently and you find success and failure all across the spectrum. So I consider it a transversal issue.<p>My focus is on efficiency, resiliency to abuses&#x2F;gameability and economic incentives.')
