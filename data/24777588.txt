In WW1, it was called Shell Shock, a terrifying name. The same condition in WW1 was called Battle Fatigue, a nicer name. In the Korean War, the name changed to Operational Exhaustion, removing any humanity from it. After the Vietnam War, the name because Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. When you compare the terms &quot;Shell Shock&quot; and &quot;PTSD&quot;, it&#x27;s obvious what the intent is.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vuEQixrBKCc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;vuEQixrBKCc</a>')
