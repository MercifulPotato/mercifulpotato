Here is the one I have for Firefox as an example in &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin&#x2F;firefox&quot;:<p>firejail --profile=&#x2F;etc&#x2F;firejail&#x2F;firefox.profile --private=~&#x2F;.sandboxes&#x2F;firefox&#x2F; &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;firefox --no-remote $@<p>In terms of risks, are you mostly concerned about security risks?
