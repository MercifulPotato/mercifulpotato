The democratic commissioners Rosenworcel and Starks while more interested in consumer protections than their republican peers, if either them are selected to be the new commissioner I would be surprised to the same push or zeal as wheeler had. Although someone else could be named for the position.<p>Although, honestly wheeler was a bit of surprise a lot people thought he would be worse than Genachowski because he had ties to the NCTA (Cable company lobbying group).
