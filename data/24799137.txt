I couldn&#x27;t find any reference to this in the repository or landing page?<p>Some sources mention it is for research only purposes (in closed roads?), others advertise this as a CES consumer product, has the project evolved along the way?<p>Each car manufacturer has to provide a battery of tests to regulators for each vehicle and sub-system within each vehicle. This project claims to be safe to use on more than 100 separate vehicles, perhaps I am missing something but this claim would require a considerable amount of evidence.<p>I am all for open-source and experimentation but in cases where we cannot provide guarantees, this should be done on a private road at your own risk.')
