Arrive to the US with B-2 Visa<p>2. Apply for F-1 Visa<p>3. B-2 Visa expires<p>4. F-1 Visa granted<p>Additionally, is this considered a violation of the terms or conditions of their nonimmigrant status? From my understanding, they are in a &quot;period of authorized stay&quot; during this time, but I am curious about what this means in terms of status and potential violations of their status.<p>Thank you so much!')
