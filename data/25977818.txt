It wasn&#x27;t to me either. There has got to be some cognitive bias at play here to lead to our acceptance of inverted principles like this. The framing of the problem is completely inverted, yet we&#x27;re pretty much okay with that.<p>If it&#x27;s not clear what I&#x27;m talking about here&#x27;s another example:<p>&quot;Why do you need privacy if you have nothing to hide?&quot;<p>This is also a reframing that presumes I do not have privacy and therefore bare the burden to prove I need it.
