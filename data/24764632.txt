Having demanding clients, and being a conscientious person, I&#x27;ve enable them to demand more, faster. This started eating up my morning hours and had really blurred the line in separating my work life from my home life. Taking ownership of my time, I&#x27;ve reclaimed stressful mornings into relaxing, reading, meditating, and spending more time with my wife and kids. The clients still scream for stuff, but it can wait. Some things are just too important. I like the mantra here to pay yourself first because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll be paying someone else. Thanks for sharing.')
