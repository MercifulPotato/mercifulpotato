You&#x27;re right in saying that &quot;user&#x27;s seem happy&quot; is not the only metric, but it&#x27;s quite a stretch to go from &quot;Facebook doesn&#x27;t optimize for holistic well-being&quot; to &quot;Facebook is as addictive &amp; harmful as Big Tobacco&quot;. It&#x27;s certainly something I believe reasonable people can disagree on and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to shame people for working at Facebook.<p>It&#x27;s a little off-topic but honestly the idea that Facebook is somehow the the cause of all these modern problems is pretty tenuous to me. Most Facebook users don&#x27;t go crazy &amp; belligerent from use, the effects are not at all like the consistent &amp; universal harm of nicotine and cigarette smoke. It suggests to me that Facebook might exacerbate existing problems, but it is not the straightforwardly harmful product that people claim it is.')
