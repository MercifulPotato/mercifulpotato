If we take away the main reasons the average person has to work for as an obligation, we can leverage a society detached from obligatory labor.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought about it from the workplace analogy. When we hire people, we make sure they are better prepared than our market competition. We provide them with a desk, computers, printers, access to food and beverage, access to tuition related to the job they will be making, and many stuff the employee doesn&#x27;t have to pay for. How and why could we think society-wide should be different? Governments should start thinking of their citizens as employees.')
