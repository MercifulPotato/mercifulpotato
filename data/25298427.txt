If we&#x27;re calling them social activists—I&#x27;m not opposed to that, I just didn&#x27;t consider them as activists in my original comment—then yeah there&#x27;s plenty of polite social activists. The social activists I was considering were along the lines of MLK, Susan B. Anthony, James Baldwin. People who were advocating for something fundamentally opposite to current societal values. With that definition I believe there&#x27;s no way to be polite.<p>I guess if I had to refine my original claim: it&#x27;s impossible to politely disagree with fundamental societal values.')
