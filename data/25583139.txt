DVD has garbage resolution and compression, while film is made to be projected on gigantic theater canvas. Surely you don&#x27;t believe movie theaters were effectively displaying 720x480 or 720x576 at the size of canvas?<p>Consult this video, for example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sCv-dIFGcd0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;sCv-dIFGcd0</a><p>Personally I find that even BD-rips made in SD resolution look better than DVDâ€”if only for contrast enhancements made for reissues, and due to better compression formats.<p>Moreover, if the source was shot on 70mm film then people might still keep re-digitizing it in the 22nd century into fresh HD formats of the day.')
