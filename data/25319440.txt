Do not mean to sound rude &amp; wish I could type out more right now, buy plenty suffering from these problems haha. Some from their tweens, ruining their careers before they&#x27;ve even begun with things like Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, Pelvic Floor Dysfunction...<p>Misery is very, very much out there. Loves company as well. Having a few million dollars would only fix 1&#x2F;3 of my problems I suppose. Money would definitely put me on the right path to being able to possibly get better, but some medical conditions you get for no damn reason are hard to manage with even the best of the doctors within the U.S., and some people with said medical problems don&#x27;t even have parents who give the slightest fuck about them. Cruel world sometimes, fairly easy to insulate from if you&#x27;re healthy in the first world tho...')
