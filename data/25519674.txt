Everything is almost there, but not quite. Pretty much anything you want to do is just a little bit too difficult compared to the amount of work you&#x27;re willing to put in to adopt a new messaging system.<p>The worst part is, that it&#x27;s been in this state for a few years now. It&#x27;s not that much easier to run your own server, clients are just a bit too clunky, bridges are flaky and hard to use.<p>It&#x27;ll get there someday, I hope.')
