Where there&#x27;s room for personal achievement (or non-achievement), I cannot imagine any good use for them.<p>E.g. I&#x27;d like to do more work and be paid more and rewarded more, with none of the union pay grades BS. I&#x27;d like people to be fired based on incompetence, not seniority.<p>The only situations when I can imagine my outlook changing is if I become incompetent at my job, or lazy and useless (e.g. I&#x27;ve coasted at a job that I disliked for 6 months or so once, and then left; I imagine for some people it might be cool to coast for 6 years instead under union protections)')
