After all, the hardware is basically capable of both roles, potentially ergonomics aside.<p>This is why there are &quot;two-in-one&quot; laptops that have fully functional touchscreens that convert to tablet mode for both Windows and Chromebook operating systems.<p>&gt;&gt; Apple basically threw out laptop compatibility and made tablets their own (well, phone-related) thing.<p>Thus this article begging Apple to reconsider.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be awesome if the M1 Macbook Air had a fully functional tablet mode that let it act as an iPad Pro?  :)<p>For whatever reason Apple does not think so.  :(')
