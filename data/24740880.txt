In my opinion, punishment that isn&#x27;t intended to reform the criminal is done so three rest of us can feel good.  I consider it sadism, but can understand if others object to that term.<p>&gt;There should be no execution of killers<p>If they are likely to only be a danger to society, and the society does not hold all lives sacred, the death penalty would fit.

Also, it would be a good guarantee they would attend behavioral therapy.<p>&gt;people would be held for as long as it takes (potentially indefinitely) to change unacceptable behaviour<p>This does make me feel unsure of an answer, but luckily I can use a simple cop-out: removing sentencing limits would be too ripe for abuse.')
