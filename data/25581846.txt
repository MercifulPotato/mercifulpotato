Name another OS you can play AAA games on, then fire up professional software suites (Office, Adobe CC) to do nearly anything creative &#x2F; office &#x2F; analytic-related, etc. so forth.<p>This article is idiotic. That statement is idiotic.<p>Microsoft should be fucking terrifying to anyone with any foresight. Yeah, they&#x27;re not Apple... it takes them 3-4 tries to get shit &quot;right&quot;, but once they do, its fantastic.<p>The entire Surface line up is proof of this. Until the M1 MacBooks, Surface Book 3 was hands down the best laptop you could buy. Sleek, powerful, good battery life, and the pen support basically makes it an iPad Pro &#x2F; MacBook Pro in a single device.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s first ARM chips will be garbage, sure. But their 3rd and 4th ones won&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m a little terrified at the walled gardens that are going up, and everyone else ought to be as well.
