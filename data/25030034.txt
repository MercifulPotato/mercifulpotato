What motivates this entire underground network of people who do this? I feel like this should be studied or something - it strikes me as a separate set of morals that these people hold that aren&#x27;t spelled out anywhere (or are they?) and no matter the number of times the powers that be try to squash them, they seem to pop right back up in one form or another.<p>A leaderless resistance to power hungry assholes or something, so cool :)')
