The few times I saw someone trying to implement the task count, it would sometimes be the case the count couldn&#x27;t be determined beforehand! So I&#x27;d see progress reports like: 1&#x2F;123 done.... 42&#x2F;124 done... 45&#x2F;2616 done... 68&#x2F;98213 done...<p>SharePoint search does something similar! It doesn&#x27;t search everything, so it just says &quot;about X items found&quot; based on an estimate. Everytime you click on the next search page, that number gets a little more accurate')
