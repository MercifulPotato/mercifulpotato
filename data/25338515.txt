It&#x27;s confusing and ultimately pointless, but if you plant apple trees, the year in which you do that is the first year in which you planted apple trees, not the zeroth year. After ten years elapsed, it is now the tenth year of your apple tree planting phase.<p>I agree about your 80s example (of course I use it in the same way), but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it ultimately doesn&#x27;t make sense because you&#x27;ll be off by one when counting backwards. So for colloquial conversations it&#x27;s fine, for serious date calculations, you cannot just have one &quot;decade&quot; with only 9 years.')
