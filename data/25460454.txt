If you&#x27;re using the KubernetesExecutor, you can point to custom images for individual tasks, this will primarily work if you&#x27;re storing DAGs in git or a volume (or if you want to handle baking in DAGs for different images).<p>2. You can use custom images in KEDA queues. This way you can simply point to a queue for all tasks in that DAG and they will run in that environment.<p>3. You can use the k8spodoperator. Now that the k8spodoperator allows for templating, it would be pretty easy to create a template for a pod and just inject different commands for different steps.<p>Hope that helps!')
