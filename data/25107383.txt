I quickly checked the repo for TFA but didn’t see mention of it. It would be interesting to see their method when designed to utilize hardware calculated optical flow, if that would help at all.<p>Here’s the NVIDIA library:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;opticalflow-sdk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.nvidia.com&#x2F;opticalflow-sdk</a><p>I’ve played with the NVENC hardware and it’s fast! I’ve not specifically tried the hardware optical flow calculation but docs say it can process flow for 4k video at 150fps!')
