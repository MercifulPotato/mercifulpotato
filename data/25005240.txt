I ordered two Red Plus drives (WD101EFAX) last month, but the drives I got are labeled &quot;Red&quot;.  I remember seeing some fine print (maybe on their website or in the box I got) which said &quot;you might get drives that look like they are Red, but we promise they totally are Red Plus ...&quot;.  That said, the drives are working fine AFAICT and I honestly don&#x27;t know enough about hard drives to tell the difference.')
