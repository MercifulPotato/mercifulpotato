Once you have someone in the room who can say &quot;we should listen to this person&quot; then you will have a chance of actually getting info&#x2F;influence upstream.<p>But to be build those relations there is a fair degree of &#x27;self-promoting&#x27; and being seen as the go-getter in the crowd. Silently doing your work and silently going above and beyond is usually just a recipe for disappointment. Another thing I don&#x27;t often see discussed is that, as with a lot of other things, luck and timing matters a hell of a lot.')
