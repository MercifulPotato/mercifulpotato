I&#x27;m not saying none of that is happening too but the point has always been to persuade the audience (fooling them being coincidental). I think it&#x27;s more useful to frame the matter from this perspective because otherwise it&#x27;s easy to fall into the trap of believing that some people are immune to this sort of messaging when really they&#x27;re just not the target audience.<p>From this angle the democrats bungling their optics was inevitable because up till now a lot of their party rhetoric had focused on ideas like &quot;resisting&quot;, fighting discrimination, and fighting authorianism (presumably because they felt those messages would resonate emotionally the most). That&#x27;s all fine if course, but it was strategically fine because it wasn&#x27;t a big risk to moderate (largest group) voters. This backfired when the Floyd protests happened because suddenly you had blue city mayors trying not to look like hypocrites and so they started tolerating arson, murder, and looting while at the same time attacking the people who get paid to stop arson, murder, and looting (which scares the moderates).<p>Short of PizzaGate being real I don&#x27;t think I could have picked a worse development for the democrats than the Floyd protests if I tried.')
