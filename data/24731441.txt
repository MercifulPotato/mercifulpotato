It’s tough with this type of article, because they are almost prescriptive rather than descriptive. It says certain actions are “problematic” but doesn’t go much deeper.<p>I think the main point of the article is to make sure to make your characters human — even if they aren’t the protagonist, which I agree with. In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with having a crazy homeless character — just don’t make their defining characteristic their craziness.<p>I did have a big problem with #5. The masses can be terrifying. Mob mentality brings out the worst in people. It happens on all sides too.')
