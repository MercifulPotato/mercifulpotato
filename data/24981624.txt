To expand:<p>&gt; The era between the mid-1830s and the Civil War—a period economists refer to as the “free banking era”—saw a proliferation of banks. Along with these institutions came “bank notes,” a private paper currency redeemable for a specific amount of metal. That is, if the issuing bank had it. At times, banks did not have enough gold or silver to satisfy all of their claims. Bank notes, like the public notes that preceded them, also tended to depreciate. It is during this period that the word inflation begins to emerge in the literature, not in reference to something that happens to prices, but as something that happens to a paper currency.<p>&gt; The term inflation was initially used to describe a change in the proportion of currency in circulation relative to the amount of precious metal that constituted a nation’s money. By the late nineteenth century, however, the distinction between “currency” and “money” was becoming blurred.<p>&gt; In addition to separating the price level from the money stock, the Keynesian revolution in economics appears to have separated the word inflation from a condition of money and redefined it as a description of prices.<p>&gt; When Keynesian economic theory challenged the direct link between money and the price level, inflation lost its association with money and came to be chiefly understood as a condition of prices.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clevelandfed.org&#x2F;newsroom-and-events&#x2F;publications&#x2F;economic-commentary&#x2F;economic-commentary-archives&#x2F;1997-economic-commentaries&#x2F;ec-19971015-on-the-origin-and-evolution-of-the-word-inflation.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.clevelandfed.org&#x2F;newsroom-and-events&#x2F;publication...</a><p>Keynesian economists changed the word to suite the needs of Keynesian theories. It is equivalent to &quot;newspeak&quot;. It obfuscates and confuses. There is a large portion of the population that does not believe in the implementation of or understand Keynesian economics(and definitions). They may not be very good at explaining or understanding their discontent due to these semantics changes.<p>Then again, maybe you are right. As Milton Friedman famously stated, &quot;We are all Keynesians now.&quot;')
