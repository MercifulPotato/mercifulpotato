Few challenges I ran into as I had a customer pay for this:<p>User agents have to be the newest browsers, if you use an old one, they start not counting your votes prior to banning.<p>You will need an IPV4 space as they treat IPV6 as spam right now. 100K bots means at least 80,000 ip addresses.<p>They track login times across accounts which vote on a similar item, or it may not be login, but, it may be action time, so your cron jobs have to stagger.<p>The best way to do it, is pay people in third world countries to legitimately post. It was about $1 per person, per day to post 2 times. We would pay them once a month and it was insanely cheap. The issue is then Reddit started banning on geo location so now you need people in poor countries who have a VPN. If you can find 100-200K with a VPN at $1 per post, $100-$200K is nothing, as you are paying developers a lot more to do this.')
