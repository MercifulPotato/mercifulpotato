Dilution of values. Fundamentalism which is so entrenched the religion (I suspect, high 90s % of strongly religious demographics, primarily Islam).<p>Long term, I see even worse divergence of national unity - these people are now speaking the language, but their own German dialect, their kids are raising with local kids, etc. I personally do not see Germans share most of middle-eastern&#x2F;islamic values. You cannot forcefully assimilate 2 different polarizing cultures, it is a time bomb of cultural divide. No matter how humanitarian your views are, there is no going away from this fact.<p>I think the best solution is to provide aid - military, financial, food&#x2F;medicine to these impoverished countries instead of taking refugees.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t respond to your comment below, but I basically have fundamental disagreement about aligning Holocaust with Syrian refugee crisis. You&#x27;re trying to shoehorn a narrative from the perspective of the lawmakers, I am asking simple questions about assimilation and integration. We&#x27;re talking past each other? Anyways, I learned a few things from your opinions about the history of these archaic refugee laws. IMO they should be with the neighbors, not transcontinental. Thanks for the discussion.')
