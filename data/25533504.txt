For older adults it makes sense they use the hunt and peck method because they have little reason to learn touch typing (they got this far without it and if they only need to interact for a few minutes with a keyboard here and there that&#x27;s okay). However, for younger people their world is different. They do most of their typing on tablets&#x2F;phones where two finger pressing via the hunt and peck method is easier&#x2F;reliable (try and type up something on a tablet screen using the touch typing method and see how often you&#x27;ll make a mistake). So, your opinion of learning touch typing applies mainly to solid keyboards used for extended periods of time while hunt&#x2F;peck skills serve them better with touch screens. My wife is a hunt&#x2F;peck user and while her speed isn&#x27;t the best she seems to have decent speed when she has hunt&#x2F;peck-ed the same key multiple times (aka warmed up). So, with all that said, hunt&#x2F;peckers in my opinion only type best when they are warmed up and usually tend to only have limited amount of things to type into the machine.')
