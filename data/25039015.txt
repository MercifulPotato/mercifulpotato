Vendor lock-in [1]<p>2. If we&#x27;re talking VSCode, I&#x27;m not down for the &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot; patterns that M$ has <i>already</i> been enacting on this front. See [2] for a case &amp; point (TLDR: they deprecated their open source, editor agnostic language server for a closed source, VSCode-specific server)<p>3. Performance (for the kind of work that I do, at least) is nearly always inferior with no payoff for it (with the possible exception of Visual Studio).<p>4. Despite the fact that they are ostensibly &quot;hackable to the core&quot;, in practice there are major limitations and weird behaviors when you try to do anything &quot;weird&quot;. For example, it&#x27;s orders of magnitude simpler and less convoluted to get Emacs to behave and feel (mostly) like VSCode than the other way around. Comparatively, I can get emacs to fit like a glove -- and sometimes it is painful, but much less so.<p>5. Code completion, language servers, and <i>most</i> of the &quot;modern comforts&quot; of &quot;modern IDEs&quot; actually work just fine in emacs (and vim).<p>6. I prefer the paradigm of buffers, modal editing, and generally prefer not having to use the mouse. I have ADHD -- any amount of time spent task switching (even if it&#x27;s having to use my mouse for 2 seconds to switch tabs) is exponentially more painful than it is for others who don&#x27;t have it. And I spent the bulk of my day editing code, often performing the same sorts of repetitive tasks (deleting entire lines, delimiting and wrapping strings, hopping from the start of a line to the end of a line) -- I need shortcuts and macros to make that process seamless.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t use VSCode and that I&#x27;m not impressed by what it has achieved in such a short time especially when it comes to accessibility and careful UX design. I used it for about a year before eventually reverting to emacs, and continue to use it semi-regularly (mainly the open-source version of VSCode[3]) for code demos.<p>On the note of emacs and vim users being resistant to change, I find that users of &quot;modern IDEs&quot; have a harder time learning and adjusting to emacs and vim than the other way around, and have a harder time debugging when the abstraction layers of the IDE bug out. And to be fair, emacs in particular has major issues around accessibility and fairly terse documentation for new users, so that&#x27;s to some extent understandable. But the claim that we stick to our editors of choice because we&#x27;re unwilling to learn or adapt is ludicrous.<p>Step off and don&#x27;t shame people for working the way that keeps them most productive. And don&#x27;t shill for M$ -- it&#x27;s not a good look.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;underjord.io&#x2F;the-best-parts-of-visual-studio-code-are-proprietary.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;underjord.io&#x2F;the-best-parts-of-visual-studio-code-ar...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;pylance-release&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;pylance-release&#x2F;issues&#x2F;4</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscodium.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscodium.com&#x2F;</a>')
