Then they see Go which is fairly accessible but with significantly better performance than python. Why not use Go instead?<p>Most (all?) 3d graphics programs use python as an extension language so they&#x27;d have to re-architecture their whole system to use Go programs in place of python. If it&#x27;s even possible to dynamically load Go programs without having to resort to an Inkscape level of tomfoolery where the extension is called as a separate program and all the data is passed as shell arguments.<p>...not saying anything is wrong with Inkscape&#x27;s way of doing things but I sure wish it had a built-in python api.')
