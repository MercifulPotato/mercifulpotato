There may be some truth to the claims that conservatives are being censored more often, but I don&#x27;t really believe that this is the primary thing driving them away. They view Twitter as a left institution, and view its users as primarily leaning left. As the American culture war continues to escalate, more institutions (and companies, and websites) get dragged into it. The entity in question &quot;must&quot; be either right or left. Even COVID-19 has taken a very partisan bent in this climate.')
