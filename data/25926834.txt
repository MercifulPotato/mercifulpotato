The annotations themselves are optional. That&#x27;s just gradual typing[0], and it doesn&#x27;t &quot;break&quot; the zen of python any more than having the choice of using a class over free functions in your program.<p>The meme going around that Python is adding so many features that it&#x27;s becoming something &quot;not python&quot; is super weird to me, and it appears as though it&#x27;s propagated since the walrus operator discussion and hasn&#x27;t really gone away.<p>All popular languages add features and adapt as new tools, methodologies, and learnings pop up from other communities. This is a <i>good thing</i> (subjective, I guess), and in general I find Python to be somewhat restrained.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gradual_typing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gradual_typing</a>')
