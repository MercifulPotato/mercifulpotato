I think from my list this is the closest issue to being resolved, if I could consistantly get 800km range (in real world usage, not &quot;800km in the brochure but actually 400km in real life&quot;) it would be fine because (1) with such a long range the risk of having to recharge multiple time on a single journey is fairly small, thus reducing the inconvenience [assuming one can charge at home or work, otherwise recharging will always be a pain in the butt regardless of how you look at it] (2) it&#x27;s enough to cross &quot;charging station deserts&quot;, areas where inevitably there will be little to no charging infrastructure (see the charging stations on french highways for reference, recharging is just as expensive as refueling and the charging stations don&#x27;t even work reliably).<p>* A large segment of the EV market is made of cars that remind me more of technological gadgets than proper vehicules. I have very little patience to deal with technology and I certainly don&#x27;t want my car to be basically a software platform. I shouldn&#x27;t get angry before bed time but I&#x27;m still going to mention the privacy aspect of it. Having SIM cards embedded in every car is bad enough already but at least with the more traditional &quot;analog&quot; cars you can give the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt that the SIM card is only activated in case of accident. Most EV cars lift the doubt by collecting analytics and installing software updates remotely. One day there will be a data breach and everywhere you&#x27;ve ever been with your car will be free for the general public to see. Even worse, a malicious actor gets a hold of the manufacturer&#x27;s private key and can push arbitrary updates to your car.<p>* Most charging networks (I&#x27;m tempted to say &quot;all&quot; because I&#x27;ve never seen an instance where it wasn&#x27;t the case, but again let&#x27;s give the benefit of the doubt) are basically spying networks that require an account and a credit card to use. Someone (everybody once there&#x27;s a data breach) knows everytime&#x2F;everywhere you recharge your car, how much you used since your last charge, etc. Why can&#x27;t we just pay cash for, say, $10 worth of electricity just as we do with ICE cars?<p>I believe the first point will be solved in a relatively near future because it&#x27;s mostly a matter of improving the technology a bit (or paying more for a bigger battery). For the two last points however I only see things getting worse since the current trend is to go further and further in this &quot;everything as a digital service&quot; direction.')
