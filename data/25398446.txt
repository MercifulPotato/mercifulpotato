Item(by='Sebb767', descendants=None, kids=[25398681, 25398729, 25398535], score=None, time=1607783780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398356, text='&gt; Something like H.264 which is used by practically everything shouldnâ€™t cost money to just look at the standard.<p>While I generally agree, it sounds a bit like &quot;if you&#x27;re successful, you&#x27;re not allowed to earn money&quot;. It&#x27;s a piece of work, still, and the creators should be allowed to earn money with it.<p>I&#x27;d personally prefer if all standards are free, since especially with an obscure one you&#x27;re SOL when it&#x27;s locked behind a paywall; with H.264, you can probably find a way around. But its hard to combine that with intellectual property. Limiting the patent timeframe to five or ten years might be a good middle ground.')
