Has <i>that</i> claim been debunked?<p>If you are simply saying that the evidence isn&#x27;t strong enough to say one way or another, fine.  But &quot;roundly debunked&quot; means, at least to me, that there has been an investigation and that the factual claims have in some way been shown to be false.  That, to my knowledge, hasn&#x27;t actually happened.<p>And sure, &quot;anyone can make up random nonsense&quot;, but these claims aren&#x27;t being made by &quot;anyone&quot;, but by people with closeness to the situation that not just anyone can claim.  And they aren&#x27;t random nonsense; they are part of a pattern of explaining how a family has become fabulously rich on a 176k salary.')
