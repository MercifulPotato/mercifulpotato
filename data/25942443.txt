Investors took it too far and short sold over 100% of the stocks in a company, ironically creating ideal conditions for a bubble.  As soon as GameStop&#x27;s stock turned upward, the rampant short selling resulted in a demand for more than 100% the supply of GameStop&#x27;s stock, resulting in a meteoric rise in price.<p>But how is this market manipulation?  The rise in stock price has nothing to do with an artificial overestimation of GameStop&#x27;s value.  It&#x27;s just fundamental supply and demand.  If anything, the short sellers are the ones who manipulated the market when they started shorting over 100% of the stock supply.<p>Like I said, I&#x27;m a complete noob when it comes to the stock market.  Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding something?')
