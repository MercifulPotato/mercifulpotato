My mail comes to personal domain and managed by Fastmail. Gmail is just a POP3\nclient for reading. My photos are synchronised via PhotoSync to my NAS and then I upload selected albums to Google Photoes for convenience of sharing. I didn&#x27;t do anything similar with files and Google Drive because File Explorer on iOS can sync with my NAS. Everything is local first.<p>The result is that I can still enjoy the technology but I can drop it at any moment.<p>I don&#x27;t use Chrome browser on iOS because ands blocking doesn&#x27;t work there.<p>The plan now is to switch to android phone start supports large SD cards and install syncthing on it to be fully local-first.')
