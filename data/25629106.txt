Email delivery latency: depending on the service you use, the time it takes to deliver emails to the user can vary. Worst case I encountered was up to 20 minutes delay when there were issues with Mailgun.<p>2. Usability: you have to leave your current app and switch to your mail client. You may be on a device where you don&#x27;t have a mail client installed at all, so you have to provide a password login option as well.<p>3. The sign in dialog gets more complicated and it&#x27;s hard to explain to users how it works as it is not all that common. This also had effects on sign up&#x2F;sign in dialog design which we found to have a negative impact on conversion rates.')
