You can send GBs videos and it will be stored and downloadable on any device from anywhere. It&#x27;s like on a Dropbox or Drive. This costs a lot of money.<p>On the other hand, I think Signal doesn&#x27;t store anything once it has been delivered and any backup will have to be made on separate via some DropBox or Drive.<p>So the cost should be far far less than Telegram')
