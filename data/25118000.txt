Right now with COVID, the risk is low, so we don&#x27;t have anywhere near a universal response to that risk. But, as you slide right along the risk scale toward &quot;really risky&quot;, you&#x27;ll see more and more of the population self-selecting to not play the risky game. I am merely proposing that people be able to choose their responses based off their risk tolerance. The problem with doing anything else, is that you make policy that will have winners and losers. A good example is the current school shutdown. We have millions of families with two working adults that rely on the school system in the United States to both educate and to supervise their kids while they are working. Those kids are now self-educating using remote learning techniques while parents are at work. When viewed in aggregate, that cohort of kids are just about guaranteed to have a lower overall outcome in life compared to the cohort where the family earned enough income to have one parent stay home.<p>Rushing school closures is one thing (it&#x27;s a policy that when made early in a pandemic with unknown risks, can be reversed once risk factors are more understood). Rushing novel vaccines out is another, it&#x27;s not something that can be reversed.<p>Life is risky. I am not trying to argue that COVID isn&#x27;t real, that masks infringe on my liberties, etc etc. I am just trying to say that there are direct and indirect consequences to policies, and a general rule of thumb that I and millions of your fellow citizens use when developing our opinions on topics, is that personal liberties are a fantastic tiebreaker.')
