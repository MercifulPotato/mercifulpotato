Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25119234], score=None, time=1605570998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118627, text='&gt; Assuming you&#x27;re referring only to the §1201 &#x27;anticircumvention&#x27; portion of the claim (the main focus of the GitHub post), whether this portion is _also_ subject to §512 rules is a little more ambiguous. §1201 defines a trafficking violation separate from copyright infringement itself, but some court rulings have established a requirement that §1201 violations establish a &#x27;nexus&#x27; to copyright infringement in order to be valid. If this is true, the §512 safe harbor protections could indirectly cover §1201 claims as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think that even if the first is true, the second is true: even the courts that hold the &quot;nexus&quot; position don&#x27;t, AFAIK, hold that Sec. 1201 liability requires that the trafficker be <i>already liable for contributory infringement</i>, only that there be a connection of the trafficked circumvention measure to infringement.<p>OTOH, if its not covered by the safe harbor provision, that doesn&#x27;t mean notice of the violation is irrelevant; knowledge is explicitly relevant to one route to liability under Sec. 1201, and arguably necessary for any of the others; notice potentially take the host from being an exploited bystander to a liable trafficker, provided that they do not take action to end the trafficking on their platform.')
