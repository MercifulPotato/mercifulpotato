There first is casual. The second is observational. (I guess you could make a semantic argument that &quot;can&#x27;t do science&quot; means like &quot;are unable to due to environmental factors&quot; and is thus also ultimately observational, but that&#x27;s not particularly convincing in the context of scientific research).')
