IKEA has a range of qualities of course, but let me tell you about the shitty, shitty particle board kmart? shelves my mom bought in the 70s and moved 5-10 times with over the years.  Around 2005 we&#x27;d had enough and drug them into the parking lot, and did an &quot;Office Space printer job&quot; to them with hammers.<p>Was cheap as hell and supported heavy books and CRT TV for thirty years.  The durability being too low wasn&#x27;t the problem.<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re in a refurbished hundred year old house and it deserves some dignified antiques sure, but for the rest of us IKEA is just fine.  We even have a 15 year old very cheap Lack table in the corner.')
