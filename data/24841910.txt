If you want a different implementation for a different data type to get the best performance, writing one method makes that hard.<p>&gt; The `Measurements` author very specifically (if I understand this right) implemented a `plot` functionality.<p>This is a good point. But in that example, note that `Measurements` also works with all of differential equations, and they didn&#x27;t implement any differential equations specific code, unlike as you pointed out with `plot`. The fact that uncertainty propagates through a differential equation solver is pretty impressive, imo.')
