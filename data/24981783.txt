Yet this is <i>never</i> covered in any media ever. It&#x27;s no different here in the US. And then some states like CA have truly bizarre things like &quot;no-fault&quot; (I think that&#x27;s the term) marriages where after 10 years of marriage, the woman can initiate divorce for whatever reason and it always results in their receiving 50% of the husband&#x27;s assets, and alimony, and the husband has no recourse at all (you can see many examples of this in celebrity marriages throughout the years).')
