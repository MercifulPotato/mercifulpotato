Its not the end of the world but you lose the benefits when you&#x27;re operating on a single large object in that style.<p>The reason you would use this setup is so you have all your data in contiguous arrays you can SIMD through quickly.  If you&#x27;re doing a lot of operations where n is low then its not that useful (and even detrimental) to orient your data array-wise.')
