Eg, my current CPU is a Sandy Bridge.  When the i series came out I wanted one badly, but I waited and on the first week of launch bought second gen.<p>The same with the upcoming Macbooks set to be demoed on the 10th.  If I want one, I&#x27;ll wait for at least second gen.<p>Regarding AMD CPUs this is an unusual situation, because 3rd gen or 4th gen may be optimal, which is highly uncommon.  This is because next gen will run on faster ram.  The bottleneck on the Zen 2 processors was cache delays.  The bottleneck on the Zen 3 processors is ram delay.  This shows to me there is more improvements to come.  However, unfortunately, this also means cost will go up quite a bit in newer generations with smaller gains making it not as worth it.  I don&#x27;t game much and I do data science work, so processing is done in the cloud, so I have virtually no reason to upgrade my nearly 10 year old CPU as odd as that may sound.')
