In both cases the stated goal of the protests was not to &quot;break stuff&quot; so if that ends up happening, is that the protest&#x27;s fault?<p>&gt; There&#x27;s also a difference between a protestor throwing a firework at a courthouse and taking tactical gear and weapons with a couple hundred buddies into a legislature.<p>What about armed protestors forcibly ejecting police from a section of the city and setting up a police-free zone?<p>&gt; This equivalence between BLM and the mobbing of the Capitol is confusing to be because it&#x27;s so obviously a false one.<p>It&#x27;s not equivalent, just similar. In both cases peaceful protesting of perceived injustice is the stated goal, and in both cases bad actors go renegade and break down rule-of-law.')
