The vast majority of my ideas are not ideas for new businesses, though a few are.<p>The idea I&#x27;m testing in this thread is, &quot;looking at successful businesses, how would rigid Lean Startup practices have worked in their early days?&quot;<p>Tinyseed isn&#x27;t terribly interesting to me in this context since they have a very narrow SaaS focus, none of them have had an IPO and Rob has a large podcast he uses to promote the companies. It&#x27;s a great strategy on his part, but it makes it much harder to figure to know how much the success of companies they invest in is due to their ideas.<p>Something similar could be said of Jason Calicanis&#x27;s launch.co, though I bet it will have some massive wins in the next few years.')
