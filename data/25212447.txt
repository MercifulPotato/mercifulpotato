A heat gun, thermal glue, prying tools, magnifier, a rework station, and you&#x27;re good to go.<p>Everything being soldered on one board is a real travesty - a failed system board on a new laptop means you throw away the CPU, GPU, RAM and even the SSD.<p>That just seems insane to me, a laptop that&#x27;s a few mm thinner is not worth it, I&#x27;d rather have the CPU socketed, GPU, RAM and storage slotted.<p>People with laptops that use MXM slots are upgrading from Kepler GPUs to Maxwell, Pascal and newer, everyone else is buying whole new machines. What a waste.<p>But that might actually make it cheaper to fix or upgrade BGA chips since you can buy the whole failed system board pretty cheap. Just gotta have the right tools.')
