It only has number.<p>On the format itself, I wonder if it needs some testing and hardening. The definition seems ambiguous, but maybe just needs a formal grammar. Just from reading it, tab handling seems like an issue. I think you could have documents that look right but have invisible issues due to tabs. E.g., it sounds like tab can be a character in a dictionary key name, which looks like indentation.')
