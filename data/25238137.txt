Item(by='moooo99', descendants=None, kids=[25239148, 25238230], score=None, time=1606577680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25237902, text='&gt; the assumption you&#x27;d always use a car.<p>which seems like a reasonable assumption for anyone<p>- living in a rural area\n- living only close to a city but not within\n- city parts with poor public transport connections<p>Also, the kind of product also heavily influences that. For more specialized products, people tend to be willing to drive longer distances, therefore making the carbon emissions worse. If the store doesn&#x27;t carry the item but has to order it first, it also means you double the round trips. Overall, Amazon certainly has a massive environmental impact, including GHG emissions, but in terms of emissions, everyone going to the store by themselves wouldn&#x27;t really be a better option I imagine.')
