The closest you could do would be to choose Swiss time for the sake of it (or UTC if you prefer).<p>Remember also that the clock will be out of sync if you set it server-side, because of latency between the server and client. This inaccuracy would doubtless besmirch the name of Swiss timepieces. Could be fun hooking into TCP and TLS negotiation to estimate latency in order to compensate in the animation-delay and make it probabilistically more accurate. Now <i>that</i> would be a fun article to read. I’m almost tempted to devise a way to do this myself. I suspect I couldn’t get the necessary information through my standard nginx reverse proxying arrangement and would need to serve the CSS from a different port so that I could handle the negotiation in a process of my own and observe the timings.')
