However, for the features that are most likely to be necessary, the costs and terms are not all that unreasonable and Microsoft does do their Business level plans without an annual contract.<p>Further, the costs between GSuite and O365 are comparable, while features are disproportionately in Microsoft&#x27;s favor. Whether those features are needed or not, is a legitimate question to ask though.<p>Can you be a little more specific about the artificially broken products and lock-in effects are you referring to? I have not experienced those types of issues with any of the O365 tenants I set-up and currently manage.')
