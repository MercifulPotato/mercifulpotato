Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=[24880502], score=None, time=1603544123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24878170, text='&gt; Some people may come back and say not to join such companies but pick wiser, but the harsh reality is that most of these startups founders are narcissistic and would sell you out for a dollar.<p>That may be the case but there is a world of difference between what you are describing and every hypergrowth Series B+ company with reputable top tier VCs I&#x27;ve worked at. Maybe part of the problem is the &quot;non-tech semi startup&quot; part -- tech startups, while still having founders who &quot;would sell you out for a dollar&quot; must nonetheless participate in a labor market which is biased in their counterparty&#x27;s favor.<p>Why is this the case? The counterparty can work at a FAANG&#x2F;newly public company, a quant fund&#x2F;finance, and so there are bidders from multiple industries who want the top tier talent. Are you a technical employee or a non-technical employee? If the latter, have you considered making a transition towards working in a tech startup for better mobility, if you want to work in startups at all? I have run into all kinds of shenanigans in my tech startup employee days, but the general quality of life at the good companies was the best I&#x27;ve ever had.')
