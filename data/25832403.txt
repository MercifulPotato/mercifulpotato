Not because &quot;I feel this is the right think to do&quot;, but my body isn&#x27;t leaving me any other choice. Ofc assuming the decision to stop or keep going isn&#x27;t influenced by peer pressure.<p>I&#x27;ve once come home with bleeding nipples (chafed by a new white Asics running top) so badly that it looked like I had been shot on the trail and the bleeding wouldn&#x27;t even stop in the shower. It was pain far worse than a sprained ankle or broken leg.<p>In your analogy I&#x27;d consider a sprained ankle &quot;bad&quot; pain while the chafed nips &quot;good pain&quot;. Severity of pain might not be the most reliable indicator in mid-range pain levels. But it&#x27;s always reliable when it dominates over a strong will. Basically you always know when you&#x27;re _done_. Peer pressure is a dangerous cloud in judgement here which is why I hate doing these things competitively or with friends (one always ends up the sparing partner of the other).')
