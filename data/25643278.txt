Many, many stores were open, many workplaces were deemed essential, masks were not generally worn in the first phase of the lockdowns, and while indoor dining at restaurants was closed, indoor dining at your friend&#x27;s house was wide open.<p>The three places that I know of that have gotten cases to zero are China, New Zealand, and Australia, and they all used lockdowns that were far stricter than in the U.S.<p>The problem is that a soft lockdown doesn&#x27;t bring R low enough to eradicate the virus quickly, and people won&#x27;t stomach it dragging on for months.  I also don&#x27;t believe that it can be done on the honor system.  There must be police writing tickets or worse for violations, or there is a segment of the population that will ignore whatever measures that are enacted.  Unfortunately sometimes these are even identifiable groups of people that all socialize together in violation of health orders, so the virus will spread within these communities regardless of whatever the governor puts on a piece of paper and makes a speech about.')
