There is also statutory warranty, and other parts of consumer law, which can include rules on basic expectations of how <i>that category of consumer item</i> is expected to perform (I&#x27;m not talking CPU speeds, but major issues like a keyboard fundamentally not working at a reasonable success rate), how long it&#x27;s reasonably expected to work without failing (for that category of item), and so on.<p>Very broad principles, but with some clear examples provided by consumer bodies to consumers, and it&#x27;s reviewed on a case by case basis. You can bring it to the proverbial small claims court (or consumer complaint body), and they can review the claim.<p>I suppose I just won&#x27;t bring up this matter to HN before. It&#x27;s too alien to the US consumer situation and mustn&#x27;t apply to most readers here.')
