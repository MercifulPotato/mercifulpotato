I see younger people learning lessons that I learned 20 years ago right here on HN. It&#x27;s not that they are stupid, ignorant, or didnt get the memo way back then. It&#x27;s that learning is a life long adventure and they aren&#x27;t as far along yet. Ok, so they did just get the memo but because they were 5 when I read it, and it&#x27;s been around far longer than that.')
