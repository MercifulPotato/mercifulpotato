If tether goes away that would hurt whomever believes it&#x27;s worth a dollar. The exchanges who are in on the scam can trade tether back to USD if they need to when the tether company sells their bitcoin for a profit. But the exchanges also make a killing from increased business during this mania, so they may choose not to sell their useless tether since they are collecting real money from retail traders and might help with plausible deniability.')
