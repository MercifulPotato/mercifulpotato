I talked my department head into okaying the first week as virtual only and then just kept it that way. Had a pretty great semester too. The rate never went down much lower than 8% on our campus. They did very little random testing.<p>I’m just a grad student without any kids yet, so I could afford to worst case lose my position— but I worry about those who are pressured into in the classroom for no real reason apart from some admin feeling students want that experience.')
