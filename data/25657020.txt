Imagine you set up two detectors at two locations. Imagine further that the schrodinger equation shows that the particle has the same non-0 amplitude at both locations.<p>Nevertheless, you will NEVER see both detectors detect the same particle. You know with 100% certainty that if one detector &quot;saw&quot; the particle, the other one didn&#x27;t (this is true regardless of how far apart the detectors are).<p>Furthermore, imagine an experiment like this:<p>1. A particle P1 is fired, and it has some amplitude at locations Det1 and Det2.<p>2. At location Det1, a second particle P2 is made to collide with P1; the collision will  throw P2 towards location Det3.<p>Now, the correct probability of finding P2 at location Det3 depends on whether Det1&#x2F;Det2 are activated. If Det1 detects P1, the probability for P2 to reach Det3 is 0, but this is inconsistent with the Schrodinger equation for P1 and P2. To make the results consistent with observations, you must update the wave function for P1 and P2 after Det1 has detected P1.<p>Now, the MWI tries to circumvent this by postulating that both results happen at the same time, just in different worlds; and that Det3 becomes entangled with Det1, so their results are perfectly correlated. But that runs into other problems, both philosophical (how could the other worlds be &quot;real&quot; if they are fundamentally undetectable) and formal (e.g. it is not yet agreed that a consistent, non-circular definition for probability in the face of many worlds can be given that is consistent with the observed probabilities computed according to the Born rule).<p>Edit: I should also mention that without the Born rule, if Det1 and Det2 were both going to launch a satellite if they detected P1, then both satellites would have some amplitude in orbit; and you would start expecting to see the gravity of both satellites, which breaks off with experimental observations even more sharply.')
