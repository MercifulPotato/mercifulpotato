Half of all COVID deaths in the US by early May were in the Boston-DC metropolis.  The per capita death rate for NYC, even after almost no COVID deaths over the last two months, is still 1 in 570, 4x the national rate of 1 in 2300 (along with NJ; CT, RI, MA and LA round out the list of &lt;1 in 1000).<p>Also NYC hit a hospitalization rate of 1 in 700 at the peak.  Legitimate forecasts had hospitalization rates potentially blowing out available capacity.   The worst State hospitalization rate now is 1 in 4600, 6x better.<p>On the other hand, consider the threshold for “just a bad flu” to be twice the per capita death rate from the 17-18 flu season (CDC upper estimate of 1 in 5000, so 1 in 2500). Then half of the US states are still in the “just a bad flu” or better six months on.  And even that skewing to the old.  Nine states haven’t reached the 1 in 5000 level of the 17-18 flu after 6 months.  So, for a lot of the US, their experience was, and continues to be, different than the East Coast and certain key cities like Detroit and St Louis.  My numbers say 30% of the US population is in this category.')
