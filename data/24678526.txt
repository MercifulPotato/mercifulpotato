I felt similarly for the first few months of WFH, but I think that was because I had it in my head that WFH was temporary. I&#x27;ve now accepted (and been told as much by management) that WFH is going to be the norm going forward.<p>I obviously don&#x27;t need as much human interaction as you or other people I work with, because we have a system which allows a small number of people into the office per day if they want to work in the office, and it&#x27;s always the same people. I haven&#x27;t availed of it once.<p>I think all this is just showing what a lot of people already knew: the one-size-fits-all 9-5 way of working really didn&#x27;t work for everyone. The company I work for (Arm) have been really great about the whole situation in accommodating people&#x27;s different circumstances and I&#x27;m hopeful for the future.')
