Item(by='giovannibonetti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603820523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909833, text='Right now the link attached is outdated and only shows release notes until the version 315.0.0. However, after running manually `gcloud components update` you can see that version 316.0.0 (2020-10-27) mentions &quot;Promoted Postgres 13 to GA&quot; in the Cloud SQL section. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find any other link with more updated information.<p>That was very unexpected to me, because up until now I hadn&#x27;t seen any mention of PG 13 even being in beta. That&#x27;s great, since I was planning on upgrading a database to PG 12 this week, and now I can go straight to PG 13!')
