They were a group I used to look down on because of the lack of rigor in their work, but recently I have come to realize that the problem is that the atomic unit of their domain (a human mind) is orders of magnitude more complex than that atomic units of all my favorite disciplines (physics: forces, chemistry: actual atoms, programming: instructions). While people like myself dismiss the problem (read: run away from it), they at least possess the fortitude to attempt it, even while stumbling.')
