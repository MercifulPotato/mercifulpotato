I&#x27;m of the belief that Americans aren&#x27;t obese because they&#x27;re lazy or because they&#x27;re gluttons; instead, I believe it&#x27;s the food that&#x27;s killing us. Processed food especially.<p>When I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I had to switch to a low-cab diet (which cut out a huge swath of processed foods), and I dropped from 170 lbs. to 150 lbs. in a few weeks. And I wasn&#x27;t trying to lose weightâ€”it just came off.')
