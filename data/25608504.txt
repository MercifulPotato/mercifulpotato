Once something is backdoored by X, it can be accessed not only by X, but also by anyone who managed to hack into X. This is one of the main objections against adding backdoors (no matter how they are named, a backdoor doesn&#x27;t stop being a backdoor just because you named it a &quot;front door&quot;) to cryptographic protocols; even if you try to somehow make it so only &quot;good guys&quot; can use the backdoor, the &quot;good guys&quot; can be compromised (through technical or social means) by the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<p>As an example, many telephony systems around the world have backdoors meant to be used only by local police. In a well-known case in Europe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%9305" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2...</a>), these backdoors were exploited by agents of a foreign country.')
