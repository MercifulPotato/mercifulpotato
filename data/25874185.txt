There&#x27;s no actual economic linkage here, which means that Google&#x27;s payments to the news organizations are actually a tax that skips the public coffers and goes straight to the news owners. But it&#x27;s no different than if the government levied a tax specifically on Google and paid the whole of that tax to the news orgs. Both approaches make an equal amount of economic sense.<p>Personally I think it would make much more sense to raise a general corporate profit tax, and use the proceeds of that tax to pay the news. But there&#x27;s a convenient devil to extract money from, so there it is.')
