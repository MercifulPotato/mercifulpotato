That never works out well. Since you mention Turkey, look at the current government&#x27;s suppression of journalism. Freedom of expression must be protected as a legal right to maintain democracy.<p>On the other hand, freedom of expression includes the freedom not to facilitate other people&#x27;s speech if you choose. I fully support the Parler people&#x27;s right to propagate whatever bullshit they like as long as it isn&#x27;t planning or inciting crimes. Equally I completely support Twitter, Facebook, AWS, etc&#x27;s right to choose what they do and do not allow on their platforms. That&#x27;s freedom too.<p>This is all part of the process of civil discourse. However uncivil it might seem right now, it&#x27;s something we all need to work out as free citizens.')
