They severely undervalue the risks of the various diseases, and severely overvalue the risks of the vaccines, and land in the wrong conclusion that every single vaccine therefore is bad for you.<p>But they&#x27;re not wrong in making that risk analysis in the first place.<p>I do not belong to a risk group for covid-19. I don&#x27;t live with anyone in a risk group, I don&#x27;t hang out with people in a risk group or even meet with them. So I don&#x27;t mind being at the back of the line for this vaccine, the risk of the disease is negligible to me, while the risk of the vaccine is unknown. I don&#x27;t mind waiting and seeing what happens after millions of people have gotten the vaccine before I get it myself. That minimizes the risk to me.<p>But my dad belongs to a risk group, so for him the same risk analysis gets a different result, because his risk of dying is <i>a hundred times</i> greater than my risk of dying. So he will try to get vaccinated as soon as he can, as he should.')
