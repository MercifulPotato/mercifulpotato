It&#x27;s a clean, low overhead abstraction, easy to visualise (and thus discuss with others), easy to change structurally or in the &quot;aspect oriented&quot; way.<p>Examples in JVM world: Netty pipelines, AKKA actors, streams, and graphs, in C++ world ASIO &amp; its executors sub-framework.<p>Queues&#x2F;Threads is still a sufficiently low level to comfortably operate on.')
