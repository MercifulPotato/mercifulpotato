I can say the same thing (12 years with similar hours. I imagine I am younger than you) but I don&#x27;t have anything monetary gain and absolutely no work experience to show for it. No family and spent most of those years working out of a car. I am currently about to be evicted and have made most of  my money flipping things and working service jobs and I will never pay off my student loans (which was promised to paid by backstabbing parents) because I spent 15 years as a professional application applier only to never get a job. I will most likely never have a family because of this. I am 35 and haven&#x27;t really started any life that is worth calling a life. I am just a slave to the system and shitty people in my life.<p>But please do tell me rich person that I should smile and be happy.')
