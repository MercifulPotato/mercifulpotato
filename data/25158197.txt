Idea: would it be possible to design a system where we distribute a membership fee to open source projects used?<p>Let&#x27;s say NPM would cost $10 &#x2F; month per end-user. This would be redistributed to all the packages you use. (Or, similarly, cumulative membership fees will be distributed according to # of projects that re-use your package).<p>Have there been experiments like this? Any thoughts?')
