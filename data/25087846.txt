Only the most stupid refuse to get tested, usually in uneducated remote areas, not trusting the press (good), the government (good), but also not their teachers and doctors.<p>In the famous Coburg outbreak 2001 it was an anthroposophic school (Waldorf), infection rate 1000 of 200.000, no one died. In all subsequent outbreaks it was always such a school. The virus is transported from Waldorf School to Waldorf School with an average vaccination rate of only 60% compared to 90% elsewhere. Hence it could not jump over to the neighboring districts. Why these schools are not yet forbidden is interesting. But you can safely call it a Waldorf illness.')
