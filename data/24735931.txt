So if you use a &quot;free&quot; server, it means you&#x27;ve selected a public server like matrix.org or privacytools.io or whoever.  These servers are hosted philanthropically for the benefit of the overall network (e.g. Matrix.org&#x27;s hosting is paid for via Patreon: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;patreon.com&#x2F;matrixdotorg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;patreon.com&#x2F;matrixdotorg</a>).<p>If enough organisations run their own servers and make them available to their users for free, then you could indeed support the online billions.  Instead, much like email, we already see a mix of free services (the equivalent of hotmail, gmail etc) and paid services (the equivalent of g-suite, protonmail, etc).')
