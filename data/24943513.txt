Eighteen of these events occurred in real life, while 29 were in simulation.<p>If they drove 6,100,000 real miles and ~5,000,000,000 simulation miles, and had 18 real contacts and ~29 simulated contacts - that <i>strongly</i> indicates their simulation is not representative of reality.<p>Edit:  My (old, now changed) numbers were wrong but my theory was right!<p>So they drove 6,100,000 real miles and had 18 real contacts.  Between June 2019 and April 2020 they drove ~5,000,000,000 simulated miles and had ~29 simulated contacts.<p>So their simulator is 3 orders of magnitude safer than the real world.  The only number that&#x27;s really fuzzy here is 29 - the number of simulated contacts (because the dates don&#x27;t match up perfectly, as this report from Waymo started counting in January 2019).  But no matter how you slice it, there is clearly no way the simulated miles are representative of reality.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;waymo-has-now-driven-10-billion-autonomous-miles-in-simulation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;waymo-has-now-driven-10-bi...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.waymo.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;off-road-but-not-offline--simulation27.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.waymo.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;off-road-but-not-offline--sim...</a>')
