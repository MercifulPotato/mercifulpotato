We&#x27;re looking for feedback on [Dabble](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabble.style" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabble.style</a>), an e-commerce solution we are building that lets you visualize and design your living room with furniture from multiple stores at once.<p>Here&#x27;s the background:<p>Shopping for furniture online is like stepping into the black hole of the internet. I recently moved into a new place (during the lockdown). I spent weeks browsing tons of online stores trying to find things that would match and look good in my room, only to buy nothing. On top of all that, I found the same products being sold by multiple vendors at hugely varying prices.<p>So we decided to try and fix this by looking at how people shop for furniture in-person. When you&#x27;re in a store like IKEA, it&#x27;s easy to visualize how things might look together, but it&#x27;s hard to explore a lot of options. On the flip side, shopping online seems like it should be easy, but feels like stepping into a warehouse full of furniture as far as the eye can see.<p>We&#x27;re trying to pull the best parts of a showroom experience into an online tool.<p>One aspect is being able to see how multiple items look in a room together. We built a furniture collection generator that shows you multiple items together in a living room setting. One tap of the space bar presents a new living room collection instantly.<p>Another aspect is customizability. Dabble allows you to swap out furniture in any of the collections to create and save your own combinations. Don&#x27;t like the lamp we show you? No problem, swap it with one of the hundreds we have.<p>Our thesis is that if we can solve these problems, we can build a much better furniture shopping experience than anything out there today.<p>Feedback? Questions? Ideas? We&#x27;re all ears!')
