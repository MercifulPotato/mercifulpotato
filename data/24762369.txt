It&#x27;s extremely quiet, inside and out.  I do not recommend it for areas that go well below freezing, though.  I want to say the unit is rated down to 20F<p>I believe it comes in mini-split varieties but I did not choose that option as it was more expensive and I didn&#x27;t like the aesthetics.')
