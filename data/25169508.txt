That makes it more difficult to find daylight-time outside on a working day, and the city is in winter mood (fewer people wandering outside in the evening) so it feels more lonely.<p>I changed the light in my office from a normal (for home), &quot;warm&quot; bulb to a 1500lm 6300K &quot;daylight&quot; one, which helps. It no longer feels like I ought to be relaxing at 15:45.<p>I&#x27;m also going to make more effort to just cycle or walk around outside over lunchtime.  Both things were easier when working at the office -- it felt like a &quot;work&quot; place with bright lights and big windows, and I couldn&#x27;t avoid the outside-time to get there.')
