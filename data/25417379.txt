UK has average speed cameras as well and they are horrible. Every time I drive in average speed zones I spend more time looking down because<p>1) I don&#x27;t want to go 5mi over the speed limit because I will get fined otherwise\n2) I don&#x27;t want to go 5mi below the speed limit because then drivers behind me have to break one by one which eventually causes a traffic jam\n3) I can&#x27;t overtake a lorry going 65 because it would take me too long and I might miss my exit, which then makes anxious because I have to extend my commute time if I get stuck behind one\n4) I can&#x27;t safely let people merge onto the motorway because if I speed up or slow down then 1) or 2) happen\n5) I can&#x27;t calculate my average speed and to avoid 1) and 2) I have to keep looking down not paying much attention to what&#x27;s going on around me<p>This only works on roads with little traffic, like in Scotland, where you can set cruise control and drive for miles. It doesn&#x27;t work in Cambridge where AADT is ten times higher.<p>&quot;These systems are safer for police and drivers as there are no traffic stops for speeding.&quot;<p>You are comparing average speed cameras to traffic stops, rather than stationary speed traps...<p>&quot;Can speed cameras be used as a revenue source? Yes.&quot;<p>No because the primary reason for speed cameras is ensuring road safety, not generating revenue in which case you are encouraging installing speed cameras where they are not required. Speed cameras are not as safe you believe they are, otherwise they would be installed every 100 metres.<p>&quot;Beyond that, if you don&#x27;t want to get a fine, don&#x27;t speed.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s like saying &quot;if you have nothing to hide, you don&#x27;t need privacy&quot; using the same &quot;don&#x27;t do the crime, if you can&#x27;t do the time&quot; principle, which is flawed. There are plenty of situations where you would want to occasionally speed 10% over the speed limit, but that&#x27;s not equal to speeding 100% over the speed limit for a very long time. Both will get you a fine. It&#x27;s not as simple as black or white.')
