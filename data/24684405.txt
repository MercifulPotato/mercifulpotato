We want them to be broken. ... There&#x27;s no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren&#x27;t enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What&#x27;s there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt.&quot;')
