I read articles in the past mentioning that you will see &quot;trains&quot; of dozens of white dots one behind another in the sky.<p>Do we currently see satellites in a dark summer night? \nYes. So for Starlink it will be the same, except with 10 of them one behind another.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to read more sources confirming or infirming this.')
