Bringing that strategy to the PC market was bound to happen and it&#x27;s likely going to work extraordinarily well for their share holders if performance&#x2F;productivity benefits (from Apple Silicon) at low-mid end forces traditional PC consumers to Mac.<p>On the consumer perspective, Would we accept a $1000 PC couple of years back with no means to install other Operating System (Officially), Only 3-5 years of updates(if lucky), Use only manufacturer approved apps, Repair only at their approved centres?<p>Then why did we accept it to be a norm for &gt;$1000 smartphones?<p>We made them smell money with our consumer decisions to trade &#x27;freedom in computation&#x27; in smartphones and it&#x27;s now coming to haunt us with personal computers. The line between Smartphones and PCs have been blurred with Apple Silicon, Google will do it with their Chromebooks(which was already happening even without their custom silicon [Update cycle, Locked boot-loaders etc.]) and Microsoft with their Surface line up.')
