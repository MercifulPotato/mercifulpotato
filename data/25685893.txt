There is, however, a good proof that they do: Tether has held the 1:1 beg pretty well recently. Bitcoin price dropped to $4.000 last year and Tether exchange rate has held pretty well. It is important to mention that USDT is still liquid despite the lack of USD on&#x2F;off-ramps. People regularly sell USDT on the offline market, and can exchange to USDC on many exchanges.<p>&gt; But Tether is printing so much money.<p>So is USDC, and the price of Bitcoin is going higher. This means Bitcoiners have lots of value in Bitcoin and some of them are going to convert that value to USD. They are mainly using USDT for that, for whatever reason.<p>&gt; Tether printing press is driving Bitcoin price.<p>Wrong. My proof for that is &quot;where is the premium to buy Bitcoin&quot;. In a very liquid market (which for the most part, crypto is), prices should be the same up to the costs (transaction and banking fees). Prices have been higher in Coinbase during this run. As I am typing right now, Coinbase prices are 50-80 dollars higher for Bitcoin. GBTC is even more ridiculous with 10-15% premium on price (but also GBTC is less liquid&#x2F;arb-able). This signifies that demand is coming from US retail and institutional investors.<p>&gt; Tether is holding USD as securities&#x2F;derivatives&#x2F;whatever.<p>All of them are.
