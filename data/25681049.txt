They were waving flags with <i>a single man&#x27;s name on them</i> and planting them at the capitol. That stinks of <i>monarchy</i>, <i>dictatorship</i>. <i>after</i> protocols <i>had already been followed</i> to reverify election results (Georgia had <i>3</i> recounts for god&#x27;s sake!)<p>To echo a phrase of the insurrectionist&#x27;s holy savior there were &quot;rioters on both sides&quot;.<p>Where were these impassioned &quot;patriots&quot; in 2016 when there was an election with <i>evidence</i> of manipulation by a <i>foreign power</i>. They were nowhere to be found, you know why? Because their allegiance isn&#x27;t to the country who&#x27;s founding and raison d&#x27;etre is the rejection of rule by a single absolute power, their allegiance is to an incompetent fool who wants to turn one of the only successful democratic countries into a dictatorship.<p>Think about intentions.
