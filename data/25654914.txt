In that case the security goal could be seen as forcing the compiled program to behave in a way close to what a human writer (or reader) would expect, while this method gets around that. So in that way, it could still be a problem, because the programmer appeared to write specialized program X but it can potentially be induced to behave like unrelated program Y at run time.')
