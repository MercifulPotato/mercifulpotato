Specifically, the SaaS grab Eliot mentions.<p>Unfortunately I wasn’t involved in the discussions with Amazon, so I don’t want to speculate on details or mislead anybody. I can say that MongoDB absolutely had a relationship with Amazon prior the SaaS grab. I believe Amazon was the largest deployment target for MDB’s cloud service (which runs on most major cloud platforms).<p>That said, the reason I say Amazon is blatantly misleading people is that the authors of the blog post chose a definition of “open source” that fits their argument against Elastic. They state companies that use SSPL software may have to give up their entire source code, which simply isn’t the case. It’s not even as restrictive as the GPL (the FSF has a different definition of open source). Please note that the OSI doesn’t consider any GPL license open source.<p>Honestly, the only accurate definition of open source is that the source code is available to the public. That means we can modify the software, learn from it, etc.  With the SSPL, you can even run a customized Elastic or MongoDB server to support any business needs <i>unless</i> your business is providing said software as a service <i>and</i> making money from it. Even then, all you have to do is release the code that runs said software as a service...<p>Amazon is claiming that you’d have to release your code even if you’re using the product for your game, social network, analytics app, etc. That’s just not true.<p>For the record, I wish everything could be under a permissive MIT or BSD-style license. But companies like Oracle, Microsoft (in the 90s) and Amazon felt entitled to destroy open projects that competed with their own. Hence the wide variety of open source licenses that now exist.<p>My first kernel commit was 2004, and while I don’t think anybody can <i>own</i> the term “open source”, I feel like I’ve been part of the open source community for ~20 years now. IMHO, Amazon is <i>by far</i> the least open source friendly company out there. They never contributed a single commit to MongoDB (at least while I was there), yet made money off their own SaaS, and even directed their users to MongoDB’s documentation.<p>Hope that clarifies my stance (and frustration) a bit...')
