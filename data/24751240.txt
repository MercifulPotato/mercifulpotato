For instance my home state, Kansas, we are fourth in the nation for installed wind capacity, supplying 41% of our energy demand. Our sole nuclear power plant provides an 18% base load. 33% is coal and the rest random crap. We&#x27;re very population sparse and low population in general. Yet in other areas of the country that are strictly coal and natural gas fired, with a greater population density and higher total population, they&#x27;re less turd colored. I&#x27;m guessing this is a strange interaction between renewable availability or it just might be a lack of available data.')
