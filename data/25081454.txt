Even for just this reason alone, it&#x27;s absurd to then come back and claim they are somehow less accurate than the AIDS or malaria numbers.<p>Also, if you want to look for the died of&#x2F;died with difference in AIDS or malaria, Malaria and HIV are huge epidemics in similar areas, so there is a good chance that many people die of malaria and AIDS at the same time - did the malaria kill them, or the AIDS? Most of the people dying of malaria also have problems with malnutrition - does that invalidate the fact that malaria killed them? HIV is often correlated with drug use - I think it&#x27;s more than likely that a few people counted as AIDS deaths were also overdosing on something. You can find all sorts of correlations.')
