Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608994206, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542891, text='The thing they tell me (when I buy in bulk) to worry about is my liver as well as developing a dependency (headaches <i>caused</i> by not taking paracetamol). I don&#x27;t know at what dosage+frequency either of those occur, though. If you do take it (or any other non-prescribed medicine) weekly or more often, I think it would be wise to do a cursory check on that or ask an apothecary or doctor next time you see one.<p>(To be clear, I don&#x27;t even buy it for myself and I know that the person whom I do buy it for doesn&#x27;t take it weekly, hence my not knowing these details despite buying decent quantities of it. We buy in bulk only because it lasts a long time and we always put off going to the apothecary because why go more than necessary especially in a pandemic)')
