I use a tiling WM and usually have two contexts side-by-side (half of my 4k 27&quot; display is usually enough for one window to work in) and when I want to switch to something else I can instinctively move to the other one without having to think about it. On the flipside, the lack of friction also means you can get distracted pretty easily, so YMMV.')
