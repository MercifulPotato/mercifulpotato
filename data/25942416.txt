They limit the framerate to 5fps, and they&#x27;re careful to use either the native size of the screen or half the native size (which avoids at least some expensive scaling code paths).<p>This is hard&#x2F;impossible to get right on every machine, because encoder implementations vary widely across all the hardware and operating system combinations. For example, using h264 instead of vp8 might help with cpu usage a <i>lot</i> on an older macOS machine, but make cpu usage worse on a newer macOS machine or some specific windows machine.<p>Here are settings we recommend to developers building apps that include screen-sharing using our video APIs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kwindla&#x2F;5d5a8190aee36dc00a5ef8e6c9011a63" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kwindla&#x2F;5d5a8190aee36dc00a5ef8e6c901...</a><p>Max-width of 640 for the camera. Max-width of 1920 for the screenshare, framerate limited to 5fps, and manually decimate the screenshare width by half if it&#x27;s larger than 1920. ymmv, but these settings use ~30% of the cpu on a typical mid-range Windows or macOS machine, for the sending side of a two-person cam+screenshare call.')
