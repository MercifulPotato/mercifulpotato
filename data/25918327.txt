The fact that they are exercising those as employers or employees should make no difference. In face we all take advantage of our rights as citizens while employed or employing people all the time. Fundamentally Capitalism is simply the exercise of basic property rights and individual freedoms.<p>As fro democracy there&#x27;s no reason you should have any say in how these people exercise their freedoms under the law, beyond your say in government and the law. If you have a problem with anything they do, then that&#x27;s a matter for the law and regulation, applied equally to everyone. An idealistic view I accept, but it&#x27;s what we should be aiming for.')
