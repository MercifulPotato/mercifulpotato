Couldn&#x27;t they simply find the least appealing and most ineffective possible &quot;liberal&quot; and allow them to make an utter ass of themselves?<p>The same of course could be said for CNN or MSNBC if they were forced to give equal air time to &quot;conservatives&quot; and they acted in bad faith.<p><pre><code>    I&#x27;m also leary of stigmatising phrases like \n    stop the steal or all lives matter even when \n    only 1% of uses are anything but incindiary.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m leery as well. Some other phrase from the opposite end of the spectrum could easily be next.<p>That said, the &quot;stop the steal&quot; movement just staged a violent ransacking of the Capitol; lawmakers <i>narrowly</i> escaped safely from armed mobs.<p>It is the laziest and most sociopathic possible fantasy to shrug our shoulders and treat the planning of such events as equal to other forms of speech. Free speech does <i>not</i> exist in a vacuum. It is <i>always</i> weighed against other rights. If somebody made credible death threats against you on Facebook, would you be okay with that? What about somebody making those threats on a megaphone, outside your home? How about a <i>mob</i> of people making them outside your home? Where would your love for free speech be then?<p>I absolutely understand the attraction and utter simplicity of &quot;free speech, always, in all cases, trumping everything else, always&quot; but it has never been and will never be that simple. It is an ideal to strive for. It is not our only ideal.')
