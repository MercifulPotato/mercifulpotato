It can of course, there&#x27;s not much to express. Go and write a (slow) tensor library yourself in pure Python.<p>To be fair, there&#x27;s even a standard library `array` module that is a direct wrapper around C arrays, and NumPy shares some functionality with it (namely in regards to buffers, memoryviews, data type encoding etc).<p>Edit: there&#x27;s also a built-in buffer type that supports multi-dimensional strides, suboffsets and all that (which, again both `array` and `numpy` make use of in establishing a standardized buffer api).')
