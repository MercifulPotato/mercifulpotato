I&#x27;m even more willing than most to agree that not every vaccine will have a sufficient cost&#x2F;benefit trade off for everyone. I have low-exposure and low-risk to COVID so I&#x27;m content to wait a while for the vaccine. I have questions in my mind about how we&#x27;re so sure that a big shot of mRNA can&#x27;t somehow cause a risk of birth defects, etc. But...<p>&gt;&gt; The reason we haven&#x27;t is because it will introduce more problems than it solves down the line.<p>This is just not sound reasoning, and it&#x27;s a terrible argument against the vaccine. Have you ever taken antibiotics? Or have you ever benefited long-term from anything medical that we didn&#x27;t &quot;evolve&quot; through natural selection? Because I sure as hell have. How does this not apply to other vaccines, which have clearly saved an astonishing number of lives, and have, almost without exception, not produced the kind of long-term existential threats to humanity you seem to be hinting at.')
