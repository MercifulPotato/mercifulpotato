Currently people can’t even afford to go to medical school, or afford to see a doctor, and when they get past the gatekeepers they are so desparate to get treatment that they can’t really even fathom rejecting a doctor because of a poor bedside manner.<p>Other countries with socialized health care systems (i.e. doctor credential gatekeeping) do not have these issues (certainly not to anything like the extent that we do). I suspect therefore that changing the credentialling process is unlikely to have much impact on these issues and&#x2F;or is not the most effective way to impact these issues.<p>&gt; Anyone who wants a good physician.<p>I&#x27;m 57 years old. I&#x27;ve never, ever met anyone who isn&#x27;t a libertarian nerd (I have friends ...) that checks to see what medical school a physician attended. If they are &quot;checking&quot; at something approximating that level, they do so via clinical affiliation (e.g. &quot;anyone at the Mayo has to be great&quot;).<p>&gt; Since we already deal with “who watches the watchers” problems in our current system, I see no problem here.<p>Not really. The &quot;watchers&quot; in our current system are government agencies, not private (potentially for-profit, or at least for-big-salary) corporations. The incentives align in significantly different ways.')
