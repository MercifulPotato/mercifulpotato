That&#x27;s how they figure out the location of those devices.<p>&gt; _Your_ identity isn&#x27;t associated with any of it.<p>As I showed in the link you continue to ignore, an easily deanonymized identifier is associated with that data in order to prevent people from sending junk data.<p>&gt; Google&#x2F;Android do this too:<p>The whole point is that on Android, you can opt out. Android respects users privacy enough to even ask them if they want to opt out on initial setup.<p>&gt; You can also entirely disable location services if you&#x27;re uncomfortable with this and that&#x27;d stop it.<p>As I explained in the link, disabling location services means you can&#x27;t get your location at all. Not so with Android.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re weaponizing people&#x27;s ignorance and the complexity of the technical details.<p>I&#x27;m fixing your and zepto&#x27;s ignorance in order to protect people&#x27;s privacy against bad actors like Apple.')
