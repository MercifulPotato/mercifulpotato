Asia was crossed by driving through Siberia, though I&#x27;m not sure if he followed the same land route to Kamchatka as described in the article. This was in the early 1990s, I think it might have been just after dissolution of USSR, and more than once it was his quick talking that helped.<p>Ultimately, the road trip ended in USA, where highway patrol took offence to his heavily-modified Land Rover or something like that.')
