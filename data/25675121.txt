It just means that, likely any action, there&#x27;s potential for consequences, and you deal with them.<p>You don&#x27;t back down from a good thing just because it might be hard to implement. So then it just comes down to whether you think removing speech that incites violence is a good think or not. If you think it&#x27;s good in itself but could be abused so maybe not do it?
