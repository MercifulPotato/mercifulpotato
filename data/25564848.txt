It seems to have several predicates:<p>1. You need to know the document ID you&#x27;re targeting (Stack Exchange once worked the ID out to ~256 bits).<p>2. You have to get the victim to interact with a Google doc on a site that you control (you need to re-dress the Google Docs interface, get the victim to your site, and then have them treat your site as if it was Google Docs).<p>3. You need to get the victim to use the Google feedback feature in order to trigger the vulnerable postMessage.<p>What&#x27;s a scenario in which an attacker gets these stars to align? (I&#x27;m sure there is one).')
