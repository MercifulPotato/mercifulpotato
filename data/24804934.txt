And my conclusion is: perhaps I should be liable if I stand up a public forum.<p>You may suggest that would prevent me from creating a user-generated-content application of massive scale without the resources to sufficiently moderate it. And again, yes - maybe that should be a requirement of me doing such a thing.<p>It isn&#x27;t like the only kind of business a person could create on the internet is one that surrounds the aggregation of user generated content. If it killed that entire class of business ... I am not sure we would lose very much of value that couldn&#x27;t be replaced by individuals hosting their own content.')
