It adds stress. When this was added (where I operate), I had to call in an accountant to do the paperwork because the penalty is prison time, and not a fine. This additional stress and paperwork just keeps compounding (there is a new paperwork every one or two years now). Then you have the small fee for that particular paperwork (should have been free?) and the accountant fee. It just keeps adding up, and for a single or very small business it&#x27;s becoming unsustainable.')
