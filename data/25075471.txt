For geekbench we see:<p>* 3800XT = 1357  (100%)<p>* 4800H = 1094 (~80%)<p>* 4800U = 1033 (~76%)<p>I would expect a 5800U to score <i>at best</i> around 1500, but realistically closer to 1300-1450.  That&#x27;s still behind the M1, but pretty darn close for being behind a node (and will still probably be faster for applications that would require x86 translation).')
