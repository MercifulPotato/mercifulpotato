Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612236749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994332, text='&gt; A  lot of comments here are warning about the addictive properties of stimulant medications.<p>Beyond everything else you&#x27;ve said which is all correct and reflects my experience, I want to point out something that doesn&#x27;t seem well known in the general fabric of the ADHD topic:<p>Addiction and substance abuse are a common trait in adult undiagnosed&#x2F;untreated cases. Alcohol abuse, amphetamine abuse, you name it. I can speak from personal experience here: before I understood I had a real chemical imbalance affecting my whole life, I had used and abused alcohol to the point it significantly damaged my life, and some important relationships. I can&#x27;t say for sure that wouldn&#x27;t have happened if I&#x27;d been diagnosed and treated earlier, but I can say the knee-jerk reaction about medically prescribed treatment that has very little risk of abuse&#x2F;addiction is inappropriate given the outcome that&#x27;s much more likely without treatment.')
