An important note is that the V3 and Babylon (unsure of HARP) were designed to have multiple charges go off as the projectile proceeded down the barrel, which gives an acceleration profile more like a railgun than a traditional cannon.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;V-3_cannon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;V-3_cannon</a><p><i>Solid-fuel rocket boosters were used instead of explosive charges because of their greater suitability and ease of use. These were arranged in symmetrical pairs along the length of the barrel, angled to project their thrust against the base of the projectile as it passed. This layout spawned the German codename Tausendfüßler (&quot;millipede&quot;).</i>')
