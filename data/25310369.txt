According to her email that Dean references in his, her &quot;feedback&quot; for the paper was given in the form of a confidential HR document. That seems highly nonstandard for a review process supposedly only concerned with scientific rigor and is not addressed at all by Dean&#x27;s statement. Further, his statement clearly, likely intentionally, muddies the water about what the actual sequence of events were that led to the paper being created, internal reviewers originally being notified, when the submission happened, who approved it, who submitted it externally, who asked for this to be retracted, and when and in what order all this happened. The fact that his statement, that was apparently meant to clarify these exact proceedings, makes it even more vague about what actually happened seems pretty damning to Dean&#x27;s case, in my opinion.<p>Both Gebru&#x27;s and Dean&#x27;s statements have very little overlap in flavor and in facts, so it&#x27;s pretty apparent <i>something</i> is going on here that is nontrivial and abnormal.')
