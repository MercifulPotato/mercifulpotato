The first time I met him was at the OSSummit in LA 2017 where he was presenting the CNCF Landscape in a small side-room. I asked him how to get a project listed and he helped me get openfaas on there and approved the pull request. After that he always seemed to have time for me and helped me in my career.<p>This is such a shocking and great loss for our community, he was too young.')
