GNU&#x27;s &quot;four essential freedoms&quot;, which imho are a little naive in retrospect, don&#x27;t say anything about this. They say anyone should be able to &quot;sell copies&quot;, but SSPL doesn&#x27;t disallow this either.<p>Debian obviously didn&#x27;t address it either. They clarify: &quot; They can even try to sell it. In practice, it costs essentially no money to make electronic copies of software. Supply and demand will keep the cost down.&quot;<p>I.e. they only allowed it because they thought the free market will take care of it, and didn&#x27;t imagine how cloud provides will become monopolies of access.<p>&quot;As a result, you can buy a Debian release on several CDs for just a few USD.&quot; - Lol.. that&#x27;s like trying to apply lessons from the bible to modern life.<p>Just to broaden the discussion, &quot;fields of endeavor&quot; doesn&#x27;t just mean cloud services, but also whether you can prevent your software from being used in weapons, or other such morally objectionable applications.')
