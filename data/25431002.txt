This is why we have the restrict keyword.<p>The only cases where the compiler can assume things do not alias are when pointers are to different types (except for char).<p>Naturally the compiler is allowed to prove that some pointers cannot alias and optimize based on that. But if it messes up it&#x27;s a compiler bug pure and simply.')
