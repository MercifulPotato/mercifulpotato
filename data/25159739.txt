A talk a bit about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkthinkthink.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-15-minute-city-thinkthinkthink" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinkthinkthink.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-15-minute-city-th...</a><p>Most importantly however cities serve as highly efficient labor markets - they connect a varied and interdependent labor force to diverse work opportunities. Most of commuting and corollary congestion happens at rush hour: the time when people travel from home to work and vice versa. In the above diagram from Order Without Design, Marie-Agnes &amp; Alain Bertaud skillfully illustrates the key connection between home, work&#x2F;entertainment and speed of travel. The 15-minute city should attempt to minimize inconvenient &amp; needless travel, while offering speedy access to jobs and amenities regardless of the place of residence. The traditional central business district is somewhat efficient in this sense; polycentric planning needs to figure out how it can keep the efficiencies of a central business district while offering the comfort of a walkable neighborhood. Even if all super-creatives work from home, that still leaves 88% of the labor force which needs to move around. Swift mobility will be a key aspect of urban living for the foreseeable future and a crucial determinant to the success of polycentric cities.')
