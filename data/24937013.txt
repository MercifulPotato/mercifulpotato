I suppose from a computational perspective you could do a simple, or set of simple computations in a machine more resistant to, or at least more resilient against, EMP (as the thing that is easy to move in a B field, that electron I mentioned above) is easier to move in undesired wave when subject to a large external B field.  I doubt it though.<p>However you do raise the possibility of longer-lasting computers in other harsh environments, specifically space.  The Voyager probes work in part because the feature size of the components is huge (discrete transistors that are inspectable through a microscope and in some cases the naked eye).  Such components are hard to come by these days.  Micro mechanical devices might even be a superior approach.  And for most space applications speed is not critical.')
