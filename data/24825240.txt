The only thing we have that was a disaster is a wardrobe with mirrored doors. The doors are too heavy for the fittings and they basically sheared off on one side. Fixing is really hard because the door weighs too much and so is brutal on anything I&#x27;ve had a go at.. and being made from fibreboard, the structure is sawdust very easily.<p>Maybe we will be able to recycle it. That would be pretty nice.')
