So you are stuck in that ecosystem (you can, though, compile with Java 8 and run in java 11 of course).<p>* for mid-sized applications where it makes sense to use DI, using kapt is sometimes a pain (it&#x27;s better this days, but still I hate the thing)<p>* even though the jetbrains support is first class, it is still considerably slower then pure Java code. \n* very personal: I&#x27;ve come to miss Java&#x27;s verboseness.<p>* some tools don&#x27;t integrate well with it (yet)... So do not expect things like static analyzers to be good or even existent.')
