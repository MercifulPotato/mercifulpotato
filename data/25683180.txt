Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610099996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682666, text='&gt; Catullus 16, which might be the oldest thing that we could properly call a diss track<p>This view is a bit disingenuous.  There&#x27;s been diss tracks as long as mankind has been singing and writing poems.  While Catullus 16 is very famous, there&#x27;s much earlier examples.  The greek counterpart to Catullus may be, for example, Hipponax of Ephesus [0], who wrote celebrated &quot;diss tracks&quot; six centuries before him.  But still, a lot of ancient greek comedy can be understood as unrestricted verbal abuse to concrete people of the time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hipponax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hipponax</a>')
