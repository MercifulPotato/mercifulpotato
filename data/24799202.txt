I think there&#x27;s a line of thinking that the US civil rights movement was caused by blacks becoming more economically important, thought I&#x27;m not familiar with the evidence. Likewise you could argue that UK industrial growth preceded women&#x27;s right to vote, and various other freedom related things that happened.<p>Of course it could also be a virtuous circle, they both cause each other, and sometimes one or the other is ignited by some other thing.')
