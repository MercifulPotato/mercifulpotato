Item(by='LaGrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612138320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25982143, text='&gt; Author seems to have over 25 years of experience.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean much. The author has been a researcher, and then moved into management, now working on a relatively simple e-commerce project with one of the most hilarious mission statements I&#x27;ve ever read.<p>It&#x27;s the kind of guy that makes me _shudder_ when he shows up in a workplace - because I already know I&#x27;m going to have to clean up after them. His dismissal of the documentation value of type systems really tells you how much experience he _actually_ has - my comeback to static typing, as is for nearly every programmer I know, specifically because of how reliable things like &quot;look up the source&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;whatever&quot; can be in statically typed code. Not everyone cares, and that&#x27;s fine, but such a dismissal tells me he&#x27;s very sheltered, and vastly overestimates the real complexity of his own projext.<p>Also apparently he worked on AspectJ, which to me tells me everything I need to know, and also probably explains why he hates the JVM even more than I do.')
