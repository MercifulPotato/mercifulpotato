You&#x27;ll probably get a wide range of responses to that question, but you&#x27;ll also probably get a good feeling for who is a competent PM and who is probably not.  Hint: good PMs won&#x27;t just base it on gut feelings or anecdotal evidence.<p>How do you balance priorities that you&#x27;re hearing from customers with priorities that you&#x27;re hearing from sales?  PMs often find themselves in between sales, customers and engineering, and balancing those conflicting priorities is tough.<p>How do you convince engineers to take on hard tasks?  A lot of times PMs come up with great ideas but engineers will balk at actually implementing them because &quot;it&#x27;s too hard.&quot;')
