While the Mu’tazilites had contended that the Koran was created and so God’s purpose for man must be interpreted through reason, the Ash’arites believed the Koran to be coeval with God — and therefore unchallengeable. At the heart of Ash’ari metaphysics is the idea of occasionalism, a doctrine that denies natural causality.&quot;<p>&quot;According to the occasionalist view, tomorrow coldness might follow fire, and satiety might follow lack of food.
