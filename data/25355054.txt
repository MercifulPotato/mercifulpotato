Certainly, I don&#x27;t keep even all my information on my computer, or even a single phone, and I think phishing _everyone_ is harder than you&#x27;re making out.<p>You&#x27;re moving the goalposts: before your ninja edit, you were only talking about the easiest way to spy on <i>someone</i>, not everyone.<p>If you phish someone, you can get the <i>content</i>.  Why settle for just metadata?  And what good is metadata for your blackmail use-case?  The difference between metadata and content is the difference between knowing you communicate with your coworker and knowing you&#x27;re cheating on your wife with her.  Only one of those things is useful to a blackmailer.<p>Also, what exactly is a foreign power&#x27;s use case for targeting everyone in the US, or being really interested mainly in metadata, when their goals mean they&#x27;re mainly really interested in specific people and organizations and the content or systems they have access to?')
