Actually the word &quot;boring&quot; is completely misused in my opinion. It is all about choosing the right solution. This has nothing to do with things being boring or fancy. The word boring is clearly defined by a dictionaries and is subject to personal emotions. One could say the JVM is totally amazing while the other says it is dull and boring. This can not be the basis for an educated decision.<p>The points you mentioned are also part of the questions one has to ask for finding a suitable approach.<p>I think that all those who say &quot;use boring ...&quot; effectively want to say something else but either do not dare to do so or are otherwise unable to express their intentions. Nevertheless redefining the word &quot;boring&quot; is not a solution.')
