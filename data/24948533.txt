Everyone became more expressive in physical space.<p>I found this to be extremely useful, even when talking to people with normal hearing on a video call. Because the call omits so much context that is obvious when talking in person, it helps to overact emotions, especially if you don&#x27;t want to take valuable speaking bandwidth. (Or worse, talk over someone, which happens much less elegantly over video call.)<p>I took to overacting pretty immediately in the beginning of lockdowns, but noticed that I was one of the few doing it. And I am still not sure how to broach that conversation with people. &quot;Hi, I notice that you&#x27;re acting normally on this video call. It would be best for you to comically overact your emotions so that people can get a read on how you are reacting.&quot;<p>Some examples include nodding - moving almost from chin touching chest to staring at the ceiling, smiling - mouth wide enough to almost hurt, with a bit of space between the top and bottom rows of teeth, thumbs up - holding it right next to my head for 3+ seconds, and reconsidering something - hand over chin, almost covering mouth, with my entire head oriented up and away from the camera.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten good feedback on it, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just me being weird. But it does sound odd now that I&#x27;ve written the examples out.')
