It really assumes that the drivers are too stupid to do their own accounting and figure out if they are making money or not.\nPretty sure most drivers wouldn&#x27;t be driving for $9.21 if a job at the local ice cream parlor could get them almost double on the spot. Yet you still see folks driving 30 hrs per week for years.<p>Not only that, but with the higher prices guaranteed by AB5 and the higher cost of having employees, there&#x27;s absolutely no guarantee that current drivers will meet the bar for full time employment as drivers (and the company will need less of them).')
