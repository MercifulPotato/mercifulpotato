So it&#x27;s like Fox on some specific topics.<p>The leading left wing paper is the Guardian (Sometimes referred to as the Gauniad due to it having pretty poor proofreading back in the day). It&#x27;s way too leftie for me on opinion, it&#x27;s grown a bit of a woke tendency, but is good on science and international news.')
