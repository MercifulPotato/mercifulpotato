As soon as you have more than one module in Python it completely falls apart, despite any autoreload magic. It just isn&#x27;t the same at all as REPL based programming. In Lisps you can write your entire program with an instance and a REPL running the entire time. No restarting the instance required. It works because it&#x27;s just how Lisp works. A REPL is a trivial thing you can write yourself that runs in the same instance.<p>Whenever I think about it I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on exactly what Python would need to make it the same. It&#x27;s something to do with the way imports and namespaces work, though.')
