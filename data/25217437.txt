Most current reimplementation attempts cannot play any but the most simple flash games.<p>Sticking the whole thing into a VM and just running the original code achieves both accuracy and safety, at the cost of resources. Given that Flash died long ago, i.e. hardware has advanced since then, resources are not a major issue, and are going to be even less of an issue going forward.')
