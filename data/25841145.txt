Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611103517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838137, text='Fediverse is a new term, so it is typically used when trying to explain newer technologies (email &amp; RSS are well-understood and need less exposition). So for that reason, yes, you&#x27;ll mainly see it used to describe new things.<p>It is a portmanteau of federated universe, and as such encompasses the full universe of technologies old &amp; new that are considered &quot;federated&quot;.<p>Federation is a system whereby you sign up to a SaaS, and can then interact with other users of <i>other</i> SaaS due to each of the services synchronising data via a unified protocol. Email is the best-known of these; SMTP is the protocol.<p>RSS is a greyer area. The nature of RSS (heavy on subscription, lighter on publishing) makes it less like other tech in the fediverse which are heavier on the publishing&#x2F;sending&#x2F;broadcasting side. Given the prevalence of self-hosting, it could be closer to being classified as properly decentralized except that there is a clear server&#x2F;client distinction. It&#x27;s somewhat subjective: either way if RSS (&amp; WebMentions) are considered outside of the Fediverse, that&#x27;s only because their paradigm isn&#x27;t compatible with federation (making the original comment about Fediverse competing with things like RSS&#x2F;WebMentions moot).')
