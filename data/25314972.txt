Nobody is paying for getting unemployment, you&#x27;re not eligible at worst.<p>There are dozens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of people paying for universities in the European countries with public schools (most of paying students are of second&#x2F;third-world background in a country that is acting passively aggressively to them because of their non-resident&#x2F;non-citizen status [that causes issues e. g. with banking services], btw), and many of them in Sweden, that&#x27;s why I feel the statement is false. Also note that I&#x27;m not judging, merely stating a fact; I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with both funding approaches, and think they should be combined (like in Czechia).')
