We have the same requirement in the UK, so when I&#x27;ve made planning applications, I&#x27;ve had to book a notice in the Oxford Mail (cost: Â£120). Probably 100 people in our town (population 3,000) read the Oxford Mail. Everyone, on the other hand, reads the free community website, but I&#x27;m not allowed to place the notice there.')
