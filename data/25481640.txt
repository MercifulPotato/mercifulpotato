Hence the undulations seen in the flight paths of the crashed aircraft.<p>The MCAS was designed under the assumption that pilots would respond to unexpected activation within 3 seconds:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;times-watchdog&#x2F;the-inside-story-of-mcas-how-boeings-737-max-system-gained-power-and-lost-safeguards&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;times-watchdog&#x2F;the...</a>')
