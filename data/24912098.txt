Item(by='scastiel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603833857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912074, text='Or you can go to my previous generator and generate the HTML and CSS, or even find there the tutorial to create the animation yourself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3d-book-css.netlify.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;3d-book-css.netlify.app</a> ;)<p>My view is the animation itself is not what I sell, it is more the ease of use, with the image hosting. The pricing model probably still needs a lot of thinking :)')
