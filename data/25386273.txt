If you buy a $1000 gaming PC, you&#x27;re going to need to install steam&#x2F;epic&#x2F;gog&#x2F;xbox&#x2F;origin&#x2F;ea to play the top 5 games of the year, deal with awful audio issues, masses of account systems with varying levels of &quot;party&quot; support, hardware&#x2F;driver incompatibilities, background software issues (antivirus, etc), varied levels of online play&#x2F;party support, mixed support for controller&#x2F;kbm, the list goes on. Networking issues? Hope you don&#x27;t accidentally have a double NAT, or you might run into [0]. That&#x27;s before touching on the actual open way of running proton on linux (You have an Nvidia card? tough. Have an AMD card? that&#x27;s great, just compile your own mesa).<p>It&#x27;s tempting to distill this down to &quot;convenience&quot;, but it&#x27;s much more than that. For many people (including myself, a professional programmer) that convenience is the difference between gaming being a way I want to spend my time or not. I&#x27;m not choosing between an open and closed device, I&#x27;m choosing between a closed device or no device.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.xbox.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;help&#x2F;hardware-network&#x2F;connect-network&#x2F;troubleshoot-party-chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.xbox.com&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;help&#x2F;hardware-network&#x2F;connect...</a>\n(disclaimer: I work for Epic, we have skin in this, but this is my own personal experience, and I don&#x27;t work on the store)')
