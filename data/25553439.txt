I expect my property to still be mine and protected by the police. My home should not revert to being owned by the state just because I went on vacation. I damned well do expect to be able to vote in whatever country I hold citizenship rather than mere residence.<p>If I move to some other country fully, and want to participate in it&#x27;s policy direction, then I expect to do whatever is required to gain the new citizenship and reliquish the old.<p>Maybe double dipping shouldn&#x27;t be allowed, but being remote should mean essentially nothing by itself.<p>Even fairly extended residence where you have a local job and rent a home etc shouldn&#x27;t constitute some sort of automatic change of citizenship. That should only happen if and when you actively choose to do it. People get sent places for work. People go places for school or research. People have to take care of family. People are in the military. There are all kinds of situations requiring a person to be somewhere other than home, for any amount of time, even years, without changing what is &quot;home&quot; and what is &quot;away&quot;.')
