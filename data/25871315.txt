Item(by='bane', descendants=None, kids=[25871537, 25871416, 25871470], score=None, time=1611320682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25869464, text='I&#x27;ve done the same lifehack for many years now and it&#x27;s been extraordinarily helpful. On Jan 1st or 2nd, I rotate all of my hangers so the hook is backwards on the bar (I do something similar for shoes, folded pants, etc.). The next Jan 1st or 2nd, any clothes that are still in that position are given away. It means I made it through 4 seasons, and 52 weeks of work, play, social functions, hiking, yard work, house maintenance, and other events and never needed to call on those clothes. So off they go.<p>The first year I did this I probably gave away about 60% of my wardrobe and never missed a single item I parted with -- a number of which still had the store tags on them. Even though this frees me up to purchase new clothes as I need them throughout the year without filling my closet up to the breaking point, I find that it puts a small routine in the back of my mind that makes me far more frugal with clothes and as a result I buy very little. If I <i>really</i> need some specialty clothing for something, it&#x27;s usually a tuxedo or something I can probably rent or borrow.<p>It&#x27;s sort of a zero effort, self-documenting, positional tracking system.')
