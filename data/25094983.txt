I used Google to sign in on digitalocean, then I changed the main domain in google apps and readded the original domain seperately on Google Apps. But probably because some kind of ID mismatch, I was now unable to sign-in on Digitalocean with the original e-mail address recreated to Google Apps. Password recovery didn&#x27;t work either, for some reason digitalocean doesn&#x27;t do password reset for accounts that were created using Google sign-in. I was forced to create a support ticket with digitalocean and wait.')
