In the early 2000s I recreated his LeNet-5 implementation, and no one was interested despite the great results I was getting in OCR and medical image processing with tumor detection.<p>Younger people don&#x27;t realize there was strong bias against using neural networks in the late 90s up until Hinton&#x27;s talk on NNs around 2007. I get the feeling we&#x27;re going through the same thing where novel research is becoming ignored because everything must fit the deep learning paradigm to be noticed.')
