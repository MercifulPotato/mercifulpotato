They literally work for the interest of their shareholders. Individual workers’ rights do not matter for them. And a high salary is not everything, especially since “high” in the SV is still pretty average at best. I now know of several high skilled engineers who worked at Apple and Facebook who came back because they were burned out and in two cases could not even afford their family anymore in the bay area (with both couples working as engineers).<p>Your employer is not your friend who was kindly enough to take you in and spread your wings. And my point of bringing in Germany was this: The US labour laws are laughable, thus to make conditions better for workers they __have__ to unionize to put themselves in a stronger position.<p>I did not address the second type because I think it is a false equivalence. There is never a balance between worker and employer. FAANG companies are the richest and most influential companies in the world, if you think that a union will topple this power distribution, you are really naive.')
