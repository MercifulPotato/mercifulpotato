To untangle competing desires and figure out what you really <i>want</i>, you have to cultivate more awareness. Listen to your feelings and your soul.<p>You might determine that you&#x27;ve been working too much, fighting battles unfruitfully, while neglecting the things in life you actually care about, like family. Or you could decide that software really is your way to contribute to the world, and find a way to optimize for that.<p>Either answer is fine. Either way, if you figure out what you ACTUALLY want instead of what society tells you, you&#x27;ll be happier and find more purpose.<p>There are no answers in life. Just strategies. Find out what you actually want, and find the most effective strategy.')
