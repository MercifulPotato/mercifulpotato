Think interactive visualizations, animations, excellent audio &amp; video quality, etc. Almost no teachers have the skills necessary to create things in the same ballpark as 3blue1brown, for example - and that needs to be table stakes. Sticking a teacher in front of a laptop connected to a zoom meeting is a recipe for failure. This also requires money invested in student setups. Every student should have access to a good quality screen, headphones, microphone, webcam, and digitizer for freeform diagram input. Anything less than this will be strictly inferior to in-person teaching, no matter what.')
