I have amazon prime american express card too. It is not like I am not a new customer. Last year alone I have 400 orders alone with 1000+ products. I don&#x27;t bother leaving reviews.<p>I found nearly all cleaning supplies 1&#x2F;3 of the price at Home Depot. Dog food also cheaper at PetSmart. To me, amazon is no longer the #1 option and I no longer buy unknown brands from it.')
