Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605348688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25090302, text='&gt; The number include people who die with covid not just due to covid. So its inflated.<p>There is no significant difference between people dying WITH a systemic disease and people dying OF a systemic disease. And there is no over-reporting in the USA compared to most other countries, so the comparison still makes sense. And even if HALF the reported numbers were wrong (the reality is probably closer to 0.01% or something), it would still be a viral disease much worse than any other active in the wealthy world today.<p>&gt; Similarly for covid, there are huge downside due to lockdown. The risk due to lockdown compared to the risk of covid ? very very not worth it.<p>You are acting as if the mild restrictions in place today are as extreme as banning cars. I&#x27;ve already pointed out that the extreme response would be state-wide, military enforced, house arrest for everyone except emergency personnel - that would be the 0 deaths alternative.<p>Instead, in all places that actually care about public health, we have mild restrictions to control the spread of the virus. This includes Sweden by the way, which has a lockdown more or less as much as everywhere else, except it is more self-imposed since their constitution doesn&#x27;t allow for a legally-enforced one.<p>&gt; If for you, you think the risk is worth it and you want to isolate yourself then its fine I won&#x27;t force you but the issue is if you trying to force other people to isolate too.<p>It&#x27;s not about what I think. We have people specialized in assessing these risks, and they have ALL said, everywhere in the world, that we must wear masks and isolate. The risks from isolation, which are also understood and absolutely exist, DO NOT outweigh the risks of the disease. And this is not me saying it, it is doctors and policy makers everywhere in the world.<p>Do you think the UK WANTS to close its economy? Or France or Germany or Norway? Do you think they WANT to keep their schools closed?<p>Or is it much more believable that they have looked at the risks, they have looked at hospital capacity, and have understood, unlike you, that Covid19 is much worse than the hardships caused by lockdowns?<p>And while there are some valid concerns about the impact of lockdowns on all sorts of problems, there is absolutely no excuse for not wearing a mask. Not doing is simply irresponsible and unhygienic, and must be strongly punished by legal and social means.')
