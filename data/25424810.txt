They&#x27;re using the same software, and the data falls squarely within Wikidata&#x27;s scope.<p>Even worse that they feel the need to stamp this with a CC license. Not only does this make it incompatible with the CC0&#x2F;public domain requirement. I consider it borderline offensive to assert copyright over the basic facts of someone&#x27;s life: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enslaved.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;person&#x2F;Q405665" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enslaved.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;person&#x2F;Q405665</a><p>This project obviously involves a lot of <i>work</i>. And, taken as a whole, some of that work is creative in nature. But individual records are not.<p>Luckily, US law does not recognise copyright for databases.')
