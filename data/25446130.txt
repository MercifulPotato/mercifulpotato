Personally I think the real benefits to society will be had by applying Bitcoin&#x27;s concepts to brand new unrelated things, and hopefully Bitcoin mindshare can help spark that creativity in people. To me, someone saying &quot;The Blockchain&quot; is like someone saying &quot;The Linked-List&quot;. They&#x27;re not thinking about it generically yet.')
