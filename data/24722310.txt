It looks like the 5600X has 1mb less cache so they probably engineered a way to disable faulty sections of the cache on a 1mb granularity.<p>Edit: My speculation&#x27;s wrong. The cache difference between the 5700X and the 5600X is due to core count differences. It&#x27;s the sum of the various cache sizes, and I misread the slide.')
