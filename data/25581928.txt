Item(by='tomp', descendants=None, kids=[25583725], score=None, time=1609338363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581708, text='<i>&gt; weâ€™re talking about a process of strategically reallocating resources, funding, and responsibility away from police and toward community-based models of safety, support, and prevention.</i><p>Not really, just more of the same. Sounds completely delusional.<p>Defensive violence (or a credible ability to project it) is the best cure for offensive violence. It exists in every society, either officially (cops) or unofficially (gangs, mafia, warlords, private guards, ...).<p>All these &quot;no police&quot; proposals fail when trying to answer the most basic question, &quot;what do I do when someone steals my car with my kid in it&quot;. Mind you - they&#x27;re fully aware that the only possible answer is &quot;violence&quot; - either cops or private guns - which is why they&#x27;re desperately trying to avoid having to answer this question. But this also makes all these proposals completely unworkable in reality.<p>It&#x27;s basically the same as idealistic communes - yeah, you <i>can</i> &quot;peacefully coexist&quot; in a &quot;free for all, cooperative, no ownership, no conflict&quot; society - as long as you outsource enough of the essentials (military, police, social security, emergency medical &amp; fire services, ...) to the rest of the society. But there&#x27;s no examples (and plenty of counter-examples) of an <i>actual</i> society (large, post-industrialized one) existing in this way.')
