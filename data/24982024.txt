I was talking about the damage he&#x27;s caused and why people shouldn&#x27;t just shrug and say, well, he&#x27;s &quot;thinking for himself&quot; as if there&#x27;s some independent virtue to coming up with nonsense that outweighs the damage that coming up with nonsense can do.<p>&gt; while Alex himself may never uncover any real conspiracies (and really, how could you personally guarantee that?),<p>I can probably &quot;uncover&quot; real conspiracies by claiming that every single government action is a lie or a false flag. At some point, I&#x27;ll be correct. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m actually performing a public service, a mindless chatbot could do that.<p>If he&#x27;s not lying[0] and actually was psychotic when he said those things, then we should not take any of the conspiricizing he says seriously because it was literally the product of his own disordered thinking. If he was lying, then he&#x27;s the sort of person who will disclaim all his positions as soon as they get uncomfortable for him to hold.<p>[0] he is')
