With a desktop you can go to the extremes and install water cooling. With a laptop you&#x27;re always compromising on performance because if the load gets high the processor starts throttling and thus its performance is severely reduced. As a side effect there&#x27;s also the issue with noise. A laptop fan is way more noisy than a desktop one because there&#x27;s so much more space inside the box.')
