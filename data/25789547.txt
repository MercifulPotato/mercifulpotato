This is painfully hard and I have years of experience with javascript&#x2F;typescript [1].<p>I doubt there ever has been a more complex programming ecosystem than JavaScript&#x27;s.\nNo other system has more bundlers (webpack, rollup, metro, ..), transpilers (babel, typescript, flow, ...), testing libraries (jest, mocha, jasmine, ...), package managers (yarn, npm, pnpm, ...).\nIt is just insane what we created.<p>[1] if you are curious, that is the error message. Good luck making sense of it. It probably is caused by non-compatible dependencies but yarn does not tell me.<p>Validation Error:<p><pre><code>  Preset @babel&#x2F;preset-typescript is invalid:\n\n  The &quot;id&quot; argument must be of type string. Received type object\n  TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The &quot;id&quot; argument must be of type string. Received type object</code></pre>')
