The quantity of suffering in the world is great, and even those of us with the <i>ability</i> to do something about some small part of it (already a pretty small number) are severely limited in their impact.<p>For the most part, it&#x27;s non-actionable info. You bring up  &quot;relatives being deported or shot by the police&quot;, but the number of people on HN that describes is going to be tiny. The average HN user is <i>less</i> likely than most to have been burned by COVID due to the remote-friendliness of tech jobs.<p>For me, the calculus works out like this:<p>1. Is it <i>possible</i> for me to do anything substantial about it? (Throwing a few bucks at a charity or &quot;raising awareness&quot; about the large social problem everyone already knows about does not count as &quot;substantial&quot;)<p>2. If it is possible, do I have the <i>ability</i>? (Financially, mentally, physically, temporally)<p>3. If the answer to both of these questions is &quot;no&quot;, then it is non-actionable and not worth expending my own limited energy on.<p>The vast majority of things you hear from the news media fail both of these tests. They are intended to provoke you or scare you about something that is mostly out of your sphere of influence.')
