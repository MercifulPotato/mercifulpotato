Of course thanks to the COVID we have nowhere to go, and the car has mostly sat in the garage. But the previous car was riding up the bathtub curve, time to turn it in.<p>I tried out the new car on some curvy roads, and concluded it takes curves at a speed faster than my personal comfort zone, but it hung in there. Maybe I&#x27;m too cautious as a driver, but &quot;not frightening the passengers&quot; is one of my criteria for driving skill, I&#x27;d at least like the car to have a setting for taking turns a bit slower.')
