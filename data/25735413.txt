We don&#x27;t have a choice, because it destroys what this site is supposed to exist for.<p>I&#x27;m not going to ban you right now because it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve been doing this for a super long time.

If you can&#x27;t do that, that&#x27;s understandable of course, but then please don&#x27;t post until you can.<p>HN&#x27;s rules have been designed to try to preserve this place as somehow interesting, not the scorched earth that internet forums usually descend to. The rules don&#x27;t stop applying because someone else is wrong or you feel they are, and it&#x27;s not ok to break them because you&#x27;re right or you feel you are. Actually those are the cases where they apply the most.')
