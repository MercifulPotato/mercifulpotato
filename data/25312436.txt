I had a similar experience.  30-character camel case names are no substitute for a well-written comment.  What I&#x27;ve found works well is to view a comment as the topic sentence of a paragraph.  For each section of code that can be reasoned about as a unit, set it off with white space above and below as paragraphs are set off in text, and give it a topic sentence explaining the intention.  If there are difficult, delicate, or subtle aspects of the code, be kind to your reader and explain them.')
