They don’t have a lot of shame about their partisanship or desire to hide it, but there is ideological distortion going on everywhere.</i><p>Yes, we agree on this point, what I&#x27;m critiquing is your injection of this obvious fact into a discussion about a specific event that can be attributed to the particular type of misinformation spread by FOX, the fact that &quot;there is ideological distortion going on everywhere&quot; is beside the point, <i>obviously</i> that&#x27;s true, so what?
