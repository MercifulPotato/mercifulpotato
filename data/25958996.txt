If you want to argue that Robinhood should have been bigger, and thus had more flexibility and been able to handle this, sure. Why not. But then you&#x27;re complaining that the company you&#x27;re dealing with isn&#x27;t big enough to float your risky position.<p>Would you have preferred the alternative where Robinhood risks exploding, has no liquidity, triggers a rush where everyone tries to get their stock out of Robinhood at the same time, fails, and every Robinhood customer is stuck waiting on SPIC for some undetermined amount of time?<p>Or would you have preferred the alternative where Robinhood didn&#x27;t allow you to sell either? And then it the stock went down during that time, you can&#x27;t try to get out?<p>Robinhood is a shitty company for a lot of reasons, but preventing themselves from being over-extended into bankruptcy isn&#x27;t really one of those reasons.')
