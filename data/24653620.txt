Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601572866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653445, text='Just seconding &quot;A Tour of C++&quot;. I picked it up last year to learn modern C++ since my professional experience has solely been with older C++ standards and code bases. The book is clearly written, though sometimes very brief. It is what it calls itself, a tour. If you already know older versions of C++, it&#x27;s great. If you don&#x27;t know any C++ but do know how to program (more than just the basics), it&#x27;s a good place to start. If you&#x27;re just learning to program, it&#x27;d probably be both overwhelming (too deep too fast) and underwhelming (too shallow in critical areas for novices). It assumes you know the basics, so start with a different book and come to this one later.')
