It was pretty refreshing and kept me at the company for probably 8 months longer than I would have without the 20% time. The other great thing is that I was able to push a project I believed in but that everyone was afraid to fund. I had ownership of something I cared about. It was something that helped out dozens of teams, helped me shape the direction of the team, and heavily pad out my perf packet.<p>In general, folks are very protective of 20% time. My director didn&#x27;t want to fund the additional maintenance cost of the project, but was respectful of the fact that it was 20% time. My manager and tech lead were in a similar boats.')
