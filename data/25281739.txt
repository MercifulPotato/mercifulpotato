That&#x27;s not how depositions work. You might be able to get a lawyer to file legal motions with expert testimony attached pointing out they shouldn&#x27;t need access to the whole phone for the reasons you said, but 99% of people will not bother getting a lawyer for something like this.<p>No, <i>that</i> is now how subpoenas and depositions work. I&#x27;ve been involved in a few. The judge needs a specific reason to approve inclusion of your personal device: like a record of information having been sent to it specifically or being used in a context relevant to the case at hand. And the information request will have to be specific to the case at hand, so you can just return with &quot;There is no information on those devices relevant to the subpoena parameters&quot; (said under oath).<p>If they demand your personal device anyway, because the subpoena is too broad or something, you can fight it with the judge and argue why it shouldn&#x27;t be included.<p>If you never, ever mix personal and work then you should have no difficulty getting your personal devices excluded from a work related inquiry.')
