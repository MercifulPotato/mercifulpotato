See if it remains consistent if you change something somewhere, that kind of stuff. Don&#x27;t want the new hire to make a well-intended change that ends up breaking things. This is why unit-tests exist. Amongst other things.<p>One may well write tests such that all possible code paths are checked... doesn&#x27;t mean the actual code is performant or written in a clear manner, or written in a maintainable manner, etc...<p>I guess a better term would be &quot;behavior coverage&quot; or something?')
