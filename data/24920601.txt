If you configure guake to use anything less than 100% of the width of the screen, then it suddenly appears in the wrong position.<p>But wait, maybe that&#x27;s a guake bug, right?<p>Wrong.  I tried a couple of other options for similar functionality and they demonstrated the same issue.  So odds are it&#x27;s actually a bug in the compositor.<p>And that&#x27;s ignoring that basic things like global keybinding don&#x27;t work (edit: ya ya, the Wayland proponents will tell you that&#x27;s by design, but it&#x27;s a) user hateful b) totally different than literally any other desktop OS out there today, and c) breaks apps, right now, in ways that will require major code changes to fix) so I have to put a hack in place to allow F12 to open guake up in the first place.<p>Meanwhile, we only <i>just</i> got the &quot;official&quot; solution for screensharing (what Zoom does is an incredible hack: they just take lots of screenshots!  No, I&#x27;m not kidding, that&#x27;s actually how it works, which is why the framerate is so bad) and it involves yet more new stuff (pipewire, et al) that I&#x27;m sure will be a source of its own raft of bugs.<p>I&#x27;d say &quot;maybe in a year or two&quot;, but we&#x27;ve been saying that for a long time, now...')
