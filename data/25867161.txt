It is very common for aircraft to fly missions that are hundreds of miles long, most of which is over enemy territory.  I used to sit in CDC on a CVN and watch the missions every day during Operation Southern Watch, which wasn&#x27;t even really war -- but those pilots were flying over enemy territory for many hours every day.<p>Same thing in Afghanistan and Iraq, every flight was essentially over enemy territory for its entire duration -- surveillance, strike, and transport.  You <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to bail out of an aircraft in the tribal areas if there&#x27;s any way to get it home.<p>Modern aircraft are extremely reliable, they don&#x27;t break often.  Modern ejection seats are extremely reliable, they don&#x27;t fail often.  And yet, everything I posted above is exactly correct.')
