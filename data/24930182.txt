The bits left over are lower and lower quality.  It used to be that an entire evening would be unplanned; I would grab something out of the fridge for dinner, sit down, and think about if I wanted to read a book or write some code or watch a new movie I was excited about.  Even if I was &quot;lazy&quot; and chose the movie 50% of the time, I was still  getting through a couple of books a month.  Now at 6pm I am wanted for something, guaranteed.  If it is not something specific, it is to be available for interruptions.  At the end of the evening, when I really should be asleep already, I am released from interruption duty, and sometimes I can get an hour or more to myself, depending on how much sleep I want to rob myself of.  At that point I would be sleepy if I wasn&#x27;t stressed out, and I&#x27;ve probably had a couple of drinks, but that&#x27;s when I hack on a personal project, or (more likely) switch to YouTube if I am not coherent enough to write code that actually works.  And if I watch something like 3Blue1Brown or a software presentation then I count that as &quot;learning.&quot;')
