A &quot;right&quot; as I understand it is something that is illegal for others to violate, and that government generally has a duty to protect. But there&#x27;s nothing unlawful about creating something that&#x27;s uncopyable, or about guarding what you have so closely that others are unable to copy it; in fact, I would&#x27;ve assumed being able to do so is <i>itself</i> your right. And should you create something that&#x27;s uncopyable, nobody will be able to copy it, <i>even if</i> it would be fair use for them to do so. They might be upset about this, but their rights definitely aren&#x27;t being violated by your creation or protection of that thingâ€”and the government can&#x27;t force you to make your stuff copyable. (Or maybe it can with additional legislation, but I&#x27;m pretty sure we don&#x27;t have such legislation.) That means &quot;fair use&quot; isn&#x27;t anyone&#x27;s <i>right</i>... it&#x27;s just a valid defense (whether &quot;affirmative&quot; or otherwise).')
