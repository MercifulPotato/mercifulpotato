My original one (vintage 2017) died recently (bad mainboard) and I went out shelled out $1400 for a brand new one from the Apple Store.  They had a bunch in stock - it was not hard to locate.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s new firmware or new hardware or what, but this monitor works 1000000000 better than my older version of the exact same one.  I had plenty of issues on the last one - wouldn&#x27;t startup after sleep, etc.  This new one is just flawless - starts right up every morning, no ghosting, etc.')
