I think there&#x27;s also a difference between a low-level employee being friendly personally to me because it&#x27;s their job and also it&#x27;s just polite, vs some marketing employee being &quot;friendly&quot; to the 500k people on their mailing list.<p>It&#x27;s also always worth noting, is the case with many countries, the US is very diverse.
