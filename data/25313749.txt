But yeah, for the dopamine still. Otherwise your brain is looking for other sources. Stimulatory thoughts (&quot;big ideas&quot;, exploding connections), or the usual procrastination with novelty mining. Sugar increases your &quot;will power&quot; by dopamine release.<p>Dopamine manages how long you can do a task before you evaluate its success; the risk of energy expenditure. Think of how long a path finding algorithm goes into one direction before aborting; with the evolutionary twist of a survival restraints on overall energy expenditure, which means there is a feedback loop modifying the risk capacity on success or failure.<p>Normal people start with more and overfill with completed tasks (if rewarding), so they got more for the next plan.
