And a problem for both sides.<p>If X is the amount of utility coming out of surveillance, and you cannot know X, then you cannot argue that X = 0 or that X &gt; Y (for any Y you want to pick, like downsides of surveillance) or that X &lt; Y either.<p>Essentially it becomes impossible to rationally debate the issue on the basis of whether it is a net gain.<p>Which means you need to fall back on other forms of reasoning. A reasonable position is that freedoms shouldn&#x27;t be sacrificed for something whose utility cannot be demonstrated. But that&#x27;s an argument about what sorts of justifications are required for laws, not about how much utility the law would have.')
