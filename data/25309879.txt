Item(by='t-writescode', descendants=None, kids=[25310561], score=None, time=1607125685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307310, text='This response frustrates me because while it&#x27;s technically correct, I think it misses what I was saying entirely.<p>My perception of what the OP was going for was a complain that the Senate is, in some way and not representing anything - just arbitrary wills.<p>It is representing something, though. It&#x27;s the second half of congress and it&#x27;s meant to represent the will of the states as a whole.<p>Calling it a &quot;majoritarian body of which the constituents are states&quot;, while technically correct, is full of sufficiently advanced language as to lose meaning in regular conversation.<p>Instead, I explained how it is equal representation, of sorts - the things that are being represented are the states, so it is fair, of sorts.<p>It&#x27;s easier for a person who doesn&#x27;t want to read a set of scholarly words to think &quot;oh, so it&#x27;s a democracy, except all the states are people&quot; than it is to break down each word - at least, I think it is, which is why I worded it that way.<p>Also in their statement, I assumed, was an assumption that it&#x27;s unfair and therefore the Senate is worthless and should be abolished because it ignores everyone&#x27;s will - even when working properly - so, I tried to compact that in there, as well, by trying to bring implications that the United States of America is not just a collective of people, but it&#x27;s also a collective of states and each of them desires representation in our democracy.<p>I guess, thank you for the etymology lesson, but it missed my whole point.')
