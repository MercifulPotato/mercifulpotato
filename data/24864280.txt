I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re effective for you but if people are not responsible enough to be trusted taking them without killing themselves then you might as well be arguing to legalize heroine for treatment as well. It would probably be even more effective.<p>And for the record I do think it probably should be legal for treatment anyway.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;drug-topics&#x2F;opioids&#x2F;opioid-overdose-crisis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;drug-topics&#x2F;opioids&#x2F;opioid-overdos...</a>')
