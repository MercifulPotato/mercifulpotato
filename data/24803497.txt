It still doesn&#x27;t quite make sense in my thought process.  Does a dog &#x27;imply&#x27; a mammal?  I wouldn&#x27;t think so, a dog guarantees a mammal.<p>&#x27;Implies&#x27; to me suggests a possible underlying interpretation.  If someone tells me he wants to eat, it implies that he is hungry.   However he might not be hungry, he might be strict about eating at 8pm for other reasons.  An &#x27;implication&#x27; is perhaps the most likely association, but not necessarily the correct one.')
