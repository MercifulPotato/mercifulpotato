At best, he hard-coded his own email address to receive an alert, however, this also goes unnoticed, since, as you stated initially, he&#x27;s dead.<p>Look, whatever company this was, was relying on YAHOO as its data source for making million+ dollar trades -- not Reuters, or Bloomberg, or JP Morgan, but YAHOO -- and then, for MONTHS -- not hours, or days, but MONTHS -- nobody in its finance department or trading desk or whatever happened to notice that the incoming data feeds were not matching up with quotes from counterparties, market makers, CNBC, colleagues, Wall St Journal?
