Groceries, in particular, I pay with both checks and cards. Admittedly, this is still a problem with many envelope budgeting SW, but they usually have ways to mitigate this.<p>The other problem: Say I have two checking accounts A and B, and I pay for groceries with A and car expenses with B. One month I overspend car stuff and my envelope for B is in the negative, and I don&#x27;t have enough emergency reserve. I take money out of my grocery envelope under A to bring the car envelope in B back to 0.<p>Now if I did this in GnuCash, it will show a wrong balance in  one of my checking accounts (unless I physically transferred money between the two accounts).<p>Your setup will work if you tend to spend everything from one account. I am curious, though: If you do it this way, doesn&#x27;t it make reconciling a bit of a pain? Let me explain:<p>When I go to do groceries, I usually have multiple categories I am purchasing (example below):<p>1. Groceries = $60<p>2. Supplies = $30<p>3. Miscellaneous (catch-all) = $10<p>I pay with a check of $100. How do you represent this in GnuCash? Will you list 3 separate transactions coming out of each virtual subaccount? If so, do you then not reconcile with your bank statement? Or does GnuCash let you mark it all as one transaction under Checking to make reconciliation easy?<p>Ledger CLI has good support for &quot;true&quot; virtual accounts, so that the &quot;real&quot; accounts show the real world transactions (it will show up as one transaction from Checking to the Grocery Store), while simultaneously letting you split this into the 3 virtual budget accounts.')
