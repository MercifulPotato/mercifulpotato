The links in the article lead to the website selling products whose team member (and co-founder) is the author of the article. It doesn&#x27;t mean the actual contents of the article is false, but I feel less inclined to believe a businessman than a scientist when it comes to scientific issues. Heck, even sleep scientists can be very wrong (see Walker vs Guzey, discussed several times on HN).')
