The entire point of the evidence that exists is that Jan 6&#x27;th dramatically changed the risk calculation. Without Jan 6&#x27;th I can imagine that Parler might still be online. But if you ignore Jan 6&#x27;th and it&#x27;s impacts you ignore a large part of the calculation going on for a business.
