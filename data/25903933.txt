At least those who downvote and flag posts and comments, tend to effectively cancel particular views a lot.<p>Pretty sad state of affairs, as the hivemind remains a political bias, as new users don&#x27;t have the same rights to manage visibility. Even on Reddit the Hivemind can&#x27;t kill a comment completely. IMO comments&#x2F;posts should never fall below 1 karma points, karma shouldn&#x27;t be visible, just affect ranking, and comments only be removed by moderators, with an explanation, which community rule was broken.')
