If you are trafficking in unique_ptr customizations, you are coding The Hard Way. std::unique_ptr is convenient mechanism, not an organizing principle. Make a named class or class template with a member that is a unique_ptr, and traffic in instances of that class, by value.<p>If you are working with FILE pointers, you are doing things the hard way. Do you have some library that demands you give it a FILE pointer? Otherwise you probably want a std::filebuf. Likely on the stack, or a member of class that provides a more useful abstraction than a raw file.')
