You&#x27;re already building and deploying on different operating systems, how much can a different architecture complicate things? Well...<p>What if you&#x27;re using interpreted or VM languages (Python, Java, PHP)? Unless you have native dependencies, very little changes.<p>If you build native code (C&#x2F;C++, Go, Rust), then you might need to cross-compile. That might range from super-easy if you&#x27;re 100% Rust or Go, to challenging if you have C&#x2F;C++ dependencies.<p>But you use CI, right? In that case, the problem almost disappears. Test locally (ARM) without cross-compiling, build and deploy on CI (x86) without cross-compiling.<p>Who builds deployment artefacts locally these days? Hopefully very few. :-)<p>There are some macOS-on-M1-specific issues you might face if you&#x27;re using Docker (native ARM or virtualised x86) containers, but those will clear up soon enough.<p>I&#x27;d take the improved CPU and memory performance of the M1, but I don&#x27;t need a laptop refresh, and the Mac Mini can&#x27;t drive two DisplayPort displays yet.')
