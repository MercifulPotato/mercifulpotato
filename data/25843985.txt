Countries in the EU have negative interest rates and it won&#x27;t be too long before we have negative rates in the US.<p>Meanwhile, bitcoin is on its way to becoming a reserve asset and is being seen as a must-own asset by the best and brightest money managers and companies.<p>Bitcoin has been a lifeline in countries where the local currency has failed--like Syria, Venezuela, Argentina. It&#x27;s allowed people to stay ahead of repressive regimes like in Hong Kong and Nigeria.<p>And it&#x27;s going to allow people in the United States who&#x27;s currency is being debased and where inflation is eating away at savings and retirement to have a fighting chance at being able to support themselves in the future.<p>You might want to understand how theft-by-inflation works [1].<p>Or how the dollar is gradually losing its status as the world reserve currency [2]. It&#x27;s not going to be pretty.<p>[1] &quot;Masters and Slaves of Money&quot;—<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breedlove22.medium.com&#x2F;masters-and-slaves-of-money-255ecc93404f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;breedlove22.medium.com&#x2F;masters-and-slaves-of-money-2...</a><p>[2] &quot;The Fraying of the US Global Currency Reserve System&quot;—<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lynalden.com&#x2F;fraying-petrodollar-system&#x2F;</a>')
