(At least in terms of the service itself, bad code and bad deploys are still a thing)<p>It&#x27;s different tradeoffs and the vast majority of shops are not set up to compete with AWS in terms of uptime.<p>I&#x27;m not an AWS apologist by any means and in fact I&#x27;ve been moving services off AWS over the last few years, but I can&#x27;t abide your claims of FUD.')
