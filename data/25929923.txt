What happened?<p>I got some good real talk about that one, and some smoke and mirrors. It was a good baloney extractor.<p>I think an important thing is to ask interviewers to pick a concrete instance of a thing you&#x27;re interested in, such as poor work&#x2F;life balance, and talk about the most recent one. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;oh, we have great work life balance,&quot; but that&#x27;s different for everyone, and frankly it&#x27;s just too easy to gloss over. Ask them why they worked late the last time they worked late.<p>For example, with your question:<p>When interviewing perspective employees, does the entire team participate in the interview process and make a hire &#x2F; no hire decision as a team?<p>I&#x27;d instead ask:<p>Had you talked with the most recent person who joined your team before they were hired?')
