I want it to be <i>impossible</i> for them to do so. Why leave the option open?<p>&gt; Basically, by fighting data caps, you&#x27;re demanding that a grandma who only checks their email once a day has to pay as much as a family of four who streams Netflix in 4K every waking hour of the day.<p>You do realize that ISPs <i>already</i> tier their offerings in such a way that this is a non-issue? Grandma would buy the 10Mbit&#x2F;s package, the family would buy the 1Gig&#x2F;s. I have no issue with <i>that</i> sort of tiered pricing. That&#x27;s a perfectly fine division to make. But, slapping arbitrary data xfer caps on top of that is dirty double-dipping.')
