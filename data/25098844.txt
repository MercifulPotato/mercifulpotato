It&#x27;s great that there is a 95% chance that your stock RSUs will increase. But if there is a 90% chance that within 3 years it&#x27;s a 15% increase or more, you should rather use the 15% increased figure for calculation instead. And then the risk is much higher because it&#x27;s not just stock not going down, but stock not going up as quickly as it did before.')
