Item(by='maest', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604395623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975371, text='&gt; I currently fund the internet to the tune of $10&#x2F;month using Brave. Someday that will be $100&#x2F;month.<p>Honest question - how much does that money actually reach the creators? Brave is sitting in the middle and I assume a. is charging a fee and b. has to be trusted to properly account for the money it has to pay creators.<p>It&#x27;s a weird sort of marketplace where supply (content) isn&#x27;t constrained at all, since it&#x27;s trivial to duplicate. This means there&#x27;s limited incentive for Brave to be nice to creators.<p>Are there any (3rd party, not Brave) stats on how much money creators are getting?')
