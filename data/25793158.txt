It fits in with News Corps long war on news aggregating tech firms (Google, largely) and their several failed attempts to lead alternative services controlled by the traditional publishing industry (with themselves in the steering seat.)<p>So, having failed to compete, they’ve just decided to lobby government to put its finger on the scale to impose a plan as nonviable as their own prior commercial ventures: if they can’t succeed in the news aggregating portal business, they’ll make news aggregation and search a business in which success is brutally punished with terms that make the business completely nonviable.')
