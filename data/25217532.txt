Item(by='woofgum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606373434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25215843, text='&gt;  I’ve never seen or heard someone who is placed on a PIP successfully “exit” the PIP<p>I have and at Amazon and AWS. The pattern I have seen is medical related. Someone is on some sort of medication that is screwing with their abilities and don&#x27;t realize it. I&#x27;ve seen multiple cases: one where it was meds that caused liver problems and the person didn&#x27;t know they were supposed to get regularly testing (crappy doctor) and another where they found out meds they were on caused short-term memory loss. These surfaced during the PIPs and were fixed - and the folks got out fine.')
