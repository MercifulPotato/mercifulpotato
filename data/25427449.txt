As someone VERY EAGER to enter this family of languages today, I ended up giving up on all of that and decided to just learn OCaml.<p>This was my exact path. A friend and I wanted to make a small SaaS using Reason for the backend, because it smoothed out a bunch of what we considered were &quot;rough edges&quot; in OCaml. Then the ReScript split happened, and we realised that Reason was dead for all intents and purposes. It&#x27;s hard to imagine the Reason team will continue updating Reason when they&#x27;re focusing hard on ReScript instead.')
