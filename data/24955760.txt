If this just happens to map reasonably to some n dimensional problem and the parameters of the swarm can be tweaked (evolve) to better map to it you can have logic with few moving parts. A simple example would be to first place the sugar pot in random locations until it ends up next to the coffee machine from where it migrates to the coffee table. The bags of sugar (to refill the pot) move around similarly.')
