Other comments mentioned some compile time options. But in my experience most Ruby doesn&#x27;t really use metaprogramming for really hard cases. I&#x27;ve translated some larger modules to crystal recently and while there are magic things like activerecord out there, most metaprogramming is... simple. Often a glorified &quot;I&#x27;d rather write a loop than repeat 3 similar method implementations&quot;. Outside of generic framework code I never ran into something meta which can&#x27;t be trivially expanded to slightly repeating (and more readable) code.')
