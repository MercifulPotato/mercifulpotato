Computers are more accessible because they&#x27;re cheaper. My dad managed to figure out VisiCalc for himself back in the day, and he wasn&#x27;t &quot;technical&quot;, he was just in sales.<p>IMO there&#x27;s an unfortunate tendency nowadays to infantilize users.<p>How can we say simultaneously that &quot;computers are the future&quot; and also accept a situation where the majority of people are just assumed to be technically incompetent and incapable of learning?<p>&gt; companies have incentive to minimize support requests.<p>In my experience, for example supporting my mom, there&#x27;s no difference in the volume of support requests. The only difference is that you can actually fix problems that occur on the Mac, whereas if someone experiences a problem on iOS, they&#x27;re basically doomed.')
