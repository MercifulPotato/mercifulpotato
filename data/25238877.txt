In either case the idea the the constitution is proof of Due Process is delusional in the face of 1000&#x27;s of data points proving the contrary<p>The constitution is more religion than it is law, as like the priests of other religions,  the priests of the law (lawyers and judges) twist and pervert the plain text of the constitution to mean anything they desire even a clear and exact opposite position of the very text they hold to be scared<p>&gt;&gt;but, it isn&#x27;t that bad because it is an outlined process, and it does not happen overnight, behind closed doors or behind a company friendly terms of service. At least you know how the meat is made, somewhat and there is transparency.<p>This is also false,  there are all kinds of actual laws, or defacto laws, or regulations that are behind paywalls or simply ruled &quot;national security laws&quot;,  we have secret courts (FISA and others), there are all kinds of Sealed judgments that impact other things.
