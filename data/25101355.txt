Item(by='incog_nit0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605449948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100050, text='Also 38, also married, also two daughters, also have depression.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you what works or not for you but I can say what helped me go from suicidal over a failing business to functional enough to interview at 20+ tech companies and land a job I like.<p>I firstly spoke with someone. Dealing with depression totally alone is not easy. I don&#x27;t know your wife (ofc) but if someone married you they (probably?) care enough to hear more than just good news from you.  If you really can&#x27;t afford to share with your wife then damn, that&#x27;s rough, but do share with someone who knows your situation and can advise your doctor, a therapist, a parent, someone.<p>Deleting contacts on social is a symptom of depression. I did it and my counsellor raised it. Ask yourself if you&#x27;d notice if someone unfriended you first? It&#x27;s not like FB notifies you. Your friends and family care, they do, but they also have their own lives and also let&#x27;s be honest, a lot of people hardly check FB in depth these days anyways. No one is going to notice their friend list drop down by 1.<p>&gt; I eat the cheapest fast food lunch alone<p>I&#x27;m gonna be dictatorial on this one and just say &#x27;stop&#x27;. Don&#x27;t do it. Junk food is a treat, like ice cream. You wouldn&#x27;t incorporate ice cream as a regular part\nof your nutrition.<p>&gt; then it gets late and I have no more energy to do anything useful<p>That&#x27;s true for any parent, especially those dealing with stress and depression. You&#x27;re not alone on this one. I get done with the day after tucking my kids in and I literally have like 1-2 hours to maybe learn something tech related to advance my career or veg out with my wife and enjoy a TV show. It sucks, but that&#x27;s life, no parent I&#x27;ve spoken with differs in this regard.<p>&gt; I have no idea how to spend my free time.<p>Another symptom of depression. Loss of interest in things we used to enjoy doing or withdrawing from hobbies. So what if you have 1000 games, they&#x27;re there to give you joy not anxiety. You might have 9000 grains of rice in a 1lb bag in your cupboard but you don&#x27;t worry about when you&#x27;ll eat each individual one. Let them be, not playing them is as valid an option as playing them. Probably more so if you&#x27;re time poor.<p>&gt; Every time I&#x27;m asked to give an estimate for something I feel like I&#x27;m pulling a random number out of my ass.<p>I think software has this problem regardless, some of us are better at estimating some less so. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that. Unless you&#x27;re repeating a development task you&#x27;ve done before many times (write a new rest controller, develop a CRUD web app) it&#x27;s heard to give an estimate on something you haven&#x27;t done before.<p>Pick a language you like and which advances the career you want and just start reading, hacking, messing around with it. Python&#x27;s a great one for work and play tbh, but the important thing is to start. Most of the great coders I&#x27;ve worked with just get stuck into something new, they don&#x27;t seem to care too much whether what they&#x27;re learning will be obsolete or is non-optimal. I myself struggle with this one which is probably why I only know Java :)')
