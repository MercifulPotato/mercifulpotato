I am in early 30s, program for a living, I don&#x27;t like bars or loud places for reasons that would make sense if I explained them but don&#x27;t want to go into full details here, and generally like sarcastic people who can have a discussion about topics and not just repeat what they have been told by headlines or what social media tells them to believe.<p>I mean, yes, they can have the same opinions of course, but they should be able to at least say why they believe those things.<p>Also, doesn&#x27;t help I moved around a lot as an only child, so its almost like I missed out on &quot;education&quot; of keeping long term friendships.<p>I&#x27;ve tried seeking therapy for it, but can&#x27;t seem to get anyone to really help me with this, since I guess they see someone who can hold a normal conversation with them, a job, and other stuff and don&#x27;t get what the issue is.<p>I guess the odd thing is I can hold down conversations with people at work and if I get to know someone no problem. Problem is getting to know people and making connections with people who I like. Just can&#x27;t really relate to many people it feels like, probably due to my unique upbringing as a child.<p>I have a girlfriend as well, but it just feels like we don&#x27;t connect for the above reasons. Sort of wish I had a gilfriend that was goal oriented, sarcastic, and had similar interest as me. But, frankly, never seen anyone out there like that. Probably will end up marrying her and wondering if I eventually get a divorce down the line.<p>Feel like I would make more connections with people in a higher educated part of the country, probably near some ivy league schools or something. Although I know that sounds stuck up as hell to say, but I just would love to talk with people who can actually think for themselves, be sarcastic, and be interesting enough to bounce conversations off of.<p>Don&#x27;t know how to solve my issues and I guess nor do therapists. Don&#x27;t know why I am even posting this here I guess. Maybe on the off chance someone reads it and is able to help somehow.')
