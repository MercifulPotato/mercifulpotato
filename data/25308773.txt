If someone breaks the rule, it doesn&#x27;t matter what they say; the response will be just this outrage. And if they&#x27;re a billionaire themselves (or classified by the audience thereas), woe betide. This is not complex conversation—it&#x27;s ritual behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing against wealth redistribution, siding with billionaires, lacking empathy for what people are living through, or anything of the sort—quite the contrary. I&#x27;m just observing that the conversation manifesting in threads like this has a distinctive quality: it is basically our version of feces-hurling in primates, and I&#x27;m curious about how weird that is and how weird it is that its weirdness goes unnoticed.')
