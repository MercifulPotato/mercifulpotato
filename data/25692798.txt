It wasn&#x27;t that way in 1791 and it shouldn&#x27;t be that way now.<p>I do think that Twitter and Facebook need to be exceptionally careful and use their powers more sparingly, but there&#x27;s absolutely no reason that they should have to repeat people literally coordinating and normalizing shooting elected officials, like many threads on Parler are at the moment--- speech that almost everyone agrees is not protected by the First Amendment anyways.')
