Item(by='CivBase', descendants=None, kids=[25731211], score=None, time=1610382343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730853, text='I disagree with what he said, but you&#x27;re seemingly doing your best to make his point.<p>He&#x27;s saying that when a person don&#x27;t like something, the recent trend is to just label it as &quot;inciting violence&quot;.  He then adds onto that by saying the idea of &quot;silence is violence&quot; means that anyone who does not speak out against the disliked thing is inherently guilty of &quot;inciting violence&quot; as well, so lurkers and moderates are not safe from being labeled.<p>Again, I disagree with what he said.  However, accusing his post of threatening violence against everyone with whom he disagrees does kind of support his point.')
