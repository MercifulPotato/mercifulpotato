Here&#x27;s a real example of a pre-seed pitch deck that I&#x27;m using for my meetings with investors [1]. I&#x27;ll explain why I like Pitch.<p>I am a first time founder. I am a technical guy who have to be a jack-of-all-trades for the past 6 months. I am a type of guy who&#x27;s really bad at designing slides. Leave me with PowerPoint or Google Presentation and you&#x27;ll see the ugliest presentation in your life.<p>I had to do a pitch deck and I saw Pitch app. I applied for a beta access and got it about 4 months ago.<p>Pitch was exactly what I needed: a set of pre-defined slides, graphs, tables which don&#x27;t allow someone like me to make bad decisions doing presentation.<p>I am more than happy with my presentation. It looks OK without me doing any extra work.<p>If you&#x27;re 0 at making presentations then Pitch is for you. For other, can&#x27;t really say.<p>Pitch team, good job, thx. I&#x27;m not paying you so hope that at least this comment will do some good for you.<p>P.S. I&#x27;ve read that Pitch raised $50M pre-launch. Did they pivot or what?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;61deced0-886c-4c28-a657-72013d35c04e&#x2F;e7846aa5-5432-4273-9e9b-1d1fabd81cb4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.pitch.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;61deced0-886c-4c28-a6...</a>')
