It has not died yet, it is instead being rewritten while the old one is on life support.<p>The technical debt accrued due to:<p>1. Poor code practices (C++, poor use or understanding of pointers and threads created most of the actual errors in the program that make it unstable)<p>2. Excessive copy&#x2F;paste (so bad decisions propagated quickly)<p>3. Poor architecture (didn&#x27;t scale, performance is technically fine but <i>development</i> costs exploded as new capabilities were added)<p>4. Poor testing (almost entirely manual, as the system grew this grew with it to the point of creating major delays in releases)<p>They&#x27;re rewriting it now keeping these lessons in mind. They&#x27;re surviving because they&#x27;re part of a larger org that can afford to keep them around for the rewrite, but essentially this now 10-12 year old system is dead. The other reason they&#x27;re surviving is they happen to have only one competitor, whose product costs 10x as much per seat. So their customers want them to survive <i>if</i> they can hit the quality improvements in the rewrite, failing that they&#x27;ll be disbanded.')
