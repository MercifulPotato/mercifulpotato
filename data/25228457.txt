In this case it&#x27;s just moving from it&#x27;s intial orbit to the Moon&#x27;s orbit, which are both around the Earth.<p>The Hohmann transfer does not include the capture burn that is required to enter a sustained orbit around the Moon.<p>Disclaimer, I&#x27;m just a KSP fan, so feel free to correct any of the above. Had to make an effort to use Moon, not Mun.')
