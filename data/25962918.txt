If you run configure and make on the upstream package, you will not only lose the patches CentOS normally applies to the package to integrate it better with the system, but your patch will also be untracked by the package manager.<p>Building a source package is trivial. Just download the srpm, run rpm -i just like you normally would. This will extract the package. Look at rpmbuild&#x2F;SPECS directory. There is your &quot;spec file&quot; which is a list of patches to apply and the exact commands used to build the package.<p>Add the upstream patch that fixes the security problem and step the least significant version number. Run rpmbuild -ba on the spec file. A binary rpm will now be built that can be installed in the normal way. This may sound intimidating at first, but it is really very simple. Also, congratulations on your first step on maintaining a package.<p>Alternatively, you can also grab the latest version from Rawhide if it has the fix. This will often have the patch and you can lift it straight out and use on the old version. Or you could just build the new version, but there can be hard dependencies on newer libraries which may not be easily available to you.')
