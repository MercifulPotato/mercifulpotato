I tried a bunch of high-end headphones through a switchable amp and I bought the one I thought had the best qualities I was looking for. There was a clear and huge difference in quality and character between each headphone but I didn&#x27;t need the most expensive one (Sennheiser 650 I believe) because it sounded too nice for my purpose (studio). Went for the BD 990&#x27;s instead.<p>Distortion and frequency response graphs are pretty important but not the only important thing in terms of sounds quality. And sometimes you want speakers or cans that simply look cool or have a certain size.')
