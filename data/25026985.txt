I know you can&#x27;t generalize like that. There are probably a lot friendly Haskellers around ;)<p>I was just angry when I wrote my last comment, because I had to read this:<p>&gt;&gt; as a special case of most people are idiots<p>which is so low in multiple ways. It&#x27;s also just wrong, because by definition most people have average intelligence. Even if you think this is true, a smart person would not use it as an argument^^<p>It&#x27;s on my todo-list to dive a bit into haskell, when I find time.')
