This would make the need for cryptography drop away completely, and trusted third parties mostly. Individual voters could verify that their votes were counted correctly, and everyone could verify that eg dead people didn&#x27;t vote.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is a good policy, just a hard technical tradeoff of what would be required for verifiable voting without cryptography.<p>It&#x27;s an all or nothing proposition too. A hybrid system (opt in to make your vote public so it can be publicly verified) would create additional vote pools that would differ based on ideological preferences and thereby attract calls to disenfranchise, as we&#x27;ve seen for mail in voting.')
