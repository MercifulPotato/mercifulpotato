The big problem for a lot of skills is that the production capacity of a human is not high enough to pay for that fixed cost or just barely profitable enough for the top 10000 humans to have a career in this skill. If you somehow increase the productivity of humans with that skill you are massively reducing the barrier to entry which means more people can make a living out of it.')
