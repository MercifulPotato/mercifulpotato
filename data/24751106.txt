I don&#x27;t do this kind of deep customization for the same reason I don&#x27;t use many plugins in vim or a browser: It would render me completely useless on 99.999999999% of the other terminals out there. I have a few different laptops, a desktop, and even with total control of those devices, I still end up on other people&#x27;s hardware.<p>If you have medical reasons, I mean, I guess it&#x27;s better than nothing, but this reads to me like the computing equivalent of moving into the woods and becoming a hermit.')
