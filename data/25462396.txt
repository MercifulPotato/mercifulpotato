I had categories for my hobbies and it was really fun to stumble on different pages relating to one of my hobbies. As it is, this is fun and takes you to sites you&#x27;d never have gone to on your own!<p>Another idea - people have already mentioned the ability to report pages but I think it&#x27;d be cool to be able to upvote a page. Then for each category you could have a rolling leaderboard of the most upvoted pages in the past 7 days or whatever. Some people might just want to look at that, or look at that in addition to getting rando pages.<p>Good luck!')
