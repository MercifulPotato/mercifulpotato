They should look for something which is good and solves their problems. I don&#x27;t know how something with the attribute boring is of interest here as other attributes for a technology&#x2F;PL might be much more important...<p>Actually they mean something different with &quot;boring&quot;: It is just a lack of courage for simply saying &quot;We are most conservative, do not want to move forwards and are not willing to take any risk. Also we are scared of specialists and talent and want to stay mediocre. Actually working with us is boring.&quot;')
