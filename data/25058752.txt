Our users can spin up a notebook server with near real-time collaboration to work with others, and no setup because the environment is there.<p>The same with training jobs: they can click on a button and schedule a long-running notebook that runs against a specific environment to avoid &quot;just yesterday I had X accuracy on my machine&quot;. The runs are tracked, the models, parameters, and metrics are automatically tracked because if we rely on a notebook author to do it, they might forget or have to context switch and it&#x27;s an added cognitive load.<p>Some problems we faced were during deployment, too, where a &quot;data scientist&quot; writes a notebook to train a model and then we had to deploy that model reading their notebook or looking into dependencies. Now they can click on a button and deploy whichever model they want. It really was hindering us because they were asking someone else&#x27;s help, who may have been working on something else.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>')
