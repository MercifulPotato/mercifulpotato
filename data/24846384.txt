There&#x27;s Udoo Bolt. Sapphire and iBASE also has several boards.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any decent contenders with multiple m2 sockets based on ARM, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re specifically looking for. But you can always buy a cable or board that splits or bifurcates a single interface into multiple m2 slots. I haven&#x27;t tried any of these myself but there are plenty of options on Ali, eBay, or directly from embedded&#x2F;industrial vendors depending on your cost&#x2F;reliability preferences.<p>I&#x27;ve spent quite some time looking around for the optimal low-footprint storage cluster options and eventually ended up with mITX form-factor after realizing I want plenty of RAM and need more cores per node to handle ZFS+gluster+encryption.<p>There are plenty of options if you don&#x27;t, though!<p>I&#x27;d advice to check out the APU&#x27;s, either way. They have served me very well until I started upgrading and have now been repurposed for other use.')
