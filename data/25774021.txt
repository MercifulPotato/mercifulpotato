Claiming it&#x27;s just a thing for governments is just a massive display of both ignorance and arrogance.<p>Put bluntly: I don&#x27;t care if the constitution of some country on another continent decides to only specifically protect people from government censorship. I care about as much as I do about the Chinese or Australian or Tongan legal systems.<p>Last time I checked HN wasn&#x27;t an exclusively American community (If I was mistaken about that, I&#x27;ll be happy to fuck off to somewhere else), so it really annoys me to the extreme when people hear &quot;free speech&quot; and just assume we&#x27;re talking about USA Law. We&#x27;re not. We&#x27;re talking about ethics and what is the right thing to do, not from a regional legal perspective, but from a social and human perspective.<p>So to all &#x27;Muricans reading this: Nobody cares about the constitution of some undemocratic shithole on the other side of the pond. Get over it.<p>And to all the reasonable people from the USA: I&#x27;m honestly sorry that a few ass-hats are giving you a bad name online. I hope you don&#x27;t mind that I just had to let off some steam from all the political BS the internet has been shoving in my face as of late.')
