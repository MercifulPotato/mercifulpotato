What big tech company do you think is behind this incredible, shrewd and presumably well-funded marketing campaign? Julia is the only new major programming language of the last decade that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have a major tech giant backing it. Adoption and development are pretty much entirely grass roots. If you see a lot of enthusiastic posts about Julia on HN, that&#x27;s because there are a lot of actual people out there using Julia who love it and write posts about it.')
