In NC (1996-2012 at least), no poll workers touch ballots with identifying information in them.  On entry to the polling place, a sticker is placed beside your name on a physical rollbook to keep track of who has and hasn&#x27;t voted.  The poll worker hands you your ballot which you take to a privacy booth to mark your choices.  The voter personally inserts the anonymous ballot into the counting machine.<p>CO has universal mailings.  You mail (or drop off) your ballot in a double envelope, and only the outer envelope carries identifying information.  One workstation examines the outer envelope to track who voted, and a different workstation processes the anonymous ballots.  It requires a little more trust on the part of the voter, but also encourages more participation.')
