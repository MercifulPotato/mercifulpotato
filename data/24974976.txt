For example, FIFA&#x27;s Equipment Regulations are a hundred pages long[1].<p>Match officials in football (soccer, if you so will) very rarely wear hats (I can&#x27;t remember seeing it even once). I&#x27;m surprised that I can&#x27;t find any mention about headwear worn by match officials in the regulations, but regardless, they couldn&#x27;t just don any old hat.<p>And as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, there are other things that also can trick up AI, like white socks. There are teams that might have had white socks for a hundred years, should they be forced to change their colours to make life easier for the AI?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.fifa.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;upload&#x2F;equipment-regulations-515430.pdf?cloudid=q3drmdesvc8bbmanff8d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.fifa.com&#x2F;image&#x2F;upload&#x2F;equipment-regulation...</a>')
