Racism? Homophobia? Misogyny?<p>&gt;I will point out that the western world is almost entirely dependent on immigrants from societies that have traditional religious views on these issues for their population stability. Western social liberalism has many positive attributes, but it hasn’t proven to be self-perpetuating.<p>I think the Western world will do just fine without embracing the repulsive values I&#x27;ve listed.')
