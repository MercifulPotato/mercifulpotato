It&#x27;s cheap, available virtually everywhere. Doesn&#x27;t take batteries and generally isn&#x27;t as prone to causing eyestrain.<p>Some notes on using Dead Tree™. Depending on the font size, I print 2-4 pages per side. Be choosy on what to print, for lots of publications you can skip irrelevant chapters.<p>Finally, the A series of Dead Tree™ is much superior to the standard US letter size.')
