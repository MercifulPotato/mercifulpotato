The facebook likes and youtube clicks are so low it doesn&#x27;t account for direct friends and relatives. This means not even the journalists around the world bothered to look at any of them. They had on average 1&#x2F;3 article written about their electibility usually with the author explaining he didnt know anything about their program. Those who didnt disclaimer it all equally failed to say anything about the program.<p>There are to many of them for a [private] person to really look at all the programs but that out of many many hundreds of millions (in and outside the us) no one bothered to look at any of them rules out objectivity by the full 100%<p>It means people get all of their information from other people who also know nothing. Information limited to the top 2 groups. If team blue gets all of its information about team red from other team blue members you will have a similar total exclusion of reality.<p>End of the day you have to get off the ledge yourself either  way based on the information you&#x27;ve gathered.<p>If we want you to know what anarchy, communism or Christianity are we should have you talk wiht the anarchist, the communist or the christian.')
