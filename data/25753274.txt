(Do the window manager and the menu suck, because they don&#x27;t have the &quot;s&quot; prefix? Is st static because it doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;d&quot; prefix? Why do we abbreviate &quot;terminal&quot; but not &quot;menu&quot; &#x2F; why not follow the established abbreviation of &quot;term&quot; as in xterm, dtterm, eterm, etc.? How come the &quot;s&quot; prefix in sprop and sselp stands for &quot;simple&quot; instead of &quot;suckless&quot;?)')
