I&#x27;d go even further and say that async&#x2F;await is a great fit for a modern <i>asynchronous</i> I&#x2F;O stack (not read()&#x2F;write()). Especially with io_uring using polled I&#x2F;O (the worker thread is in the kernel, all the async runtime has to do is check for completion periodically), or with SPDK if you spin up your own I&#x2F;O worker thread(s) like @benlwalker explained elsewhere in the thread.')
