Think about what would happen.<p>Ok, so now the party that has 51% of the congress has absolute legislative power. The other 49% shouldn&#x27;t even bother to show up, they aren&#x27;t even voting on anything anymore.<p>Now we have to figure out what are the party positions? What laws are we going to pass? Well, we have to come to some internal agreement, so they probably end up having some kind of vote on each issue. So now, only 51% of 51% of the legislature have to agree on something for it to become law. Suddenly, only 26% of the population has to agree on something for it to become a law.<p>That is terrifying.<p>We do not need anything that REDUCES the level of agreement required to do something. In fact, I think some of the best aspects of the US governmental system are the checks on simple majority rule. Tyranny of the majority is a real thing to be afraid of.<p>Also, we already have the issue of a two party system not being able to accurately reflect the myriad combinations of viewpoints that real people have, and we don&#x27;t want to exacerbate the problem by removing entirely the ability to have diversity of positions within a party. We elect representatives who have a particular set of views, and that person is (usually) a member of the party whose viewpoints more closely align with. This doesn&#x27;t mean they agree on every issue.')
