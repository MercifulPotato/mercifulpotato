We&#x27;re not trying to disambiguate whether doctors are getting better at treating COVID or COVID is itself getting easier for doctors to treat.<p>Age is a strong predictor of COVID fatality, either directly or through correlates. In every US county whose stats I&#x27;ve spot-checked, deaths go up with age. It&#x27;s also one of the <i>best</i> predictors, given that advanced age is much more common in populations than stronger, but more selective factors.<p>Thus, controlling for age and nevertheless observing a reduction in mortality should be taken as an indicator that COVID is becoming comparatively more medically tractable.')
