Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603771683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24903977, text='Yeah, I&#x27;m a motorcycle sports bike rider, so the police are my &lt;David Attenborough voice&gt;natural enemy...<p>It&#x27;s kinda well known amongst my riding peers that some people &quot;fail the attitude test&quot; and end up way worse off than people who&#x27;re at least polite and businesslike when pulled over. I&#x27;ve rarely &quot;talked my way out of a ticket&quot;, but I&#x27;ve watched people talk themselves into 3 or 4 serious tickets where they could have &quot;settled&quot; for just the one relatively minor they deserved.<p>(I _did_ managed to escape without a ticket in San Francisco once, doing 100mph past a cop car on the Bay Bridge on a borrowed noisy piped Honda VTR1000 with a girl on the back wearing a blindingly white pure muppet fur jacket and a big fluffy glow-in-the-dark tule tutu. The cop car didn&#x27;t trigger my normally well honed &quot;cop radar&quot; because in my head it was just a &quot;movie cop car&quot;, not a real Australian Ford&#x2F;Holden mortal enemy carrying sedan with our local highway patrol markings, so I just kinda obliviously cruised past him in fairly light 2am traffic into town. He light up his disco lights so I pulled over at the nearest exit, pulled my helmet off to reveal a grey-beard most likely older than his dad, and said in my broadest and fairly exaggerated Aussie accent &quot;G&#x27;Day mate!&quot; and told him &quot;I was only doing about 100!&quot; to which he said &quot;Miles, you&#x27;re not driving in kilometres now&quot;, and let me go with a warning to &quot;ride safe, OK?&quot;  Pretty sure that was part middle aged white privilege combined with &quot;way too much paperwork booking an Australian&quot;, with a little but of &quot;Australians? We _love_ you guys!&quot; cultural luck thrown in for good measure... But I&#x27;ll take that rare win against them :-)  )')
