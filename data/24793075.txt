Reinventing the wheel is always easier, cognitively (perhaps while being vaguely cognizant of how there was a Roman Republic that fell to dictatorship that then fractured into hundreds of apocalyptic Christian fiefdoms and how there was an incident with this thing called Therac-25 [and maybe crystallizing that cognizance in proper government standards for medical software]).<p>Also, since the bottleneck is brain bandwidth, it&#x27;s not helpful that old code is written in old languages which were formulated in a time where the most salient bottleneck was memory&#x2F;processing speed.')
