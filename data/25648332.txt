They can easily have one&#x27;s social media account suspended, etc.<p>In such a scenario, how can one create&#x2F;maintain channels of mass communication that cannot be disrupted by such companies (and even government?). Obviously, reliance on social media companies won&#x27;t cut it.<p>The question is from technical perspective, but other thoughts would help too!<p>EDIT: Grammar')
