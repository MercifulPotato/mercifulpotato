Item(by='walrus01', descendants=None, kids=[25037714], score=None, time=1604942849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036454, text='&gt; The issue is not rich vs. poor. My internet is cheap because our building has contractually guaranteed a single monthly payment on behalf of the many units in the building for some number of years. You can make an investment based on that.<p>Also because the economics of making your building a live, on-net premises are much more favorable for the ISP. Their capex to make your building live is based on a calculation for the expected number of units that will sign up in years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the revenue projections. In the telecom industry this is an &quot;MDU&quot; - multiple dwelling unit.<p>The cost per unit served in a 65 or 95 unit apartment&#x2F;condo building is much more favorable as compared to building a new GPON FTTH network (even when 100% aerial on poles) to every house in a neighborhood of individual wood frame houses.<p>You mentioned Webpass above. Where Webpass got started, in the SF bay area, they did precisely what I described above because they could make the economics work by focusing exclusively on MDUs.')
