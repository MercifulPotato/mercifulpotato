This was never the complaint. I was explicitly stating that when you claimed this was the complaint, you were misunderstanding.<p>A story told about racism from a white persons POV is fine! What is less okay, and at a minimum needs to be taught in a larger context is a story about racism that treats race and racism as a sort of thing-to-be-observed, both in that Scout is primarily &quot;learning about racism&quot; instead of experiencing it, and black characters who are flat. The white-saviorness of Atticus can&#x27;t really be denied (especially when you draw in the larger context that Atticus was based on Harper Lee&#x27;s father, and the novel was quasi-biographical). And it&#x27;s not even conclusion that Scout draws on her own. She feels justice and fairness for all is good not because she learns through some experience, but because her father tells her so, and she greatly reveres him and respects his authority. Scouts willingness to fight for justice isn&#x27;t born out of a dislike of racism, but of a need to defend her dad.<p>Like I said, in part of a curriculum that focuses on race in America, I think TKAM is a vital book to teach, but if it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> exposure to literature-that-focuses-on-race-in-america, which for a lot of people it will be, it&#x27;s not a good tool, because you aren&#x27;t going to get exposed to the criticism I just provided in a high school context.')
