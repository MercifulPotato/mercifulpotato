But with animated ones it&#x27;s rather like making a game -- and once again the users are forced to run and complete it in order to proceed to what they were after. Good that it&#x27;s optimized (although it&#x27;s still a 60% CPU load and laggy here), but I&#x27;m rather curious how it may seem like a good idea in the first place.')
