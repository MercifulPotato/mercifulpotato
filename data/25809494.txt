Then later you end up with a bunch of teams using Kafka when far simpler things would do the trick, because it&#x27;s already available and there&#x27;s a whole team supporting it, with expertise to debug it if things go wrong. It doesn&#x27;t look good if you take the system on its own, but in context it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable decision.<p>IMHO sometimes this reasoning goes too far (I&#x27;ve seen people suggest we rewrite super relational apps to NoSQL to avoid operating SQL DBs!), but it usually comes from good intentions.')
