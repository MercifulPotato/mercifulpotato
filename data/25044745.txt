Most projects are happier to throw away merge history in favor of a linear history with ephemeral branches and semantic versioning, and that&#x27;s perfectly fine. The repository layout should be dictated by the project&#x27;s needs, be it a glorified personal Undo Log, or a management tool on top of a Subversion repository.')
