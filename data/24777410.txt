You know, there were times in history when horrible, bizarre things were norms, and somehow the societies overcame those. This is our only hope.<p>&gt; Given that I connect the iPad to the Mac via a USB-C cable, it&#x27;s not clear why iCloud is required at all. They&#x27;re just intentionally crippling their expensive devices.<p>I believe they just want to make you get used to that so one day you would&#x27;t even think about using any of your devices&#x2F;apps without iCloud.
