Now think about what you were doing 6 million years ago. You will be doing the same thing as then the day after you die.<p>You are not aware of the 13.8 billion years that preceded your birth. You have some conception of the abstraction of time, that an unknowable past has occurred, but that is not awareness.<p>You are going to die, just like the rest of us, and all that&#x27;s waiting for you is the same oblivion that yielded you in the first place.
