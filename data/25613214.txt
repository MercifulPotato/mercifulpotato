Several reports mention Windows shutdowns, sleep or hibernation, so it may be a simple unclean shutdown of the VM.<p>A bigger problem would be if Hyper-V is either ignoring memory barriers, or caching writes to the disk and losing them when the Hyper-V service is shutdown. But that would likely affect more than just WSL, so we&#x27;d have seen the problem sooner (or so I vehemently hope).')
