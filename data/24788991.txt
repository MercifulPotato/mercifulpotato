I still have my 28S (with working battery door) from when I was at University. But, while I was impressed by it&#x27;s potential, I never loved it as a device to use and I&#x27;ve stuck with my older FX-7000G as the calculator on my desk.<p>As explained here (edit - not my site, but I agree with the POV):\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ganjatron.net&#x2F;retrocomputing&#x2F;hp-28s&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ganjatron.net&#x2F;retrocomputing&#x2F;hp-28s&#x2F;index.html</a><p>&quot;I must say I have mixed feelings about this calculator. All this sophistication comes at the expense of ease of use. I find the HP-28S aggravatingly clumsy to use, and it&#x27;s not because of RPN. For starters, the clamshell design, while ideal protection, is awkward -- you&#x27;ll find yourself constantly flipping back and forth because keys on both sides are frequently used in typical operation.<p>Another major problem is that the HP-28 is, for the most part, not keystroke programmable; most commands are indirectly accessible through menus (over 20 of them).&quot;<p>Not having the ability to import from exteral storage (the IR link is out-only) is also a big minus.')
