When the delta changes, they need to adjust their shares to avoid exposure. Certainly a large part of the price action here is a gamma squeeze, where WSB folks buy tons of OTM calls, which Citadel buys shares to cover, which pushes the price up, which in turn requires them to buy more.<p>Should they no longer be able to buy or sell options to ensure the solvency of their sellers?<p>I mean, it&#x27;s totally reasonable to tell them they shouldn&#x27;t have taken on that level of risk haha.')
