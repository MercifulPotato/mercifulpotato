The problem here is that Swift seemed to be a cool language that it might work for a &quot;Hello world&quot; app. You won&#x27;t notice any problem until the thing grows up to a certain point.<p>For example, I work in embedded and I am proposed with a new &quot;X brand&quot; Chinese Modem to integrate in our devices. I don&#x27;t recommend it but since it costs less I&#x27;m pushed to evaluate it. I am handed 3 samples and they all work fine, so management convinced themselves that Brand X from China is the way to go.<p>Once in production the modems started to fail at a 10% rate (10 devices over 100 won&#x27;t work). And that is a problem you only see only when manufacturing a certain quantity of devices.<p>Now there are delays, an ongoing battle with the manufacturer of modems and a unhappy customer (that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t recommended it).')
