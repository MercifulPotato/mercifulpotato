And I totally understand the sentiment. The vaccine will mostly benefit rich white people, while the poor Africans will, as always, get the short end of the stick. And I have no doubt it will happen like that.<p>But, by refusing trials in your poor country, you basically lower your chances of getting an effective vaccine when it matters from not much to zero. Allowing trials should be a good way to negotiate a way to secure doses for yourself, since you can&#x27;t do it with money like first world countries. But it is also a way to have the vaccine tested on your population rather than only on white guys.<p>And sure, there are risks in doing that, but Covid-19 kills in Africa too. I didn&#x27;t do a risk analysis but I am quite sure it is a net positive for the &quot;guinea pig&quot; countries.<p>And sure, in an ideal world, we should all work together and treat everyone independent of status and wealth in order to end the global pandemic as quickly as possible. But past events showed us it doesn&#x27;t work like that. Rich countries fighting to secure resources (tests, masks, vaccines, ...) for themselves. The push for buying domestic products instead of from evil China. The very idea of evil China, partly justified but overblown for patriotic effect... Africa will get nothing but scraps unless they have a bargaining chip, and hosting vaccine trials could have been that chip.')
