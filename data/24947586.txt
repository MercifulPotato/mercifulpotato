(As I understand, the &quot;external funding&quot; thing is less of a problem in mathematics. Also, I have no idea how tenure works there.)<p>Back then, i think full professors were appointed by the Queen. (Certainly so for Beatrix, but he became a prof before her inauguration)<p>Being appointed by the Queen made it really difficult to fire you - one of the reasons (I was told) they stopped this practice.<p>Moreover, back then research funding worked very different from how it works now in .nl. Actually, I have some idea of how finding worked from the mid-90s on... but I&#x27;ve read that prior to early 80s, in .nl, most PhD students were part-time and not employed by the university.<p>Not sure how accurate that is. Irrespective of its accuracy, it&#x27;s clear that academic life had changed drastically since then. (In .nl at least)')
