Have fun ;)<p>One of the major issues on the web currently is that colors aren&#x27;t properly colorspaced or matched to a brightness curve, so on shitty 6-bit 100 nits panels #000 on #fff will still be grey-on-grey while on a proper 10 or 12-bit 1000 or 4000 nits panel #000 on #fff will be a color contrast of &quot;literally looking into the sun&quot; vs &quot;the darkness of the darkest night&quot;.')
