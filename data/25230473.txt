Also why a mid drive is somewhat better with full suspension due to less unsprung weight.<p>The Juiced RCS is a lot of bang for the buck, the battery is huge and mine will top out at 32mph on flat ground and go 40+ miles on charge without holding back. I have 1300 miles on mine with no issues.<p>Also look at Biktrix.')
