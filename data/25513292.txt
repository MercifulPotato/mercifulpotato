At minimum, you should have welding gloves, sturdy tongs and a face shield.  You should understand what happens when molten aluminum comes in contact with moisture (wet concrete is extremely dangerous!), practice your pouring motion with a cold crucible, and keep a bucket of water and&#x2F;or fire extinguisher nearby in case you start a fire.<p>But please research casting safety yourself, I&#x27;m no expert. 1200+F temperatures significantly more dangerous than the high temperatures we interact with in our daily lives.')
