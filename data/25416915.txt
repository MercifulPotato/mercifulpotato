Do you mean that it explains that there are more female born than male? Probably not since you say it can&#x27;t be talked about so you&#x27;re hinting at a more ideological and thus controversial claim : That masculine values are on the down or something of that kind.\nIf that&#x27;s your opinion, well it is a classic overheard reactionary argument about the pacification of social relationships and how war forge &quot;real&quot; men and you just disappointed me.')
