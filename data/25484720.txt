Taking responsibility for your own life is extremely important, and more peoe should think this way.<p>However, when taking political and social decisions and analyzing the world around us, we must also look at how people are influenced and how their chance of success or failure is affected by conditions outside of their personal agency. The fact that we are each responsible for our own happiness should not preclude us from observing that there is no downwards mobility and increasingly little upwards mobility in European and US society. It should not preculde us from observing that while productivity is increasing at all levels, wealth for middle and low income families has been stagnant for decades, while the top earners have exploded in their wealth.<p>Basically, each of us in our own lives should seek to be the best we can be. But we should also realize the limits of our individual powers and seek to collaborate and organize to achieve more than we can alone. And we shouldn&#x27;t care just about our own personal well being, about climbing up to be the next Jeff Bezos, but about the well being and success of everyone around us. You can&#x27;t build a cathedral alone, but you can inspire many people to build one with you.')
