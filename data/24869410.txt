Item(by='deergomoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603460841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24867656, text='&gt; And the worst being the attribute #[] syntax... why?!<p>Hah. Since the initial RFC was agreed, I think there were three changes to the syntax because no-one could agree. At one point it was going to be `@@attribute`. #[] is similar to or the same as Rust, I believe. It also has the advantage of being backwards compatible; while rarely used, comments in PHP can start with # instead of &#x2F;&#x2F;, so older versions of PHP will just see an attribute as a comment. Of course, that also means that a comment in old code might now be interpreted as an attribute, but there you go.<p>Single @ is probably a no go because @ is already the error suppressing operator. Now, in my opinion that should be ejected from the language with extreme prejudice, but I doubt it ever will be.')
