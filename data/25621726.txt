Performance get faster.<p>Phase 3: PM thinks that offline scenario is not worth optimizing for since most users have internet anyway, performance and features degrades.<p>Phase 4: Some developer forget that offline is even a valid scenario, device becomes useless without connection.<p>Phase 5: Company servers broken. Device useless.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this happen to multiple products. We would like to believe that things top at phase 2 but here again i think we reached all the way to 5. Useless might be an overstatement since it still points somewhat in the vicinity but it certainly not working as intended. Do they have some kind of meter showing how good accuracy it has so you know when it&#x27;s inaccurate or not?')
