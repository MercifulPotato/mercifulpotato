But seriously: do you Signal fans have to derail every conversation?<p>Do you have to take a jab at every other messenger at every given opportunity?<p>Or can we agree that there&#x27;s room for more than one solution? Because physical mail, email, irc, Telegram etc are probably going to stay around for a long time, at least until Signal solves:<p>- large groups<p>- backups<p>- grows a stable messaging API<p>- creates a Bot api<p>- and starts teleporting physical goods<p>- etc<p>Until Signal solves all this we are going to have to deal with other mesaging solutions.<p>Deal with it. Seriously.<p>Yes: Signal is probably the most secure now IMO.<p>No: talking down other messengers doesn&#x27;t make it better.<p>@dang: apologies in advance. I&#x27;ve tried hard to keep it polite.')
