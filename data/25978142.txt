Item(by='iamoverworked', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612093862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977798, text='&gt; it is broadly true that the 90s was a happier time than present.<p>I do have some great memories from the 90s, but for a few years I lived in a town south of Chicago that was heavy in gangs where I would regularly hear semi-automatic gun fire, see the river getting trolled for bodies and lived next to a professional bike thief. My father&#x27;s truck was robbed of tools, my bike was stolen, my friends were poor as dirt and I couldn&#x27;t play in their yards because I am white and they were afraid their neighbors would beat the shit out of me or kill me, and one of those friends was in a gang (learned that 15 years later).\nI remember lots of good things, but my 90s experience wasn&#x27;t all that pleasant.')
