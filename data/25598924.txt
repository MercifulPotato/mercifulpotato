I mean, not carrying too much cash (but of course if they find you with a suitcase full of cash, they will ask you where you got all that cash from), but you can&#x27;t pay in a shop more than 2.000 euros (and they will lower this limit to 1.000 and possibly less in the future). Also you can&#x27;t pay your employee cash, you have to pay in traceable manners something that you want to deduct from taxes like medical expenses, and so on.<p>Transaction with cash between private citizens are permitted tough (like buying a used car in cash), but it&#x27;s not a good idea to do so if you don&#x27;t trust the other party (because then how can I prove that I gave you the money?)')
