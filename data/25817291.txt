Mass produced reactors can use mass produced components, be built under standardized conditions by a standardized team, have a standard regulatory pathway, undergo rigorous testing to increase community good-will, and have a standard decommissioning process. There are thousands of experts working on and hundreds of millions of dollars being put into modular reactor concepts; if you&#x27;ve found something in just 10 minutes with a highschool level education that proves they&#x27;re all wasting their time and money, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ed love to hear it.')
