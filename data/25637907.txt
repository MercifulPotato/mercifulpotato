To be fair I think none of these issues has to have a union to solve it, its just the majority of tech companies are really not fixing these major issues and most likely will never fix them.<p>&gt; but you also have a lot of low performing lifers counting their days to retirement<p>I see this as a huge issue with unions. But I feel you have the same folks in large tech companies, they fall into a large team, the company is profitable so its not looking for layoffs, the person&#x2F;s fall under the radar and they contribute as little as possible.')
