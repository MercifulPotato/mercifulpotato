They are breaking the spec anyways. A simple timeout would be equally spec-breaking and a lot easier to understand and use.<p>The weird async-callback-chaining doesn&#x27;t actually limit any nefarious behaviour. It just requires the code author to carefully stay inside their arbitrary happy-path. A simple timeout after a user gesture is just simpler. Furthermore this is something that you can&#x27;t test without buying a thousand dollar device.')
