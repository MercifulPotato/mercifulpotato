It&#x27;s still not perfect, but unlike &quot;emotional support animals&quot; there are actually pretty strict testing guidelines.  I went through it with one of my old dogs to volunteer at a children&#x27;s shelter and the testing authorities that I worked with took it VERY seriously.  Likely because I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d face pretty serious backlash if a dog they passed were to attack someone at a nursing home&#x2F;hospital.<p>The support animal thing of &quot;I just need this animal near me&quot; without any regards to the temperament of the animal itself never made sense to me.')
