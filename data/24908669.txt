For example, I&#x27;d argue a language like Ruby is simpler in many aspects than using VBA or building complex formulas.<p>Like Microsoft, Google Sheets also has quite an ugly, clumsy feel to its syntax.<p>The terrible programmable usability of these products (Excel and Sheets) could only have come from the mind of a developer (harsh I know, but true).')
