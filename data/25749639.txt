Fortunately they weren&#x27;t busy, &amp; I tried to apologize for taking so long &amp; explained I felt it was a matter of honesty to know what I was agreeing to, and they printed things for me and let me cross some of it out.

(It unfortunately seems like on medical stuff, it helps to get as much as possible covered before the visit, also for financial questions, making sure everyone is in-network etc etc, so I am now trying to remember to ask for everything in advance sometimes.)')
