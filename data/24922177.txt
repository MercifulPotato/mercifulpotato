It&#x27;s a small premium for me, but not unreasonable for something as useful as it. If they really like it, they can toss me $10 whenever we actually see each other again.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d be way more eager to pay double, if it meant I was unlocking &quot;host&quot; abilities to start the game, while everyone else could join for free in an app&#x2F;website.<p>Fantasy Grounds got me this way. I dropped the money so everyone else could just download the demo and join in the games that I host. Easily worth the cost to me considering I run a game every other Saturday right now (and trying to run additional games).')
