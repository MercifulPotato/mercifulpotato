This creates less room for miscommunication, and creates a space where we can both leave async notes or topics for the next 1:1. This is largely the extend of the process I follow - I don&#x27;t prescribe how verbose I am, the structure, etc. I just make sure the important stuff is written in that document.<p>I (personally) take notes in the moment in part to stay focused on the conversation and ensure that I&#x27;m communicating clearly. I don&#x27;t pore over my notes after I&#x27;ve taken them, but find that the act of writing them helps me remember and internalize information that&#x27;s been shared.<p>Beyond that, what _doesn&#x27;t_ work, in my opinion, is adding a process-heavy workflow like creating an Issue&#x2F;PR&#x2F;Doc for every conversation, or doing anything that&#x27;s not write it and forget it. Every time I have tried doing something more structured, it&#x27;s resulted in the process not being followed.<p>I hope that&#x27;s helpful, and happy to answer any more questions!')
