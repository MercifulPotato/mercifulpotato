Some people really are unaware of the risks of handing their child an iPad to play a Sonic game. They&#x27;re unaware of features like family accounts or app store controls to prevent payments.<p>An argument to this I keep seeing is &quot;well if the parent doesn&#x27;t understand it then the kid shouldn&#x27;t be using it.&quot;  Heck, if my parents only allowed me to play with things they understood, I&#x27;d never be in a software engineering career. Parents should be able to make a mistake with a video game an not have to pay _16 thousand dollars_ to recover from it.')
