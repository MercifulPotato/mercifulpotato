It&#x27;s visibly productive, nominally helpful, and incredibly useful in picking apart what&#x27;s actually going on under the hood.  The two biggest challenges I run into are managers (including engineering managers) who insist that unit tests are a waste of time and codebases that retard attempts to break things down to workable units.')
