I poured it into the glass and the normally brown soda came out a transparent golden yellow. Then a dark brown muck slowly poured out of the can. None of it was carbonated and it looked like it hadn’t been mixed at all, and maybe had also gone bad. Anyway, I was really glad I decided to use a glass that day. I threw out the rest of the 12-pack and didn’t drink soda for at least a month.<p>I also once bit into a chicken nugget from a national brand and nearly chipped a tooth on a bone. I’ve eaten a quarter of a sandwich only to discover the far corner of the slice of bread was moldy. I’ve bitten into a nearly raw chicken tender at a restaurant. I’ve had a mouth full of curdled milk. And I’ve eaten from a bowl of cereal and then realized those little red things on my milk weren’t crumbs, they were mites.')
