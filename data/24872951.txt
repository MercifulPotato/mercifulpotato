The issue is just ensuring there are enough listeners and musicians per genre. The site is very new and we are slowly increasing the number genres as we expand. We started out with only 4 genres and are now up to 8. We look to support many more in the future.<p>As for the 20 second time for more casual listening I recommend listen or skip mode where you build up quick skips and can skip to the next song 3 seconds in. For the ranking mode it is very important to artists that the people ranking their music and determining its exposure give it a chance.')
