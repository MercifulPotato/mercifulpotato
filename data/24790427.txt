But I don&#x27;t see how it squares with technology. For certain technologies, the answer will be &quot;the weights in the neural network, when applied to your attributes, yielded a score that fell above a cutoff&quot; or &quot;Your data attributes mapped to a certain location on an eigenvector and it fell above a cutoff defined on that eigenvector&quot;.<p>Is the answer to stop using such algorithms? If not, doesn&#x27;t this webpage need to give us more of a hint as to how we are to overcome the apparent impasse?')
