In my mind they fill different niches:<p>- Rust is a better C++<p>- Go is a better Python<p>YMMV.<p>Some will argue we don&#x27;t need a better Python or Go isn&#x27;t a better Python. These are both entirely reasonable positions. My take is:<p>1. Go is statically typed (even with an interface{} catch-all and no generics; which honestly I personally don&#x27;t really care about but I understand if you do; it&#x27;s certainly no worse than the Python equivalent).<p>2. Python still has the issue of requiring it to be installed as well as the compatibility of that installed environment (ie what virtualenv does). Java has this issue too. Standalone executables are just more convenient;<p>3. Loading your runtime environment has a greater cost in Python;<p>4. I actually don&#x27;t like where Python 3 has gone where almost every point release at this point seems to add to the language itself. Python 3 really was a change in philosophy vs Python 2.')
