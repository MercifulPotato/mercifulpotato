Most anthropologists are extremely skeptical of comparing modern hunter-gatherers with Paleolithic hunter-gatherer cultures, particularly the ones that would develop into agricultural societies.<p>The main reason that farmers outcompete hunter-gatherers is that agriculture allows building larger societies than hunter-gathering can, and this extra population gives a decisive advantage in being able to prosecute wars for as long as is necessary to exterminate hunter-gatherers.')
