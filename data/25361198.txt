But in some contexts, e.g. Alaska under Palin, it&#x27;s viewed as a natural resource, benefiting every resident.<p>Why does company X get to keep all the oil that was just there naturally?  One can say, &#x27;they did the work,&#x27; but others were denied the opportunity to do the work bc it requires loans from the government.<p>In a nation better set up to respond to its committments to its citizens to enable them to pursue equality, opportunity, happiness, etc., internal competition isn&#x27;t as ruthless bc all will benefit from its extraction more equally.  There&#x27;s no fight for the precious resources, so we don&#x27;t have to pretend that certain people suck at their jobs so we can fire them.')
