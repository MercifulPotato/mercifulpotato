Czech robota means corvee. There are different words for corvee in other slavic languages - &quot;barshhina&quot; (in russian), &quot;panshhina&quot; (in ukranian, polish and belarusian, spelled a bit differently in each), and rabota in them means any work, in czech work is called prace.<p>Edit:\nThis is a good example of &quot;false friends of a translator&quot; - words in different languages that sound similar but have different meanings. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;False_friend" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;False_friend</a><p>That said rabota and robota still have a common root which means slave in most slavic languages. So how is it the czech is such an outlier is a curiosity.')
