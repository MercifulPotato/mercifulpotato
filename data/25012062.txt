Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25012622], score=None, time=1604704758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25010100, text='&gt; My perspective is that every process node is so critical that missing the mark on 10nm had far-reaching ramifications.<p>The problem with Intel missing on 10 nm is not so much that 10 nm is critical, but that it is critical to their roadmap. Large CPU design is heavily pipelined (like large CPUs), so you miss on the process node, you&#x27;ve still got a team building the refined next release for the year after, and a third team working on the more refined release for the following year.<p>Then you have decision making; it&#x27;s hard to get a sense for if you need to go back and make a good new design on 14 nm, if 10 nm is going to be ready enough soon (but it&#x27;s been several years now of not ready enough), splitting design resources.')
