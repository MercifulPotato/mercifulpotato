You can download installers from your web browser and use them without any internet connection at all, or any &quot;client&quot; to speak of. And GOG has been getting more and more AAA titlesâ€”Prey, Quantum Break, and Horizon Zero Dawn are all available right now!<p>They also have <i>all</i> of the Batman Arkham games! Can you imagine if Warner Brothers released DRM-Free versions of the Batman <i>movies</i>? That would be practically unprecedented, and yet it&#x27;s relatively common for video games, largely because GoG has been pushing for it.<p>It would really suck if GOG got caught up in the Cyberpunk fiasco.')
