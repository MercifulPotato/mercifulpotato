Hold my beer.<p>In Argentina, pre pandemic there were people that actually went shopping to Miami, because getting anything Apple - be it an iPhone or a laptop - was cheaper that way.<p>The iPhone 12 is not for sale here, but let&#x27;s use the iPhone 11 as an example. In the only &quot;official&quot; store I could find it [0], the price is 184.299 pesos (yes, 184 thousand). If you check the &quot;official&quot; US dolar rate [1] it is around 80 pesos.<p>But hear me out: The country has so little reserves, that officially buying dollars is limited to 200 dollars per person per month. If you buy something using your credit card outside of the country - be it online or in person - this limit does not apply, but in both cases you have &quot;extra&quot; taxes to pay (Buying or spending dollars is called &quot;dolar turista&quot;). the final rate for this is around 137 pesos (again, [1])<p>Let&#x27;s use 140 as the CC rate, for rounding. Considering the same iPhone 11 is around 630 dollars in Amazon, the price in &quot;dolar turista&quot; is 88.060 pesos.<p>that still leave us around one hundred thousand pesos left to the current street price of the phone. considering I can currently get tickets to Los Angeles [2] for around 60K pesos, that more or less gives me ample room for having a short US holiday when getting the phone (Supposing I can get the VISA to enter the country ;) ).<p>BTW the reason for this phone to be so expensive is that there&#x27;s a black market rate for the US dollar (Called the &quot;blue&quot; dollar) and it&#x27;s rate is currently around 180 pesos. Using this rate, plus the normal taxes and stuff when importing things, we get close to the street price.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tienda.personal.com.ar&#x2F;iphone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tienda.personal.com.ar&#x2F;iphone</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambito.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ambito.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promociones-aereas.com.ar&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;los-angeles-flexible-y-con-equipaje-desde-buenos-aires-con-american-airlines-rt-p.html?utm_source=Perfit&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=%2F2020%2F10%2Flos-angeles-flexible-y-con-equipaje-desde-buenos-aires-con-american-airlines-rt-p.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promociones-aereas.com.ar&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;los-angeles-flexib...</a>')
