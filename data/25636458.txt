You seem to think they should be flown to the US to be tried at your convenience to in a language they don&#x27;t speak, in a legal system they don&#x27;t understand at their expense?<p>You could prosecute him in Australia for hacking in whatever form it broke Australian law. How can any non-US citizen be held responsible for some vague &#x27;damage to US national security&#x27; if they have nothing to do with the US?
