The attacker need only register one of them, and if the domain gets frozen they can often just register another -- until the generator algorithm is integrated into the registrars&#x27; blocking system, which takes time and work.<p>Personally I&#x27;m surprised we don&#x27;t see more malware using the various DNS replacements that sit on top of Ethereum.
