If not, is that not a good reason to believe this time will be different?<p>Smart, ambitious people tend to congregate, and capital follows.  If during past exoduses, people moved to random places, I can see why SV remained the primary magnet.  But, this time everyone seems to be moving to Seattle and Austin (based on my anecdotal experience of ~20 SV startups that have moved to Austin in the past 6 months).<p>Other things that make this time different: remote work being generally acceptable &amp; higher state income tax<p>Of course, &quot;every time is different&quot;, but eventually SV will fall.  The question is just when and what the right conditions are.')
