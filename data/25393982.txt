I know lots of people who play guitar hero, lots of people who play real guitars, and some who play both (me for one, mediocrely in both cases). I have met zero people who think guitar hero = guitar. They are different things that serve different needs.<p>I use a cli to compute all day, every day. Can&#x27;t imagine using computers without one. I have no empirical proof of this, but I would be willing to wager the deed to my house that the vast majority of users, having been explained what a cli is, the benefits of it, and how to use it, would chose to never use a CLI again. It&#x27;s not what they want, it&#x27;s what other people want and it&#x27;s a myopic view of what computing is.')
