Parties who would debate the question would do well to respect the problem and others who would offer solutions.<p>I lean more towards honesty and accuracy, and if you can&#x27;t handle the truth then go read something else, but my perspective is probably closer to one of decadence, rather than persecution.  Also, I haven&#x27;t played the game but I thought the article was a good read regardless.')
