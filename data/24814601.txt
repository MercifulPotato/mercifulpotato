That has certainly failed so far, but I wonder if it is at all possible to create a social media platform that drives genuine, deep interaction.<p>I think it would have to be based on curated, pseudo-anonymous conversations with some strong ground rules.<p>Information is cheap. As recently as 20 years ago, the best source of general knowledge was a set of encyclopedias, at home if you could afford it, or at a library if you could not. Wikipedia is far from perfect, but it is generally as good as encyclopedias were, and far more broad. You could tell a similar story about the news, and many other things.<p>What does it mean when information is cheap? I&#x27;m not an expert, but I think it means that propaganda is cheap too. I wish people were better able to recognize propaganda and brain washing.<p>The truth does not battle falsehoods with facts, but with emotions. Hate, anger, fear, and distrust are used to prepare the soil for the seeds of propaganda.<p>It seems like the brain is hardwired to find &#x27;interesting&#x27; things, like counterfactuals. Conspiracy theories are the ultimate counterfactual. I admit that I find conspiracy theories to be interesting as well; but I use them to inform my opinion about motivation, not facts.')
