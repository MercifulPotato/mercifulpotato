Item(by='newbie789', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609540568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605880, text='I don&#x27;t mean to sound pedantic (though I certainly will), but Focalin, Ritalin, etc are formulations of methylphenidate which is absolutely not an amphetamine. It&#x27;s a DARI, not a VMAT2 inhibitor. They work in very different ways and are not chemically related.<p>I only bring this up because if you&#x27;re trying to educate folks on compounds in this sphere, being accurate is a nice thing to do.<p>I wish this project all the best. It&#x27;s absolutely silly that the name of a commonly prescribed compound should be so maligned. What if I named an app &quot;Metformin&quot;? Would that be at risk of uh, encouraging type 2 diabetes?')
