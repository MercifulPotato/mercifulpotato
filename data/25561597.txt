You then need to trick them into looking at their document on your domain, and then from there, need to persuade them somehow to press the send feedback button.<p>I&#x27;d also note that the feedback button is a button that I suspect very very few people ever press. I certainly never have. I also don&#x27;t know the IDs to any documents I might find interesting but can&#x27;t read, and if I find a document via some random google search that I can&#x27;t look at, I generally have no way of knowing how to contact the owner so I can try to send them phishing emails to get them to look at their document on a non-google URL.<p>There&#x27;s been a bunch of cases where google has paid out very substantial bounties, and given the extreme difficulty of both meeting the attack prereqs and then managing to pull off a very sketchy exploit process at the same time I think the sum paid is more than fair.')
