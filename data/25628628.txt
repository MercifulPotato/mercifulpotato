It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;legal&quot; as opposed to illegal. It means &quot;for the purpose of settling things within the legal system&quot;.<p>Anyway, that treasury.gov link is actually a good reference for the original point I was trying to make about the introduction section of the paper: it explains that companies are not obliged to accept legal tender for normal payments.')
