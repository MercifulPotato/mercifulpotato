Facebook software engineering doesn’t have “positions”. You don’t apply for some specific role. They are hiring thousands of engineers every year, they hire for general software engineering skills, and you figure out what exactly you’re working on afterwards.<p>Meanwhile, US immigration law assumes that you are hiring one person at a time, and that each person is being hired for a separate “position”. You cannot say, we need 3000 people in this role this year, we have 1000, so we need 2000 more.<p>It ends up just being incoherent. You have to answer questions like “why are you unable to hire an American” and it’s like... well we <i>are</i>. We’re hiring many many Americans.')
