Just as it doesn&#x27;t make sense comparing the performance of the fanless M1 with a desktop CPU, it doesn&#x27;t make sense comparing the perf-per-watt either; they are just optimized for different parameters. From what I&#x27;ve seen with the more objective benchmarks (not just geekbench), the Ryzens don&#x27;t seem to be doing worse if you account for 7nm vs 5nm.')
