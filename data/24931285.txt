Those who are high risk or older would need to exercise caution to limit exposure of course and universal masks would still be a good idea, but I do feel like things could largely get chugging again. At some point the isolated living just isn&#x27;t viable or worth living anymore.<p>However the risk of financial ruin to any given individual or family from a 3 week  COVID stay in the hospital, even if you survive without complications, is just too great a risk to &quot;go back to normal&quot;. In the US such a stay likely means you end up  unemployed and facing massive surprise bills from out of network &quot;contractor&quot; doctors, coinsurance, etc. It was already bad before, but the economy (the &quot;real&quot; economy) really wouldn&#x27;t survive the obscene amounts of medical bill bankruptcies.')
