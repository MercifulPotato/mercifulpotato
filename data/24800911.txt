Where I work, people have been pretty good about using shared docs--Etherpad for a long time and Google Docs now. But with everyone on video calls, shared docs are now used pretty religiously for most meetings.<p>Also agree about the use of office. I&#x27;m happy to come into an office now and then if it&#x27;s for a particular purpose. I&#x27;ve no interest in coming into one to work individually or <i>maybe</i> run into someone and have a serendipitous conversation. Serendipity is fine but it&#x27;s actually pretty inefficient.')
