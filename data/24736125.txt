YET.   It makes no sense to have it when we&#x27;re still burning fossil fuels.   But without seasonal storage providing power from renewables at high latitudes becomes very expensive in the winter (and countering weeks-long rare correlated production outages becomes very expensive too.)<p>&gt; Anything. Anything is better for seasonal storage.<p>Let&#x27;s go through that list.<p>Methane: you make that from hydrogen and CO2.  Where is the CO2 coming from?   The cost of capturing the CO2 will likely overshadow any savings in cavern space.<p>Flow batteries: obviously not economical.  They might be good for a week or so of storage.  For half a year?  No.<p>Pumped hydro: the water volumes involved are too large (see other response.)<p>Molten salt: this will be stored in tanks above ground, and these will be more expensive per unit energy stored than underground hydrogen caverns.   Getting the heat out of the salt is also problematic.  Heat exchangers (and heat rejection on the other side of steam turbines) are not that cheap.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of the alternatives you have proposed actually are superior to hydrogen.<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t know how to store hydrogen. Still. After decades or research.<p>Yes we do.  In underground caverns.  This is a known technology; it&#x27;s already been done.')
