What this Censorship has done is conveyed to the World that American Government cannot be trusted. That America has 2 power centers not 1. The two power centers being American Government and Big Tech.<p>Any ban or removal should come from the elected Government. In this case it is the US Congress. This is what the World expects as this is how all Democratically elected Governments all over the World function. It is the Government which has a final say.<p>Now when Big Tech unilaterally decides to censor a sitting US President and bans a rival competitor this will cause every World leader and Government to sit up and take note. Everyone will ask themselves: are we now supposed to trust US Government for its word? What if tomorrow a private company decides to censor the US Government? If they can ban the US President&#x27;s account they wield more power than even elected representatives. Why then should we liasion with US Government and why not directly talk to Big Tech as they seem to hold the power over even the US President.<p>Then it goes further than that: how do we trust that the incoming President won&#x27;t be censored? Since all communications happen through a digital form where one of the Big Tech companies is an intermediary in relaying such communications what is the guarantee that the communication is not tampered with? When Big Tech enjoys so much power in US, that it can censor the Government itself, then why can&#x27;t this also be possible? If Big Tech can attach disclaimers to a sitting US President&#x27;s content then why can&#x27;t they tamper with the messaging too?<p>This sort of confusion existed for countries like Pakistan which has dual power centers: the elected Government and the military. You won&#x27;t know whom to talk to as one can override the other. Which is why you have so many successful coups in Pakistan. What Big Tech has done is set a very dangerous precedent. Now no World leader will trust the word of the American Government at face value and will double&#x2F;triple check every communication.')
