Was it to save from splicing into the factory wiring? If so, as an alternate method, on mine I got some of the same connectors used on the factory indicator wiring to add an in-line split off to a relay that triggered my new indicators which were then powered directly off the battery. This made the entire system very simple and reversible.<p>I wanted to do mine animated like my car but I wasn’t sure how well MCUs hold up to the pretty extreme vibrations bike electronics get submitted to. Plus I’m lazy.')
