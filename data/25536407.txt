I was blown away that you could do this, and I went on to study maths and logic at university.  But the most remarkable thing is that I only saw that proof when I was 15 or 16.  In other words I&#x27;d gone through a decade of maths classes at a decent school and no one ever taught me about proofs!  It was all simply memorizing facts and methods up til then.')
