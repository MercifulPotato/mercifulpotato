Item(by='regularfry', descendants=None, kids=[25028020], score=None, time=1604852253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025937, text='&gt; Is it unreasonable undesirable or unnecessary?<p>In the context of self-defense... yes?  It&#x27;s just not a very good return on investment.<p>&gt; I disagree. Guns are tools. Guns are toys.<p>&gt; The overwhelming majority of firearm use is safe and recreational.<p>Right, so that&#x27;s the <i>other</i> half of gun owners, who don&#x27;t say they have a gun for self-protection, which wasn&#x27;t the context of this thread.  That&#x27;s fine, though.<p>&gt; Gun ownership is not correlated with gun violence[1].<p>I mean, it clearly is. You get less gun violence in countries where there are fewer gun owners. That&#x27;s trivially true.  And you&#x27;ll have to forgive my cynicism, but I can&#x27;t take wikipedia seriously as a reference on this topic.  It&#x27;s too well-funded a concern for that page not to be pulled in every direction under the sun.<p>&gt; The problem with guns isn&#x27;t that there are a lot of them. The problem is that they are, in very rare cases, used to do serious harm.<p>The CDC says 39,740 firearm deaths in 2018.  Four or five weeks of COVID, at that rate.  Whether that counts as &quot;very rare&quot; is subjective, I suppose.  That&#x27;s the cheap bit, though: because the US seems to have a congenital inability to prevent people from going bankrupt over medical bills, you&#x27;ve also got to factor in the same again (to a tolerable approximation) in hospitalisations, according to the NIH.<p>At some point you&#x27;ve got to look at that situation and think &quot;Is the fun of making things go <i>pop</i> worth it?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not just the direct harm.  In supporting a culture that normalises making things go pop for fun, you get an extensive infrastructure that also benefits people who end up being a serious problem.  Yes, that includes school shootings which, yes, are rare, but they&#x27;re also fairly unique to the US in scale and regularity. Saying &quot;they&#x27;re rare&quot; doesn&#x27;t absolve anyone of the need to question why that is, or what can be done to make them less lethal.  They make headlines - or used to; they&#x27;re frequent enough now that they&#x27;re less news-worthy, which in itself points to a <i>really</i> deep issue - out of proportion to the number of people directly affected because of the combination of the innocence of youth and the extremity of the violence, but now <i>all the schools</i> need to have active-shooter drills because, as a society, the behaviour of the US shows us that it prefers making things go pop to making kids safe.')
