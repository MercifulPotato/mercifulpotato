You still have the problem of why the Schrodinger equation shows you that that a particle has some amitude both here and there, and can interact with other particles both here and there, yet when you experiment you only find it either here or there, never in both places.<p>MWI just posits that the measurement apparatus exists in a single world, while the particles exist in many worlds. But it can&#x27;t explain this basic fact, like any other interpretation. What we need is an actual new theory that can actually measure what a measurement is (at what precise point the Born rule must be applied, or how can we do without the Born rule).')
