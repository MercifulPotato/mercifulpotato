You police actions, not speech. Someone talks about building bombs? Fine. Talk never blew anything up. Someone builds bombs? Time to arrest them. It&#x27;s not very complicated.<p>People are responsible for their own actions. &quot;But he incited me to violence!&quot; is not an excuse for violence. Maybe in the case of a superior giving a subordinate a direct order (in which case both are responsible), but &quot;the man on Twitter told me to do it&quot; should hold about as much sway as Son of Sam&#x27;s &quot;the neighbor&#x27;s dog told me to do it&quot;.')
