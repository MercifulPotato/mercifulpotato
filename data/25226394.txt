I knew I was on shaky ground with the translation. I know nothing about beer and my German is rusty and I didn&#x27;t do a lot of digging before posting.<p>My main point stands: It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;fucking hell&quot; <i>in German.</i><p>Kind of like that song &quot;What does the fox say?&quot; The two brothers didn&#x27;t expect it to be so successful. In fact, they intended it to be a joke on some TV show they were doing or something like that. They were planning ahead of time to be all &quot;We got our big break and this is the garbage we produced!&quot;<p>I talked to an American who was sure that it was intended to be a play on words. She heard it as &quot;What the fucks?&quot; and she figured that&#x27;s why it was so popular.<p>That may well be part of why it took off -- because it&#x27;s something for English speakers to snicker about -- but I kind of doubt it was originally planned that way. People who speak English as a second language -- <i>or anything as a second language</i> -- routinely say &quot;bad&quot; things without intending it or even realizing it.<p>So someone may be doing it (&quot;it&quot; being naming the beer something naughty to the English speaking ear) on purpose because it&#x27;s funny to people who speak English. But this isn&#x27;t a case of &quot;laughing with you.&quot; It&#x27;s very much a case of &quot;laughing <i>at</i> you&quot; and the people being laughed at aren&#x27;t enjoying it and they decided to put a stop to it wrt their town name.<p>And I feel like I&#x27;m getting a lot of hostility for being on the side of the villagers who feel mistreated and don&#x27;t want to put up with it anymore. And it&#x27;s an icky thing to be feeling right now and to be observing how this went down overall.')
