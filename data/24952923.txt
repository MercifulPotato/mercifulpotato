Like social networks such as facebook, gold, etc, it has network value and these tend to be hard to break when at scale (there are many forks and all are worth nothing).  Bitcoin is now (aside from ETF&#x27;s and 401k&#x27;s) the single most held liquid tradable asset on earth.  More people own it than stock in Apple (not in ETF or 401k form).<p>You think the gold MC is based on utility?  There is not a 9 trillion electronic plating and jewelry market.  Jewelry is also by extension speculation on the metal.  95% of golds market cap is through the same value social network that gives bitcoin value.  Except I&#x27;ve owned physical gold and its a pain in the ass for so many reasons. Bitcoin is a better store of wealth.
