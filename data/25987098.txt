The military is not within civil control, legally. Civilian government has no power to order the military to do anything.<p>She had two choices: 1) Say publicly that military are bad people, and erode what little power military affords NLD and fragile relationship between civilian government and military. Or 2) Have the press hate her for not saying words, and maintain the fragile understanding and peacemaking process with military.<p>She chose the least bad option, in support of civilian rule, democracy, and peace building.
