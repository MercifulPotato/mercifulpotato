That would be a real challenge, therefore it is probably better to build the IP camera from ground up with security and trust in mind. The PineCube from Pine64 seems a really good step in this direction. Just like their PinePhone, being so hard to liberate an existing phone, it&#x27;s actually easier to design and produce from scratch one that is really free and open and therefore trustworthy.<p>Some interesting options also from Friendlyarm to make small Linux driven embedded boards with cameras.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.friendlyarm.com&#x2F;index.php?route=product&#x2F;product&amp;path=70&amp;product_id=245" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.friendlyarm.com&#x2F;index.php?route=product&#x2F;product&amp;...</a>')
