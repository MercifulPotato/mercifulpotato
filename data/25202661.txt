Some of that is just the sheer volume of code, but also, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if it&#x27;s hitting bottlenecks in the compiler (e.g. a recently fixed issue in the performance of #[derive(...)] on a huge number of structs). Getting appropriate bits of Rusoto put into the compiler&#x27;s performance testsuite could help, and profiling the compiler on it would likely turn up some areas for improvement.<p>I would also love to see support for using Rusoto on non-Tokio runtimes. Given the amount of code generation used for Rusoto, abstracting over the remainder (such as the choice of async traits) based on a feature flag would hopefully be feasible.')
