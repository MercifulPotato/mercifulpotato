As a UK cycle commuter who travels a lot to Netherlands, the big thing they did there is to make it normal and easy for everyone to cycle.  Not just fit macho well equipped enthusiasts but children, elderly, timid, and badly equipped.  Once the bike lane is fully separated and well lit and full of other cyclists you don&#x27;t need high vis gear and excellent situational awareness to avoid being killed and that makes cycling universally accessible and slashes the number of cars required')
