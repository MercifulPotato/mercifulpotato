A semester-long parking pass (4 months) was around $900, daily parking was $12. A ticket was $25 if paid in the first 7 days. They checked cars and ticketed twice a week, on random days, but always twice a week (I assume this was a contract stipulation). I parked there four days a week, I&#x27;d usually get one ticket a week, sometimes two... still cheaper than paying daily or for the pass. They&#x27;d only tow if you had overdue tickets, so as long as I paid them immediately it was all good.<p>Sometimes it pays to do the math.')
