I disagree however that the &quot;standard&quot; definition presumes zero-trust. In my opinion the only thing that is presumed is some form of consensus mechanism, which can also be a trusted one like PoA (proof of authority).<p>&gt; git repo where you have some set of trusted notaries and at least M of N notaries<p>There isn&#x27;t really much difference between a PoA blockchain and what you describe on a data structure level. The main differences here will be the mode of operation (active node vs. passive repository) and builtin support and optimizations for currency transactions.<p>If you were really inclined, you could probably implement a optimized git client&#x2F;server that could achieve that (and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone has done that already). What&#x27;s the point in doing so tough, if you could just as well use an existing implementation of a PoA blockchain?')
