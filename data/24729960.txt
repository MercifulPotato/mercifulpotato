In fact, I assumed that there must be some kind of client-side secret wrapping with a customer-managed key or similar (i.e. you end up managing one secret, rather than <i>n</i>). I still need to secure access to the Doppler API key in any case.<p>Then I looked at the API documentation and it seems, no, you&#x27;re being encouraged to send your secrets verbatim over the Internet.<p>I understand how this invites comparisons with the CSP secrets management products (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager), but it seems strictly worse from a number of perspectives:<p>* blast radius: if I&#x27;m a multi-cloud, or hybrid-cloud, property then compromise of one environment doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to compromise of the others; if I have all my eggs in one basket, like Doppler, then it seems like it does.<p>* Internet traversal: if I&#x27;m using something like AWS Secrets Manager from within AWS, I can entirely avoid having to traverse the Internet for my secrets by using VPC endpoints. Having to cross the Internet just means I&#x27;m exposed to more bad actors, an increased variety of attacks and also operational risk factors unrelated to security.<p>* (probable&#x2F;possible?) segregation of duties concerns: the design of products like AWS Secrets Manager means that some kind of active collusion across product teams within AWS is required to create inappropriate disclosures and to conceal that disclosure. If secrets management is the only product line, that seems less likely to be sustainable.')
