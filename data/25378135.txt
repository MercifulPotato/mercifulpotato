I&#x27;ve bought 2 games on Stadia so far, and the solace for me is I don&#x27;t ever really re-play games I&#x27;ve finished like I relisten to albums.  Same with books, tv, movies, etc.  It&#x27;s just not my style, so the potential for Stadia to go poof in a year or two is fine by me, assuming it was a good value while it was still going.')
