Presumably they&#x27;re for somebody. Netflix gets no jollies out of producing a bunch of content that nobody wants.<p>There are a lot of people out there, and Netflix is like a catalog of the different kinds of things they can want. It&#x27;s hard producing content that hits me personally where I live, and I&#x27;m always grateful when they do. It happens a few times a year.<p>I&#x27;m glad other people are also getting their stuff. Clearly a lot of people are finding enough to make them happy. I&#x27;m sure Netflix would love to produce more shows that manage to hit a wide range of people. I think that they did bottle such lightning again with Queen&#x27;s Gambit.')
