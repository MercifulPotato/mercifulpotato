One of the challenges that teams at Google have is service dependencies. In theory, Google is one big, happy family and everyone is responsible for everyone&#x27;s code. In practice, teams have focuses, software interdepends and interoperates, and mistakes get made at the margin where the linkages between two software systems are neither team&#x27;s direct responsibility---or the responsibility of both teams.<p>It&#x27;s not malice, it&#x27;s incentives and information flow. Integrating with a service that one is not responsible for, one can get tripped by unknown unknowns that the team that maintains the service has failed the document. And while a migration mistake is embarrassing, software engineering teams are generally rewarded for task completion, not for the time spent preparing for a failure that doesn&#x27;t occur.')
