They wanted to program computers all their lives. They were born for it. After spending six, eight, ten years in the industry, they quit for good. [...] Something had to have gone wrong for them to abandon their first love.</i><p><i>&gt;But sitting at a mandated retrospective or mindlessly gluing APIs together doesn&#x27;t put me over the moon. It makes me feel the opposite (whatever the opposite of being over the moon is).</i><p>I like Slava Akhmechet essays but this theme of disillusionment doesn&#x27;t resonate with me.<p>As background, a relevant wikpedia article when thinking of personal change:  End-of-history illusion[1]<p>I used to think I became disillusioned because the industry was &quot;getting worse&quot;.  But I changed my mind because it&#x27;s just too convenient that my peak of creative excitement and wonder about technology just <i>happened to coincide</i> with the <i>&quot;good old days&quot;</i>.<p>My opinion changed when the new iPhone came out in 2007 and I noticed I was <i>not excited</i> about it.  How can that be?  How can I spend all-nighters messing around with less powerful 8-bit and 16-bit toy computers and not also be obsessed with the idea of playing with the new Apple gadget that&#x27;s 1000x more powerful?!?<p>I had to dissect this strange contradiction.  I finally had to admit that <i>it&#x27;s because I simply got older</i>.  As another extreme example, as a little boy I used to be <i>excited about hopping on escalators and elevators</i> because they were like fun little amusement rides.  But now, they&#x27;re everyday boring.  Escalators didn&#x27;t change; I changed.<p>I remember being a teen at a loud rock concert and thinking about no old people being there and being confused as <i>&quot;how can anybody ever stop going to concerts?&quot;</i>  Well, it turns out I stopped too.  I won&#x27;t blame disillusionment.  Instead, I just got bored of it.  I still like live music but not enough to go out of my way to buy expensive tickets and deal with the traffic jam to get back home.<p>I used read lots of fiction.  I don&#x27;t anymore.  Fiction author Philip Roth also stopped reading[2] others&#x27; fiction when he got older.  I&#x27;m sure today&#x27;s fiction is just fine.  But my motivation to read it isn&#x27;t there anymore.  I won&#x27;t blame the book industry and I&#x27;m not disillusioned about fiction.  I&#x27;m just a different person now.<p>Is it disillusionment or just getting older?  There are confounding variables.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;End-of-history_illusion#:~:text=The%20end%2Dof%2Dhistory%20illusion,or%20mature%20in%20the%20future" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;End-of-history_illusion#:~:tex...</a>.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;philip-roth-ive-stopped-reading-fiction&#x2F;352196&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2011&#x2F;06&#x2F;philip-r...</a>')
