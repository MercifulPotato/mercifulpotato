The Windows 10 template was great for running STATA etc, and the way Qubes handles copy paste and file transfer were pretty great.<p>What I didnt like was having to restart qubes when updating software, and general complexity. I will go back to Qubes or something like it when I go back to school, though, as it <i>is</i> simpler to manage than multiboot or multiple computers.')
