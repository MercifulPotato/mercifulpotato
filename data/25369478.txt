YouTube&#x27;s censorship restrictions have nothing to do with a formal concession, merely claims of fraud impacting the election.  And identical claims of election tampering resulting in a &quot;fraudulent electioin&quot; have been ongoing by Democrats on MSNBC, Twitter, Facebook, CNN etc. for 4 years.<p>So we&#x27;re now in a boat where Google&#x2F;YouTube is essentially arguing they&#x27;re qualified to make judgements on defending election integrity in the U.S.<p>It has nothing to do with policy consistency, and everything to do with who the people are who work there.')
