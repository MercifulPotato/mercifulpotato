Take the big topic apart into a finite number of blocks and work through them: introduce concept, explain concept, impact concept, tie to next paragraph. In the end I was able to follow through multiple topics I knew noting about and get a high level understanding.<p>What I find from media science reporters is often missing background or context (or just flat out wrong) with oodles of impact (supposedly). From scientific journal articles I often lack the required background to even follow the abstract and almost certainly not the jargon filled paper (whether they are written that way on purpose I have my own opinions about).<p>I know you can&#x27;t spend time explaining every building block concept, but the selection of what gets background and the succicintess of the explanations here is really nice for me.')
