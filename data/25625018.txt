That&#x27;s a separate repository and software project, often on-premises deployment which we have to maintain. And that&#x27;s for the &quot;application&quot; proper with user management, and business logic. I&#x27;m not even talking about what most people do &quot;Flask app that loads model weights, exposes a form, and returns predictions to show the client, let me set a VM on GCP and send a link to the client&quot;, but the client is busy, and you forget about it, so you shut down the VM, the client clicks on the link, nothing there, and you&#x27;re left to remember which of the VMs and which of the models was there.<p>This toil is one of the reasons we&#x27;re building <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a>, because we&#x27;ve done it so many times for clients, that certain patterns and inefficiencies have emerged and we&#x27;re addressing them in our platform to really focus on high value things.<p>For example, we have AppBooks[1] where a machine learning practitioner clicks a button and publishes an <i>automatically</i> parametrized notebook, without tagging cells or using metadata, or cluttering the notebook with code that does that. It generates a form and the client or domain expert can then change parameters and run the notebook without mutating it.<p>One other benefit is that this automatically tracks the run: the parameters, metrics, and the model generated is saved, and you can then deploy that model in one click or build a Docker image. These are not much, but solve the problem of &quot;I want to show results and get feedback, how do I do that? VM on GCP and Flask app? Export to PDF?&quot;<p>&gt;<i>Finally, Models are easy to build on Jupyter Notebooks. We all know it just takes a few lines of code and your `model.fit()` is ready. But whatâ€™s next?</i><p>Well, it depends. Long-running notebooks have been problematic as people would be watching training, and then there would be a disconnection or they&#x27;d close the browser tab and lose data. Some would add code to save the model&#x2F;pickle it, but that&#x27;s clutter. We&#x27;ve added long-running notebook scheduling[2] right from the notebook&#x27;s interface, so closing a tab or shutting down your computer doesn&#x27;t impact anything. You can view the output <i>outside</i> of JupyterLab in a simple page, even on your phone.<p>That&#x27;s very useful because it sometimes happens where we want to run a <i>bunch</i> of experiments. We just schedule them all in a fire and forget way.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;appbook&#x2F;</a><p>- [2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai&#x2F;docs&#x2F;notebook&#x2F;#long-running-notebooks</a>')
