It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re comparing a bike to an e-bike, and someone says &quot;yeah, but can the e-bike run faster than a rocket?&quot;<p>Second argument &quot;Sure, it&#x27;s faster than a machine that costs 3-4 fives more, but you should instead compare it to a machine that costs even more than that&quot;.<p>I can only take it as a troll comment.')
