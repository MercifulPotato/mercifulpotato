Was it just media manipulation or did it go further to also include voter fraud and hacking of election systems?<p>- How much did that interference contribute to Trump&#x27;s win in 2016?<p>- If the prevailing notion for the last 4 years was that nothing was done to fortify election integrity, shouldn&#x27;t we have expected to see similar or greater interference from Russia in 2020?<p>- If there was Russian voter interference in 2016, and nothing was done to fix that in the last 4 years, how much trust should be put in CISA&#x27;s statement of no evidence of manipulation?<p>- Is this just a perfect example of the uncertainty about our democracy that Russia intended to instill all along?')
