For my main codebase, that is in excess of 1200. That is, on a system with 1200 cores, I could use all 1200 cores productively, at full capacity (ignoring disk i&#x2F;o waits) [1]<p>My impression is that few games (if any) can ever approach this level of potential parallelism. There are not many tasks in computing with this level of &quot;embarrassing parallelism&quot;.<p>[1] somebody actually did this with Ardour once, on a system with 1024 cores. The current normal-system compile time record for the software is a little under 5min (Ryzen Threadripper 2950X + 64GB of RAM). The k-core system completed the build in less than 10 seconds :)')
