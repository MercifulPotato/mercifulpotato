I only noticed this as a possiblity once you pointed out the random bolding. Some of the article items that seem suspect:<p>- fully random bolding<p>- long, rambling, not entirely coherent (understandable given the subject matter, of course. however, the author also has a PHD?)<p>- inconsistent naming, e.g. iBuddy<p>- broad conclusion that doesn&#x27;t fully match the content<p>- a nondescript screenshot which doesn&#x27;t implicate anybody<p>- separated into 5 segments (&quot;parts&quot;), although the segments aren&#x27;t narratively meaningful<p>- a huge list of accusations (of varying degrees of believably) interwoven as though they were more related textually rather than contextually<p>I hope it&#x27;s not GPT-3, and that if this is true the victim gets their due justice, but it&#x27;s worth consideration.')
