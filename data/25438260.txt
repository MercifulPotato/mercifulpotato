Here in India I had once finalized an apartment for rent for around Rs. 35000&#x2F;month. The landlord bailed at the last moment because an agent found him another tenant willing to pay Rs. 2000 more&#x2F;month. However:<p>1. I had approached the landlord directly since his previous tenant had been a friend of mine. So there was no agent fee (one month rent) to be paid.<p>2. The other tenant moved in almost a month after i was supposed to, so another month&#x27;s worth of rent lost for him.<p>The landlord didn&#x27;t realize it would take him almost 3 years to recoup the losses even with the increased rent. I didn&#x27;t push my case much, and found someplace else to stay.')
