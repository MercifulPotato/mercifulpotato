You can add several remotes from different servers (or peers in case of single user instances hosted at home)<p>Even though other sites like GitLab exist that GitHub remains a near-monopoly default doesn&#x27;t bode well for attempting to migrate to a completely decentralized system as default. There are decentralized extensions of git (like git-ssb).<p>Addenda: Git is also not well suited for a lot of decentralization due to how branches are modeled. Patch-theory based systems like darcs and pijul would need more adoption before code repositories could be decentralized.')
