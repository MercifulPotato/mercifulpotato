It&#x27;s that they should have also been just as skeptical and censorious of other allegations without any evidence, such as Russiagate.  Dozens of people were accused of colluding with a foreign power, which is crazy, and not just Republicans - Bernie Sanders was accused as well.  And the impeachment report by Mueller did not reveal a single piece of direct evidence of any collusion.  Even the people convicted during the trial were not convicted of collusion but of other crimes.  The problem is that you can&#x27;t pick and choose what you will censor or control based on political preference.  The crazy right wing extremists might be ignorant and on the wrong path but they sense unfairness just like anyone else.')
