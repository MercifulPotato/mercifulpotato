My native language makes use of a lot of compound words and Google&#x27;s spell checker often gets confused when I combine words according to the standard grammar.<p>I can see and understand the technical limitations, but tools like Microsoft Word seem to do a much better job than Google&#x27;s spell checker, even in things like Google Docs.<p>Google search will often suggest splitting up words and sometimes even does it transparently, which can give entirely wrong results because suddenly Google matches words across a sentence instead of specific compound words. It&#x27;s kind of frustrating to have to resort to quotation marks for some single-word search terms.<p>I get the feeling Google&#x27;s spell checker doesn&#x27;t check spelling, it just tweaks the input until it manages to find more results. Not quite the same, because a lot of &quot;fixes&quot; often have entirely different meanings in my experience.')
