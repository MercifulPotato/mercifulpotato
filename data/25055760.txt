No, we are not naive as to the presence of security related bugs elsewhere (e.g. Heartbleed). Just a lot of reputation was lost.<p>It was interesting because the cause was a patch crafted to satisfy a static analysis tool they insisted on applying to every package, which demonstrated their want to go above and beyond with respect to quality. Kudos to Debian in that regard. But a blindly applied policy, and bad judgement in disabling some cryptographic initialization code, caused a terrible bug.<p>I wonder if this is less of an issue today because of well defined kernel interfaces for getting &quot;good&quot; random numbers (i.e. cryptographically suitable). I&#x27;m sure the devil is in the details, and OpenSSH&#x27;s support for unpopular systems means intentional use of uninitialized variables is still in the code base. It&#x27;s all very impressive to an outsider who knows enough not to tell cryptographers how to do their job.')
