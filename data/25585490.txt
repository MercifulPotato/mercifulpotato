So you&#x27;re not completely safe using EmuNAND, unless you refrain from ever going online.<p>Common practice is to do homebrew activity on EmuNAND without going online there, and keeping a clean SysNAND for online activities. You can also wipe uniquely identifying keys on EmuNAND and essentially ban yourself there, then you won&#x27;t be able to use any Nintendo services (incl. updates &amp; online play) in EmuNAND but you can go online for homebrew stuff -relatively- safe.<p>So what you can&#x27;t have is both homebrew and online services in the same NAND. Not to mention no matter how hard the community tries, each new update has the potential for Nintendo to introduce more &quot;telemetry&quot; to identify CFW devices before community gets wiser.<p>Either way, there are no certainties when it comes to ban evasion.')
