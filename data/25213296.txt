The <i>more likely</i> explanation is that HN is host to a lot of people who are completely incapable of empathy and are unable to protect themselves from disinformation in areas outside of their own expertise.<p>This doesn&#x27;t say much for HN or the tech sector in general.<p>.\n.<p>A contagious biological virus is not conceptually different from the Morris Worm. If there was a neo-Morris Worm loose on the Internet, those of us on the sysadmin-side of the IT house would take all reasonable measures to protect our systems from it. Indeed, failing to do so would be negligent.<p>Failing to take protective measures (social distancing, masks, WFH) against SARS-CoV-2 is no different from putting unpatched systems directly on the internet while a worm is active. It&#x27;s so clearly negligent that no one whatsoever should advocate for it.')
