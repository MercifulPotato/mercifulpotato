The article shows Tesla firmly in the lead in capability&#x2F;performance and ease of use and that Cadillac just nannies the driver more and turns itself off completely when not on pre-mapped divided highways with restricted access, which is antithetical to making the world safer because it&#x27;s only active away from where people currently die by the thousands due to human negligence.<p>CR&#x27;s idea of goodness is that autopiloting should only ever be allowed on pre-mapped divided highways with restricted access. Since Cadillac&#x27;s only works on pre-mapped divided highways with restricted access, they get high marks. But that&#x27;s not better performance. That&#x27;s worse performance with a geofence to hide the details.<p>&gt; <i>“Active driving assistance systems should only be able to be activated in low-risk driving environments, void of pedestrians and tricky situations, such as intersections and complicated traffic patterns,” Funkhouser says.</i><p>But this ignores the fact that most traffic fatalities happen from human negligence in the places where Cadillac&#x27;s Supercruise explicitly disables itself, rural roads + intersections. If Cadillac&#x27;s system only ever activated while parked in your garage they could give it a 10&#x2F;10 for safety, and it would not make the world safer.')
