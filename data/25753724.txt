I’m talking about things like includes, using a compiler, &lt;&lt; and other facets of basic I&#x2F;O, defining a main function.<p>Python allows students to hit the ground running much faster. Once they learn the very basics, then it can make sense to introduce something like C, but not require them to temporarily ignore magic incantations with the promise they’ll understand them later.')
