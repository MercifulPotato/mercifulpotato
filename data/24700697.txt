It is really, really easy to embed. Like, takes 10 minutes to get going level of simple. So having to do nothing other than include one header and link one object file (or add to the build) is nice. I don&#x27;t really have a strong opinion one way or the other on the all-in-one-file issue, but as someone who uses it in an embedded context all the time, I&#x27;d have to say the fact that it&#x27;s all in one makes zero negative difference to my work. And it&#x27;s really nice to be able to just leave s7.h open and grep over it to figure out how to do just about anything. This simplicity can not be said about Chicken, Racket, or Gambit, mind you. (Guile though, also has a low barrier, I really like Guile too...)')
