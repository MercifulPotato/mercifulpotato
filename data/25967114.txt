This argument doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.<p>This is how covid has been eradicated in NZ and Australia. Locking down part of the population doesn’t work - isolating the vulnerable from those that are less likely to die isn’t possible.<p>&gt; People have to be allowed to make their own choices, their own risk analysis, and live with the consequences.<p>And where has this worked? A portion of people refuse to listen to advice, refuse to wear masks and refuse to isolate. People go out while sick, they congregate in groups. Why should the vulnerable have to be exposed to this? If everyone follows the rules, you get back to normal faster.<p>An approach based on evidence is the way to get results.')
