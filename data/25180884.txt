One of the best biographies I have ever read, such a loving read.<p>Reading this article reminded me how Paul Allen described the early days of coding with Bill when there were just two of them.. \nThey would spend the entire day coding, then at evening eat pizza and then watch whatever was on in theaters that day...<p>Reading that story and seeing how Paul Allen fondly looked back on it made me truly respect them.<p>The days are long, but the years are short!')
