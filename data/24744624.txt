Webpack just offers more bells and whistles, which in our case we need to wrestle legacy projects into modern build pipelines. For a new project, maybe you don’t need all that, and you also don’t need Webpack with 3000 config lines. And fwiw, with every major, Webpack has moved to more sensible defaults for modern web bundling, meaning if you stick with it for a new project, likely you only need 5 config lines')
