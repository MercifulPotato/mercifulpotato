And I realized that to a lot of people there is no discernible difference between doing software development and doing tech support. It’s all just working with computers right? And they know that I like to work with computers.<p>But where I actually derive joy from computers is in creating things. Writing code, optimizing my algorithms and data structures, improving the speed and robustness of software that I write, making software that is as ergonomic and sensible as I can. Both when it’s APIs that other developers will use or I myself will use and when it is user interface stuff that end users will use. Those kinds of things are what gives me satisfaction.<p>To sit on a phone line and guide someone through a thousand steps of troubleshooting and finally in 90% of cases having them reboot a machine, that’s just.. not even close to being enjoyable.<p>I always like to help people, and if someone asks me, whether they be friends or family or others I will help them. But when I do that, I do it for a different reason. I do it because it is easy and I know it helps them. Not because I enjoy doing that in its own.<p>And I don’t mean to talk down at people doing tech support or anything. Nor do I want to seem arrogant. What I am getting at is just that it’s not the same. Not at all the same.<p>I didn’t want to get into all of that then and there of course, so I just carefully said that tech support wouldn’t really be for me because what I like most is to create stuff.<p>But yeah.')
