Item(by='dash2', descendants=None, kids=[25903246], score=None, time=1611574610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25897057, text='Hmm, well, I&#x27;m a social scientist so perhaps I&#x27;m a bit elitist about what counts as seriously understanding the world.<p>It&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s no insight in what the guy says. Some of it is quite accurate. I think I would say that (nearly all) the insight was delivered by The Office in the first place. I never saw the US variant, but I LOVE the UK version. We like shows like that because they do speak to us - we do recognize the appalling awfulness of middle managers, or how decent people get stuck in dead ends.<p>The problem is the attempt to systematize and generalize and make some deep &quot;theory&quot; out of all this. It just isn&#x27;t worthwhile. There&#x27;s no sensible theory where everyone at the top is a sociopath, and everyone at the bottom is a realist, and every middle manager is an idiot. I mean, come on. And this &quot;theory&quot; isn&#x27;t meant to be tested, and never will be... at best, it&#x27;ll be written down in some kind of fun, pseudoscientific book like Bullshit Jobs.<p>To sum up, this guy mistakes ∃ for ∀.')
