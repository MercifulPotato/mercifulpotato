Decided to get it installed after buying a new desktop. Overall it&#x27;s good (and I&#x27;ve used it before), I have very simple setup and I don&#x27;t really need much. Just dev tools.<p>The issue I&#x27;m having is (I think) hardware related. I&#x27;m a bit afraid to update systemd since by doing it several times before I got a kernel crash during install which left the system in an odd place. requiring me to boot up from usb to correct the installation. I can deal with it, but this is not something I particularly enjoy. I currently have almost 2GB of pending updates because of this, which I think defeats the purpose of rolling release distro.<p>I was actually thinking about trying out some other distros, maybe debian. With hopes that it will fix the kernel crashes. Another thought that I had, was to switch to FreeBSD, the only thing currently preventing me is the lack of Docker.')
