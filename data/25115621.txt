However, many people enjoy this lifestyle. Reinventing something as basic as fishing into an “experience” for tourists, most of who are likely city dwellers who would never get to experience this, seems like a win win to me, and honestly something we could get other industries involved in. You mention the timber industry... if there were places that would allow me to cut down trees with a chainsaw, I would actually be interested in that!<p>As more of human society urbanizes, we’re going to see a lot more demand for these “experiences”.')
