Breitbart et. al. are grifters.  The disinformation economy is real and vibrant, and they&#x27;re just catching some of the extra cash.  For every Breitbart or Newsmax link shared, there are seven or whatever to a blog or PAC or campaign that is not monetized.<p>At this point I think the game is lost.  I mean... we just had an election which came out (absent higher turnout) more or less exactly like the last one, to within a percent or two.  And half the country genuinely believes it was stolen by fraud to the tune of hundreds of thousands of ballots across at least four states.<p>How do you come back from that?  I don&#x27;t think we do.  I just don&#x27;t know what the endpoint is going to be yet.  But disinformation is no longer just competing with real facts, it&#x27;s won the war.')
