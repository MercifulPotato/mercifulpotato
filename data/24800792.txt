That means we both disagree with what was (at least circa 2003), a fairly standard economist&#x27;s perspective.<p>In a nutshell, Keynes made assumptions about economic growth (correct). He then riffed on assumptions for income effects (if I pay you more, will you work more?) and substitution effects (if you have more money, will you work less?). Those are not very hard to populate. Ask poor people, observe higher income people&#x27;s behaviours.<p>The standard retort my professor gave (people decided to keep working lots and buy more stuff instead of chillin)is, IMO, the favoured explanation because it&#x27;s parsimonious with theory. It fails when it meets reality, in the form of people. Ask a median person why they don&#x27;t chill more and work less and you&#x27;ll get strange looks.<p>If interested, I think concepts in the &quot;cost of thriving index^&quot; are probably key to understanding why economists are (I agree) mostly wrong on this.<p>In any case, I think the keynes prediction, is an invaluable starting point... being from the past. A modern economist might defend the theory, with the &quot;chill more&quot; defense. I doubt they would bring it up though. No one is going to make a false prediction about the past to test a theory they support.<p>^ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media4.manhattan-institute.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;the-cost-of-thriving-index-OC.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media4.manhattan-institute.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;t...</a>')
