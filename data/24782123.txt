This gives the authors time and space to develop the characters, and reach a satisfying conclusion. But these often suffer from pacing issues, because mid-season episodes become filler.<p>- ones with episodic stories <i>and</i> with a season-long arc (a problem or a villain that keeps popping up). This helps with pacing, but still lets authors build up momentum and develop characters and stories. These often suffer from underdeveloped arcs though and unresolved season cliffhangers hinting at &quot;that arc we developed, it&#x27;s so much bigger than you thought&quot;.')
