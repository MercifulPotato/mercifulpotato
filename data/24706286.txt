It&#x27;s rude (to a point) to point out how much raw luck may have had in one&#x27;s achievements, but why is privilege (which is arguably very similar in many ways) fair game?<p>The focus should be on all of the effort that the kid put forth which many other equally privileged or lucky kids would have squandered.')
