Most of the authors on the paper come from neurosurgery&#x2F;neurology, and I don&#x27;t doubt for one second that they have a strong grasp of &quot;I can mess with the human brain in these ways and I&#x27;ll get these behaviors&quot;. They shouldn&#x27;t be expected to know everything we&#x27;ve ever looked at for time in the brain.<p>I am frustrated at one of the ways science journalism tends to report on neuroscience. I think they want to do it like they do physics, and it affects how people outside the field think. Rather than considering the brain as a complex system, we&#x27;re looking for the Jennifer Anniston neuron, or time cells, or some single component that explains consciousness, much like we looked for the &quot;god particle&quot; (Higgs) or gravitational waves. It&#x27;s not a great way to look at things.<p>My original comment on fragmentation is just my own opinion. Maybe it&#x27;s not as much of a barrier as I think it is.')
