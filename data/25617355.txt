Ruby gems works very nicely by not requiring version numbers but always respecting the lockfile unless you explicitly update one or more packages, so when you add a package with no version you get the latest by default, and you can easily do incremental upgrades that respect version dependencies.  Later if you need to lock to a specific version you add it (ideally with a comment about why it&#x27;s locked to that version) and still utilize the automatic dependency version resolution for updates.')
