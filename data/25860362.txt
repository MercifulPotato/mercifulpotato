Right now most states are focusing on high risk people first. So medical staff, essential workers (I think) and those 65 and over.<p>My parents fall into the 65 and older category and can&#x27;t find a vaccine anywhere local.<p>It&#x27;ll be months I suspect before these groups of people get their shots. Then they move into another group and it&#x27;ll repeat. I don&#x27;t anticipate getting my shot until summer at the earliest.<p>The reason I say it&#x27;s a mess in the US is each state is sort of doing their own thing. And some areas are getting very little vaccine.')
