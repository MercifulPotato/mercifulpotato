I assume what berkay is talking about is this wording of &quot;&lt;existing license&gt; with Commons Clause&quot; - e.g. the Apache foundation has explicitly requested that this not be done (which the creators of the Commons Clause conveniently ignore), because it changes what the license means a lot and sounds like it&#x27;s an official variant of the license. Apache only wants if any &quot;Apache 2.0 with addons&quot; licenses if they give more rights to the recipient, not less.')
