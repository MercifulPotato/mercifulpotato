Millions of lines, an insane number of contributors, development period of decades with a very decentralised management structure.<p>Emacs has a lot of problems but once you learn the base language, it&#x27;s quite easy to interface with. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s because of the limitations on structural complexity - you don&#x27;t need to wrap your head around non-locally-defined structure in order to understand any one line. The parts that attempt to emulate OO tend to be a lot harder to deal with as an outsider.')
