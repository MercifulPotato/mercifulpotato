The decision merely requires the copyright holder to <i>consider</i> fair use. It doesn&#x27;t require them to accept that the alleged violation <i>is</i> fair use or even to do a detailed analysis:<p><i>In order to comply with the strictures of ยง 512(c)(3)(A)(v), a copyright holder&#x27;s consideration of fair use need not be searching or intensive.
