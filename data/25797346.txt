Item(by='SilasX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610749524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796742, text='&gt;No, asset inflation absolutely does not mean that. Increasing the minimum buy in for asset investments would do that, but we’ve got mature enough financial markets that a general increase in asset prices doesn’t increase the minimum needed to enter productive investments.<p>Yes, &quot;can&#x27;t&quot;, taken literally (and uncharitably), is incorrect. I was exaggerating.  The point is it becomes much more difficult with lower yields, just as it becomes so with cows. To produce the same X units of milk tomorrow, you have to save more milk now (to buy the cow) -- the same effect as if you had less to save due to your consumption goods being more expensive.<p>So, no, &quot;mature financial markets&quot; don&#x27;t really solve this.<p>&gt;No, it doesn’t; driving money into productive investments and out of cash (which, as an expected side effect, produces asset price inflation) is part of the mechanism by which loose monetary policy is expected to stimulate economic activity. Asset price inflation does not indicate that that is not working, it is what you expect if it is working.<p>Money going into productive investments is only good <i>if it also translates into productive economic activity</i>. You can&#x27;t just say, &quot;we gave it the old college try, so that&#x27;s a win&quot;. We&#x27;re seeing P&#x2F;E ratios go up (earnings yields down), which means that the higher asset prices aren&#x27;t translating into that productive use of assets.  And even by your own standard, the flows into gold, bitcoin, and idle real estate indicate a failure.<p>&gt;What would indicate that it is not working is if output figures did not exceed what was expected without the policy.<p>So, non-falsifiable, then.')
