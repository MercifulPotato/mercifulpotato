To a point anyway. Sitting for upwards of 8 hours a day typing code can be a depressing life trap to find yourself in. If every time I touched my trackpad I cringed because it feels like sandpaper, works like shit, and might not even have good first party driver support, only to be consoled by the the thought that I could install Windows on it if I wanted to,  I&#x27;d probably not be too satisfied.<p>I have an expensive chair, that I could only really get fixed by the company that made it. I could have a shitty chair that hurts my ass, messes with my posture, costs 1&#x2F;12th the price, that I could sit in and re-assure myself that I&#x27;m free to get commodity parts anywhere I want, but I&#x27;d prefer not to do that unless I had no choice.')
