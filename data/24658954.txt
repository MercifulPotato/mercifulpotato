Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby. The work is mostly on the back-end, but some front-end skills are welcome.<p>Location: UTC+0 to UTC+8<p>Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud to apply.
