I could easily see landowners adding whatever &quot;improvements&quot; the tax credit incentivizes, regardless of whether it benefits the tenant or increases the potential rent charged, and then passing the cost along to the tenant.  Also see a booming cottage industry of contractors &amp; paper-pushers to get the tax credit.<p>I do agree that an LVT has psychological issues when proposed to voters.  It&#x27;s a massive change to how we currently do things (that&#x27;s the point!), and it preferences groups who don&#x27;t currently have political power (future developers, tenants, future residents) over those who do (land speculators, retirees, existing homeowners).  I think the most likely scenario for its adoption is in the aftermath of a cataclysmic war that destroys all the existing infrastructure and redraws political boundaries.  Likely one successor polity might try it out (since everything&#x27;s dead &amp; destroyed anyway), and then their pro-development advantages would draw lots of displaced immigrants to them, and eventually they&#x27;d amass more power than their neighbors through that economic dynamism.  Much like how the U.S. became the pre-eminent global power through an innovative politico-economic system + immigration friendly policies + near complete genocide of the native population.')
