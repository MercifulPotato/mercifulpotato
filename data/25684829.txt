Generally raising expectations on what adults say and write by arguing against ahistorical nonsense where possible.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be reasonable to force all the kids to learn details of past warfare or sustenance system. I did enjoyed the blogs a lot, but I am 100% sure I would not cared as 12 years old or 16 years old. Plus, there are more important things to learn about history, imo.<p>This being blog by someone who understands history about popular series confronting them with reality.')
