It&#x27;s explicitly designed as a purely web front-end language, that&#x27;s its scope.<p>Of course, many Elm users like to run another ML-family language in the backend as well. Haskell&#x27;s Servant backend library, the one used in this article, has a project to automatically generate Elm client code [1]. Elixir is popular as well.<p>But in general, I&#x27;d say that any backend framework that can provide an OpenAPI spec will work well, as you&#x27;ll be able to auto-generate most if not all of the Elm client code (which is normally dull work and one of the main complaints about Elm).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haskell-servant&#x2F;servant-elm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;haskell-servant&#x2F;servant-elm</a>')
