They only care about arbitrary puzzle-solving abilities and other random abilities which have nothing to do with productivity. When applying for a job at these companies, the criteria are so arbitrary that you&#x27;re basically a beggar. You just have to try to figure out what they want to hear, what they want to see then you basically have to tell them and show them exactly that; all while simultaneously using your face muscles to project a sense of enthusiasm. Just like a beggar who does backflips or plays the ukulele on a banjo; you just have to do whatever random crap will impress them enough to toss a few coins your way.')
