But on another note, their flagrant behavior only highlights the immense power that old media had before the Internet became as big as it is today. Just as in the past, media companies hold massive sway over the opinions of regular folk, and in all this time the law has not evolved to challenge that power in any way.<p>The thing I dislike most about Trump&#x27;s presidency is that it shone a spotlight so bright on DC that lawmakers and politicians that no one would have cared for otherwise have become celebrities, which doesn&#x27;t bode well for the future, as any organization that controls the mediums these celebrities use to gain followers and boost their platform holds power over them.<p>It is Facebook that gets to decide whether or not you will even get a chance at getting elected, it is Twitter that gets to decide if you even exist outside of your local city, it is Amazon that gets to decide if you even get a website to host your platform. Obviously these aren&#x27;t the only ones but you see the point I&#x27;m trying to make, which is that politics have become a televised drama, and these tech companies are the Executive Producers.')
