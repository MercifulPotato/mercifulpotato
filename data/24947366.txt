It definitely reads at least partly like an &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you feel that I have offended you&quot; apology and &quot;We ... issue a public apology to Jeremy Howard...&quot; is a weirdly evasive way of putting it. I get that it is hard to admit fault and apologise but here&#x27;s what they <i>should</i> have said:<p>&gt; We, the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee, would like to publicly apologise to Jeremy Howard for our handling of the JupyterCon 2020 reports. We did not give Jeremy a chance to defend himself before concluding that he had violated our CoC, and for that, and the stress it has caused, we are sorry.<p>I&#x27;m available to hire for public apology writing. :-)<p>Still, to be fair I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve actually ever seen a public apology that was <i>actually</i> a full genuine public apology. This is probably the best anyone could hope for.')
