Chores and errands became easier to fit in, exercise at noon literally is a matter of stepping outside to bike, run, or hit the gym. It saves 10+ hours a week of travel, less stress and expense of commuting, and did I mention I don&#x27;t need to shower until after my noontime workout?<p>Granted, at times I&#x27;m on the job until late at night, to get things done and, sometimes, to make up for an extra long shopping excursion etc.<p>A 4 day on-site job would feel severely disadvantageous by comparison.')
