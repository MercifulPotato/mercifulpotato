Throughput is the same across these two. I was looking at AMD Zen2 versus Intel Ice Lake.<p>Some Intel chips have AVX512. Still, many practical applications don’t need that amount of SIMD wideness, and these who do are often a good fit for GPGPUs.<p>&gt; There are also things like Intel MKL<p>There’re vendor-agnostic equivalents like Eigen.')
