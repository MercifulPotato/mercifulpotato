FM targets don&#x27;t have any similarity to known structures. Roughly a quarter were FM targets. I think the more interesting thing to look at is the size of the multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) which is the basis of this and essentially all methods. They seem to do very well with few MSAs, which bodes well for other targets, although there are families of proteins with few MSAs.')
