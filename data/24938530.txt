It causes gas to become hotter because the temperature has to be higher for entropy to remain constant, as the volume is reduced.  This is a reversible process.  But shocks are inherently irreversible.<p>But as my last sentence said, as the mach number goes to infinity the density increase across the shock is finite.  Therefore, compression cannot be the (primary) source of the heating; dissipation is.')
