If I buy a whiteboard from Staples, and draw a confederate flag and some hate speech it does not get erased automatically. Have the whiteboard manufacturers made a political statement because their products do not censor hate speech?<p>Considering that in that case you are the &quot;moderator and owner&quot; of that white board, yes it would be a political action if you decide to remove or not the confederate flag. That&#x27;s without getting into the fact that the whiteboard didn&#x27;t come from the ether and it&#x27;s production, sale and all processes that compose the two are, also in some manner, political.')
