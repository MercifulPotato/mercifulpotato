But then, you have to “push” it to the remote branch.<p>I understand what it’s doing, but the choice of words seem wrong. It sounds like “push” has a lower importance than “commit”.  But because “push” will sync your local changes with the master remote system, then this obviously has more importance.<p>Instead, I think they (Linus) should have used something like “snap” for snapshot, to take a snapshot of your local changes. Then “commit” would be used to push your local changes out to the remote server or repository.')
