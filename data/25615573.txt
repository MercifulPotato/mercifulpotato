The idea of being &quot;happy with the government&quot; implies there is something to do about being <i>not</i> happy with the government. It&#x27;s a little like asking someone if they&#x27;re happy with the position of the continents on the planet. Sure, you <i>can</i> wish that Australia were in the northern hemisphere, but that&#x27;s sort of &quot;besides the point.&quot; There is not a sense, in China, that any individual or group is in a position to seriously change how the government runs the country.')
