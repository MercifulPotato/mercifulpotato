They don&#x27;t give any insights at all, and they don&#x27;t even mention rising rents as a cause (which was what we are actually discussing). Only the solutionsdfl site mentions &quot;foreclosures&quot; as a reason for more homelessness, without giving any numbers (like what percentage of homelessness is caused by it). And it doesn&#x27;t say what caused the foreclosures. Does economic success in a region increase the number of foreclosures?<p>Of course on a simple level, saying &quot;lack of affordable housing&quot; causes homelessness is true. If you could give everybody a free house, there would probably be less homeless people. However, that is also in itself a completely useless realization, as housing is not free and space is limited.<p>And, more specifically, it was not what we were discussing. We were discussing the claim that rising economic success of a region caused rising homelessness there, by driving existing renters out of their homes. None of your articles provide any information regarding that claim.')
