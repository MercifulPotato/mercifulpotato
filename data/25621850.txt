Many people complain about &quot;Python not being scalable&quot; or &quot;Jupyter notebooks&quot;, and when you engage them and want to know what problems they have exactly, they&#x27;ll make it obvious they&#x27;re only repeating things they&#x27;ve heard, have not really used either, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Python or Jupyter don&#x27;t have problems, I&#x27;m saying that many who complain are not necessarily the people you want to talk with, and it&#x27;s better to be deliberate and conscious about targeting people who are actually having problems.<p>For example, one complained that a notebook didn&#x27;t work on JupyterLab and that it worked seamlessly on Google Colab. Interesting. I asked whether it was a hardware issue or a JLab vs Colab issue: did they have enough RAM, a GPU on their local machine or they ran it on JLab + CPU + a bit of RAM on their local machine and then ran it on Colab + GPU + more RAM on Colab.<p>Would you be against learning about others&#x27; problems for a living? You can be in consulting. You&#x27;ll have plenty of problems to solve. Here&#x27;s a sort of mini blueprint[0]. I&#x27;ve worked on problems in different sectors and industries such as telecommunications, energy, banking, employment, healthcare, social work, communications and public relations, etc.<p>It is good to talk with people for whom the problem is <i>actually</i> a problem, not just blogging or tweeting about it or &quot;building an audience&quot;, which you see a lot of creatures doing [X influencers&#x2F;X thought leaders&#x2F;X enthusiasts&#x2F;motivational gurus]. You won&#x27;t find good problems talking with these people because they&#x27;re not the people &quot;doing the deed&quot;, and problems to solve usually stem from doing something in life.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;1310668293305499653" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jugurthahadjar&#x2F;status&#x2F;131066829330549965...</a>')
