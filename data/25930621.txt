(At the cost of the annoyance of moving it as a single unit!)<p>I am sure there are different experiences out there, could also be the circle of friends that do a lot of IKEA &quot;freecycling&quot; meaning I do see a higher quantity of re-used items being moved about.<p>I know that depending on the type of item as well there is a build quality issue - like Kallax shelving, it is a little more sturdier than the slightly cheaper version, and given I started with Kallax, I have stuck with it - Same with the Billy book cases too!<p>Although, the Diam Cake you can get from IKEA... that 100% is not going to waste, and 100% no one is getting a &quot;second hand&quot; one from me... there will be none left ;)<p>But returning back! It could be Apples to Oranges, there are so many products, and in my experience I have seen people stick to the same grouping of products as well, which could see re-use more possible than say another grouping (for any number of reasons).<p>Who knows, tomorrow the shelf behind me might just fall apart and I will be back eating my own words :)')
