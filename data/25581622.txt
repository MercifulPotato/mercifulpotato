An OS is a necessary evil.  It doesn&#x27;t actually complete any user tasks, much like a car&#x27;s engine doesn&#x27;t do the actual driving.  An OS should take the low-level tasks assigned to it, complete them without issue, not do anything unexpected, and generally stay out of the user&#x27;s way.  A car engine&#x27;s job is to start and stop when asked, not to organize the driver&#x27;s inbox.  BSD has remained true to this while Linux has moved away in recent years.<p>On the flip side it windows.  That OS doesn&#x27;t hide in the background, rather it screams for attention 24&#x2F;7, inserting itself in every little task even when specifically told to back off.')
