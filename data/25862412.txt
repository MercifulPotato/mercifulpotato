We might be interested in ants, but the ants would not be interested in us, because <i>ants cannot understand us.</i><p>We can prod and research ant hills all we want. But all ants will ever see are some unexpected occurrences - maybe a very unusual scent which they can&#x27;t place, or some food which wasn&#x27;t there earlier, or an unexpected plague of ant death - which they will forget almost instantly.<p>It will never occur to ant-kind that they&#x27;re even being studied, because ants have no concept of what &quot;being studied&quot; means.<p>There is nothing at all in the ant (hill) mind capable of understanding that a creature like a human might exist, never mind how to communicate with it.<p>So we can do what we like, and we will remain not just invisible, but unthinkable - forever.')
