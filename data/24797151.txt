Hypothetically, the letters had stirred a lot of discussion, and my local paper decided to print them in bold type on the front page. Then the letter-writer got so popular, he was elected mayor of the town. But then the newspaper noticed it was having some negative impact on local politics, and the garbage collection for the print shop was suffering, so they decided to entirely stop publishing the nutjob. The writer cried out that it was a violation of their freedom of speech.<p>But none of it has anything to do with freedom of speech because they don&#x27;t . I&#x27;d 100% support the newspapers&#x27; decision to stop publishing them (while also criticizing them, since it was their choices that created the issue in the first place). I&#x27;d also applaud anyone who felt strongly enough to cancel their newspaper subscription, or even start their own local competing paper!')
