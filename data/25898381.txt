Even before this recent WhatsApp fiasco I noticed that some parents are using Telegram at the school where my kid goes. Out of 24 kids in my kid&#x27;s class, there are 3 families which I know for sure have Telegram (I don&#x27;t have contact with all of the parents so I don&#x27;t know).<p>And I think Telegram is reporting more than, what, 500M users by now? If it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s definitely a sizeable dent in WhatsApp&#x27;s market share.  It may not be 2B+, but 500M is quite something.<p>The thing is: users are not loyal at all. Telegram or Signal or others are a click or two away: it&#x27;s neither hard to find&#x2F;install nor to use.<p>I really wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a bigger shift some day once more people begin to realize that &quot;WhatsApp = FB&quot; (many don&#x27;t like FB but have no idea WhatsApp belongs to FB).')
