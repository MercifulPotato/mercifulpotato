But the data can be tampered with, and if youâ€™re not clever about how you do it there will be some discrepancies.  Presumably a company validating their data would be a relatively trustworthy way to catch the tampering. There are a couple people on Strava (a fitness app) that doctor their GPS data to shave a few seconds of their times and take the top spot on the leaderboard.  Sometimes they get caught because of the discrepancies.<p>This is really about Shelby getting caught with a doctored video and lying about a fake record but the author is too nice to call them out on it.')
