The user has to somehow know that they have to do this to get the benefit of forward secrecy. This seems all too common with contemporary encrypted messaging stuff. Really great features that depend on having the users behave in a way they normally would not.<p>Of course the app can do this wrong simply by failing to do a secure delete that actually removes the messages from the storage device. In the end the actual communications protocol doesn&#x27;t make very much difference in the face of counter productive implementations; conceptual and&#x2F;or technical.')
