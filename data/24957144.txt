An optional field on an input type can be left off (in which case it is undefined) or it can be explicitly set to null. For a mutation, these have very different meanings: undefined means &quot;don&#x27;t update the property&quot; while null means &quot;update the property to null (which usually means &#x27;delete&#x27;)&quot;. These are very different things.<p>This thread, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphql&#x2F;graphql-js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;133" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphql&#x2F;graphql-js&#x2F;issues&#x2F;133</a>, is a good overview.')
