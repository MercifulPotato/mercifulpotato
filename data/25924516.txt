Make no mistake, that&#x27;s what centralized social media platforms are - private property.<p>I&#x27;m getting pretty tired of this line. The American first amendment is not the same thing as the freedom of speech. People who value the freedom of speech aren&#x27;t making arguments against these companies based on the law, they are stating this is a deterioration of liberal values.<p>Furthermore, the argument is that no corporation should have these powers that they do, thus the need to regulate or break up the large tech companies.')
