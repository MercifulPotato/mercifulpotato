I was just trying to discuss with another user on this site who seriously claimed all conservatives have been banned from Twitter. I proposed a smorgasbord of conservatives who haven’t been banned—George Bush (mainstream neoconservative), the Koch brothers (business libertarians or paleoconservatives), Ron Paul (moderate libertarian).<p>Their response was that none of these were “true conservatives”. Their proof was an article by the Cato Institute (brainchild of the Koch brothers, ironically) saying Bush was not a conservative. Well, duh, that’s my point. A wide variety of conservatives with distinct ideologies have not been banned.<p>None of these people have been banned. Why? Well they aren’t creating mobs who storm the Capitol chanting that they want to lynch Mike Pence.<p>Claiming Twitter is banning conservatives is flat out wrong. Twitter is banning <i>terrorists</i> who assaulted our Capitol.')
