In fact, after I wrote that comment I started thinking about what could be done to make this easier. Language servers help a lot with some parts. Linters and checkers might be able to use something like that, if you&#x27;re transpiling. Run standard tools on the target form, but with ways to tie results back to the original source. If we stick to a transpiling model, CI&#x2F;CD integration might also be eased with a generic DSL adapter that just needs to know extensions and target language. It&#x27;s now on my list of &quot;maybe some time&quot; projects now that I have a lot of spare time, but TBH it&#x27;s not high in that list so I doubt I&#x27;ll get to it.')
