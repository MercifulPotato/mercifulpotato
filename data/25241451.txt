Borg cells are, as far as I can tell, akin to an AWS Zone. There are similar concepts within Google that match the concept of &quot;an application unit that is in multiple compute units but is isolated from other similar application units, and can be used for a singular customer or workload&quot;. There are multiple terms for this concept, which I&#x27;d be happy to share within Google.')
