Item(by='leptons', descendants=None, kids=[24761935], score=None, time=1602541936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759650, text='&gt;(I am strongly convinced lambda should be used as a glue to automate AWS infrastructure and any other uses is just abusing it)<p>I&#x27;ve created a whole photo sharing website in AWS Lambda, including a complete user accounts system (register, login, forgot password, email verification, profile photos, etc), social aspects, as well as other things like youtube video search and transcoding in the same system.<p>I also had to create my own Lambda build system because what was out there wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. I wanted to be able to hit save on a file and have it repackage my Lambda on AWS (using a Lambda to create the lambda) including shared code in &#x27;Layers&#x27;. Kind of a &quot;live-reload&quot; for Lambda. It&#x27;s all working very efficiently.<p>This was a lot of effort though, but now that I&#x27;ve got a basic system I can extend it to any kind of website.<p>My photo sharing site for friends costs me about $0.25 every few months, and that is mostly&#x2F;all the cost of storing gigabytes of photos on S3. No, it doesn&#x27;t see a lot of traffic, and that&#x27;s exactly why I chose Lambda to build this site on, because I don&#x27;t have to run an EC2 instance for my photo sharing site 24&#x2F;7 if nobody is using it. It&#x27;s worked out exactly how I wanted, costs me practically nothing to run every year.<p>And, if I did build a system with a ton of active users, Lambda handles the scaling of that. Another reason I spent the time to create this build system and write all the code to handle user accounts, etc.')
