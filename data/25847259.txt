It&#x27;s obscured and mediated through culture and belief systems.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t fundamentally animal aggression. It means it&#x27;s expressed through abstract symbol systems which disguise its true nature. And it only becomes overt and physical some of the time.<p>Mainstream economics works in the same way.
