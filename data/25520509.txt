For example, in all most all languages it is vital that functions such as &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;hash&quot; are pure. It is an open problem how to combine our fine-grained Boolean unification-based effect system with other algebraic effect systems (e.g. row polymorphic ones). I hope the future will tell :)')
