The uncertainty principle means the product of two measurements (position<i>momentum, time</i>energy, conjugate variables in general) can&#x27;t be more precise than a certain threshold, so if you only care about one value of that pair, you can dump all the uncertainty into the unmeasured quantity and get past what might otherwise be considered a barrier.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;new-technology-improves-gravitational-wave-detectors-by-cutting-quantum-noise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;new-technology-improves-g...</a>')
