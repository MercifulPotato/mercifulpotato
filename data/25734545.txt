But for companies whose customers are primarily on the right, the cost&#x2F;benefit could be favorable. If there are enough such companies, someone could build a business that caters to them.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about how complex it would be to set up companies to replace AWS, Stripe, etc., but I imagine that at least some of these services will be offered (probably at higher cost, due to lower scale&#x2F;efficiencies) within the next year or two.<p>Even my liberal friends think that the de-platforming has gone too far â€” and the Trump presidency hasn&#x27;t even officially ended yet. Most thought that the companies would wait until after Trump was no longer President and then ban him on the grounds that his behavior was only previously allowed because he was a political figure.')
