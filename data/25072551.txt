I really, really wanted to pay for it at the time, but it didn&#x27;t quite work.<p>Should I try it again?<p>I also might be confused, but I thought they kept some key parts proprietary. I&#x27;m now looking, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. Perhaps something changed (perhaps even my memory!). I&#x27;m a lot more happy to pay for 100% open-source than 90% open-source.
