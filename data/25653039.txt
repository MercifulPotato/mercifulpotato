Why would anybody, ever, make an order number that only has 5 digits. Even if it&#x27;s just a home-hobby project, the cost of changing to 7-10 digits is so small a d negligible that I can&#x27;t see any reason for choosing anything lower. Like the 640k that was once &quot;enough for the long term future&quot; in DOS. I understand that hindsight is 2020, but can&#x27;t wrap my head around not starting bigger when there&#x27;s no extra cost (nearly).<p>Could you shed some light on that?')
