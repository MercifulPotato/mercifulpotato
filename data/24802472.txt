On that, the evidence seems pretty cut-and-dry. From your article:<p>&gt; In an email released Monday morning by WikiLeaks, Brazile provides details to top Clinton aides about what Clinton would be asked at a CNN debate March 6 in Flint, Mich., by a woman whose family had lead poisoning.<p>&gt; “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,” Brazile writes in the subject line of an email to Jennifer Palmieri and John Podesta. In the body of the email, she adds: “Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.”<p>I hate Trump. But acting as if people are so stupid that you can just deny that this even happened? You&#x27;re only hurting Democrats at the ballot box.')
