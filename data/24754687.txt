It&#x27;s my interpretation that keeping up with upstream is what was meant by answering to the community. It seems that the GP post was not concerned with this or with following the footsteps of Android. It certainly seems within Microsoft&#x27;s means to deploy a custom kernel on Azure and then only periodically merge with upstream (I believe they are already doing this anyway).')
