Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25292957], score=None, time=1606980473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285605, text='&gt; You can&#x27;t have T-cells and antibodies covering every single potential surface area of every cell of every tissue in the body, so there can be places that are infected in the body even though you&#x27;re totally subclinical<p>That is exactly the mechanism how non-sterilizing protection  by vaccines for respiratory diseases occurs: the cells in mucosa in the upper respiratory tract are infected every time one is exposed to the virus before the antibodies can respond. The mucosal cells shed the virus even if the infection doesn&#x27;t have to result in symptoms. The viral shedding is however high enough to allow transmission to the unprotected.<p>Note that at this very moment <i>there are still no reports of a vaccine inducing sterilizing immunity, especially in nasal mucosa</i>.<p>Up to now, for the vaccines which reported the efficacy, it was by design measured and reported as protection to the <i>symptoms</i> of the disease. The press releases take care to mention &quot;efficacy according to the primary study objective&quot;, where just &quot;protection from Covid-19&quot; (as in: from the disease with defined <i>symptoms</i>) was reported. Not the sterilizing immunity.

The notion that COVID-19-vaccine-induced population immunity will allow a return to pre-COVID-19 “normalcy” might be based on illusory assumptions.&quot;<p>&quot;Crucially, it will be important to communicate to policy makers and the general public that first-generation vaccines are only one tool in the overall public health response to COVID-19 and unlikely to be the ultimate solution that many expect.&quot;<p>(Note: All cited here are the papers directly studying Covid-19, which are far more relevant in this case than a wikipedia article about what &quot;herd immunity&quot; were, when and if it exists.)<p>1) See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2024671" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nejm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1056&#x2F;NEJMoa2024671</a> and Figure 3 and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2608-y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2608-y</a> &quot;Viral gRNA was detected <i>in nose swabs</i> from all animals and <i>no difference was found on any day between vaccinated and control animals.</i>&quot;<p>2) See also my other posts here, e.g. the one which directly cites the Moderna protocol. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25286838" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25286838</a>')
