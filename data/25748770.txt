But the implementation of the service bookings was so poor it took over a dozen steps with lengthy spinners for network requests. Our metrics showed less than one third of service  booking attempts completed.<p>I pointed out that since the company was terrified of Amazon, that store services  were a key differentiator and margin producer and we could make booking services far faster and easier with some design changes.<p>The response was, that’s not in our backlog. So next build after completing my work, and helping other devs complete theirs, I worked over a weekend and cached some booking data in the app to eliminate spinners on entry into the booking system.<p>I proudly showed it to the analysts that Monday and they nearly had heart attacks. That wasn’t in the backlog!<p>All they cared about was making the product owner happy (she was a teller, apparently) and all my efforts did was make me unpopular with them and their boss.')
