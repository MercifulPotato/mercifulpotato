I also got it on sale last year so paid only ~$350 for it-- wait until Black Friday&#x2F;Cyber Monday if you&#x27;re looking to get one. I got a Roku to stream with and have been pretty happy.<p>Meanwhile my family members all have Smart TVs, and have dealt with terrible firmware that makes streaming a real pain and slow boot&#x2F;startup times, not being able to stream Disney+ for a while because the manufacturer wouldn&#x27;t update their firmware for a long time,  of course the general privacy&#x2F;spyware, and I think even ads pushed through onto their TVs.<p>I hope dumb TVs continue, otherwise I fear I&#x27;ll be forced to &quot;upgrade&quot; to a Smart TV once this one needs to be replaced.')
