The drywall interior fixing systems are designed to substantially reduce the amount of on-site work required. Modern plumbing fixtures can often be snapped together or joined with glues&#x2F;expoxies rather than needing to be soldered. Domestic electrical can come as pre-wired conduit and you better believe that large developments are selecting those sizes carefully to reduce on-site work. Windows and doors arrive as single units which just need to be fitted, again a lot of attention is paid to ease of fitting since they are selling to series building professionals for whom labour time is money. Kitchen cabinetry is supplied fully prefabbed.<p>Modern flooring is also based on easy-to-assemble systems. Compare the effort required to put in laminate vs old-school parquet, hardwood boards, or marble.<p>Of course if you just put a whole ground floor together in a few modules in a factory, you will save even more labour time. The question is whether the greater transport costs and reduction in flexibility* will make it worth it in the end.<p>(*) If your factory isn&#x27;t mass producing the same product over and over, you&#x27;re going to lose a lot of the productivity gains from factory production.')
