For example, think about echolocation. We understand how it works, we understand what parts of a bat&#x27;s brain light up when echolocation is used. However, I have no idea what the <i>experience</i> of echolocation might be like.<p>I guess it&#x27;s kind of like hearing.. but different? Maybe a weird combination of hearing + seeing black and white? Or similar to one of those LIDAR depth-field renderings? In other words, I don&#x27;t have access to the qualia of some echolocated object. Exactly how I wouldn&#x27;t have access to the qualia of some red object if I were blind.')
