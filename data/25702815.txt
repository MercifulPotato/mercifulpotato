Who needs surveillance. What you do need is to react to available intelligence, but this isn&#x27;t the first time in history that that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>They are <i>also</i> presently discussing their next day-out for rednecks in the form of another insurrection and coup attempt on the 17th of January. Let&#x27;s hope that this time some people will take notice because while everybody seems to be happy that this effort failed from the perspective of the perps it looks like a major victory: they took the bloody capitol with such ease that 10 minutes more planning would have had them hold house or senate members or even the VP or the speaker hostage. Or worse.<p>This isn&#x27;t over yet.')
