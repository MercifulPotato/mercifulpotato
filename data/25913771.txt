For every search in Bing where a user clicks on the first result and never clicks back on the first search, Google will much more. Likewise, for every frustrated chain of search refinements in Bing, Google will have many more to learn from.<p>Their position as market share leader gives them everything they need to know to maintain quality. Any deterioration in search quality with the data Google has means far worse than the competition in relative terms.<p>Which is a complete shame since people like quality in absolute terms so it’s gonna stay that way. Even I’ve tried DuckDuckGo and Bing - regardless of how not-Google they are, the results are absolutely worse. So I’m not switching either, despite knowing how Google keeps its position.')
