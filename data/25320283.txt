Item(by='beaner', descendants=None, kids=[25320427], score=None, time=1607219708, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320170, text='&gt; Because bitcoin requires substatial inputs... it will end up being controlled by whoever controls the most capital<p>Huh? Whoever has the most capital has the most capital? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>&gt; Citation needed<p>The boom&#x2F;bust cycle is caused by what we declare to be the solution: active management and printing of the money supply as desired to achieve short-term economic or political goals.<p>&gt; an anonymous market manipulator caused bitcoin to top $20k<p>I was speaking about the money supply, not the price. Dunno if you meant to misinterpret or not. But regardless, even that criticism isn&#x27;t really doable at the scale Bitcoin will achieve.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll work...<p>I don&#x27;t consider this to be a real criticism. I don&#x27;t consider any scaling criticism to be valid, because they all come from the perspective of &quot;Bitcoin hasn&#x27;t scaled already, therefore it will never scale.&quot; 80% of software engineering is scaling. It&#x27;s what we do, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s being done. It&#x27;s a lazy argument. For it to be interesting, you have to tell me why Bitcoin <i>can&#x27;t</i> scale, ever, in principle.')
