But the &quot;most people I know&quot; argument is not a good basis for rejecting real, rich features in software that works well for other people.<p>I am also curious: why do you care about semantic correctness? It&#x27;s OK if that&#x27;s just your preference, but it&#x27;s not something that moves the needle for me....I&#x27;m not sure why I should care!<p>(edit to add: my comment sounds glib and a little sharper that I intended.
