So if the leader goes down at the exact moment of quorum, you you can still get quorum again.<p>That would mean in 3 servers you need 2.5 aka 3 machines to commit a change. Then 4&#x2F;5, 5&#x2F;7, 6&#x2F;9, 7&#x2F;11. And I think it’s a wash anyway, because as the servers go up the fraction you need for quorum goes down, but the odds of falling behind or failing outright go up too. Not to mention the time during which 1&#x2F;n machines are down due to an upgrade gets longer and longer the more machines you have, increasing the chances of double fault.')
