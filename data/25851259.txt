It took on a life of its own, and has been transferred by the Bytecode Alliance (which Mozilla is a part of). At the moment it&#x27;s not mature enough for us to use in production (both in terms of performance and in terms of code churn). We&#x27;re hopeful that will change over the next few years, but we need to ship wasm support now, so we&#x27;re sticking with our existing backend.<p>(We intend to keep Cranelift working behind a compile-time flag.)')
