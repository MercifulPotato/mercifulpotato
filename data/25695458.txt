Insight to violence, and I think doxing should also be illegal or censored.<p>I think the problems come in a couple forms. First, the best way to combat bad ideas is to bring them to light, not ridicule, persecution or isolation which will only serve to instill a victim mentality which will sew more problematic outcomes.  In the end, the calls to excise those that have differing opinions, views or ever did can only serve to make things worse, not better.<p>When discourse is no longer an option, violence is largely inevitable.  It&#x27;s when people feel they no longer have a voice that these things happen.<p>Conspiracy theory or not, when the media, congress and so many just dismissed a huge portion of the population, it was bound to end this way... bouncing Parler off apple and google stores, combined with the cleaning house actions of Facebook and Twitter will only serve to escalate problems, not resolve them.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the violence, I didn&#x27;t agree with it for the better part of the past year when it was far left activists, I don&#x27;t agree with it now.  The only thing I will say is the contrast in response is a bit hypocritical on a lot of high profile individuals.')
