Am I doing it wrong? I don&#x27;t feel like this was as scary as it was supposed to be. Did I take <i>actual</i> LSD? Maybe it was just a placebo that some jerk sold me! Maybe I didn&#x27;t take enough? I have been working out lately and I ate an apple the other day. I should take a <i>tiny bit</i> more to find out. Wait, why am I so worried about all of this? I&#x27;m typically so chill. Was I drugged??&quot;<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the team is staring at you waiting for your opinion on the new landing page, starting to look a little confused&#x2F;worried - perpetuating your inner fears as you are now surrounded by confused, concerned people.<p>Don&#x27;t do drugs kids. Why? Not because the drugs themselves are that bad (some are), but because there is <i>so much</i> social stigma around them that it is really hard to take a drug without psyching yourself out.<p>Or do drugs and enjoy the chaotic ride directly into homelessness as you find ways to rationalize it as &quot;reduced rent living, a back-to-the-earth lifestyle, and non-materialism&quot; to your friends - if you still have any.<p>Option 3: Continue reading articles on the internet that random internet strangers wrote explaining <i>their</i> experiences with drugs and ponder whether or not you should try them yourself<p>Edit: Y&#x27;all saying my post is just FUD. I think you have seriously misunderstood my tone and intent. The point is this article and ensuing discussion is about <i>other</i> people&#x27;s experiences doing a thing that is &quot;scary&quot;. Literally the entire topic and approach is built because people already have a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt on the subject.<p>My point isn&#x27;t even about LSD directly, but about engaging in activities that have a very strong social stigma attached to them. If you think X is scary, then you have already built up years of conditioning to believe that X thing is a no-no - that FUD is intrinsic, and not my doing. The above train of thought is common for someone who start tip-toeing into drugs for the first time. They are usually completely <i>fine</i> physically. Great even. But frequently this leads to a little soul-searching and rethinking things in their lives. Which is a huge reason <i>to</i> do drugs for many people.<p>Source: Have used a variety of drugs and know many people who have as well.<p>TL;DR: You will most likely be fine, but shaken up by <i>your own mind</i> as you break past a mental barrier that you didn&#x27;t know existed or why it exists in the first place. And the process of breaking past that barrier can disrupt your familiar routines and comforts, including: your job, home situation, and social life. None of this is inherently a &quot;bad&quot; thing. It is your life. Maybe losing that comfy SV paycheck is just what you need to grow personally, but how do I, or any else know what you need in your life? We don&#x27;t. The three options I lay out are essentially me saying...&quot;:shrug_emoji: some people do well with drugs, other don&#x27;t. Do what you want&quot;')
