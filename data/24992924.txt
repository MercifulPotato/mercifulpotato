Item(by='kbenson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604523076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992456, text='&gt; Basically, if I was a political candidate, my platform would be a ceasefire on the most high-profile wedge issues for the duration of my term!<p>Except you&#x27;ll find it very hard to get elected in the first place, which is why we don&#x27;t have many politicians like that.  The candidate &quot;appropriately&quot; far enough left or right will get hit by criticisms over the large stuff the other side, and people that would vote for them will discount those criticisms.  Candidates in the middle that claim they don&#x27;t want to deal with those issues will be hit from <i>both</i> sides with criticisms, and their own side will consider them, and the other side will use it to exclude them.<p>If I run for office on a platform of avoiding abortion rights to instead focus on something else, my own side will say &quot;He doesn&#x27;t care about women&#x27;s rights&#x2F;the lives of children&quot;, and the other side will say &quot;he <i>says</i> he&#x27;s not interesting in doing this, but he&#x27;s stated his believe here and there, and <i>can you really trust him</i>?&quot;<p>All that&#x27;s <i>before</i> you get to the fact that constituents are driven into a furor on these topics, and whether any change will really be made on them, they care about electing someone that will try, even if it&#x27;s very unlikely anything will happen.<p>Finally, what do you do as a candidate that isn&#x27;t focused on an issue when the other side tries to use that as a good time to push for change on that issue?  Do you then devote time and effort to at least retaining the status quo?  How different does that look (and how different <i>is it</i>) to focusing on that issue, allowing the other side to claim they were right that you were lying about not caring about the issue?  Or if you do nothing, then your own side points out that you let this issue regress.<p>I think the whole adversarial nature of the two groups means that any candidate basically has to at least publicly present themselves as a crusader for the issues their respective groups favor.  Anything else can and will be used against them aggressively.  Candidates can only be as relaxed and aligned on an issue as their respective groups allow them to be, and lately that&#x27;s <i>not at all</i>.')
