Covid finally gave me the time to do so (I guess it&#x27;s the bright side of the pandemic).<p>I have developed this tool because I was frustrated with existing mainstream static site builders. I wanted a tool written with web languages, that I could just run with my web development tools (node, npm, etc.).<p>For this reason I have developed YASSB in TypeScript (shipped via npm in JavaScript), and made it support natively all the tings you would expect both from a static site builder (e.g. Markdown with FrontMatter) and in modern web development (e.g. JSX&#x2F;TSX support).<p>To make this tool accessible I have curated some in-depth guides on how to use it [1], and the docs on how YASSB works are available with many comments [2].<p>As you would expect, the landing page of the project, as well ad the guides and the docs are all generated with YASSB.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear in the comments what you think!<p>[1] [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;guides&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.git...</a><p>[2] [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.github.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yassb-foss.githu...</a>')
