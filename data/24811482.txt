Item(by='mrtnmcc', descendants=None, kids=[24811638], score=None, time=1602955110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809866, text='&gt; Why though would bordeebook want to make sure theirs is always more expensive? This would seem to guarantee they would get no sales. But maybe this isn’t right – they have a huge volume of positive feedback – far more than most others. And some buyers might choose to pay a few extra dollars for the level of confidence in the transaction.<p>Alternatively bordeebook may be focused on when the competing book sells out (these are used book listings on Amazon which are single units). Then they will be the only alternative, and at a 27% markup. Books also often get bought in bursts (group sales, class assignment, labs, book clubs), so this might be reasonable purchase pattern prediction.')
