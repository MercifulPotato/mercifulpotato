Of <i>course</i> Santa Monica is expensive, but the point is that it <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be. In fact, until a few decades ago, it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> -- it&#x27;s not like people just recently started liking the beach. Your argument also doesn&#x27;t work because most LA tech jobs are in Santa Monica. The idea that it should be status quo to commute to your job because you can&#x27;t afford to live around where you work is nonsensical. Not to mention that Santa Monica real estate (like a lot of CA real estate, including OC) is propped up by foreign investment and screws the actual locals that live in those communities -- unless, like my parents, you just happened to get lucky and get a house at the bottom of the bubble (a house which now almost doubled in price).<p>Professional, educated, well-off young people can&#x27;t afford to buy houses in California (I&#x27;ve had this conversation with dozens of friends). Market forces or not, even as a part-time libertarian, it&#x27;s clear to me that this isn&#x27;t tenable and people are frustrated.')
