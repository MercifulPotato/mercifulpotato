It is a single memory controller, which means the CPU &amp; GPU <i>are</i> fighting for bandwidth. It&#x27;s not an exclusive lock, no, but you will see a  very sharp decline in memcpy performance if you&#x27;re also hammering the GPU with blit commands.<p>Which is the same as basically all integrated GPUs on all modern (or even kinda modern) CPUs. You don&#x27;t <i>usually</i> have such heavy CPU memory bandwidth and GPU memory bandwidth workloads simultaneously, so it&#x27;s mostly fine in practice, but there is technically resource contention there.')
