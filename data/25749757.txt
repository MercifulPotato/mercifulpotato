Those that were supposed to be arbiters of truth (fifth estate) abandoned their responsibility and embraced Trump Derangement Syndrome.<p>It&#x27;s sad that this is where we&#x27;ve gone and the people supposedly interested in preventing the undermining of democracy, the rule of law, bipartisanship, and political unity are now attempting to steer the conversation again. No, you who are squawking about &#x27;lies,&#x27; &#x27;riots,&#x27; and &#x27;democracy&#x27; have already lost all credibility.<p>Double standards')
