Totally unrelated, the example you cite is now fifty years in the past, and occurred in a time when local news still existed.<p>It&#x27;s related because it&#x27;s a nice clear example of &quot;bad press [<i>eventually</i>] forcing change in laws and companies,&quot; on an issue that&#x27;s settled enough that one would be hard-pressed to argue the end result was wrong.  The swipe at local news isn&#x27;t exactly relevant, given this recent is a national one that did get coverage and the river fire spurred a federal, not local, legislative solution.')
