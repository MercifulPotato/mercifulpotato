I&#x27;m extremely impressed.<p>It can not only tell you which exit you need to take (extremely important in Paris) but also which car to board to be the closest to the proper exit or line change.<p>Multimodal routing is also extremely impressive. They properly implement the city bike sharing system including how much bikes and empty spots they are available at each station.<p>As most of this is public data, I don&#x27;t understand why Google is not exploiting it. My guess is that Citymapper originated in London and therefore as a deep understanding of this way of using public transport while Google Maps is mainly developed in the USA.')
