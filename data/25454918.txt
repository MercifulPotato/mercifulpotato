While it might temporarily improve the air quality, extreme filtration will reduce the air flow through the system.  This will in turn reduce the efficiency of the heater, possibly in a way that causes its internals to overheat and destroy themselves.   Rather than &quot;upgrading&quot; to higher filtration, you are safer replacing whatever filter is there with a new clean one that matches the correct specs and then adding higher quality filtration separately.')
