There&#x27;s lots of areas where it feels unfinished and fails (AI, emergent gamplay, details, real choice), but I think it is a fantastic game.<p>I think the problems boil down to rushing the release for xmas and poor expectation management. The idea that people will be able to play something as well on a SEVEN YEAR old console as well as recent hardware is absolutely ridiculous, and PS4&#x2F;XB1 users really need to get their head around that. However, CDPR didn&#x27;t manage that expectation and one could argue that they mislead people for sales.<p>Whether this was a good business decision (loss of money for damage of trust and refunds vs money gained by releasing it early and misleading) we have yet to find out.')
