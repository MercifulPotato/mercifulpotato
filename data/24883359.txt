Unless you feel compelled enough to look at a dictionary or ask someone for a definition (which is basically equivalent to looking at a translation in the language-learning context), you often just live with an incomplete mental model, and it becomes gradually refined from repeatedly hearing&#x2F;seeing the word in context.<p>This is required, to some degree, to become fluent (i.e. intuitive) in a new language too, which is why there is an emphasis on immersion&#x2F;input in most language-learning circles&#x2F;ideologies. But when you have an explicit goal, it&#x27;s natural to want the mental shortcut&#x2F;jumpstart that a translation provides. There&#x27;s also the fact that, as a language learner, the context itself often isn&#x27;t understood very well (or at all), which makes the natural process even slower. This is where the idea of &quot;comprehensible input&quot; comes into it, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Input_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Input_hypothesis</a>')
