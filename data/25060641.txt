I write open source software as well and I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone for licensing under GPL.  And, I&#x27;m perfectly willing to obtain a commercial license, but I&#x27;m going to pass that cost on to my customers.  In this particular case, though, the question for them is whether they want Apple silicon bad enough to pay an additional $50-100k in software licensing costs to keep their code private or to just buy an Intel or AMD chip.  I know where I&#x27;d spend my money.')
