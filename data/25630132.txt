Item(by='xxs', descendants=None, kids=[25643531], score=None, time=1609760768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25624277, text='&gt;My desktop machine is basically a gaming rig<p>...unlike all the accountant machines which are just standard desktop grade ones that have invoices entered from their keyboards.<p>&gt;Hence the “performance over integrity”.<p>If anything ECC would be better for performance, as it&#x27;d allow to clock memory higher. It&#x27;s a mystery how Intel has managed to convince people ECC = enterprise&#x2F;server market. The real cost of ECC is 1&#x2F;8 more memory (and datatraces on the motherboard)... and if anything, virtually all intel cpus have the needed support&#x2F;transistors in the memory controller, it&#x27;s just desktop variants have that part fused off on purpose.')
