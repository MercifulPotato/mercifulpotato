I&#x27;ve owned 3 or 4 Thinkpads, and all of them run Linux like they were designed for it. Considering the security issues and hidden analytics in Big Sur, there are plenty of better platforms around. If you&#x27;re looking to outright replace MacOS, KDE will mostly do the trick. It&#x27;s super customizable, and contains all of the MacOS idiosyncratic staples (Global menu, dock bar, you get the point). With that, you get perfect Unix compatibility and software freedom, and you&#x27;re only losing a few proprietary apps in the migration process.')
