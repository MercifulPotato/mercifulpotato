My tank isn&#x27;t just a hole in the top, there&#x27;s some kind of metal &quot;basket&quot; in there (2020 XSR 700). I generally do then squeeze it by hand, but I let the auto-shutoff engage.<p>I would feel fairly comfortable using the auto-shutoff. I have had it fail twice in my life. But, because the tip of the nozzle is so near the exterior of the tank, and the tank is becoming a bottleneck there, there is sometimes a little splashing that gets on the paint.')
