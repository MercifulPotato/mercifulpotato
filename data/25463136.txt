Is it that it has <i>some</i> vitamins and few calories? Does that mean that a multivitamin pill combined with a piece of plastic is the ultimate healthy food? It has vitamins and basically zero calories, because you can&#x27;t actually eat the plastic.<p>On another note, 6700 kcal is a once in a while type event. Calorie calculators put the calories needed at 6700 kcal at excess of 450 kg (1000 lbs). That&#x27;s more than the record weight of a person. 6700 kcal is still 2.5 kg of Big Macs.<p>Also, carrots just aren&#x27;t great as food. They&#x27;re more like flavorings. You would definitely have a brought deficiency on a carrot diet, whereas it&#x27;s less so on a Big Mac diet.<p>The thing is that our bodies need a wide range of <i>materials</i> to function well. We can function even when our diets aren&#x27;t great, but there will usually be some small problems. I don&#x27;t understand why food that&#x27;s actually poor as a food is considered healthy.')
