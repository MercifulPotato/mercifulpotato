What these example people perceive as a problem and the way they see it are product of generations of advertising.<p>&gt; <i>you need to address the underlying causes for the perception of countless problems that may or may not actually be relevant&#x2F;rational etc.</i><p>There is nothing to address here. The market is an optimization system. As long as there exist a single exploitable loophole in the human psyche - and there always will be something[0] - advertising industry will evolve to find and exploit it. Lying to people, or making them feel bad and offering a product to relieve the emotional pain? All par for the course, tried and true methods.<p>Advertising - and marketing in general - needs to be reined in, because it&#x27;s a cancer on modern society.<p>--<p>[0] - Even if we were emotion-free robots with perfect reasoning capabilities, there&#x27;s only so much time an individual has to acquire and process information about any given thing.
