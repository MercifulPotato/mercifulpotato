The great part about Wordpress is the ecosystem of plugins and customizability of the CMS. You can just add the Classic Editor plugin and you can use the old editor - it is that simple.<p>You can do this if you pay for hosting or an account on wordpress.com. As this was meant to be a pet project, I really didn&#x27;t want to pay for it, so went with the wordpress.com free account.<p>&gt; If the editor is laggy it is because of the server &#x2F; infrastructure you are using, not the editor. I can guarantee this as a fact.<p>I mean, you&#x27;d think that Wordpress&#x27;s own editor wouldn&#x27;t lag on their free account&#x2F;hosting, especially if they&#x27;re wanting people to upgrade and not leave?<p>&gt; If you are just doing a pet project and simple blog and you don&#x27;t want to spend a few minutes to figure things out, then it might not be for you.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the time trying to figure it out. The bigger issue is I don&#x27;t want to pay currently, until I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m going to stick with this project. Sadly, the only way to fix the problems is by paying.')
