It is a rather wonderful problem to have, but still a problem. I&#x27;m not going to brag about the details, but in practice I set out to achieve some difficult goals as a teenager, and dedicated my life to them. It worked. I have everything I wanted. Now what? I&#x27;ve spent the last few years unsure of what to do with the rest of my life, and it is like being a teenager again as I flirt with new narratives. I&#x27;m only now just starting to settle into what I see as a &quot;decade long effort&quot; on a new set of goals.')
