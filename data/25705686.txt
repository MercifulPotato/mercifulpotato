Computers are very simple at their core. One of the first questions I used to ask people in interviews, for highly technical programming and information security roles, was “How do computers work?”. The number of people, even those with years of programming experience, who could convincingly answer that question was low. It was often hand-wavy answers about processors and memory and stuff. When someone could walk me down to logic gates, that was great. The odd electrical engineer or computer engineer who started taking about silicon doping was great, but I would stop them there lol. Never let the computer or it’s components be a mystery to you! Those fundamental skills and understanding will pay off over a long technology career. It’s not like everyone needs to be a systems programmer, but it’s a competitive and enjoyment advantage in my book :)')
