Because now every developer who ever reads that bit of code for years into the future, now has to understand your code-golf solution, how it works, why it was done, and the implications for the rest of the code.  Whereas they could probably skim the &quot;standard&quot; solution and say &quot;yes, that is a standard linked list&quot; and move on to solving the actual problem instead of trying to understand the code golf.<p>In many cases:  your clever solution isn&#x27;t solving a difficult enough problem that it&#x27;s worth the cleverness, because <i>cleverness is often expensive</i>.<p>edit: I agree elsewhere that this is probably a question of &quot;vocabulary&quot; and whether a particular bit is &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;code golf&quot; depends on your particular team.')
