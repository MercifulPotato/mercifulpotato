I understand that content can be expensive, but Magic Leap did produce actual consumer hardware, and Microsoft and others have spent similar amounts to make comparable hardware.  I&#x27;m not saying that Magic Leap is a successful company by any stretch, but if ML is a Theranos style scam, then Quibi was as well.')
