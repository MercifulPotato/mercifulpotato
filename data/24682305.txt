Any purely merit-based educational institution in the US invariably skews in that direction. And, because Asians don&#x27;t have the same political agency that Jews achieved many decades ago, very little is being done in their defense.<p>But Jews had a much easier time than Asians ever will because they could mostly blend in with White people. They now get counted as &quot;White&quot; in the statistics. This is the uncomfortable truth of the new racism. This country is hellbent on disenfranchising high-achieving Asians, who have the misfortune of looking too &quot;Other&quot; and get marked as such in racial composition stats.<p><i>Stop using skin color and race. Just stop.</i> The only consideration that&#x27;s remotely permissible, beyond merit, is financial posture.<p>&quot;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&quot;<p>EDIT: Removed the use of caps, as requested by @dang.
