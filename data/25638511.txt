He said that a big problem they have with lower-voltage lines is people shooting at the glass insulators, and a big problem they have with the high-voltage lines is people shooting at the spacers... and also stealing bolts and straps for metal value. It&#x27;s interesting to think about what could have happened if someone unintentionally caused serious damage to, say, a transmission line which was the largest connection into Los Angeles, but ultimately they are built pretty sturdy.<p>This kind of vandalism is just a huge hassle for just about any infrastructure that covers a meaningful amount of land.')
