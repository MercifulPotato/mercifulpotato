Historically, C is often <i>not</i> trusted for software where people’s lives are on the line. Thus bringing up doctors is a great example of how building a better programmer is not good enough. There’s an entire class of “safety critical” programming practices and standards and it was common to prefer a language like Ada that made more bugs and logic errors into compiler errors.')
