I have sold every single iPhone that I have owned (about 6), and virtually all were 100% functional at time of sale. Making the products openable will likely to make them heavier, more expensive, larger, and more prone to damage (i.e., water damage), and thus less durable overall. I don&#x27;t want this as a consumer as it will lead to more waste.')
