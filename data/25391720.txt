They then complain that Facebook bots have apparently banned them for offering these or similar views on the platform.<p>Of course, the irony here is that the poster wants to simultaneously be protected from harassment yet have the freedom to harass those who in their mind &quot;deserve it&quot;.<p>Every harasser believes their victims deserve it.')
