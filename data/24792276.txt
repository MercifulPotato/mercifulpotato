Things might be different for very large businesses who are spending millions per month, but that&#x27;s hardly relevant to how Google might  handle email customers hypothetically paying $9.95 a month for a personal mailbox.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>I do not understand why anyone defends consumer abuse by businesses. Unless they work for said businesses, or own their stock, there is absolutely nothing to gain by siding with an abusive business over an abused customer. The business isn&#x27;t going to reward their supporters&#x27; loyalty by treating them better.<p>Collaborating with hostile entities is not a redeeming quality.')
