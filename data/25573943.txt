Ruby only provides mechanisms for cooperatively scheduled execution. That is to say, and this is the big problem with async most everywhere except Erlang&#x2F;BEAM, a task will block everything else from executing until its finished and <i>yields</i> to another fiber&#x2F;thread.<p><i>Shrug</i> Having tried like every possible method of async I&#x2F;O with Ruby to eek out moar good perfz back in the day... including various actor implementations (sup, JRuby and Akka)... nothing compares to just using BEAM if you want the actor paradigm. The cooperative scheduling problem is a really enormous pain in the ass most of the time.')
