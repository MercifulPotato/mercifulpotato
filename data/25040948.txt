And, lo and behold it was.. It was a Canon Pixma G3200, one of the ones with the built-in inkwells. When I finally decided to face the frustration I knew the thing would present me with, it threw an error.<p>It took a fair amount of time to track down the error (a particular pattern of blinking lights) that meant &quot;the ink cartridge is inserted incorrectly.&quot; Ok....
