Or will it stop serving you once your GPS coordinates from your iPhone show that you were actually there?<p>These would be absurd, almost troll-level questions a year ago, but I feel that now they must be pondered.<p>Edit: from 4 to -2 points within two minutes and zero reactions.<p>I do not think that this scenario should be taken lightly.
