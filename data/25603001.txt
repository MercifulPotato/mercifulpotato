They can&#x27;t know&#x2F;assume from the developer&#x27;s update description that it is a minor update, and don&#x27;t have much other information about what has changed.<p>Otherwise it would be very easy to first publish a &quot;normal&quot; app, and then just publish an update with bad stuff added.')
