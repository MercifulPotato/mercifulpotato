Generates 1 yaml file. Accepts no input. The code itself is edited and run when required. Has some very useful test cases that validate the yaml. Saved us countless hours validating for example incorrect nesting, missing whitespace characters, duplicate ids, etc. It is useful enough to be valuable to distribute it on various containers.<p>Code is expected to run on different architectures (x86, ARM). We cannot expect the language runtime to be installed. We need to ship the runtime with the codebase in as small a footprint as possible.<p>We have considered making it into a Go executable but then we compromise on flexibility that allowing us to modify the source code itself provides.<p>What are our options ?')
