Yes, mirrors are easier to expand. But across 12 4TB disks that is 24TB instead of 40TB with RAIDZ2 - and that’s a lot of capacity to lose if you’re on a budget.<p>The rebuild times in this post seem high to me, though. I replaced 7x 2TB disks (nearly full) in a raidz1 in a backup pool with larger drives in about 30 hours.')
