Item(by='femto', descendants=None, kids=[24833402], score=None, time=1603159535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833170, text='Enphase&#x27;s claim to fame is the &quot;microinverter&quot;.  In most solar systems the direct current from all the panels is combined and sent to one big inverter.  With microinverters, there is an inverter per solar panel and the power is combined as alternating current.  I gather the advantage is that the operating point of each panel is optimised independently, so you get better performance across an array when light conditions are different across the array (eg. a tree shading part of the array).')
