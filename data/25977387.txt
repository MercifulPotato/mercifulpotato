Somehow America thought this was fine for decades when somebody might be smoking a joint, but now it&#x27;s fascism when it actually has a material purpose. Pretend like the people with covid actually have drugs and 10 days in jail sounds absurdly progressive when viewed in terms of very recent history. Covid is a gateway drug to full respiratory failure, and it takes very little peer pressure to spread it.<p>edit: also, I thought our pretense for harassing prostitutes was to stop the spread of disease. If we don&#x27;t actually care about disease we should stop harassing them so they can have have a few years of freedom from interference before a strain of covid mutates into the death rate of MERS and civilization falls because <i>we can&#x27;t live like the awful Chinese.</i>')
