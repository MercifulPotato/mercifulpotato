Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25651925], score=None, time=1609883952, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650050, text='<i>&gt; the economy suffers whether or not governments institute lockdowns, mostly because people choose not to go out on their own</i><p>Yes, in a free country many people will choose to curtail activities. But that&#x27;s still a lot better than governments shutting down businesses without any real data or science to back up their decisions, including many businesses that (a) aren&#x27;t linked by any real data to COVID transmission, (b) are taking precautions to protect their customers, and (c) <i>still have plenty of customers who would like to go there</i>. Not to mention (d) allowing &quot;essential&quot; businesses to stay open, but &quot;essential&quot; often means &quot;has political connections&quot; rather than really being essential, and (e) politicians notoriously violating the very lockdown rules they impose on everyone else. Which causes further secondary damage by further eroding people&#x27;s trust in institutions.<p><i>&gt; The CDC didn&#x27;t lie either, AFAIK.</i><p>To be fair, the CDC hasn&#x27;t done a lot of public communication either--most of that has been Fauci, who works for NIH, not CDC. But the NIH is a government institution too. And the things he said were trumpeted by the media, who I also included in &quot;institutions&quot;:<p>Masks are bad--no wait, masks are good!<p>Lockdowns are bad--no wait, lockdowns are essential!<p>The herd immunity threshold is 60%--no wait, 65% to 70%--no wait, 70% to 80%, or is it 70% to 80% to 85%? Fauci <i>admitted</i> to the New York Times that he was just making up those numbers based on no actual science, just on what he thought would manipulate people into doing what he thought was a good idea.<p><i>&gt; The WHO is irrelevant in this case because they&#x27;re not in charge of approving vaccines in the US.</i><p>We&#x27;re talking about second order effects. The WHO refused to even admit there was a pandemic until March 11, by which time Europe was already weeks into exponential growth and the US was not far behind. No wonder people in January and February 2020 weren&#x27;t thinking in terms of a vaccine (or, for that matter, of <i>shutting down international travel</i> to stop the spread, which the WHO advised against).')
