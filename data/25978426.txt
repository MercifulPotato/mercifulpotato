Everything is going to have rounding or blurring in some way. This is unavoidable.<p>If you follow the email I linked a while ago, this was mostly a decision in Weston, not really particularly related to GTK. But if you want to follow the conversation on where Gnome is at with this, see here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;mutter&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;478" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.gnome.org&#x2F;GNOME&#x2F;mutter&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;478</a><p>The end comments there are what I&#x27;m getting at, the only reliable way to do this is to just bypass scaling completely and have something where the client says &quot;never scale my buffer at all on any monitor.&quot; But of course that has the same issues with mixed DPI and you would only really want to use it for performance-sensitive applications that are not particularly sensitive to scale.')
