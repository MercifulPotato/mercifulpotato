Virgina Pine grows well in the south (was the historical staple crop until 20~25 years ago), but doesn&#x27;t naturally grow in cone shaped, and requires trimming&#x2F;shaping and spraying multiple times a year for the 4-8 years it takes to get a marketable tree. Most southern tree farms have replaced V.P. with Leland Cypress (not really a cypress) or a similar&#x2F;derivative breed of tree with promises of low&#x2F;no required tending, but they also ended up having pretty high maintenance costs and don&#x27;t market as well. (They look more like privacy bushes to me, and are also sold for that purpose at nurseries.)<p>So it ends up being cheaper&#x2F;more profitable to ship trucks of harvested firs&#x2F;etc from where they grow almost naturally, and &quot;export&quot; them clear across the country.<p>Also, the actual&#x2F;current market for locally grown trees (at least in the south) is sustained 99% by people who still want the <i>experience</i> of choose-and-cut. And that also costs more to run than a commoditized crop.')
