If I have a typed API interface (both endpoints and payloads), and I publish a (generated) client library for the frontend, then that frontend will only use the new API version if it is also upgraded to use the new client lib. Here I think multiple repos are more suitable because the pieces of code can improve independently.<p>In case the API is not typed&#x2F;versioned, the case for a monorepo is much more important: the change to the API on the BE should come along with the change in the FE.<p>Thus typing&#x2F;versioning (on specific barriers) helps with breaking up a code base (along those barriers).')
