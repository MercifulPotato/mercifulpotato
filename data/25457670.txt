In conclusion, coffee drinking may be associated with a decreased risk of dementia&#x2F;AD. This may be mediated by caffeine and&#x2F;or other mechanisms like antioxidant capacity and increased insulin sensitivity.<p>Not all studies are this positive. Note that sleep deprivation is still a risk factor, with or without the aid of caffeine.')
