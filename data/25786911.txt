I have had 3 WearOS watches over many years. None last more more than a few months of use due to the mindblowingly bad WearOS. 256,000 reviews and 120,000 one star reviews. I have a drawer full of perfectly working hardware that I can&#x27;t throw out.<p>The bot based support question answers is a complete joke.\nMaybe not Google&#x27;s fault but the connectivity between the watches and the phone is the most flakey thing ever. Considering a $20 Xiaomi Band can keep a bluetooth connection forever I don&#x27;t think it is the hardware.\nThe rest of the software stack is hobbled my a java stack that needs gigs to run.')
