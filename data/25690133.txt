Item(by='waterhouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610138356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689388, text='Freedom of association also implies the right to choose not to associate with people due to characteristics like religion, race, wealth, etc.<p>Some people have made laws outlawing discrimination based on some of those characteristics.  This is a kludge, with all kinds of annoying implications.<p>The classic argument in favor of unconditional freedom of association is, &quot;If some companies are refusing to deal with some group of people for stupid reasons, then they will get outcompeted by other companies who don&#x27;t have such prejudices and can therefore hire cheaper workers or charge higher prices.&quot;<p>This argument works less well when certain extremely valuable services (some would call them &quot;essential&quot;) are provided by a small group of huge companies, and entry by new competitors is very difficult.<p>The solution I would favor is reducing those barriers to entry.  Ideally by repealing laws that I think are unjustified in the first place.<p>In particular, for these social networks with their network effects, but also have something that sucks (be it &quot;they use dark patterns&quot;, &quot;they ban people for bad reasons&quot;, &quot;their &#x27;feed&#x27; algorithm is bad&quot;), why can&#x27;t someone create a &quot;better network&quot; that acts as a new interface to the old network, but also has better features or has additional members that aren&#x27;t part of the old network?<p>My impression is that it would be &quot;against the site&#x27;s terms of service&quot;, and there may also be allegations of copyright violation, and that anyone who made such a thing would eventually get sued.  Well, could we change the law so that the site would have no standing to get sued?<p>I think that, fundamentally, the principle would be, &quot;If users can use a site through the site&#x27;s interface, then they can also use it through someone else&#x27;s interface.  The site is free to try to detect the difference and block people who do this, but cannot get the law to punish anyone.&quot;  So the site can either play cat-and-mouse with those developing better interfaces, or they can improve their own interface enough to keep their customers; in terms of banning people, they could either fix their banning practices, or just gamble that those who care enough to use the alternate interface are a sufficiently small group.')
