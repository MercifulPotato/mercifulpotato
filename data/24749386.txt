You can use a hammer and a screwdriver for putting screws into drywall, but one tool is objectively better, under most conditions, regardless of your personal opinion.<p>Python is superior to C and Rust for most kinds of scripting tasks, given equal mastery of both. It has a REPL, it doesn&#x27;t have a compile time, it has a great batteries included standard library. There are plenty of specific tasks that will be exceptions, but that&#x27;s my subjective opinion. I also think it&#x27;s closer to the objective truth - and that people who have a different opinion are simply wrong. I&#x27;m not afraid of calling it how I see it. I could be wrong here, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the smart money bet.')
