How probable is it that their programming language picked those numbers? What are the chances they were hacked? What are the chances an old (or current) employee or contractor didn&#x27;t bake in some numbers + dates with known data?<p>What&#x27;s the chance that 20 people picked numbers that close to the edge of the bell curve? What&#x27;s the chance that the next 79 people picked 5 balls that close to the edge?<p>Any thoughts on these results?')
