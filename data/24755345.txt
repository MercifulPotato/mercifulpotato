Your free speech protections are only protected _from_ the _government_. The government is not allowed to silence you on most things you say. However, things like shouting &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a crowded movie theater (the age-old example) are not free speech. Moreover, Facebook is not the government and does not need to allow you to say anything you want.<p>People who would otherwise post on Facebook about Holocaust denial can go out on the streets and talk about it to their friends or others. But, they can expect a punch in the face if they do. I think that is what is happening here. People are spewing nonsense, and a non-governmental entity (Facebook) is punching them in the face (not letting them say it on their platform).<p>Like the grandparent post said, this is intolerant. But it&#x27;s following the paradox to allow more tolerance in society.')
