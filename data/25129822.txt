I always check out a new branch for my work and rebase or merge off the branch others are working on.<p>I&#x27;m fully aware of stash, and every now and then I use it, but it&#x27;s pretty infrequent. Seeing as you need to learn branching anyway it&#x27;s not going to be important for every workflow.')
