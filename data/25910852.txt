Neither of them claims they wouldn’t have been allowed to stay if they had stayed until the room was empty.<p>What the state investigator says, and what those affidavits both appear to agree with, is<p><i>&gt; Nobody told them to stay. Nobody told them to leave. Nobody gave them any advice on what they should do. And It was still open for them or the public to come back in to view at whatever time they wanted to, as long as they were still working.</i><p>I’m going to give more credence to the affidavits of the people who were directly involved over the wording from ABC.<p>One of them did return later and was allowed in, but arrived as the counting was complete.<p>It’s an unfortunate situation that everyone was told it was closing down and then the secretary of state’s office called to tell them to keep counting, but that doesn’t support Giuliano’s claims about rigging the election with suitcases of ballots from under a table.')
