I was a totally average computer user when I found Stallman&#x27;s writings (especially, &quot;The Right to Read&quot;, and the story of the printer drivers) extremely seductive and compelling.  A big part of me being genuinely interested in computers is thanks to him (and also to my father, who tried in vain to teach me to draw the mandelbrot set in gwbasic).<p>Honestly, has anyone ever been &quot;alienated&quot; by RMS?  He&#x27;s a very good communicator and makes funny talks with a deep message.  In all venues that I have seen in person, he attracted a huge crowd that did not fit in whatever auditorium was reserved for the talk.')
