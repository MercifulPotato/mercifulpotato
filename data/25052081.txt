Or the evening stroll after dinner when you suddenly find that nice elegant solution to the gnarly code. Do you run home and put those 5 minutes in toggl?

My brain is churning away in the background, laying things out, figuring out solutions. And that&#x27;s all extremely valuable subconscious processing time that&#x27;s not going on my own or other client&#x27;s projects.')
