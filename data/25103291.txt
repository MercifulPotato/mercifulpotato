Serverless computing isn’t about fast iteration (for CRUD app development) or even “pay for what you use” (for CRUD app development).<p>Serverless is typically hard to setup and hard to iterate upon. You want to have a pretty clear understanding of the specific use case you’re addressing beforehand so you can architect the system well, which isn’t easy for a solo developer &#x2F; small team who just wants to setup a little function in the cloud.<p>Actually, the best use case for serverless is:\n- subscription to AWS specific events. It’s all built in and easy to plug into. \n- elastic ETL pipelines. This is a very enterprise focused use case which involves processing GBs&#x2F;TBs of data with complex transformations. The variability in data throughput makes serverless an elegant solution. Also, your ETL pipeline isn’t going to change in the same way that a product focused use case of serverless will change.')
