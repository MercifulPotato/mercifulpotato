Management asks people to estimate.<p>Jeff Patton says it best in User Story Mapping, the &quot;client-vendor anti-pattern&quot;<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the client&#x27;s job to know what he wants, and explain the details to the vendor. It&#x27;s the vendor&#x27;s job to listen, understand, and then think through a technical approach for delivering what the client asked for. The vendor then gives her estimate - which in software lingo actually means &quot;commitment&quot; ..<p>&gt; The real tragedy is the client understands their problem better than she&#x27;s able to predict what will solve it. But in the anti-pattern, conversations about problems and solutions are replaced by discussions and agreements about requirements. No one wins.<p>&gt; Try showing up at your doctor&#x27;s office and giving her your &quot;requirements&quot;. Tell her the prescriptions you&#x27;d like written and the operations you&#x27;d like scheduled.

Try to make your working relationships more like doctor-patient and less like waiter-diner.')
