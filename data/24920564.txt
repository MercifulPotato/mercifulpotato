Learn Scheme.<p>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is still the best single book on computer programming: the most important concepts (closures, continuations, macros, transformations,...) for the least expense in complexity.<p>To what you learn from SICP, rust and C++, add just one thing: how to exploit a physical stack efficiently. Scheme-&gt;C++&#x2F;rust will be easy. C++&#x2F;rust-&gt;Scheme can still be quite difficult depending on how distracted you got by the complexity.<p>As a practical matter, most system software is written in C. Being able to read the Unix kernel has been valuable for nearly 40 years. You&#x27;d be surprised what one can accomplish with just functional decomposition.')
