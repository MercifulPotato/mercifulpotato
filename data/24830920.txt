The application is granting access based on a public-key exchange, which the key stored in a hardware store which cannot be retrieved even in the event of a system-level compromise[1]. The remote application does not see the biometric data or even know that it was involved in the process.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that this does not mean anyone who grabs a laptop gets access to everything. The device still uses a password to unlock — you&#x27;re forced to enter the password on boot before you can use biometrics later — and someone who stole an unlocked laptop could, for most users, have auto-fill supply the passwords _except_ on devices with biometrics which usually require that check every time (as iOS users have been reminded in this year of mask wearing).<p>So let&#x27;s walk through some common threats:<p>1. Password re-use: a major source of compromises, blocked by this system\n2. Phishing: a major source of compromises, completely blocked by this system\n3. Compromised email: also popular, blocked by this system except for the services which allow email-based MFA resets, in which case it&#x27;d be the same as a password.\n4. Local system compromise (user or root-level): passwords are vulnerable, biometrics present a barrier when the attacker can&#x27;t just do something like reuse the credentials stored in your browser&#x27;s cookie store. Biometric data and FIDO keys cannot be extracted.\n5. Stolen device, locked: both are probably secure as long as you don&#x27;t have your password taped on the keyboard\n6. Stolen device, unlocked: passwords are vulnerable if you have a password manager which doesn&#x27;t require e.g. FaceID checks (which is what Safari does on supported devices), FIDO MFA is not usable if Touch ID or Face ID is configured. Biometric data and FIDO keys cannot be extracted.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;security&#x2F;secure-enclave-overview-sec59b0b31ff&#x2F;web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;security&#x2F;secure-enclave-over...</a>')
