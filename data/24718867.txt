He pointedly hasn&#x27;t taken a similar tack of emphasising the involvement of fine people as well as bad people with other protests involving some degree of violence, such as BLM. That&#x27;s the context a person someone with some objectivity is putting it in, and it&#x27;s difficult to argue with a straight face that there is no degree of truth to the media reporting it as Trump endorsing the march.')
