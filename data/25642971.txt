I don&#x27;t know why. Apparently having a site &#x27;look good&#x27; trumps being able to read it? I was curious what the font size for this site was and it seems to be 14px for key sections which is honestly way too small.<p>On websites that optimize for readability (like news websites) you see at least 18px and upwards. They also don&#x27;t force the text into a micro-column forcing you to scroll for pages to read a few sentences. I also think the color &#x2F; background isn&#x27;t helping with readability. Black text contrasts terribly with a white background and makes it feel like you&#x27;re staring at a light bulb. Imagine if PDF readers used the same style for rendering. People would probably go blind before finishing one book.<p>I think hiring managers will be sitting through a lot of CVs on this site and they would probably appreciate it far more if you optimized for readability over appearance.')
