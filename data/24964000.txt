This is field- and technique- specific, but animals approved in a grant and animals that end up in the paper are, in my experience, extremely unlikely to be the same number. Even in an experienced lab with well-oiled technical expertise, there&#x27;s nearly always a fraction of animals that go to pilot experiments (i.e. didnt work), have some confound, or just didn&#x27;t work. And by didn&#x27;t work I mean didn&#x27;t even get far enough to count as negative data, e.g. if you&#x27;re trying something very technically demanding or new.<p>Jumping to the conclusion that negative results aren&#x27;t being reported (which is indeed its own big problem) from a difference in animal number suggests lack of understanding of the process, but perhaps formal accounting of research animals differs by country.')
