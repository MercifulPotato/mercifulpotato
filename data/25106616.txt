Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25106940, 25106661, 25106982], score=None, time=1605487509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106546, text='This won&#x27;t happen, and Oklahoma&#x2F;Tulsa needs to fess up to that reality and make a real plan for their economic future.<p>If we&#x27;re honest, DC&#x2F;AZ&#x2F;OR are the &quot;third tech hubs&quot; after SF and then Seattle&#x2F;Boston&#x2F;NYC.<p>The ambition for a midwest tech hub to join those ranks is not insane in general. Pittsburgh could make a reasonable play because, unlike Tulsa, in Carnegie Mellon it <i>actually does have</i> a continuous pipeline of world-class talent. Milwaukee, MSP, KC, sure, worth a long shot (with Madison &lt;-&gt; Milwaukee &lt;-&gt; Chicago HSR it&#x27;d be the short short, but, well...). Heck, why shouldn&#x27;t St. Louis&#x27;s Central West End be the Kendall Square of midwest biotech?!<p>But not Tulsa. That&#x27;s just not the right play, and time is not on the region&#x27;s side.<p>Oklahoma is heading the way of Venezuela -- a horribly mismanaged and ultimately failed oil state dependent on handouts from its primary trading partners (in this case via the US federal government). It can burst forth from the ashes, but it doesn&#x27;t have Carnegie Mellon or UW-Madison or the U Chicago &amp; the CME or Wash U. It won&#x27;t succeed at the &quot;Midwest Tech Hub&quot; play. It needs a different play. IDK what that play is, which is why I&#x27;m not betting my mortgage payments on the future of that particular region. But I do sincerely hope they eventually figure it out.')
