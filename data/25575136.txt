Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=[25575965], score=None, time=1609276610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25574884, text='&gt; you&#x27;re saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation is a criminal organisation<p>No. What I said was that <i>Hoover</i> was a criminal, and that his reign at the FBI was marked by illegality. Whether or not the <i>present</i> FBI is a criminal organization is a separate claim that I&#x27;m not going to make right now.<p>&gt; And this doesn&#x27;t come up in every single news article about the FBI? This doesn&#x27;t come up to discredit every single piece of FBI evidence in court?<p>It&#x27;s an established fact about the FBI, the same way that the Tuskegee Experiment is an established fact about the CDC. Both agencies (claim to) have reformed, so there&#x27;s nothing to &quot;bring up&quot; in court.<p>The fact that you don&#x27;t personally know about it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s ignored. It&#x27;s taught in US high schools as a critical part of America&#x27;s cold war hysteria as well as the federal government&#x27;s reaction to the civil rights movement.<p>&gt; Tragically what &quot;Many Americans&quot; believe means nothing about credibility.<p>You asked <i>specifically</i> whether Americans hold Hoover in contempt, not for the factual content of their beliefs. I think that they&#x27;re right to hate him, but the base factuality of their beliefs doesn&#x27;t change the fact that his public image <i>is</i> negative.')
