People with diabetes, especially type 2, have different sensitivities &amp; levels of insulin production. A group with greater or lesser averages on those factors would strongly influence results. They don&#x27;t even appear to have accounted for medication dosage, merely whether or not the person was on biguanide. Or even mention weight, another significant factor for insulin sensitivity.<p>Second is the glucose increase: Glucose tests have margins of error, an issue not addressed here, and the difference in glucose levels this study measure were small considering that factor, about 20 points. Specifically: Even a blood-drawn lab test has a total error of about 8%. If that&#x27;s tge type of test they did, then an 8% swing could reduce the results to insignificance. If they used a rapid test, even the sort used in a doctor&#x27;s office, it&#x27;s even worse: those are considered accurate if it produces results that are within 15% of what a lab test would produce, meaning +&#x2F;- 15% of a value that already has a total error of 8%.<p>There&#x27;s just too much wrong with a study like this that&#x27;s poorly controlled with ~15 people in each group. And unfortunately there&#x27;s a decent chance we&#x27;ll see headlines soon along the lines of &quot;Diabetes: Think sugar matters? <i>think</i> again ::lol lol we made a pun::&quot;')
