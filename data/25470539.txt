Run challenge trials, but don&#x27;t pay participants in money. Talk up the danger and risk, and publicize the heroism of the people who volunteer. Make a spectacle of it. If you ask for fifty heroes, is there any doubt that you&#x27;d get them?<p>2. Pay participants, but impose a minimum price they need to be paid in order to assuage people&#x27;s squeamishness. That hypothetical guy in sub-Saharan Africa might be exploited at $10, but if he&#x27;s getting paid $1,000,000 then he has practically won the lottery.<p>Either of these would be a big improvement over the status quo, where challenge trials aren&#x27;t run at all and countless people die because of it.')
