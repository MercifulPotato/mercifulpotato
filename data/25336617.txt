It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve looked into this (in the pre-streaming era) but back in those days it was around $.30 per copy. In the US, this is mostly handled through the Harry Fox Agency. I just peaked at their pricing page and there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more categories than their were back in the 90s. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harryfox.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;rate-charts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harryfox.com&#x2F;#&#x2F;rate-charts</a>')
