Item(by='core-questions', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610077244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676493, text='&gt; Out of genuine curiosity what are examples of the control being implemented under the veil of COVID?<p>If you post something that disagrees with the mainstream take on COVID you can be banned from social media or at least have some banner text added to your post. Little by little, your right to post things you want is being eroded; it starts with &quot;hate speech&quot; and proceeds through to &quot;misinformation&quot; which, of course, is anything the gatekeepers say it is.<p>Of course it&#x27;s going to look like it&#x27;s being done reasonably to start with; they&#x27;re not dummies. It&#x27;s always done in some way such that it&#x27;s hard to disagree with, until eventually everyone who is capable of disagreeing has been silenced.<p>&gt; Sure lockdowns and such are being ordered but once the vaccination is completed those won&#x27;t be continued.<p>God, I hope so. I really do still think there&#x27;s a chance of returning to something that seems normalish. NZ seems to be managing. But the precedent is set: we have people pushing the narrative that &quot;misinformation kills people&quot; and therefore gatekeepers need to be in charge of what people can say.')
