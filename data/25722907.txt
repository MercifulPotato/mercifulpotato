Gab isn’t restricted from doing business. It’s just forced to do it’s business on its own because it’s not seen as a good citizen.<p>“We could better regulate our site if you gave us better tools to do so” isn’t valid. If they “care about the kids”, the cost for outside help with that is clear, also deal with the far-right&#x2F;extremist elements on your platform as well. Gab doesn’t want to do that, so the other players are distancing themselves. This mean that the quality of their content moderation when it comes to child pornography is their responsibility.<p>“I’ll do what I want and you must enable me” isn’t a valid argument.')
