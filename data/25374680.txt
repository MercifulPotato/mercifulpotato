The journey sounds very similar to what I&#x27;m going through, though in my case acquisition was the end result, couldn&#x27;t see it through to the 3 digit $$.<p>Built an app 3 years ago, just kept at it and it was on a constant cycle of losing interest and suddenly bursting out features then losing interest again over and over.<p>Nevertheless, I get the grind and I respect it. It isn&#x27;t easy keeping at something for these many years on the side especially without any rewards. There will be this inevitable impulse to just kill it and move on to the new one when after the excitement wanes off (it definitely makes sense for certain projects). Kudos for keeping it up!<p>Keep on going.')
