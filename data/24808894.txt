It&#x27;s funny how I was longing for the good old days of the Internet in the early 2000&#x27;s, at least for the simplicity of design (albeit, not the garishness).  Everything was centered upon some form of content: a cookbook, poetry, scientific research.  Most of the sites were developed using an HTML pre-processor or on an Apple IIe.<p>As much as I miss those days, I doubt that I would survive in the modern world of web development.  Each of those sites were developed because someone had something to say.  There was no pretense of building a reputation or making money.  On the flip side, there was also no sense of being a voice lost in the wilderness.  People you know would still go there and you may even receive a few appreciative notes from those who stumbled across your site.<p>It&#x27;s so much fun rambling about the &quot;good old days&quot;.')
