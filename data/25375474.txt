I hadn&#x27;t considered that in this context.<p>My greater reason for &quot;scoring&quot; progress on consent as &quot;no real gains&quot; is less about &quot;compliance&quot; and more about the goals of this compliance. What does consent mean to a non-lawyer and would do we want legislators&#x2F;regulators to pursue it in the first place?<p>The model of consent being litigated here doesn&#x27;t, imo, lead to noticeably more choice or dominion vis a vis companies. It just leads to technicalities about how popups need to be designed. Form rather than substance.<p>I think the reason these laws have been more effective on disclosure is that the legible, lawyerly definition of disclosure is the same as the common sense one. Consent... not so much. The actual point is not whether or not a document was correctly initialed on page 6.')
