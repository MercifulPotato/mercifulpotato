But it&#x27;s worth it to them to have their own source of chips and also chips that they trust, even at a huge multiple of the reasonable market cost.  In a million dollar tank, a $10,000 chip you trust is less of a concern than a $400 chip that you don&#x27;t trust or may lose access to in wartime.')
