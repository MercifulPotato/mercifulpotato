But still no dice for me. Perhaps, I should be more careful what I wish for, haha.<p>Both System76 and Purism have a &quot;We teach you to fix it&quot; support attitude. So when you run into trouble you are going to have to expend effort. They both have their share of bugs.<p>All I want is something that gets out of my way and works. I don&#x27;t need the latest specs. As long as they hit a reasonable base the more ethical the better. I do software development on Linux. I don&#x27;t feel like that is a big ask to have a trouble free Linux laptop.<p>And I knew this when I was making my purchase. At the time Purism was advertising a &quot;luxury&quot; laptop experience coupled with the equivalent price tag. But I got it and 7 days later it wouldn&#x27;t boot because of a rather nasty software bug (which I am not sure has been resolved [I think it is a rather nasty race condition since its happens indeterministically]) due to their specific configuration. They also lied about the battery life on the website (I get less then two hours and they adv. five hours). And the WiFi doesn&#x27;t really work no matter what you do as the chassis severally attenuates the signal. Which for me, as a &quot;digital nomad&quot; in SA at the time really really hurt.<p>If I where to do my laptop purchase again ATM I would get a Dell.
