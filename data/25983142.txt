Records must be corrected.<p>Voting is a great example. If we moved voting to the blockchain, it wouldn&#x27;t automatically solve fraudulent voting problems. It would just record fraudulent votes on the blockchain. If your grandma accidentally loses her private voting keys to hackers, do we just roll over and let the hackers vote as your grandma? Obviously not.<p>Any future blockchain solutions to anything government-related will certainly have corrective measures and overrides overlaid on top. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going to sit back and watch people lose their house because hackers stole the private keys to their property deed, or forbid someone from selling their car because they can&#x27;t remember the password to their title wallet.')
