Sometimes I work for 3 weeks even and especially weekends. I&#x27;m super productive there, then all of a sudden I lose interest. Then I start playing games. Anything that&#x27;s fun. Until one day I&#x27;m bored of that and get back to work.\nIn both cases I treat it like a game. The work game and the game game.\nHowever especially if income is low, I push myself to work. It&#x27;s not a game then but a fight against my own will.<p>I had a bad relationship breakup. She cheated and I was very hurt. She made sure I lose all my friends. All those I cared about anyway. \nIn that time coding was my way out of hurt and depression.\nFocusing every day on progress of one project and seeing it grow.\nThat one project made me about 150kâ‚¬ and gave me back the self-esteem she destroyed.<p>Compared to that COVID19 lockdowns are light fruit cakes.<p>I go outside and walk at least 45min a day. You can&#x27;t sit at home all day. You need to go outside.<p>You at least are employed and in a safe situation earning your income and sure about that. I work and don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever see a single cent from the work I&#x27;m doing. The project I finish today may or may not take off in 3 years (earlier if I spend money on advertising)')
