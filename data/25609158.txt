Especially in northern Europe after a summer with almost open societies and no grave surges.<p>With this in mind we will peak when regular flu used to peak, ie. we are only now at the very start of some very bad months (for the latitudes with winter now).<p>Also while this new variant may be the culprit, the regular flu probably also mutates in a similar pattern - though it could be that this variant is a heavy factor, but for me we are still pretty much following the seasons.')
