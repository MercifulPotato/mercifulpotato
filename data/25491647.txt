How many people are you going to have to hire to make sure it’s running? Patched? Will one person know how to optimize the 25 services we used? All of those services are redundant across multiple servers.<p>As far as the backups, how long would it take you to recover from a disaster? Do you have a team of people who are experts on all 25 different surfaces?<p>It was a pain when I did my first and only on prem from scratch infrastructure that consisted of multiple environments just running Consul, Fabio, Nomad, Vault, Mongo, Memcached and Sql Server. We also had on prem builds and deployments using agents orchestrated by Visual Studio Team Services (now called Azure Devops, basically TFS online.)<p>The prod environment was running clustered for all of the services. I left off my original list Amazon Certificate Manager that automatically provisions and renews SSL certificates. The IT department had to keep up with SSL certificates.<p>Our on prem infrastructure was a pain to manage and didn’t have anywhere near the reliability. I know we didn’t keep everything up to date and patched.<p>Backups were a pain to manage and no one ever verified if they worked.')
