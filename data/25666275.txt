You obviously can&#x27;t say &quot;Bill Gates sent assassins kill my parents&quot; and, when ask with any evidence that Gates did this or that your parents are even dead, complain that people aren&#x27;t taking the Bill Gates threat seriously enough. The burden of proof is on you for making extraordinary claims. The claims of widespread fraud should require extraordinary evidence as well, and there really hasn&#x27;t been any.')
