I think my gripes are:<p>- all buildings look the same, so it is hard to make out the layout of the factory from an overview<p>- (at least initial) levels are very small, and when you move on, you have to build from scratch. I love infinite worlds since Minecraft. It would also be ok, if levels preserved my previous setup when reentered.<p>- the pace is too high (maybe it is controllable, I haven&#x27;t looked) to plan far ahead, which is exactly the most interesting problem in Factorio (and Satisfactory BTW)')
