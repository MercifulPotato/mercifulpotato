I think it&#x27;s wonderful that people love the UI of SourceHut. You&#x27;ve put a lot of effort in and made a product that many people love, and that is fantastic and a hell of a lot more than I can say for myself. Seriously, congrats on all you&#x27;ve accomplished, and thank you for all you&#x27;ve done for the open source community, it&#x27;s quite a lot and very deserving of appreciation<p>But my point is about mass-adoption. What I personally think of the UI isn&#x27;t very important - as you say, &quot;Design is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. But I would argue that if GitHub were to release a redesign identical to SourceHut in 2020, we&#x27;d see the largest exodus of GitHub users (for personal projects at least) ever - far, far, FAR more than any other time GitHub has changed their UI.<p>You can argue that GitHub and GitLab have UI that degrades a developer&#x27;s experience. You can argue that their designs are FADs, and even that eventually they might change their design to be more similar to your&#x27;s. And all of those arguments may be right. But right now, I&#x27;d argue that this design hurts mass adoption, and even though what design language is &quot;in style&quot; is completely a FAD, following the FAD does help adoption, and entire companies (e.g. fast-fashion like H&amp;M) make tons of profit on FADs (even when they do horrible things - like how fast fashion is bad for the environment, some of GitHub&#x27;s actions are bad for open source, the Apple example, etc).<p>I think your numbers are great evidence that you will get users with your current design, and I think that were you to release a GitHub clone (design-wise), you&#x27;d lose most of your users and would still struggle to gain non-GitHub users. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a way to satisfy both camps of users, but perhaps a &quot;colorful&quot; and &quot;minimal&quot; theme may help? This is not as important as other things you are doing such as the things mentioned in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103662" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25103662</a> but I do think it would help with mass-adoption (which may even be a non-goal, or may be far less important than other goals - that&#x27;s totally fine too, I&#x27;m not trying to judge you or say you&#x27;re completely wrong, just pointing out something which I feel is missed in these design discussions on HN).')
