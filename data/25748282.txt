Why have we seemingly lost the ability to say that we need new taxes?<p>In Boston we constantly complain about the state of our public transit system which has been in debt for decades.  Being proximate to a train station has a 20-50% positive benefit to home prices.  The transit system can&#x27;t raise fairs as those punish lower income workers who most need it, and they are even prohibited from raising fairs at more than 2%&#x2F;yr by state law.  Why can&#x27;t we tax the property owners (I am one) benefiting from proximity to the train stations?  Why are we building stations with 100 year growth horizons if it means we only build 1 new station?')
