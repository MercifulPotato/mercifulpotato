I didn&#x27;t have a Sony Walkman but  my first personal cassette player was similar.  It was too big to go in a pocket and was generally worn clipped to a belt or on a shoulder lanyard under your coat.  By the time I went to Plymouth Poly (UK) in 1989 your cassette player was small enough to fit in the breast pocket of your sleeveless denim over jacket (over the leather jacket that is!)<p>My first home PC was a ZX80 with 1Kb of RAM - not all of the 1Kb was available.  Later I had a C64 which nowadays has a USB interface - I re capped it, sorted out a few other details and got it going again. The first game I played on it in 2018 when it sparked up was &quot;attack of the mutant camels&quot; - a Jeff Minter classic.')
