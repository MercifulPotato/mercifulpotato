It signals continuity of the platform. And besides, they just redesigned the Air two years ago. What were you expecting?<p>And yes, they did add more cores. There&#x27;s PCIe 4. There&#x27;s support for Ethernet. There&#x27;s also Thunderbolt and HDMI.<p>You&#x27;re extrapolating the three lowest-end Macs up through the entire product line. They aren&#x27;t going to keep the higher-end Intel Mac mini available if they don&#x27;t think it (and its specs) serves a purpose. They aren&#x27;t going to invest everything they did in the new Mac Pro just to drop it after a year.<p>And if the performance of Apple&#x27;s chips over the last decade makes you think they won&#x27;t put the resources behind their silicon to compete, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you.')
