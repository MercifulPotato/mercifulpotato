But when you did the initial build or repair yourself, you often learn enough to come in and troubleshoot an issue that arises, without having to schedule a troubleshooting session (or five, as is the case of my brand new roof that still has a <i>new</i> leak after quite a few visits and failure to identify the cause.)<p>The more capable you find yourself, the more you can readily learn to shape your immediate environment to be the world you want to live in. And arguably, there&#x27;s more satisfaction in that than paying others to shape the world for you.')
