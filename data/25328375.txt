(In my case ironically <i>I</i> was the problem, it was fully unnecessary and no one but me involved).<p>Thinks I learned from it:<p>- It&#x27;s very daunting.<p>- It&#x27;s quite bad for your health, especially your mental health.<p>- It&#x27;s bad for productivity. Which means it&#x27;s a fatal cycle: you do crunch time =&gt; because of stress and exhaustion you are less productive =&gt; you need to do even more crunch because you where not productive enough.<p>- It&#x27;s bad for quality. Sure all your tests pass and the many problem(s) seems fixed, but there is a good chance that you will have to pay extra in the long run due to technical dept or just sub-optimal design.<p>- It&#x27;s bad for creativity. I could more than one time majorly reduce my work by just reflecting on what is actually needed (in difference to what seems to be needed, is asked for by your team lead (i.e. not your customer)). The chance for this to happen under crunch is continuously decreasing with increasing frequency of crunch.<p>- EDIT: Because of the last 3 points, it&#x27;s bad for getting things done in time as they will likely take longer on a &quot;work done per hour&quot; scalar.')
