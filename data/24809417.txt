Item(by='quintushoratius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602937067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807133, text='&gt; If I ever hear of someone admitting to being diagnosed with this personality disorder I would do everything in my power to disassociate myself from them -- which I believe to be a rational decision when self-preservation is the goal.<p>This seems pretty harsh.  You&#x27;re making a pariah of someone, based on something you heard, because you assume they wish to do you harm without ever meeting the person.<p>Replace &quot;sociopath&quot; with &quot;homosexual&quot;, &quot;non-Christian&quot; (since, really, who chooses their religion?), or &quot;Black&quot;.  Keep in mind that sociopathy is not a choice.  It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re made, more likely they&#x27;re born that way, but either way not a path a person sets themselves on.<p>While knowing such diagnosis for an individual may be instructive in forming relationships with them, just assuming they intend you harm without getting to know the individual is a knee-jeek reaction at best. The author&#x27;s own experience, should you choose to accept it, shows that relationships are not only possible but can be healthy, beneficial, and even self-enlightening to all parties.')
