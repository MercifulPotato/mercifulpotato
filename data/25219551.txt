High speed trading has no societal value and relies on a large number of bad-faith bids and offers - these people are parasites.<p>Creating liquidity has some value - though not as much as bankers tell themselves.<p>But HFT does not add liquidity.  No one needs subsecond liquidity, but even more important, HFT traders vanish like a fart in a windstorm the moment liquidity is actually challenged.<p>Market makers are the ones who provide consistent liquidity, because they have to keep inventory of the stocks.<p>Now look at what HFT does - they flood the wires with hugely out-of-the-money bids and asks, all of which are in bad faith, because they know they won&#x27;t even get hit or lifted.<p>So everyone else pays for this, and they get to shake absolutely everyone down for a few pennies, a trillion times a year.<p>---<p>It would be trivial to stop them without changing the markets in the least.  Even just charging a dollar for every &quot;bad faith&quot; bid or offer made that expires without being within, say, 10% of the actual price, would put a big dent in them.  Punitive taxes on trades where the trader doesn&#x27;t keep the position for more than a few seconds would also be very effective.')
