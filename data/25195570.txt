Item(by='nyokodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606195565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25195138, text='This is an extremely difficult problem. The proximate problem is that there isn&#x27;t liability for industry when there should be. The proximate fix is adding liability into the equation one way or another. Using regulation may work, it theoretically ought to but Regulators tend to get captured by industry. Another way is to open the issue up to civil liability&#x2F;class action lawsuits which requires a cooperating political and legal class who also tend to get captured by industry. The only way to overcome that is for the population to make it politically untenable to kowtow to industry. However, the population isn&#x27;t educated on this and the political class which controls education for most people is unlikely going to push for it. Even if they were educated because the costs are diffuse and the interests are concentrated the population is unlikely going to feel the urgency to make this a political priority and the special interests certainly won&#x27;t. Politically speaking the priorities of the Hacker News crowd amounts to very little. I would love to hear ideas about how to overcome these problems.')
