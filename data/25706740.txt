E.g. if you are alive, you are more likely to spread a disease to someone else than if you are dead and buried in the ground. If you drive anywhere, you might possibly run into someone, but if you stayed at home they&#x27;d be safe.<p>If your philosophy is &quot;you can never do anything that&#x27;s dangerous to someone else&quot;, it&#x27;s a hopelessly bad zeroth-order approximation that would completely cripple you if you actually followed it.')
