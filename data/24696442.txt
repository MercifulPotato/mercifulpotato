They were first introduced about 10 years ago and are still tricky to set up. Porting and testing device drivers in stubdomains is also hard (from my own experience).<p>Svirt for KVM on the other hand is enabled by default on Red Hat like distros, providing a reasonable MAC policy and locked down device model without any requirement for the admin to do something. I like Xen&#x27;s design but I can&#x27;t help but feel that safer defaults trump theoretical configurations.')
