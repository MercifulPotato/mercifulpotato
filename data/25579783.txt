Geron. It&#x27;s quite practical - you won&#x27;t find careful progressive proofs, but it is very good at introducing the methods of ML and relating them to real problems. It provides you with a way to get your hands round the techniques - with an MSc in Stats you should then be well placed to understand where the gaps and problems are and to use things wisely.<p>It isn&#x27;t quite state of the art, and it is very light in terms of how to evaluate and deliver the solutions. But I thought it was good. My team at work has gone through it selecting one chapter at a time this year in our book club - it&#x27;s provided a good catch up and share forum for us. Some of the folks in the team are Engineers and so haven&#x27;t a strong ML background, a couple are Data Scientists and therefore were in the same place as you (+&#x2F;- some use of deep learning in a few engagements) and a couple of the folks are diehard ML researchers, but focused on different things (time series, NLP, evaluation) so there was a lot of crossover for everyone.')
