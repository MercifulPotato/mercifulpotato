At age ten I would hop on my little stingray bike and explore for a dozen miles in any direction. Today that would be an invitation to have your children seized by child protective services.<p>It&#x27;s still like that in rural areas. A kid can explore the wilderness with her dog on a Saturday and not be expected until dinner. Crime is much less of a concern where there are far fewer people. The air is cleaner, the night sky is darker, wildlife is all around. If she skins her knee or gets lost, she gets to deal with it herself rather than having an adult on tap. This breeds more independent people with hard earned self confidence. She can watch and help her parents do a bazillion things around the house that they&#x27;d dial up a contractor for in the city.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s harder to get a ride share, and you can&#x27;t work in an office in the city without a very long commute. But there are higher priorities than those, like growing better humans.')
