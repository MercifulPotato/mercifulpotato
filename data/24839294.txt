The vast majority of people want convenience, not control. They want their stuff to &quot;just work&quot; because even if they do have the technical knowledge they don&#x27;t have the <i>time</i> to screw around with fixing their computer. Apple is giving the market what they want as evidenced by actual buying behavior, not posts on HN.<p>My <i>other</i> point is that while there probably are enough tech-savvy people who care about freedom to support a viable alternative platform, the majority of <i>these</i> users are not willing to pay for anything so there is not in fact a market for it.<p>Basically what it boils down to is that people don&#x27;t actually care. Even the vocal people who say they care don&#x27;t care because they won&#x27;t open their wallets or change their buying habits. If you won&#x27;t actually <i>do</i> anything about something, you don&#x27;t care. Whining on the Internet is not doing something.')
