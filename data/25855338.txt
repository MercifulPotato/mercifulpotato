It would be user-hostile if not carefully designed:<p>Ruby: Good but there are too many kinds of syntax. Use double quote to interpolate which need to escape a lot. And single quote doesn&#x27;t interpolate, which makes many code bases very mixed and merging code is annoying. I wonder if they swapped them in the first place would it make the mixed thing better because it&#x27;s easier to settle on single quote?<p>C#: Support multiline, still awkward because it uses double quote.<p>JavaScript: Simple, intuitive yet extensible. It&#x27;s pretty useful because in JavaScript world embedded languages are very common (CSS, HTML etc). And I find ${} is slightly better than {} in C# and Scala because of the escaping. The community is pretty much settled with single quote, and only use back tick when interpolating so it suck less than Ruby.<p>Scala: Extensible. Very thoughtful and cool, you can indent and strip margin. It&#x27;s a little bit cumbersome to write multiline when it&#x27;s space sensitive in JavaScript<p>Elixir: Extremely extensible, the Sigil is not only for strings but also for other syntax.<p>Clojure: It&#x27;s weird that I put Clojure here, yet I find (str &quot;Hello&quot; name &quot;!&quot;) is not far from dedicated interpolation syntax. S-expr, simplicity and all that.<p>I would say Clojure&#x27;s is good enough for me, but JavaScript is pretty awesome already - maybe it would be perfect if it can strip margin as well.')
