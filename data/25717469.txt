It&#x27;s like we can look at the stock and bond markets for things like interest rates, P&#x2F;E ration, yield curve and a zillion others. Commodities are supply and demand for the most part. BTC just goes up from it&#x27;s own hot air. You can look at it&#x27;s record and say that it will keep going up because it&#x27;s been going up. There&#x27;s been dips before, but no one can say what triggered it other than a stampede. So long as there&#x27;s no indicators, there&#x27;s no negative indicators. So investors are happy.')
