I&#x27;m using Gutenberg.  It can be frustrating and it need to be improved but it  gets easier to use after some tutorials.<p>Wordpress needs a solid out of the box functionality, without resorting another decision (do I use a plug in wysiwyg editor?, will it work with my theme?).<p>If I were writing paragraphs of text, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it as much.<p>Its not always super clear how to do things.. But I like that its the &quot;New Standard&quot; way of doing things, and gives Wordpress a better default starting point.  Wordpress feels the heat from Wix and Squarespace, and this seems to be their reaction.')
