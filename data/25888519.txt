All of Trump&#x27;s tweets are preserved at the National Archive, the department entrusted with doing that. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;donald-trump-national-archive-tweets-1563149" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;donald-trump-national-archive-tweet...</a><p>All of the concerns are  handled by robust existing infrastructure. That&#x27;s the point. That ultimately the website backend doesn&#x27;t matter, our intuitive logic and apprehensions about this stuff simply doesn&#x27;t apply<p>Let&#x27;s take an extreme example, pretend they use GoDaddy as their registrar and someone falls for a phishing email hijacking the domain. The Whitehouse not only could probably seize it back with a single phone call but also get the right people on the phone to stop the DNS record propagation at the root servers as well.<p>It&#x27;s kinda like how the police keep their cars running when they&#x27;re parked and nowhere around. They don&#x27;t have to worry the same way you and I do about someone smashing the window and driving off, the infrastructural support for their vehicle is vastly different.<p>Or how the president doesn&#x27;t have to worry about when to leave for somewhere to beat traffic because the police literally clears the road the president is currently traveling on of all vehicles like Moses parting the sea. It&#x27;s a completely different kind of logic')
