I&#x27;m living in Japan as a native English speaker, and have my OS, browser and logged in Google account all configured for English only. Despite that, Google search results always prioritize Japanese language content. Every now and then (though not consistently) it gives me a yellow popup asking if I&#x27;d like English results instead, which is a bit disappointing given they already have all the information they should need to make a judgement call about that. Maybe the individual experience here depends on the languages and regions involved.')
