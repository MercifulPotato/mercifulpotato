Particularly when it comes to Kong, we have done all the heavy lifting in Kong[1] + Kuma[2] (the latter a CNCF project) to do that.<p>Typically we want to create a service mesh overlay across our applications and their services - to secure and observe the underlying service traffic - and still expose a subset of those via an API GW (and via an Ingress Controller) at the edge, to either mobile applications or an ecosystem of partners (where a sidecar pattern model is not feasible).<p>With Kuma and its &quot;gateway&quot; data plane proxy mode, this can be easily achieved via the Kong Ingress Controller, which is mentioned in this spreadsheet.<p>Disclaimer: I am a maintainer of both Kong and Kuma.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kong&#x2F;kong" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Kong&#x2F;kong</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kumahq&#x2F;kuma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kumahq&#x2F;kuma</a>')
