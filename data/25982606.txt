Item(by='AndrewUnmuted', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612127452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980164, text='&gt; Is it really so hard to believe that such an unprecedented mass movement would break the underlying business assumptions of a pre-IPO startup that was heavily dependent on their credit lines?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone is discounting this. The problem is that after going through so many of these problems with various pre-IPO startups, we appear to have not learnt our lesson.<p>- Facebook made us think it was safe to publish our real names and pictures online, and attach them to a public profile. When cyber-stalking and cyber-bullying became a thing, they feigned shock &amp; ignorance.<p>- Twitter used to suggest anonymity and low-intensity were the main goals of their product. Then they doubled the character limit just as doxing and other forms of real-life intimidation began picking up steam on this platform.<p>- YouTube used to portray itself as a free speech video platform, encouraging users to upload any and all videos that don&#x27;t explicitly break the law. Now YouTube polices its content to such an extent, and with such murky and ever-changing policies, that speech which is perfectly legal and protected by federal law is banned without explanation. It now even inserts itself into the conversation with a degree of authority that pre-Google YouTube would never have dared attempt.')
