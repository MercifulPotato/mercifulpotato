The full term is <i>coup d&#x27;état</i><p>It specifically refers to the overthrow of a government. Trashing a single courthouse comes nowhere close to that.<p>The goal is power. Taking power from your political enemy and securing it for yourself.<p>The word <i>coup</i> by itself has a broader definition, but is usually used as a compliment. Such as &quot;Heather just closed a $30mm deal with Acme Corp. Her entire sales team scored a coup with that sales pitch&quot;<p>But when used in the context of gun-toting insurrectionists? &quot;Coup&quot; is shorthand for the full phrase. Coup d&#x27;état.')
