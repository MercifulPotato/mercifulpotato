It sounds like you&#x27;re arguing the Laffer curve doesn&#x27;t exist, which is a pretty bold claim not backed up by scholarship. This is a very different claim than &quot;the US is on the left side of the curve&quot; which even a lot of conservatives agree with. If you&#x27;re arguing against the existence of the curve, it would mean that a marginal increase from 99% to 100% would increase revenue which seems unlikely.')
