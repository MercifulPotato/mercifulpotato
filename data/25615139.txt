And in the wild I see plenty of older Excel documents (before 97) which I don’t think are compatible with LibreOffice. Obviously this isn’t an ideal situation but historical data around prices&#x2F;etc from the 90s are often stored as old Excel binaries.<p>In general I think using Calc (or Google Sheets) instead of Excel is a bad idea for a business. Word processing and spreadsheets - sure (although there might be some things specific to Word&#x2F;PPT that I am not aware of). But Excel is a very specific piece of software and should not be thought of as a general “spreadsheet tool.”')
