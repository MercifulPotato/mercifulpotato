Plenty of shopping and entertainment, high speed internet, recreation all within reach.  Tech salaries are around 6-figure for many jobs (systems engineer), higher for developers.  Oh, and if I felt like doing handy-man work, I could have gotten a house for 90K (would be livable, but require renovation to make it &quot;good&quot;).')
