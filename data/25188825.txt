I actually looked into it because I really didn&#x27;t want to use Python to create the output PDFs. I have experience making C bindings in Go, but had issues with Objective C (I also don&#x27;t know Obj-C). If you are able to remove the Python dependency with a CGo please open a PR! Thanks for the feedback too...')
