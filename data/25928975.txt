I can&#x27;t speak to how sustainably it&#x27;s harvested or anything, and while this is commendable, there is profit motive here, as IKEA is heavily dependent on wood for its products.<p>I think in general, supporting things like working forests from a government level (tax benefits) is probably something that isn&#x27;t done enough, given forests are one of the best carbon sinks available to us.')
