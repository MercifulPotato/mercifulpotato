You can&#x27;t mess that up.<p>I&#x27;ve recently handled multiple support calls from a family member due to USB-C confusion. I have to explain &quot;This USB port is only for power, this USB port is for power and data. And don&#x27;t try to try use HDMI through your USB hub because it some some strange problem. Use this other USB-C port only for your monitor&quot;.<p>Maybe USB C is better for a few, but it&#x27;s worse for many.')
