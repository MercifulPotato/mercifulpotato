This case touches on one of them: the Act establishing the Investigatory Powers Tribunal contains an ouster clause which is expressed as preventing any of its decisions being appealed or questioned in another court (subject to exceptions which don&#x27;t apply here). And yet, here is the High Court hearing a judicial review of one of the IPT&#x27;s decisions.<p>The courts don&#x27;t like these jurisdiction-stripping ouster clauses, for good reasons - if someone can&#x27;t be reviewed, what is to stop then committing abuses under colour of law? In <i>Anisminic</i> (1969) the House of Lords ruled that an ouster clause didn&#x27;t actually apply in a given case, and that decision has been followed and expanded in various cases to this day. Including in this case - today&#x27;s judgment was given after the Supreme Court ruled the IPT ouster was ineffective for similar reasons.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any copper-bottomed legislative wording that has been accepted to show that Parliament <i>really does</i> intend to oust jurisdiction, so in practice the courts can and do rule &#x27;they can&#x27;t really have meant this&#x27; even against the express intentions of Parliament.')
