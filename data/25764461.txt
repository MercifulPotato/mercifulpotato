Item(by='dmurray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610556180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763407, text='Yes, there are several computer chess rating lists, but you run into the same problems once you want to compare a CPU engine with a GPU one: how do you account for the hardware? Really a rating, as a measure of playing strength, should apply to a hardware&#x2F;software combination, but we almost always want to compare the software. The most respected lists used to be the SSDF [0] and CCRL [1] lists but they both ignore the GPU issue. There&#x27;s now the CEGT list [2] which I don&#x27;t know anything about, but does seem to use heterogenous hardware.<p>Note that the numbers aren&#x27;t calibrated to human players, so there&#x27;s no claim that an engine with a rating of 3100 on some particular hardware should score 85% against a human rated 2800, or whatever.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssdf.bosjo.net&#x2F;list.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ssdf.bosjo.net&#x2F;list.htm</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccrl.chessdom.com&#x2F;ccrl&#x2F;404FRC&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ccrl.chessdom.com&#x2F;ccrl&#x2F;404FRC&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cegt.net&#x2F;40_40%20Rating%20List&#x2F;40_40%20SingleVersion&#x2F;rangliste.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cegt.net&#x2F;40_40%20Rating%20List&#x2F;40_40%20SingleVers...</a>')
