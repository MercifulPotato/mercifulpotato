The virus can travel rapidly through hospitals, so un-vaccinated  patients can be isolated from the general hospital population to reduce the chance of transmission.<p>Un-vaccinated people are potential vectors of the disease, able to contract it and spread it to others. As such they have chosen to pose a risk to the rest of the population, so their rights to travel and perform activities such as some jobs might be restricted.')
