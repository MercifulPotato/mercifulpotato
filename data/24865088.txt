Rather than give myself an arbitrary &quot;death day&quot;, as the author did, I instead chose to make a life clock. It&#x27;s just a display of my age in years, months, days, and seconds.<p>The advantage of this is that it is 100% true. There are no mental tricks you can play. Things like: I know my clock says 8500 days, but I&#x27;m sure I have more than that.<p>I find I get much the same feeling watching the values ever increasing as I would watching some arbitrary number increase. You&#x27;re watching the grains of sand fall through the hourglass.')
