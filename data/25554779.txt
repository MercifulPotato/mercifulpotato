First, they are not new; they go back more than a decade. But more to the point, they are at odds.<p>Instruction compression says that DRAM+cache are a scarce resource. Macro-op fusion says don&#x27;t worry about those big instructions, we&#x27;ll combine them after decode. Which is it? BTW, micro-op fusion is not free. It has to search the instruction stream for possible matches.')
