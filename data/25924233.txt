Is there a robust ecosystem of MirageOS users online able to help troubleshoot issues from the simple to the arcane? Is it supported by VPS providers the world over?<p>Personally, while I <i>doubt</i> these are the case, having never heard of MirageOS before, I&#x27;m willing to be proven wrong. However, if the answer to any of these is &quot;no&quot;, I have a hard time seeing how &quot;just abandon Linux wholesale for NewShinyThing&quot; is a viable option for more than a tiny subset of users. (Even if they&#x27;re all &quot;yes&quot;, it&#x27;s still a wildly unrealistic expectation...)')
