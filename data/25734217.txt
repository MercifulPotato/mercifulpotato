This wasn&#x27;t some hypothetical, it actually happened. Not only was there not this kind of concern about Facebook radicalization back then, the House Minority Leader Pelosi and most of the press outright lied and falsely claimed that the party whose Congressman was in hospital fighting for his life were the ones who had incited the attempted murder of a member of Congress, pointing at the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords. This was almost the exact, precise opposite of reality; that was inspired by a really bizarre personal disagreement with her which had nothing to do with national politics, whereas the shooting of Scalise seems to have been entirely about that. Nonetheless, the entire mainstream establishment pushed this bogus line.<p>Bizarrely, the FBI even concluded Scalise&#x27;s shooting wasn&#x27;t politically motivated because the assailant was a wife-beater whose wife had got fed up with him and left him, and everyone in the press went along with it - even though if we applied this principle to domestic terrorists in general, the US probably wouldn&#x27;t have anyone who counted as a domestic terrorist.')
