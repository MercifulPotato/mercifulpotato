The inefficiency of energy storage and retrieval dominates the energy costs of using a battery.  You lose 10:1 on construction, and at least another 10:1 on electric-to-electric efficiency for a net of 5:1.<p>However, with an electric-to-electric efficiency of only 40-52% compressed air has a net efficiency of ~ 0.5:1 even if construction costs suggest 200:1 that just means it stays 0.5:1.')
