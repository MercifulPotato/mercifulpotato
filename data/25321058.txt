While I&#x27;m not sure that the first author can be <i>completely</i> absolved of responsibility (due to the simple fact that they are listed as an author), the power dynamics in academia are absurdly skewed and it&#x27;s nice to see a tacit acknowledgement of that in an otherwise (justifiably) scathing critique.')
