Whether it was named Palestinian or not, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that Israel occupied those territories! We are talking about land, not names.<p>The point is that kind of like in Pakistan&#x2F;India UN decided to split the area in two ethnic areas.<p>In the middle east 70% was given to the Arabs and 30% to the Jews.<p>(Well kept secret: While the international community keep asking for a state for the Palestinian people it has existed since the start. It is called Jordan and was created on 70% of the land that was considered for the Jewish national home.)<p>Again: I&#x27;m not here to defend UNs actions, only (parts of) what Israel has done afterwards.<p>&gt; Would you say they are terrorists but Israeli government is not?<p>That is absolutely my opinion yes.<p>The Israeli government is a democratic government. Hezbollah was a terrorist organization last I heard.<p>(Actually I looked it up right now. Here  is what Wikimedia says:<p>&gt; Either the entire organization or just its military wing has been designated a terrorist organization by at least 21 countries, by the European Union and since 2017 by most member states of the Arab League, with the exception of Iraq and Lebanon, where Hezbollah is the most powerful political party.)')
