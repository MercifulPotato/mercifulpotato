Pose a thought experiment: if someone said &quot;would you go out drinking with your friends tonight if there was a 10% chance that, for the next 12 months, you&#x27;ll be 5x as likely to die in a car crash than baseline?&quot; I would say &quot;absolutely not, why would you even ask me this?&quot; and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t take that risk over-and-over again for such a petty reason.')
