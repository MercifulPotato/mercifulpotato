In the case of some satellite TV broadcasters, no DRM is employed.  With satellite internet however, centralized control is trivial because merely listening to the satellite is not sufficient; the satellite must also accept data you transmit to it.  This means that it will be <i>trivial</i> for the American government to regulate Starlink.  Whether other governments can regulate Starlink as well will depend on a few matters, not least of which will be the American government&#x27;s willingness to facilitate their regulation.  And even in some countries the American government dislikes, access to Starlink will likely be blocked by mandate of the American government (I wouldn&#x27;t expect feds to tolerate Starlink selling subscriptions to Iranians or providing service to stations located in Iran.)')
