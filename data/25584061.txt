I would <i>much</i> prefer to deal with 100% autopiloted Teslas than current human drivers.<p>Teslas don&#x27;t have blind spots. They have eight cameras that give 360 degree views around the car. They also have a dozen ultrasonic sensors that can detect obstacles up to 5 meters in all directions. The only way to collide with a Tesla on autopilot is by doing something really dumb.<p>In practice, a Tesla on autopilot tends to drive like a human taking a driving test: accelerating slowly, <i>always</i> signaling before turning or lane changing, <i>always</i> yielding to pedestrians, always braking or cancelling lane changes if an aggressive driver gets in the way, never honking. If traffic is too dense to lane change to the desired freeway exit, it reroutes rather than cutting into traffic (as pretty much any human would).')
