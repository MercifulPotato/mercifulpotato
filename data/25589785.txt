They solve different kinds of problems, even within the same context.<p>Excel is fantastic for what I would describe as linear modeling, building a graph of effects in single data models. I reach for Python when I need to fundamentally transform the data model at points to answer the desired question. That is difficult to the point of being impractical in Excel, especially if the data model is large or exploratory. Python is more programmable in this regard but also lacks the strong static typing that would be useful in such work.<p>I canâ€™t imagine not using either.')
