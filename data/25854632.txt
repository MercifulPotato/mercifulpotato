Out of curiosity, do you have a partner &#x2F; children? If yes, how do you balance your family with work&#x2F;entrepreneurship? If not, do you think people with family commitments can&#x2F;should use their free time on side projects?\n(As for me, I work similar hours to you and have a wife but no kids. I think my side projects will have to stop when the kids come along; my wife is already sad that instead of spending time with her I choose extra work that is unpaid in the short term and may never result in a financial reward for our family.)')
