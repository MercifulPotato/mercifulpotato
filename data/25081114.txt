People&#x27;s homes are also &quot;walled&quot; for a reason.<p>Your concerns are not everybody&#x27;s concerns.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t like the telemetry and information leak as described in the article, and would want Apple to stop it and allow disabling it.<p>But I also don&#x27;t care for using another OS just because &quot;it&#x27;s actually yours and you can do anything you want with it&quot;. That&#x27;s also true for TempleOS, but I would&#x27;t want to use it (to use an extreme example of an alternative), and simililarly, I prefer macOS and the app ecosystem to any Linux distribution I&#x27;ve seen (and I&#x27;ve used UNIX when there were still UNIX wars and SunOS workstations with black and white monitors, and Linux for close to 25 years).')
