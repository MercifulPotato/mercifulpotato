This is hard, but not impossible: we’ve spent loads of time and money on Matrix’s governance model and spec process to get it right.<p>For me it seems to largely come down to a juxtaposition between the above risk (owed to Matrix) and the below risk (owed to Signal).<p>&gt; you end up thoroughly putting all your eggs in one basket, trusting past, present &amp; future Signal to retain its values, stay up and somehow dodge compromise &amp; censorship… despite probably being the single highest value attack target on the ‘net.<p>Definitely something to think deeply about.<p>Might I add, as a complete Matrix newcomer, the description of its decentralised model in that article reminds me a bit of IRC in the 90s - except with solid encryption.<p>It certainly seems to make sense if liberty is one&#x27;s priority.')
