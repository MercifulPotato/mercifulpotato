I don’t really suffer from the prevalence of broken screens. Am I just careful or is if from people with loose pockets running around or moving some other way (eg skateboarding)?<p>I occasionally drop it from my pocket onto not-too-hard ground without damage and I bent the corner a bit dropping it on tarmac when I was drunk once but otherwise it’s unscathed. Maybe I’m just super lucky.')
