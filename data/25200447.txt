It does mandate certain thing that are common sense and good practice, yes. But you can&#x27;t really mandate security via a checklists from 10 years ago. Government can&#x27;t keep up with cryptography, software bugs being discovered, new threats and so on. It&#x27;s just too slow, and requires more than just going through a checklist.<p>The exact details of how things are done at the lower level are simply insane. It&#x27;s very common that the FIPS-certified product has security strictly lower than non certified one, e.g. because the certified FIPS base had bugs, that are known, trivial to get fixed (3-liners, etc) but can&#x27;t because that would take months&#x2F;years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to re-certify the whole codebase being patched.<p>The whole thing was probably created by lobbyists to create another corrupted channel to monopolize and overcharge government and related institutions, just like many other nonsensical laws in the US.')
