I missed that the original packaging text used the word &quot;agree&quot;; I thought it was merely a statement of patent restrictions and not an attempt to create an agreement.  My opinion was based on there never being an attempt to create an agreement in the first place combined with your statement about &quot;other restrictions&quot;.  It makes sense now, and we do agree on this.')
