For anything else, standard cross-origin restrictions apply. A simple localhost server that has ignored this issue and isn&#x27;t aware of CORS at all is generally not vulnerable.<p>* This change doesn&#x27;t actually increase this risk, it decreases it! Localhost requests from pages were already allowed, CORS notwithstanding, it was just not possible from HTTPS sites as it was mixed content.<p>* This is a pretty common pattern for lots of popular software that has a desktop component - e.g. Spotify, Zoom - so there&#x27;s a clear use case for it.<p>* There&#x27;s ongoing work to restrict this further, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;cors-rfc1918-feedback&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.dev&#x2F;cors-rfc1918-feedback&#x2F;</a>, proposed by the Chrome team. In short, HTTPS will be required, and a new `Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true` header will be sent (and an `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` response required) to force servers to opt in to any requests that cross from public origins to private ones.')
