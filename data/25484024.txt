It&#x27;s hard to understate the performance vs power cores like that are cable of. Also sub nanosecond interrupt latency.<p>Think a small coprocessor with local memory that&#x27;s pulling commands out of a queue and managing an io controller. Couple of wins, lower power consumption, fewer context switches, and cache pressure.')
