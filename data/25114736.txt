It’s a complete mess. The very first time I went to Italy, my cab driver got into an accident before we ever even left the airport. He was trying to do a crazy maneuver to avoid a fee and rear-ended another cab driver who was doing the same thing, but who apparently wasn’t doing it fast enough. They got out of their cars, yelled at each other for 15 seconds, then continued on their way.<p>It was downhill from there.')
