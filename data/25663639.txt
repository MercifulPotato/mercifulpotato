They also offer 5 percent back for pay pal purchases which can be combined with places like Raise.com to get a lot more than 5 percent saved in total, and gift cards almost always go for under full price.<p>If you&#x27;re doing an online purchase you can combine with a coupon collector site, credit cards, and gift cards to get steep discounts. When I shopped at H&amp;M their gift cards regularly had 15-35% discounts from gift card sites and they will accept any piece of fabric in store for a discount coupon, making the clothes close to fifty percent off in total.<p>When shopping online it adds possibly two minutes extra to check out once you get used to the flow. It&#x27;s not recommended for gifts as it mucks up the return flow but gift cards are usually only for large retail outlets so it&#x27;s always possible to hold on to it and purchase something later.<p>This is all legitimate use and not a flow for money laundering.')
