It is incredibly slow without customization.<p>2. Editing is a clunky process. Not only is the UX subpar, it never loads all the possible widgets you can insert, making dynamic content a pain.<p>3. Awful search. It always manages to find internal process documents from 2014 and not the service pages I actually want.<p>4. Tough to reorganize content. Moving a page around is just hard enough that people tend not to do it, resulting in really poorly organized content.<p>Honestly, I’d be happier using notion or just GitHub wikis. But the main benefit of putting our docs at wiki.$COMPANY.com is that I can guarantee discoverability for other teams, so we’re kinda stuck with it.')
