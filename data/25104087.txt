It&#x27;s &quot;cleaning things up&quot; when the result benefits your cause but censorship when it harms your cause. It&#x27;s sickening how editorialized national news has become. Why not just report the facts, &quot;...twitter has deleted these tweets...&quot;? Why does some talking head on television need to try to tell me what I should think and feel about an event or statement by a third party?')
