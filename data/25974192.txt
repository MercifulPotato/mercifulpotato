Item(by='nostrademons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612049946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972111, text='Another interesting idea I&#x27;ve been playing with is that <i>there&#x27;s no guarantee that the lifeform that replaces us will be the same level of complexity</i>.  What does it feel like to be a molecule?  A mitochondria?  A cell?  All of these are or were once self-contained &quot;things&quot;, but now they exist as part of larger systems.  Our image of the beings that replace us tends to look like us and be roughly the same size - robots or little green men.  But what if the thing that replaces us <i>encompasses</i> us, so that individual humans become cells in a giant superorganism.<p>There&#x27;s some evidence that this is already happening - with 6 billion humans on earth, the global economy is already showing specialization (similar to how cells develop into organs in a human) and complex emergent behavior, with parts of it dying off without killing the whole.<p>What if the reason are experience looks like it does, with life a full 1&#x2F;4 of the age of the universe, because at later points in the universe&#x27;s evolution, life at this scale becomes meaningless and the primary sentient beings are planetary civilization interacting at the speed of light through the galaxy?  Or galactic civilizations interacting throughout the universe?')
