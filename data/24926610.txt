This seems like a massive violation of ethics.<p>Given what happened (Actual loudspeakers deployed) I doubt the official &quot;Tt was as an internal training aid and never actually meant to be put into practice&quot; explantion, that seems to require a set of steps that requires extraordinary levels of stupidity to the point that I don&#x27;t believe Hanlon&#x27;s Razor is adequate reasoning.<p>And if it <i>is</i> just colossal levels of stupidity &#x2F; lack of oversight &#x2F; lack of process then I do not believe the military should be trusted with such operations in the first place, training or no training.')
