Outside of what I&#x27;ve seen in papers Ctrl Click Face[0] has some of the best &quot;in practice&quot; deep fakes I&#x27;ve seen. The video in the main post is meant to be a joke. But these still aren&#x27;t state of the art and really are just &quot;some dude&quot; that is doing this on their own. Not a production studio. What I think is different here is that we can think that: photoshop got so good that your average person can create convincingly fake content. At the end of the day deep fakes are part of photoshop (I mean they have neural filters now...). The question is more about ease of use. &quot;Requires a team of highly trained special effects artists&quot; vs &quot;some dude in his basement and a shiny computer.&quot;<p>And a big part is that you have prior knowledge. I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t realize it was Trump at first. Nor did a friend that I sent the video to that didn&#x27;t have the prior that all characters were fake. Took him a good minute. That&#x27;s a meaningful difference.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H3pV-_iyT4U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H3pV-_iyT4U</a>')
