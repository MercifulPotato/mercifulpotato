I made a careful decision to do so by estimating that the traffic on &#x2F;r&#x2F;wsb will increase because of the news coverage, which causes people to buy those shares. I don&#x27;t live in the states and don&#x27;t use Robinhood, but a local broker that charged me a good bit for US stock trading.<p>Robinhood halting trading tanked the price in afterhours immediately, and it will likely crash further on opening because of this. As a result, I too will lose money.<p>Sure that&#x27;s what you get with market gambling and speculation but I find it ridiculous that this company now singlehandled crashed the stock and results in losses for global independent investors like myself.<p>Being able to only sell shares and not buy is directly playing towards the hedge funds. It will drive the price down and positions might get closed. If what reddit did was market gambling and manipulation, what robinhood is now doing is the same, just in the opposite direction.')
