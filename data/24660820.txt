Their impact on revenue hasn’t suddenly changed.<p>I would never accept such a deal. Whether I am moving to a lower cost of living area or not, that is my business and none of my employer’s business. My employer and I have an agreement about my pay based on how they value my labor and how I value my time. I am looking for <i>raises</i> not cuts. And raises are a function of my impact on revenue. Whether I live in Manhattan or Madison utterly plays no role in this, full stop.<p>This very likely would be a reason to leave a company, or never consider working for them in the first place.')
