When you hear people say they use a &quot;Debian based&quot; distro they&#x27;ll be using apt as their package manager.<p>You have 3 main &quot;base&quot; distros&#x2F;package mamagers:<p>Debian&#x2F;apt<p>RHEL&#x2F;yum&#x2F;dnf<p>Arch&#x2F;pacman&#x2F;pkgbuild<p>There are of course many more but these are the overwhelming majority.<p>This means if I wanted to make my own distro I could do as little as take Debian stable as my upstream, rebuild a few packages with a s&#x2F;Debian&#x2F;MyDisro&#x2F;g and change a few default packages and call it that.<p>Or I could track a mix of packages from Debian testing and stable.<p>Or I could decide I prefer to build everything my self but still use apt for my package manager.<p>This is of course turtles all the way down eg: Mint is based of Ubuntu which is based of Debian.')
