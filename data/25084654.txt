The laws governing subatomic particles, as far as speech is capable of representing them, are probabilistic. And, as we see in practice, we have surrendered to using aspects in the sciences. When useful, we speak of light as a wave, when useful, a particle. Really it is neither or both. The same gap in the work of the software engineer to depict the world in language. Any mode of speech can only depict one aspect of the truth at a time, even if a single language is capable of more than one mode, it can only ever express one aspect.<p>Your being a Neo-Darwinian and your confusion at the possibility of regression or a halt in progress are the same. Once the mollusc has &quot;conceived&quot; of his shell as an &quot;adaptation&quot; to a change in condition, he has &quot;responded&quot; so harshly to environmental dangers that he has closed them off almost entirely, bringing the process of speciation and adaptation to a near halt. In fact, there are countless examples of &quot;tools&quot; &quot;conceived&quot; by organisms that have been so immaculate that development has grinded to halt. Not all is progress... the world is not a machine...')
