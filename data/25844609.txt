So xscreensaver is just another X client that happens to draw itself full-screen on top of all other apps and grab all user input.<p>From the point of view of the display manager, a screensaver&#x2F;screenlocker crashing is just a simple app crash. There&#x27;s nothing in the protocol to suggest that this is a security failure.')
