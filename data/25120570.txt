It&#x27;s a spectrum. On one end you have pure play tech like Stripe or Facebook (100% zero marginal cost). On the other end you have industrial firms who produce mostly undifferentiated commodities with thin margins like tires (super high marginal cost).<p>Apple is clearly a tech company since they conduct tons of activities that are zero marginal cost (iOS, MacOS, App Stores, AppleTV, Apple Music, Apple News, Logic Pro, iCloud storage, etc. etc.)<p>However if you remove the software part of their business, then they&#x27;d be a commodity phone company, and valued by Wall Street in the same way TV manufacturers are (ie. like Samsung, with a PE ratio roughly half that of Apple).<p>The higher value and differentiation is mostly derived from the software (an OLED screen with a processor attached isn&#x27;t high margin otherwise--see Samsung&#x27;s margins). Hence why &quot;software is eating the world.&quot;')
