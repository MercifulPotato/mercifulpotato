But S1-S6 developed many good characters and plotlines, and it&#x27;s OK leave a world in progress. Especially in GoT world which is all about treachery and turmoil -- the idea of a tidy ending for everyone is absurd, unless everyone dies. So someone new knows to watch only S1-S6 and it&#x27;s a good show.')
