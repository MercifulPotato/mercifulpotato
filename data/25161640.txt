While Actor model systems have not been commonly encountered in the circles I&#x27;ve run in (we don&#x27;t need no stinking XML Web Services, we&#x27;re going to microservices wooooo), this confluence of (Actors + Rust + Wasmtime) seems perfect for the age of increasingly-parallel CPUs as Moore&#x27;s Law comes in for a landing.<p>I hope these kinds of efforts start to represent the dawn of a beneficial trend that starts us down the curve of excitement, cargo culting, then depression, then plateau of standard utility.<p>This trend doesn&#x27;t have to get as bad as the OO craze of the 90s, but it needs to grow large enough to get people to stop reinforcing the OO model out of baby-duck syndrome or inertia.')
