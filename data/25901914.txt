Scanning and re-scanning project took long time. Freshly written code either didn&#x27;t appear in auto-completion lists or appeared after long delay. Huge projects lagged horribly â€” and that was just with basic auto-completion. Doing on-fly null-checks and displaying hints, like Idea does, was completely outside of reach.<p>I don&#x27;t know, if today Eclipse fares better, beacuse like many people I switched to IntelliJ never looked back.')
