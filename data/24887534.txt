I suspect many readers here never used X on a 90s PC or workstation, so they could be forgiven for not realizing it was up to the task on hardware that is now pitiful.<p>Another example I like is the Nokia N900, which ran X on a phone no less, phone hardware from 2009, and it was pretty good there.<p>Part of the problem is surely software bloat over time on higher parts of the stack, rather than X itself. You couldn&#x27;t get the 486 in the comment above to run recent gnome or a recent browser. But you could run software of the era well.')
