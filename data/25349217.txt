They have every incentive to have gotten this right, the future of American commercial aviation basically rides on this outcome. Both organizations have the technical competency to get it done, and the management culture has been thoroughly slapped down. At this point, I just don&#x27;t think it is possible for real concerns to have been ignored.<p>As to future development, it would be nice to see Boeing become an engineering first organization.<p>As an aside: the plane was never &#x27;aerodynamically unstable&#x27; as so many people purport.
