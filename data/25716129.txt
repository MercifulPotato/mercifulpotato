I think it will be way more interesting,  especially pixels rendering part. You need implement vector rasterizer (because after you parse ttf font file glyphs represented as sequence of lineTo(x,y) and quadTo(cx,cy,x,y) instructions). You need to implement proper antialiasing (based on area coverage, not sampling, because it gives 256 shades of color not 16x of something like msaa in games). You need to choose some of rendering approaches - for example rasterizing vector objects one by one with blending to background or do some deferring approach with resolving intersection between objects geometrically (to reduce overdraw) and only then  walk over pixels and calculate its colors. You also need to implement some dynamic caching and adaptive streaming because you want to zoom big blobs of text and without caching e.g rendering as vector you will not get 60fps and smooth curves without pixelization or LOD changing artifacts)')
