Use of db generated identity has the downside, but n&#x2F;hibernate has a bunch of other Id generators to mitigate the problems. You can use sequential guid, hilo, guid, or whatever. I use sequential guid because it helps with a bunch of other things. So it&#x27;s not really a leaky abstraction. It&#x27;s not really an orm problem, you need to do that regardless.<p>Re queries: I think linq showed the true power of orm in some sense. Query your database as if you are querying your objects. It has problems like n+1 or exploding cartesian but postgres and the likes fixes it nicely with json_agg.  I have to agree though that I like graphql way too. For nodejs compile time linq is not an option, so graphql it is.<p>Transactions: I don&#x27;t know how this is related to orms?<p>Disclaimer: former nhibernate developer that was around when ayende was building linq for nhibernate and my view is probably dated and biased.')
