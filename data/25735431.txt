Or atleast, I wish Microsoft could implement such features for their login interface.<p>I love gaming on Windows &amp; PC and would love to have the PC have a &quot;Big Picture mode&quot; friendly UI, _throughout_ the OS. Some gimmicks I have had to resort to are to set up my PC Sign-In to be _without_ a password and on a _local account_ on my Win10 PC, along with having Steam start in BigPicture on startup. This way I can switch on my PC and have my controller connect to start gaming just like a console; but way better graphics of course :)<p>It&#x27;s these tiny affordances that collectively add up to great User Experience features.')
