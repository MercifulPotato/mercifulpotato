Item(by='falco925', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603205479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24837971, text='Hey guys, I&#x27;ve posted here before to show off a collection of 500 SQL and python interview questions (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.stratascratch.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;platform.stratascratch.com</a>) and got a lot of great feedback from you all. I&#x27;m back because I wanted to share 500 more data science interview questions -- this time covering concepts in statistics, modeling, product sense, probability, business cases, and system design. They&#x27;re all free and were collected from various public sites. But they&#x27;re free because I&#x27;m only 1 person and can&#x27;t answer them all. I&#x27;m hoping the data science community can contribute. These questions all have discussion forums attached to them, sort of like StackOverflow and Reddit style.<p>I&#x27;d love it if you guys could share your thoughts on it! Does this hit the mark as an educational resource to prep for interviews? What can be improved?<p>And just to be transparent about my end goal here, I&#x27;m hoping for this site to be largely free. I just wanted to create a site where people can have technical conversations around data science, and am starting with the niche of interview prep. The coding questions do have an executable IDE with datasets so I do have to charge for most of those questions to pay for my server costs.')
