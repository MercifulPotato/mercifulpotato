The point at which tens of thousands of rounds becomes useful isn’t a few weeks disruption in food distribution.<p>To justify my stance, in a long term survival situation slings are for low risk low reward hunting.  With even moderate practice they become very high calories per resources and time invested while your doing something else.  Aka, if you’re collecting firewood and see a squirrel, vs specifically looking for squirrels.  That’s still true if you’re missing 95% of the time.<p>Plenty of active bow hunters are around to tell you how long that takes to learn.  Unfortunately, manufacturing arrows and replacement bows takes significant effort. Atal are generally worse than bows, but vastly easier to manufacture and maintain.<p>As to ammo it’s very much possible to find good ammo that’s 50 years old.  Depending on specific ammo to still be good in 50 years is a very different thing when you can’t depend on climate control.  That’s not a concern at 70+ but a 25 year old presumably has a longer time horizon.')
