Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607067751, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25299420, text='&gt; Science is a global cooperative effort, rather than a national competition.<p>Haha... that&#x27;s not at all the case; academics are petty people with fragile egos who are often under the thumb of lab directors with even worse egos and often come into that role with an ax to grind. Racism, be it veiled or otherwise, is also no stranger to the realms of Science. Much less the dregs called the peer-reviewed system. Consider the plight of Dr. He Jiankui who many researchers in the West lauded in private, but scorned in public when the &#x27;evil Chinese Scientist&#x27; revealed his results to the Public because grant money and political standing were at risk.<p>Collaborations are limited in so far as their personal utility for more grants or prestige, lets not elevate researchers and their horrible practices to places they do not belong.<p>I think you would find the process entirely sad and depressing, as most of us did in our undergrad, when you see it for what it really is.')
