Now it&#x27;s just a small benchmark with specific tests, but I do think it&#x27;s easier to make NodeJS handle large amount of requests than PHP. Although again, you can definitely do large amounts of requests with PHP too. I&#x27;ve spent about 5 years on each, found that getting good performance out of V8 is easier than out of PHP.')
