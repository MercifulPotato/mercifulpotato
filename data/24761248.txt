My point is simple here history teaches some lessons and we should learn from it.<p>If you see today monarchs are replaced either by oligarchy, power or money. It’s impossible to fight an election for US President without money, which brings vested interests (not so much different in essence from Indian, Persian or Chinese federal systems managing large swaths of empire).<p>Only a system which protects minority from the tyranny of majority is true test of humanity and in this I believe early Persian empire, Ashok and among Mughals Akbar did better by promoting truly plural society, abolishing the system of punishing people in minority with different beliefs. Obviously we didn’t live in that era so my views are only based on some studies.<p>Today in most democracy it’s a tyranny of majority and the constitutional rights granted for protection of minority are constantly diluted or completely removed. “Black lives matter” and “Minority treatment in India” is a very good example of it (including in China, but than people don’t consider it as democracy anyways).')
