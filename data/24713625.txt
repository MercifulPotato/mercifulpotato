The problem then becomes what classifies as political ad. This can be very obvious (vote for president = political, buy cereal = not political), but it can also be far less obvious.<p>For example, would an ad for in support of an oil pipeline be considered a political ad? What if it&#x27;s in support for an outcome of a referendum? Or an Ad for a charity? What if that charity is the EFF&#x2F;ACLU in support of changing policies?<p>It&#x27;s an extremely difficult problem to differentiate what is considered a political ad and what is not and I don&#x27;t exactly trust Facebook to do so.')
