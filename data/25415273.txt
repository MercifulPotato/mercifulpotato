The hard facts are that BTC is wasteful in terms of energy consumption.<p>&gt;Examples of this include over-built hydroelectric dams in certain regions of China, or stranded oil and gas wells in North America. Bitcoin mining equipment is mobile, and thus can be put near wherever the cheapest source of energy is, to arbitrage it and give a purpose to that stranded energy production.<p>Way to romanticise the issue; again, here are the actual % that make up electricity production in china: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_China" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electricity_sector_in_China</a>\nIt isn&#x27;t excess hydro power being used, its coal.')
