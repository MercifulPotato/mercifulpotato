Apologies.<p>But also, that&#x27;s contributing &quot;out&quot;, not contributing &quot;back&quot;. It&#x27;s the difference between working with your neighbours, vs leaving your extra shit around your house on the curb for someone else to take.<p>The mechanics of how they relate to the groups from which they filter wealth, that <i>matters</i> imho.<p>When I get frustrated about how they don&#x27;t really contribute, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m intensely cynical about the worldview from which their offerings come.<p>Anyhow, thanks for the generous comment, and the chance to reflect :)')
