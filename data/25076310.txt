Different callers may pass objects with different sets of methods into a function and expect it to work. You run into the case where the object that was passed in is one with subtly-mismatched behavior from what your method expects, but you don&#x27;t know who created it - it was probably stored as a member variable by something 10 callstack levels and 5 classes distant from what you&#x27;re currently working on.<p>Static typing prevents that by telling you early where the mismatch is happening - some method calls into another with a variable of the wrong type, and that&#x27;s where the bug is. It also allows tooling to look up the types of variables and quickly get information about their properties.')
