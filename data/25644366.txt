If all they did was apply a merge request in one of the repos then would reverting the merge and blocking the account would be enough to comply? Is there some alternative way to comply with US export restrictions?<p>The real question here is why people even consider using US cloud companies when they know they have employees working in countries subject to severe US trade restrictions. If you&#x27;re willing to risk your company being denied business with American companies, then you should also have a mitigation strategy when you get caught. It sucks that you have to work around US regulation to do normal business but this is just how the world works right now.')
