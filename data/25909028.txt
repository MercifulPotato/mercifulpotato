I&#x27;ve usually heard it&#x2F;hear it when it comes to certain people (actually, two varieties even - one tied to the &quot;Zirkus&quot; and the other one being a group of &quot;Landstreicher&quot; basically) but that&#x27;s not tied to an ethnicity or whatever.<p>A more prominent example would be the word &quot;Neger&quot; where the media tells us it&#x27;s a terrible word, insulting, racial slur etc etc, yet however, it is used by normal people in a conversation without any issues. It&#x27;s funny how irrational media (and some crazies) get, ignoring all context, how something and with what intention something is said. There is always a stark contrast between that and actual real life. I, for one, like to eat my &quot;Negerkuss&quot;.')
