The first is that there might be a large group of users unknown to you and I who enjoy looking at pinterest in the image results and that is who Google wants to cater to. And the second is not that Google is or should be a &quot;pure democracy of algorithmic conformance&quot; but that Google has, does and always will make choices about what is best and that the definition of best is up to their discretion. They are making choices about who to cater to with their results and justify those choices with their own logic that we will likely never know. One company having the power to be the only one making all those choices isn&#x27;t anything I would call a democracy.')
