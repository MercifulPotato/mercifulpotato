If instead of `cat|pv` you just use `pv filename` or even `pv &lt;file`, it&#x27;ll work out the file or block device size on its own.<p>If you forget to use pv and want a nice progress bar for an already executing process, use `pv -d &lt;pid&gt;`. That&#x27;ll display progress bars for every open file. Works even for things like installers and servers, where you wouldn&#x27;t be able to use a pv pipeline anyway.')
