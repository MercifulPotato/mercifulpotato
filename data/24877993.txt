But I&#x27;m curious if that&#x27;s even the goal of it?<p>When I took ASL I remember them saying the reason ASL was accepted as a foreign language was because it has a culture that was taught along with it. It may or may not be taken seriously when taught, but a lot of people grow up in a bubble and don&#x27;t get exposed to other cultures.<p>I&#x27;ve lived with a bunch of people that were fluent in English, but it wasn&#x27;t their first language and others who were English native but studied foreign languages more seriously. Learning another language makes you think more about your own language. One friend said her teacher gave her a basics of English book early on when studying Japanese.')
