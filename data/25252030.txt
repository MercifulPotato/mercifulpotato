Everybody is paying for your &#x27;free parking&#x27; don&#x27;t pretend that we&#x27;re not.<p>&gt; Trains and busses are fundamentally less convenient and useful than cars<p>This is only true for very low density areas which means low prosperity and opportunity. In any major city it&#x27;s physically impossible to transport the majority of people to their work places in cars and impossible to store those cars for the work day.<p>Studies have shown that people are happy to use what ever transport is available as long as it&#x27;s fast, frequent and cheap. For a high density city with lots of economic opportunities the only way to do it is with trains.<p>&gt; Need to make enough parking available for a building.\nIn an apartment building I used to live in 1&#x2F;3 of the building was parking. That means that each apartment was 1&#x2F;3 more expensive than it needed to be. Even though I didn&#x27;t have a car I still had to pay for the cost of the construction and maintenance of the 7 level car park. Everybody pays the car tax.')
