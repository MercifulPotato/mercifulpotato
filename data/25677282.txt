Sure, some crypto exchanges have fallen, but there have been many many people that stored their funds on their own, improperly, and lost them. I had a friend that kept the keys in plaintext in google drive and lost them.<p>IMO, the average user has weak opsec and is safer to keep crypto on exchanges. Get a good reliable one and use 2FA and you should be fine.<p>I did pretty much all options. Kept the cryptocurrency on paper wallets, multiple exchanges and now on a HW wallet( I use a Trezor) but I don&#x27;t advise this for all.')
