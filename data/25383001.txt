Great idea and the app looks very polished. I&#x27;m really excited for you as I&#x27;ve got a similar story: working on a project on and off for 10 years, first as a hobby offering it for free but last 3 years thought what if I could make it worth my time. I started charging this year and now at a similar MRR. Oh and judging by the currency, also living in the UK. A story like yours really gives me hope and inspires me to keep going so thank you for sharing.')
