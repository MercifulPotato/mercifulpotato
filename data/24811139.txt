I hate the word &quot;career&quot;, and I&#x27;ve never wanted one. When I was about 14 years old, I decided that I needed to avoid a career at all costs. Eventually I understood that entrepreneurship and ownership in a company was the only way I would ever achieve financial freedom. I wanted to (and I still want to) do whatever I want, go wherever I want, whenever I want.<p>&gt; You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. [1]<p>(Naval&#x27;s recent interview with Tim Ferriss was really interesting [2].)<p>I also gave myself a deadline of 10 years. I decided that I would join startups and try to work on my own projects and app ideas. If I ended up with nothing after all this, I would join the workforce and put away my ambitions. I would still try to achieve financial independence the normal way, and perhaps try to retire at 55 instead of 65.<p>Against all odds, I&#x27;ve been able to achieve my goal. I was one of the first employees at a startup that has become a unicorn. The IPO will give me a life-changing amount of money (&gt; $3 million.) While waiting for the IPO, I also founded multiple failed startups and side-projects. I eventually managed to build a modestly successful bootstrapped company. I just reached the point where the income from my startup ($120k) is higher than my initial salary at this unicorn company in San Francisco ($115k). Growth is good and I will probably sell the company for $2 million within the next few years.<p>That&#x27;s my story. If I could go back in time and tell my teenage self something, I would say: shut up, you are completely wrong.<p>I grew up in a country with limited career opportunities for software developers (aka anywhere outside of Silicon Valley.) I had absolutely zero idea that a software developer could earn total compensation of $300k, $500k, $750k, or even $1M per year.<p>If I had known that a career at a FAANG company could pay so much money, I would have told myself to stop wasting time on side projects and work as hard as I can to get my foot in the door at one of these companies, and work my way up to these extremely high salaries. Then I would retire after 8-10 years of extremely high earnings, and I would be much further ahead than I am now.<p>I am an extremely talented programmer. I have been doing it since I was 5 years old. I&#x27;ve never had a job at a FAANG company, but I think I could probably get one.<p>The stress from startups has wreaked havoc on my mental health. The freedom of freelancing and then owning my own source of passive income has ruined me for regular employment. I will never go back to being an employee.<p>If I could do it all over again, I would pour all of my energy into preparing for the Google Technical Interview, then work my way up to a L7 or L8 software engineering position. Part of me wants to do it now, just to see if I could do it.<p>I&#x27;m very happy with how everything turned out, but I walked along the edge of a knife, and I was a dumb teenager who didn&#x27;t know anything. Now I&#x27;m a dumb adult who still doesn&#x27;t know very much.<p>Also I guess everyone already knows that FAANG compensation can extremely high. I only learned about this a couple of years ago, and I struggled to believe it for a long time. I just didn&#x27;t know that $750k in compensation was even <i>possible</i>. The people who earn this much money just work pretty normal hours, and they don&#x27;t deal with a ton of stress.<p>I&#x27;m sure there is a top 0.01% programmer who is reading this while earning  $80k in the mid-west, or €70k in Germany. If you want to make a lot of money and retire quickly, you should consider applying for a job at a FAANG company in the US. Instead of working on your next SaaS idea, it would be better to spend 6 months practicing data structures and algorithms and getting ready for your interview.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;naval&#x2F;status&#x2F;1002103670400417792" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;naval&#x2F;status&#x2F;1002103670400417792</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;naval-ravikant-on-the-tim-ferriss-show-transcript&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tim.blog&#x2F;naval-ravikant-on-the-tim-ferriss-show-tran...</a>')
