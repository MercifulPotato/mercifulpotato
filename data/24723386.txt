That does not translate into Euroskepticism.<p>But Poland would be done without the EU - imagine if &#x27;New Mexico&#x27; were cut off form the US, it would be devastating. It&#x27;s not just the transfer payments, it&#x27;s the trade, quality standards, participation in so many groups, financial networks, zillions of Poles able to work abroad and remit payments, the Poles do not have a sophisticated diplomatic corps so they&#x27;d be starting from &#x27;nothing&#x27; in trying to make international trade deals and nobody would care.<p>From a geo-strategic perspective, Putin &amp; Co. may very well press hard to meddle in their affairs, trying to pull them into the Eurasian Economic Union aka the Neo Russian Empire.<p>So in almost every way, Poland wins tremendously from EU participation and that&#x27;s probably unanimous from every perspective. Arguments between Duda and EU is huff and puff, partly it&#x27;s just populism, partly it&#x27;s negotiation, partly it&#x27;s Duda trying to draw the line at where he believes power is etc. etc. but it&#x27;s not existential - there is zero chance Poland is leaving the EU.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;europeans-credit-eu-with-promoting-peace-and-prosperity-but-say-brussels-is-out-of-touch-with-its-citizens&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;global&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;19&#x2F;europeans-cred...</a>')
