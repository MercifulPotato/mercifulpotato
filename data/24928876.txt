My earliest &quot;tech memory&quot; is from the huge Digital TSR-80 desk computer he bought in 1980. He did a lot of dBase II&#x2F;III&#x2F;IV and Clipper back then, bought a load of PC and Byte magazine and pirated a lot of diskettes. You could say he&#x27;s a quintessential MIS hacker type.<p>Today he&#x27;s responsible for reporting the hell out of a telecom&#x27;s database (Oracle DB for the most part) in a large IT department. He&#x27;s an &quot;expert&quot;, not a manager nor team leader. He does a lot of SQL wrapped in Java spit out by Tomcat (iirc) and uses a deeply customized Eclipse editor. He&#x27;s also created several logistics sw on the side through out the years, launching a couple of startups in the 80s and 90s, mostly for automating shipping and manufacturing processes, and that&#x27;s how he paid for my college degree in CS.<p>I remember when he bought one of the first IBM RISC 6000 computers ever in 1990 (he was even featured in an IBM paid ad-article), loaded with AIX (IBM&#x27;s Unix flavor). I wanted to help him out setting it up or just hack on it, I logged into the console and I asked &quot;how do you edit a file in this thing?&quot; (I was doing PC and DOS back then). He came over and said &quot;I think it&#x27;s called `vi`&quot;. He keyed in `e` or `i` and said &quot;there, now type ESC + :wq to save the file&quot;. It blew my mind. I was 15.')
