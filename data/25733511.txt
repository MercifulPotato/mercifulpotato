It&#x27;s of extreme importance that you should be able to view, and preferably interact with, something posted on a social media service with as little friction as possible â€” which means it has to have a web version, and that all content within must have permanent HTTP URLs. No one will be downloading a client and syncing it to the P2P network to view a post or to comment on one or to like one. This has never worked and never will, because it&#x27;s inevitably a messy experience.<p>ActivityPub is basically as far as one could push the decentralization of social media without severe UX compromises.')
