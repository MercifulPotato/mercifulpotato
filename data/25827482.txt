It&#x27;s very fun...but I&#x27;m not sure if our practice can justify this cost.&quot;&#x27; - Susan (psychiatrist)<p>It just goes to show you how haphazard and lacking of scientific method the psychiatrist field is.<p>&#x27;&quot;And that isn&#x27;t worth something? Prescribing better treatments?&quot;<p>&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; she said, picking at her fingernails. &quot;Not directly. Of course I always have the best interests of my patients in mind, but, you know, it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll pay more if I prescribe Lexapro instead of Zoloft. They won&#x27;t come back more often or refer more friends. So I&#x27;d sorta just be, like, donating this money if I paid you for this thing, right?&quot;&#x27; - Susan again<p>This is an absolutely disgusting response to me. They don&#x27;t care because the costs of shitty treatment - medications that fuck a person up - are externalized, the practitioner&#x2F;psychiatrist doesn&#x27;t have to deal with whatever severe &quot;side&quot; effects the medications they&#x27;ll experiment on a person with.')
