Windows. It was Windows. Outside of what the (much smaller!) Open Source world developed, stuff worked on Windows in the 1990s and practically nothing else.<p>Now I can open a browser and have a 3D sculpting application and nobody needs to care what OS I run. You can denigrate webapps all you want, I won&#x27;t hear you over the sound of how happy I am that I don&#x27;t have to dual-boot with Windows anymore.')
