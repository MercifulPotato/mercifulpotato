I&#x27;m genuinely curious. Looking at Linkedin I see a lot of Ruby jobs in London, some in really top notch companies. To me London seems like a great place to be a Rubyist.\nJust for comparison&#x27;s sake this is from Linkedin (London Metrpoloitan):\nRuby: 1238\nNode: 1940\nPHP: 1332\nRust: 157\nPython: 9208\nGolang: 588 (might be called Go in many jobs though)<p>Conclusion: Ruby on par with php, less popular than Node but not by orders of magnitute, and used way less than Python. But comparing it to web development languages like PHP&#x2F;Node, it&#x27;s right there with them.<p>If anything Ruby is in bad form in mainland Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands) where for whatever reason PHP is king for startups.<p>Now for frameworks:\nRails: 480\nLaravel: 41\nDjango: 535\nSymfony: 164<p>Conclusion: Rails is really up there with any other major framework. Could be that some job posts don&#x27;t mention the framework, but I&#x27;m going with the data we have.<p>Some famous Ruby shops I know are from London: Deliveroo, GoCardless, Funding Circle, Babylon Health. I honestly don&#x27;t see how this is bad.')
