I&#x27;m sure you (and the other people in this thread) care a lot about the firewall exception, but from the perspective of Apple this must&#x27;ve been a non-critical issue at best. I don&#x27;t understand why you assume Apple should&#x27;ve dropped everything and fixed <i>this</i> as soon as it was reported. And clearly, as opposed to what you say, they <i>did</i> take action - otherwise they&#x27;d never have removed it.')
