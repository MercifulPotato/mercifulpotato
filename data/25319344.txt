On the one hand I don&#x27;t think that one should be forced off one&#x27;s land because others could be using it in a more valuable way. However the whole idea of property rights is founded in improvement or creation of value. Abandonment is a thing, and if you do nothing to improve or derive value from land you can lose your property rights in it.')
