I can&#x27;t be convinced that they weren&#x27;t violent, destructive, and plainly, evil, no matter how much other people tell me what to think.<p>Your point is well taken.  I live in a large city.  The area where I live, while mixed, is majority minority.  My own experience was quite different.  No one assaulted teachers from my local school.  I saw no businesses burned.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who was directly impacted by the <i>months</i> of daily BLM protests.<p>Those are <i>my</i> experiences.  Why are <i>you</i> telling me what I should believe?<p>I mirrored my experiences against yours to point out that  your anecdotal experience is not the whole of the story.  Nor is mine.<p>Now for some facts that neither you nor I actually experienced:<p>Where I live there were a few instances of violence <i>against</i> police (and in every single case, nearly all the folks involved were both white and from out of town).<p>There were also numerous instances of police instigating violence against peaceful protestors.<p>There were a few instances of looting, and the police and local government addressed them quickly and harshly, as just about <i>everyone</i>, including the protestors (many of whom were captured on video chasing would-be looters away) was horrified and angered by such actions.<p>There were (and are) violent miscreants who should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  However, those folks were a tiny group compared to those who peacefully protested.<p>When you hear folks say the protests were &quot;mostly&quot; peaceful, they are empirically correct.  Something like 20,000,000 people around the US <i>peacefully</i> protested against police violence.<p>At most, a few thousand people committed acts of violence and vandalism.  Let&#x27;s say there were even 10,000 (a high number, I suspect) folks who committed violent&#x2F;destructive acts alongside the peaceful protests.<p>If that&#x27;s correct, 99.95% of people protested peacefully and 0.05% of folks were violent&#x2F;destructive.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that could be construed as anything other than &quot;mostly peaceful&quot;.  in fact, I&#x27;d characterize it as &quot;overwhelmingly peaceful&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m most certainly <i>not</i> telling you what to think or believe.  Just presenting my own experiences and a few facts.<p>Don&#x27;t take <i>my</i> word for it.  I&#x27;m just some random asshole on the Internet.<p>The facts speak for themselves.')
