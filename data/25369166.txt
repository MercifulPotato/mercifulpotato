The kind of videos I am talking about are not ones discussing some frivolous  lawsuit, they are the ones by wild-eyed zealots ranting about the Constitution that end up hatching plots to kidnap the Governor of their State [1]. The sort of videos that lead to people shooting up a pizza parlor because they believe it&#x27;s the center of a Satanic organization [2].<p>But leaving that aside for a moment, restricting what&#x27;s okay to talk about on YouTube is, by definition, YouTube&#x27;s problem. They can restrict videos uploaded on the platform to be exclusively people wearing pink furry suits if they want.<p>Senators can ask YouTube to try and stop running videos peddling conspiracy theories on their platform, because they believe YouTube (despite the large number of complaints about them) is generally speaking, a responsible and fairminded platform; and they expect that YouTube is broadly trying to do the right thing â€“ <i>not</i> be political, but also crack down on unreasonable crackpot theories being peddled on its platform.<p>Asking this of a less fair-minded source (say the vidoes on a Stormfront website) would be pointless, which is why the Senators don&#x27;t do so. You will notice that the Senators aren&#x27;t asking the creators of Gab to crack down on crackpot theories on their platform either.<p>-----------------------------<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-michigan-whitmer&#x2F;militia-members-others-charged-in-plot-to-kidnap-michigan-governor-she-says-trump-complicit-idUSKBN26T2ZF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-michigan-whitmer&#x2F;militia-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thetwo-way&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;533941689&#x2F;pizzagate-gunman-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;thetwo-way&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;22&#x2F;533941689...</a>')
