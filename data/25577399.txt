Especially when riding a bike next to the forest you&#x27;ll end up on this road because google thinks it&#x27;s a shortcut.<p>Truth is, after 500-600m what remains of the road, more of a path, is totally overgrown and after ~900, ~1300 and ~1700 there are fences (I went for a hike down that path with a friend after repeatedly being guided down that path by google maps).<p>I only use OpenStreetMap for planning my hikes and bicylce routes now.')
