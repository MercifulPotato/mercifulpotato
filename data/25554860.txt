It’s more some specific circles where this is going on.<p>The good thing for those writing such articles is that it’s hard to refute them, as they only discuss the instruction set, not particular designs, and few, if any, people can meaningfully judge how true various claims <i>“this thing my&#x2F;your favorite CPU does is worth&#x2F;not worth the transistors. You’ll see it once advanced designs of my favorite CPU exist”</i> are (even more so because feature A may be worth it for a CPU that also does B, but doesn’t do C, and that has a given power budget)')
