Automatically fixing run-on sentences and removing repeated words is possible. Activating passive sentences is challenging; Grammarly gets it wrong all the time, in my experience. Replacing cliches and fixing wordiness would be very challenging without deep linguistic and cultural knowledge.<p>Well I don&#x27;t know why I was downvoted so heavily. I dont disagree.<p>My goal isn&#x27;t so much to write a novel but rather improve upon my englitch. Now I have chosen writing a novel in order to improve but I dont know where I went wrong.<p>I would love a human editor but that costs $. I doubt anyone is giving me a dime for my book. I don&#x27;t have &gt;$1000 to get my book edited.<p>Of which any hired editor will just shoot themselves.')
