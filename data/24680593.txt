A judge (depending on jurisdiction) might look askance at a complete disclaimer of warranty if an implied commercial relationship can be construed between the entities that provided and used the software (for example, through a donation, or perhaps by contributing employee work).<p>There is probably case law of non-profits being sued for something they provided for free, the NPOSL is trying to protect against that, given that compared to for-profit companies, they are likely to be resource constrained.')
