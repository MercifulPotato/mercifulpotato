E.g. if the device receives a message, does something locally, goes through a clock change, and then sends a message dependent on one it fetched earlier, that&#x27;s a logical order with out-of-order clock.<p>Or if a device gets a message, processes, sends something to another device, that one processes too then sends another message back to the original source, there&#x27;s a logical order but with three different clocks.  Even if the clocks are synchronised, there will be some drift and the messages may be processed fast enough that the drift puts their timestamps out of order.')
