We&#x27;ve received bills that say in large print &quot;Your insurance will not cover this&quot;, then when I call my provider says &quot;Of course we cover it, send us the bill&quot;<p>While the bill is working it&#x27;s way though insurance we&#x27;ll get new bills, every week or so, &quot;We have not received payment and this account will be sent to a collection agency.&quot;   Call the ambulance company and they say &quot;oh nevermind, it&#x27;s marked pending&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a scam. They want to scare you.  They want to scare you out of getting a negotiated insurance rate.  They want to scare you into paying before the insurance comes though.  They want you to have to call them and fight to get your money back after insurance pays')
