The type system is definitely limited and if you compare it to Haskell I understand 100% why you&#x27;d be frustrated. And the docs are overly verbose while simultaneously not being detailed enough.<p>For me, I&#x27;m currently at a point where a lot of these things are „known issues“, and they don&#x27;t affect my day-to-day too much. I think the last time they did matter was during the Java 1.7 -&gt; 8 switch, but I see what you mean.<p>It&#x27;s funny that you mention not being fond of Python &amp; Javascript, because those are the two most &quot;mainstream&quot; alternatives I thought you&#x27;d compare Java to, with plenty of warts themselves.')
