What exact law or regulation in the US Federal Code did they break?<p>The evidence of their malfeasance is plain to see, but malfeasance itself isn&#x27;t illegal - nor is harming the public-at-large indirectly through legal business planning and legal business deals. As it is, I don&#x27;t believe there is a law against establishing corporate sales targets for harmful prescription drugs or fostering an internal company culture that encourages their overprescription. Nor do I believe is it illegal for drugs companies to give unintentionally misleading - or even intentionally misleading - marketing material to doctors and  pharmacists because there&#x27;s so much current legal leeway (for reasons I won&#x27;t get into).')
