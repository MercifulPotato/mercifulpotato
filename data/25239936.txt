I was extremely passionate about their mission and product at first. Company slowly started bringing in external management, and with them, all of their &quot;battle-hardened&quot; management practices. What once used to be a vibrant culture turned into one without transparency, with rampant bullying and &quot;1-up&quot; culture, perpetuated by the CTO (a naive bully, not a leader). They then used their product as a way to inhibit growth in engineering, despite claiming that the product was there to help us grow.<p>The lesson is that if the company shows me that they no longer care about me or my co-workers, and try to pit us against each other, then I immediately stop giving a damn about their mission and product. If you want your employees to &quot;give a shit&quot; then you absolutely must make it clear that you &quot;give a shit&quot; about them, and that they &quot;give a shit&quot; about each other. That startup has a lot to learn. Culture should be motivated by love, not fear. So I have to disagree with the viewpoint put forth by Scale AI.')
