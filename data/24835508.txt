However, to be fair, I would say Red is practically like Rebol v3. Arturo&#x27;s goal is not to become yet another Rebol, but combine its positive aspects (which are <i>a lot</i>) with other features of modern programming languages, mostly functional programming -oriented. Actually, Arturo&#x27;s influences range from Rebol to Ruby, Haskell, Tcl and even Forth or Factor or... Swift.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m all ears for feedback&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;suggestions. Code contributions are more than welcome as well - it&#x27;s been just a one-guy thing so far, and I can honestly not find time for everything :)')
