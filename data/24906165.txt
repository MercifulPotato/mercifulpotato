Not to say that you are wrong, and a lot certainly can be improved, but a couple of things that impressed me (not being from Spain):<p>- Use of x.509 user certificates to access many government services online.\n- Getting a government ID right away at the appointment (from the police of all places)\n- FTTH 600Mbit&#x2F;s symmetrical.
