I first really started recognizing this pattern when I had this sort of episode where it became clear to each and every person around you, that there is something off. It was like I was on cocaine 24&#x2F;7, paired with extreme paranoia (I moved to a rather bad neighborhood in a big city two years before).<p>Ever since this initial awareness and diagnosis, I have stepped back from a lot of people, and many stepped away from me. I was left in a void where I had basically I social interaction.<p>While it was extremely depressing I have the feeling, at least in my case, that less communication can help to find a manageable state. Today it’s easier for me to manage, although still not perfect. I declined any medical treatment except for one dose of Haloperidol which I agreed to after I had freaked out and the police had to tie me down and send me to psychiatry. (As it happened I accidentally ran into a drug handover in the midst of my mania, I was afraid to die and started losing it completely)<p>Nobody really understands the hurricane of feelings one is going through, it doesn’t really make sense to try and explain it to people.')
