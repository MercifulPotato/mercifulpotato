In the early nineties a corporation got in touch with me, they said they were working on a Java IDE and could they ship some of my source as &quot;example projects&quot;.  I thought about it for about six seconds and said &quot;Yes please!&quot;   I think they even mailed me a CD-ROM at some later point.<p>At the time I was thinking &quot;Yay!  I&#x27;m famous!  My code is good!&quot;.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve seen some of my code, not much of course, end up in other big projects and I&#x27;m a little proud, and a little pleased.  The fact that the company got the money and not me?  Doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.<p>I write code for me, and if I get bug reports that prove other people used it then I&#x27;ll try to improve things.  Money just isn&#x27;t a consideration, although I have linked an Amazon wishlist in a few places over the years, and received unexpected books&#x2F;films which make me smile.')
