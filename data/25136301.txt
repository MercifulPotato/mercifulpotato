What we do have is web-first apps that use Electron to provide a desktop experience (like Slack), and desktop-first apps that use Electron as a multi-platform runtime (like VS Code).<p>The first group tends to have webview-based &quot;native&quot; apps and running those on the Mac wouldn&#x27;t realise any of the expected advantages of a native app. The latter group won&#x27;t have any sort of native iOS app to begin with. At any rate, neither of those groups is likely to migrate to native apps because of this move.')
