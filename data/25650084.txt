I explicitly disregarded that by putting in the premise that the hypothetical person is not and will not get burned out with that philanthropy schedule.<p>I could have just as well have written that they made a million a year and only donated 5%—that’s besides (my&#x2F;the) point.<p>I guess we are all so alienated these days that we don’t find working on Wall Street—or Main Street—in order to indirectly help other people with our money instead of helping <i>directly</i> not the least bit <i>weird</i> at all.  Or to help people by working as a programmer <i>and donating a lot of your salary</i> to some school instead of just working there as a teacher, helping people directly (to use another example).
