I&#x27;d point to IBM&#x27;s 360 model 67 which was released in 1967 as the earliest example that I&#x27;m aware of.  A typical use before containerazation was shared hosting.  But people thought of and managed those as servers.  Maybe servers with some scripting, but still servers.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of anyone prior to Google treating them as disposable units that were built and deployed at scale according to automated rules.  There is a significant mind shift from &quot;let&#x27;s give you a pretend server&quot; to, &quot;let&#x27;s stand up a service in an automated way by deploying it with its dependency as a pretend server that you network together as needed&quot;.  And another one still to, &quot;And let&#x27;s create a network operating system to manage all services across all of our data centers.&quot;  And another one still to standardize on a practices that let any data center can go down at any time with no service disruption, and any 2 can go down with no bigger problems than increased latency.<p>Google standardized all of that years before I heard &quot;containerization&quot; whispered by anyone outside of Google.')
