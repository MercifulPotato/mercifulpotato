You get data from every voter.<p>Actually an election is literally a poll in the sense of a sample, you are counting people at &quot;polling stations&quot; in order to gauge the public mood about who should be president.<p>When you see it that way, Nate Silver is predicting a sample of an unknown distribution, the &quot;true&quot; distribution of people&#x27;s preferences.<p>The fact that you can only make one officially binding sample (&quot;the voters&quot;) is a practicality, as is the fact that there&#x27;s an electoral college that means votes have different values. The fact that turnout matters is another issue, a statistician might call it a sampling problem.')
