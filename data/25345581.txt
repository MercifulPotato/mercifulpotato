They&#x27;re a different genre all together.<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like them, or even like them any less in general; I just have a hard time considering them to be Bond movies at all. They&#x27;re so serious, even when being sarcastic and dry. They&#x27;re not <i>fun</i>, and not something I probably would have been excited to binge watch as a kid, as the other ones are&#x2F;were. I try hard to convince myself this is just temporal bias, but I&#x27;m less convinced the more I think about it.<p>And I still can&#x27;t wrap my head around the fact that Goldeneye and Casino were directed by the same person.<p>I say this as someone who has 4 different actors in my top 5 Bond movie list, and none are Craig. So probably not a popular opinion- but also as someone who&#x27;s never read any of the books, but seen every movie multiple times.<p>Then again, I also consider Brave Little Toaster to be a better version of Toy Story 3, for almost opposite reasons, while I still consider TS3 to be objectively the best Pixar-formula movie made. (Unless counting the first 10 mins of Up as it&#x27;s own entity.)')
