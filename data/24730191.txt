Accounting for the accepted use of the higher heat value (because inefficiency via heat can be redirected back into the system to create the steam required by the catalyst), average working efficiencies for PEM electrolysis are around 80%. This is expected to increase to between 82â€“86% before 2030 [1].<p>It is to store peak renewable energy (negative price), and to achieve Zero Carbon by 2050 (no natural gas).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrolysis_of_water#Industrial_output" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electrolysis_of_water#Industri...</a>')
