Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605714561, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137068, text='&gt; Just triggered a thought - what&#x27;s so special about &quot;what&#x27;s going on in the world&quot;, especially when the majority of what people focus on with social media will never affect them and at best is the equivalent of local gossip.<p>I came to this conclusion years and years ago, when I stopped watching TV news because of ads, but had the unintended side effect that I became <i>more</i> informed about the world (because I had more time to invest in reading true journalism). When I tell people I don&#x27;t watch the news, they scoff and claim I&#x27;m ignorant. I ask them what the most important thing was in the news two weeks ago. They never can tell me.')
