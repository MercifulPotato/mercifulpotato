Item(by='Lev1a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612099997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978451, text='&gt; I live in Europe and in my experience a stone in a wedding ring is very uncommon.<p>My parents married in the GDR during early-mid 80s, for them big diamond rings were definitely out (since one wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get one anyway) and AFAICT they still really like their old wedding rings from back then: gold, not that wide, the surface looks kinda woven and each ring has three or four tiny specks of diamond integrated into the weaving pattern of the gold.<p>OT:<p>Growing up watching TV series&#x27; from abroad (US, UK etc.) I always wondered why people would throw around huge amounts of money for engagement rings (i.e. not even the real wedding ring), then spend thousands or more likely tens of thousands on a wedding, hundreds or more likely thousands on a wedding dress (which will only be worn for one day anyway) and on and on...<p>It just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me spending such a huge amount of money making a committed relationship <i>official</i> when what actually matters is the sentiment between the significant others not some pathetic posturing in front of &quot;friends and family&quot;.')
