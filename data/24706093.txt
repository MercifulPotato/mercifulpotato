I use it primarily to store various torrents (up to ~250GB each).<p>I have had my torrent client find single-chunk errors in a couple of torrents I was seeding (twice over a few TB worth of torrents). I recall reading ZFS filesystem over NFS is particularly prone to this. I did some worried searching and remember finding it was likely caused by memory errors being persisted to disk, but I don&#x27;t have any links handy anymore.<p>I likely would not have noticed the corruption if the torrent client hadn&#x27;t alerted me.')
