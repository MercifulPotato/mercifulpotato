Communications freedom is basically my main political issue, but I&#x27;ve had a really hard time caring about <i>The Purge</i>. It seems basically inevitable after what occurred.<p>What is happening with Big Tech is the same arc as many other instances of American exploitation - an industry springs up around some type of obvious exploitation, but everybody speaking out about it is ignored because they&#x27;re preaching against business expedience (eg the handful of HN users talking about centralized webapps being a bad idea for the past decade, outnumbered by those with get rich quick startup dreams). Finally the externalities grow too great to ignore and the industry finds itself in an untenable position (financially and socially). The innovative exploiters retreat, while those that bought into the system fight to preserve the status quo, creating a pleb-vs-pleb political issue while the initial exploiters have simply moved on to creating a new manner of exploitation. Even <i>slavery</i> fits this general pattern, and we&#x27;re still suffering the mess today.<p>One question I&#x27;ve been pondering is if polarization&#x2F;propagandization (foreign or domestic) is even possible at the scale we&#x27;re observing without these centralized watering holes? It&#x27;s really big tech &quot;social media&quot; that offers this promise of unsophisticated users connecting with socially-distant low-reputation nyms as if they are other good-faith individuals (ie non-Sybil), essentially filling in the companies own reputation in their place. High fanout bad faith actors (political demagogues) will always exist, but it takes an impedance-matching middle layer creating social proof to enable them at such scale. It feels like that would be harder to pull off if people were only connected to closer nodes by default. Although this is probably a hypothetical question now that such structure has already been created.')
