These two features are often overlooked and people just ask &quot;why do you even have so many pages?&quot; and it ends there because nobody wants to entertain the power user.<p>A third disadvantage I&#x27;ve seen is search. I use fuse to generate a JSON for client side search but it takes a lot of memory to render and is a cause for concern.')
