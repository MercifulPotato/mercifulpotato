You would need a plugin that allows mapping to a local mail dir or a plugin that has an imap library to fetch updates and validate GPG signature.  Or maybe use a plugin that talks to Tor relays?  This is all hypothetical of course.  I am not factoring in legal consideration and risk to the developers.')
