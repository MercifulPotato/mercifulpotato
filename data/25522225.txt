I use them mostly for exploratory data analysis. It’s great for being able to view multiple graphs at the same time, tweak some parameters and see what changes. Then of course being able to easily share your findings. I agree as a development environment it has a lot of drawbacks. Hard to debug and global variables galore. I don’t view them as an end to end solution but as one step in the workflow')
