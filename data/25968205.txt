The previous release was in 2016, so I was sure that XQuartz was dead for good. Nice to be pleasantly surprised!<p>I occasionally use XQuartz to run graphical programs over SSH using X forwarding, although Iâ€™ve mostly moved on to other approaches due to a combination of:<p>1. Bad support for HiDPI displays (theoretically fixable in XQuartz - curious if they will tackle it now).<p>2. Annoyingly high input and redisplay latency (probably not fixable, just an inherent property of the very chatty X protocol).<p>Still nice to have the option.')
