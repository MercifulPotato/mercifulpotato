Those are just the things I specifically remember.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be misleading though, claiming &quot;full gigabit&quot; might be a bit hyperbolic of me.<p>By &quot;full gigabit&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean &quot;exactly 1Gbps&quot;, but I&#x27;m easily able to reach the same speed to an external network as I&#x27;m able to obtain within my ISP&#x27;s network.<p>For example right now if I run a speedtest to my ISP&#x27;s Speedtest.net server, I see 820Mbps. If I run an iperf3 test to my Feralhosting server, I see 820Mbps. If I run a iperf3 test to my Hetzner server, I see 894Mbps.<p>It&#x27;s not technically right at the 1Gbps that I pay for but it&#x27;s close enough that I&#x27;m generally happy.')
