They should have to use a term like &quot;license&quot; or even &quot;borrow&quot; to drive home that you&#x27;re not paying for unfettered ownership.<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying about preventing copying being impossible without DRM, but I think you overestimate the prevalence of unauthorized copying, at least when the convenience and cost of purchasing a legal copy is reasonable enough.<p>DRM has other bad societal effects, like locking up works beyond their copyright expiration, and causing people to lose access to those works if the company goes out of business (for DRM systems that require periodic license refreshes).  DRM also generally disallows all legal copying under fair use terms.<p>I think the only way that I&#x27;d be even <i>remotely</i> comfortable with DRM is if companies using it were required to place their DRM keys in escrow; if the company ever decides to stop offering the service, or simply goes out of business, those keys should be released to the public.  And companies should be required to remove DRM from works when its copyright expires.  Even with all that, though, I&#x27;d still find DRM undesirable.')
