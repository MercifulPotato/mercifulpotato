Microsoft tried it with the Windows Phone. Samsung and Huawei still have desktop modes in their phones.<p>Google kinda explored the idea in some developer settings but the Pixel phones don&#x27;t even support HDMI out via USB-C.<p>Just like the Nintendo Switch allows us to play video games on the go and on the big screen with one device, I want to finally have a smartphone &#x2F; tablet which makes a laptop obsolete.<p>Just plug it into a dock and start using a monitor, mouse and keyboard.
