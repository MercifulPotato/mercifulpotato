The analogy with a black hole suggests that money disappears with no good.<p>Donating to cost-effective charities directly and significantly improves the quality of life for numerous individuals. Just because you don&#x27;t &quot;solve the whole problem&quot; with your donations doesn&#x27;t mean it shouldn&#x27;t be done. Just like you don&#x27;t choose to stop eating because eating a single meal won&#x27;t satisfy your hunger for the next 30 years.')
