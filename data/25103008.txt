For example, there&#x27;s a Wordpress plugin that lets your Wordpress site act as an IndieAuth identity[1].  That makes it pretty usable from and end-user perspective.<p>The challenge with centralized is that it is a single point of failure.  The original post was more focused on &quot;If you get locked out of google, you get locked out of everything&quot;.  In that vein if promise gets hacked&#x2F;bought&#x2F;abandoned&#x2F;changes it&#x27;s business model etc.. then you lose all your accounts.  The anonymous nature of it is great, but this is something Apple already offers with their sign-in with apple which is already widely supported and with the proxy-email solution you can still be contacted by the sites you&#x27;re signing up with.<p>I got interested in IndieAuth because of a project of mine[2], trying to make it really easy for everyone to self-host their facebook&#x2F;twitter equivalent with direct control over who has access.  This runs into the problem with wide adoption where you have a separate credential for each of your friends&#x27; blogs.  With IndieAuth built into the self-hosted platform, then your own self-hosted site becomes the one credential you can use on all your friends&#x27; sites.  Self-hosted distributed identity for privacy AND ease-of-use.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;indieauth&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wordpress.org&#x2F;plugins&#x2F;indieauth&#x2F;</a>\n[2] You can find the link in other comments I&#x27;ve made on HN')
