It&#x27;s a shame Microsoft hasn&#x27;t invested more into it, especially as there was talk of making CC an integral part of the C# syntax (as in, first-class support for `pure` functions in C# and a succinct syntax for attaching them as invariants&#x2F;etc to C# types and methods). If this was done it would solve so many problems (e.g. compiler-enforced guarantees about which navigation-properties on Entity Framework entities are loaded) and maybe even elevate C# to compete with Ada and Eiffel for safety-critical systems!')
