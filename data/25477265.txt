They wouldn’t brazenly do this by shutting down access completely, but they are doing this via throttling and I could see rate limiting certain services in the future unless you pay more, etc.  Or Comcast can exempt itself from data caps.<p>At the end of the day, the owner of the pipe that comes into your house or the wireless signals has the technical power to control what comes in and out and at what cost.  Which is why it should be a publicly owned utility.')
