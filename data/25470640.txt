Yet we never bust out concrete code. It&#x27;s funny.<p>But the outcome that you&#x27;re lambasting so rudely (really? &quot;terrible idea&quot; when we aren&#x27;t even looking at code?) is still often the best outcome.<p>Some rotting, bugless, duplicated code is some of the easiest code to work with. It&#x27;s the code you wish you had when you&#x27;re debugging the complicated failing abstraction that GP wanted to avoid. The most damning thing you yourself could say about it is that it was taking up space.<p>In fact, you seem to be making the exact reverse argument of GP: that some duplicated, unabstracted, bugless code poses such a risk (&quot;rot&quot;) that it&#x27;s a &quot;terrible idea&quot; to not immediately merge it into one frankenabstraction.<p>When this happens in an argument, usually you both are imagining an absurd extreme that&#x27;s opposite of the other&#x27;s chosen extreme. And you actually are in agreement, as you&#x27;d both go &quot;oh well yeah, if you go to <i>that</i> extreme, then I&#x27;d definitely agree with you.&quot;')
