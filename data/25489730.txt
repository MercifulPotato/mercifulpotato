We will never ever make things like video games open source. But we can sandbox them. Even open source tools could do with being sandboxed.<p>I don&#x27;t see why this is an issue. The user still has full power to do anything and its is only programs which are restricted. Under the new model, instead of a tool just grabbing your screen, it must now make a request to the OS which will show a popup asking if you want to allow access and if you accept the program can continue as it would have before.')
