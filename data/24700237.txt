There is a higher good than low prices for consumers.<p>Consolidation destroys small business and the ability of the average American to support themselves through independent, private enterprise. All 5 of the FAANG companies have caused consolidation in tech, retail and other verticals, and they are acting as private regulators to manipulate the markets. I don&#x27;t want 5 companies controlling my destiny, and I can&#x27;t figure why any rational person would, even if you genuinely see yourself as a consumer.')
