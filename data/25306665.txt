Their affordable SoC&#x27;s powered the Lenovo Duet into being one of the most compelling affordable Chromebook Tablets of the year. They&#x27;ve also mentioned plans to put more powerful chips into chromebooks in 2021.<p>ARM powered chromebooks run Android apps far better than their x86 cousins plus still include linux support (crostini) which has a growing set of ARM applications every year.<p>I&#x27;m pretty excited for where the future of efficient computing is going.  Between my M1 Mac Mini and overclocked Pi4 8GB I&#x27;ve managed to sell off and move on from x86 machines for personal use.  Interesting times indeed.')
