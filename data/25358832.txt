Gatsby inlines critical css and small images and does just about every trick available to minimize page load, then the plugin kills the hydration. The plugin can run on a per page basis, so you can still keep your hydration on your pages that need them. For complex webapps that also have marketing&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;landing pages, it&#x27;s a really nice combo.<p>Gatsby devs or advocates would argue removing the js removes the preloading of pages that helps make Gatsby faster.
