Boxy UI elements (notably tabs); elements of different sizes in the same container; too much whitespace in some places; generally not enough whitespace in most places (bookmark folders&#x2F;menus in general&#x2F;the whole area around the location bar); elements that change size (the location bar); etc. I don&#x27;t like customizable UIs; it seems to lead to less attention being paid to the default UI. I don&#x27;t want to invest in configuring a UI; I just want it to work. Themes degrade over time as they&#x27;re not maintained. Font rendering is worse than Chrome; colors are different from Chrome (I can&#x27;t claim that one is right, but it&#x27;s a jarring difference when comparing them, and I&#x27;m used to Chrome). Firefox doesn&#x27;t have a polished UI, and its whole job is to be a UI for other content.')
