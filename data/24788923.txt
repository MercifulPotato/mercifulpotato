They are driven by algorithms that prioritize certain information over others. Such algorithmic prioritizations are not platforms for free speech and removing harmful content from these algorithmcally-generated feeds is not the same as censoring speech in the domain of free discourse.<p>Given YouTube&#x27;s algorithmically-generated feed, removing certain harmful content is more accurately identified as curation than censorship.')
