The local DSL company was really bad until this year (I wonder why...), but it’s still $70 a month for up to 50 meg and I believe it has a cap. Until this year it was the same price for up to 15mb&#x2F;s, which in the evening meant more like 1mb&#x2F;s.<p>I’m on some hotspot plans that are no longer available that have no caps, but I’m pretty lucky with the speeds I get.  For me it’ll depend on what speeds Starlink gets in my area, and I might keep one hotspot anyways as it’s handy to have.')
