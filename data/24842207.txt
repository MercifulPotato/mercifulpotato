Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603226781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836422, text='&gt; A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage — but who can&#x27;t find one — is unemployed. If you accept that definition, the true unemployment rate in the U.S. is a stunning 26.1%<p>But they actually <i>measured</i> &quot;isn&#x27;t paid a living wage&quot; (by their definition), and just <i>assumed</i> &quot;looking, but can&#x27;t find one&quot;.  That assumption is absolutely false - high school kids, college kids, independently wealthy, non-working spouses, and retired people.  The article&#x27;s methodology doesn&#x27;t implement their definition.  The conclusions are therefore worthless by their own standard.')
