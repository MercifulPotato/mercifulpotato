GH Actions has been reliable for me, but it tends to be rather slow due to the architecture. Also I feel like this would chew up all my build mins pretty quick (this is 8000+ runs&#x2F;month).<p>Side note, I find it hilarious how many sites use those generic &quot;modern&quot; illustrations which have absolutely nothing to do with the service or page context. I know it&#x27;s tempting to keep up with the modern design trends, but picking from one of those illustration packs almost always leads to questionable choices.')
