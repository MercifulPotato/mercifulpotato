The bigger the pot of money, the more resilient the community.<p>So actually, health insurance has a long legacy. The problem, I would suggest, is shareholders who are not the principal beneficiaries of the service.<p>FWIW, in the UK we found that a system of mutuals and municipally owned hospitals was sufficiently imperfect that we created the NHS anyway. Probably best to skip to single-payer in the US, imo.')
