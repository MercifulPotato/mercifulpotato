He had a cartoon on his office wall, later relocated to his office at home, which depicted two priests having a conversation beneath the image of a very famous prophet being tortured (honestly, it doesn&#x27;t matter which prophet).<p>One priest is saying to the other, &quot;He was a great teacher, but he didn&#x27;t publish.&quot;<p>My dad had a stress-related heart attack at 50, which he survived, and he semi-retired to a part-time professorship at a different university so that he could continue to work with grad students, which he loved doing.')
