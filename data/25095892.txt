How many games do the rename trick correctly when they save? I bet it’s less than half.<p>The behaviour should be that if power goes out while saving, the game either updated the save file or it didn’t. Saving should be atomic. That’s the best we can do, and what the user should expect if power goes out before it’s finished saving the game.')
