My 2 golden nuggets are:<p>- Find out if you can diagnose with the Big 5 whether you&#x27;d be more of a fit with someone (or in my case: the HEXACO model -- a derivative of the Big 5). In my case: I need someone who scores quite high to extremely high on openness. My whole strategy on finding an amazing girlfriend always revolves around this. So far, I&#x27;m 4 years in :)<p>- Read up on assorted mating theory (check the wiki, just a few paragraphs)<p>When you have the right approach, finding an amazing partner is actually really easy, albeit there&#x27;s work to do.<p>For more inspiration see also [1]. What I took away from this talk is not that she went all techy on it, but that she made a very clear strategy on how to find her life partner. It&#x27;s the best example I could find of that it&#x27;s quite easy (but hard work), when you have an approach that works for you.<p>Finding an approach that works for you is the toughest part.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;amy_webb_how_i_hacked_online_dating&#x2F;transcript" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com&#x2F;talks&#x2F;amy_webb_how_i_hacked_online_datin...</a>')
