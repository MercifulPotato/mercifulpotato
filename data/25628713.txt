In the worst case it might even be used as evidence that your work is a fraud.<p>There is no benefit; To the lay person, It would sound just as impressive to say &quot;We trained a machine learning model to detect ads and spyware&quot; and that wouldn&#x27;t immediately set off alarm bells with people familiar with the current state of machine learning.<p>Second: Talking about fraud, the evidence linked above is pretty strong.<p>Their alleged  AI is somehow detecting test domains that authors of other lists as &quot;ads or spyware&quot;. Test domains that aren&#x27;t linked anywhere on the internet.<p>In one &quot;smoking gun&quot; example, the test domain doesn&#x27;t even have a DNS entry. The alleged AI can&#x27;t even load the domain to scan it.')
