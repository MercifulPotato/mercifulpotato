Item(by='alanfranz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601760940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24672718, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see them immediately realizing that filling out Google reviews would leave them exposed in such a way.<p>I have that kind of family members as well. But they don&#x27;t leave reviews on Google Maps, because they wouldn&#x27;t know how to do that or why. And their home address is still on the White Pages, so.... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem for them.<p>The question is: is there somebody who is a) able to use Google Maps - which implies a rough understanding of how it works - and b) able to leave reviews about a place they have been, that is then unable to realize that a review says &quot;I have been there at that time&quot; and that multiple reviews may suggest the (approximate) place where they live?')
