You can dedicate a very small DSP with the block to feed and manage it. I haven&#x27;t been involved in a new chip design in a few years, but a lot of specialized cores were vector processors (very narrowly defined vector processors). I don&#x27;t know if that has changed.<p>I find it surprising that you have a graphics card that won&#x27;t decode new video formats, unless the vendor has completely abandoned support for it. I have never encountered a modern graphics card that wasn&#x27;t completely configured and run with firmware.')
