No homeless, no open drug use...all protected by private property laws and private security. Get ready for more of them. It doesn&#x27;t matter what laws you will pass, you don&#x27;t get past the front gate unless your card scans.<p>In the end, the only people who will be forced to look at open drug use and homelessness will be people who can&#x27;t afford to buy a unit in a SafeStreets(tm) community (YC Winter 25!).<p>edit since HN is rate-limiting me: my point is, you aren&#x27;t going to be happy with the response everyone-else has to social-engineering legislation they don&#x27;t agree with. If you don&#x27;t want more inequality and social divisions, stop giving people a reason to build a moat.')
