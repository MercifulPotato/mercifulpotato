You do end up with very small percentages for ingredients like yeast, but in general it’s nice because you can easily see for instance how sweet a recipe is based on how much sugar is added as a percentage of the total flour.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baker_percentage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baker_percentage</a>')
