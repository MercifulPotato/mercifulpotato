And the war on drugs has been a huge success.<p>&gt; Why don&#x27;t we have world wide privacy laws?<p>The Internet makes trying to enforce world wide privacy laws much harder than physical laws: anyone in the world can reach you and collect data about you.<p>&gt; Just make it outright illegal and fine heavily per violation. You have profile information that a user didn&#x27;t explicitly give you? $10k fine, each.<p>How do you propose to discover violations? Self-reporting won&#x27;t ever happen.
