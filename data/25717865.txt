If so, then why do you hope to be wrong about it eventually disappearing?<p>I still believe in the merits of free speech as regards reasoned good-faith open debate and communication, what has changed is that it is now clear to me that bad-faith propaganda without regard for reason cannot be countered by reason, and that such communication is in fact significantly dangerous.<p>&gt; Even if I agreed with this [that misinformation can&#x27;t be countered with reason] —which I don&#x27;t— the answer to this hypothetical reality is definitely not to start removing actual information.<p>If recent events haven&#x27;t convinced you, I honestly don&#x27;t know what will. I don&#x27;t see any way around having to remove the underlying (mis)information in order to prevent its spread. Events have shown that merely tagging misinforamtion as such is not effective, and that&#x27;s without getting into an argument about who gets to judge what is and isn&#x27;t misinformation.<p>&gt; Do you have historical evidence to back up this claim?<p>You mean aside from the increasingly violent divisiveness of politics in the past dozen years? Not really. I&#x27;m not intending to prove it exhaustively in my post so much as to say that it seems like it might be the case. I welcome evidence to the contrary.<p>&gt; All in all, my hope is that we find easier, better ways for people to fact check, instead of removing data wholesale.<p>People have many methods to fact check right now, but it has been shown that people prefer to ignore information that runs counter to what they want to be true. People can be lead to water but can&#x27;t be made to drink, it seems. Indeed, the information age has made fact checking more accessible than it has ever been in history, yet we have seen recently that people will attempt to overthrow the government based on outright fabrication and even call for the hanging of an otherwise politically aligned individual for disagreeing with them.')
