Countries with high amount of bribing tend to also be countries with large off-the-record economies, therefore I am skeptical of that proposition.<p>FYI in the US, you can claim tax deductibility on bribes paid in foreign countries <i>iff</i> they are not legally classified as bribes in the respective <i>local</i> laws.')
