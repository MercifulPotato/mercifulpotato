Soldiers don&#x27;t have the right to quit if they don&#x27;t like the working conditions. But many people actually sign up (or re-up) for the money, to pay off student loans, etc.<p>Look man, if you don&#x27;t want me comparing nurses to the military, then don&#x27;t bring it up in the first place (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25213289" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25213289</a>)<p>&gt; This is what the army does, it works fine.<p>Your words, not mine. Find a better comparison. And no, I don&#x27;t think your &quot;helicopter pilot&quot; argument is serious at this point. There&#x27;s no way you actually consider helicopter pilots as important as nurses right now.<p>-----------<p>&gt; Nursing isn&#x27;t some kind of uniquely difficult occupation. If a pilot can learn to fly helicopters commercially in a year then I would propose that we can train people to do this, too.<p>If a nurse quits on their job, then their patients die. You can&#x27;t just get &quot;another nurse&quot; to do their job (those nurses are also overworked and busy).<p>If a helicopter pilot quits their job, their passengers need to wait a few more days to find a new pilot.<p>I have my doubts you&#x27;re serious with the helicopter discussion point. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you&#x27;re trying to prove.')
