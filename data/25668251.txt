There&#x27;s a very large amount of over-valued houses in and around the larger cities in Denmark. If the property value goes down, so does the property taxes, which means less income for the local authorities.<p>There are cheap houses available outside those areas, but getting a loan for them can be tricky since their value is too low and there&#x27;s no money to be had from lending the money.<p>Furthermore, most people have their homes as security (not sure if it&#x27;s the right word in English) for their loans. If the property value drops then many will be forced out of their homes. Also a lot of landlords and real-estate agents, will be out of a job, but that&#x27;s probably a smaller issue.')
