Right now, our time system conveys implicit information about the &quot;solar time of day&quot; (whether or not its daylight in the locale) as well as season (January is winter in the Northern Hemisphere). For monotonic time, you would have to use some sort of conversion function to recoup that information. As we both noted, certain monotonic time systems could be used which deviate very little from solar time such that the accumulated error would only make a difference (for the purpose of recouping that aforementioned implicit information) at very large time scales, which is a problem we already face with inflation (1950s dollars are not the same value as 2021 dollars and we all seem to manage alright with that).')
