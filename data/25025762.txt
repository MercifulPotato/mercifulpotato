For all of my cars so far I have upgraded the radio to support Bluetooth audio. I don&#x27;t really need anything else. So far I&#x27;ve been able to choose from a wide variety of aftermarket head units or OEM units from other models. The aftermarket units are usually possible with an adapter to make it look nice, but it&#x27;s not strictly necessary. I get the feeling the interfaces are reverse engineered, though.<p>When I see new car systems they look like a nightmare to upgrade. Maybe you&#x27;ll be lucky and someone reverse engineers the interface but maybe not.<p>Many parts on cars do have standard sizes, but many do not. It would be nice if there was something like the ATX standard for cars. But maybe it would make cars cost twice as much and be less efficient? Who knows.')
