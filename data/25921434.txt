Don&#x27;t have personal mind reading  AI so it can type text for me. Sorry for errors :)<p>So technicaly it is possible to rewrite that it can read what thoughts person can have. Atleast those repeatedly ones.<p>Situation: man suicide bomber at airport. His thoughts &quot;push the button. Not now. Wait a bit. That guy is looking at me wtf Im gonna blow. You chikenshit. Im pushing Im pushing Im gonna push. Do I got Likes on facebook. I forgot my notes at pancakes shop with phone number I need to call for instructions. Mom forgive me.&quot;\nSo AI reads brain waves randomly selected persons and Lest say picks this guy because of one his thought then analises second by using examples alarm goes to security.<p>Another thing can you share on github the code? I would like to make my own machine for my mind reading. I could manage to create just upgraded machine for my needs, so it could serve me coffe when I want or play me a song when I have sutch thoughs or answer my phone for me if my hands are bussy but it&#x27;s important etc. Or call to someone if I have thoughts that I miss that person but somehow I am not on the mood to dial the number.<p>(This AI tech could be helpfull in lockdown. People are going crazy, loliness etc. Even if all will go crazy then AI in home automation system can call psichiatric free line to help and to get up. Or call the police or the ambulance before the accident. In the lunatic hospital it can be usefull to call the nurse or to know condition of the pacient because he is a pacient and not telling the truth what on his mind. And to control all the humanity it can be used too. What to think, what to do futurism-totalitarism)<p>For a free marketing ideas you could share with me the repo.<p>For a repo I could send you my amazon echo. Still it&#x27;s an oldschool if to compare with your AI.')
