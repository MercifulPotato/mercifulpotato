Being a journalist can&#x27;t be defined by the willingness of the subjects to be covered. That&#x27;s stenography.<p>&gt; If it&#x27;s a side gig you don&#x27;t intend to make a living doing, you&#x27;re very likely not a journalist.<p>So belief in anything is evidence that you aren&#x27;t a journalist. Journalists are defined by their income.')
