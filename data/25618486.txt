I recall reading a document written by the (then-current) lead dev on the project outlining the criteria used to assess C++&#x27;s suitability for the project. He conceded that Ada was the superior choice in most every aspect except for the ease of finding developers. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find that document now. If anyone knows the document I&#x27;m referring to and could point me to it, I&#x27;d appreciate it. I thought I had it saved.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II_development#Program_cost_overruns_and_delays" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning...</a>')
