It&#x27;s a really old MMO at this point but still has a niche following. New community shards are still popping up and some of them (such as UO Outlands) have high populations.<p>I opened up a Patreon for the project in hopes that the community and the shard owners would support me enough to keep working on it but I never got past 100 euros per month in pledges. The app does have a stable userbase of around 1000 users though.<p>Even though it wasn&#x27;t a financial success by any measure, I&#x27;m really proud to have brought my childhood favourite game to new platforms.')
