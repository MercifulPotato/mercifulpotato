If you have trouble finding answers to your questions I can give them to you. I won&#x27;t call you a cuck and will engage in a proper debate. Even though I don&#x27;t subscribe to all of Trump&#x27;s policies I&#x27;m a right winger and a conservative. Another point to note: I don&#x27;t subscribe to all of Trump&#x27;s policies because the right wing in America is different from right wing in my country in many respects. But there is sufficient overlap to be able to say I can agree to many of the conservative points in US politics as well. So if you have questions regarding my ideology fire away and I&#x27;ll try my best to answer.')
