Item(by='pietrovismara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604935936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25035386, text='Because a small company, by definition, doesn&#x27;t earn millions and usually has very small margins (if none, if they&#x27;re still in the startup phase). A large company can definitely afford to contribute more.<p>&gt; Like I said, go ahead and offer free commercial licenses to small companies, who in your estimation are 99% of developers.<p>Offering commercial licenses adds a lot of work on top of the already difficult development of OSS projects.\nI don&#x27;t understand why you think that the situation can be fixed using existing solutions, when the problem arised with these solutions already in place.<p>Perhaps we need something different??<p>Edit: I also completely reject the notion that everything should be commercialized. OSS is the antithesis of this. Down with commercial licenses, down with rich capitalists exploting people&#x27;s voluntary work.')
