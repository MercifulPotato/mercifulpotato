Item(by='trident1000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601820018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24679050, text='Thats such an absurd opinion.  People live in suburbs because you can raise a family at an affordable price point and not have your children see people shitting on the sidewalk.  People also dont want to live around millions of people in close proximity if they can afford it.  I lived in NYC for 10 years and its a complete trap that you can&#x27;t escape because you dont have the logistics or financial means to move out (and I had a white collar job in finance).  I had to get very well off before I could move out.  Thats the primary reason cities become over-crowded.  Its a one way street especially if you&#x27;re single.  Not because they&#x27;re so great.')
