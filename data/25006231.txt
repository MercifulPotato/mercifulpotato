That way, I can know how my class is doing. My students can understand where their performance falls short. And their parents want to know how the class is going along the way.<p>Cheating on exams is only a problem for that last one, the parents seeking to know how their children are performing. If the educator isn&#x27;t providing credentials, it&#x27;s not a problem if someone cheats. They&#x27;ll get less education, but that&#x27;s their problem, not the educator&#x27;s.')
