My home is still predominantly Z-Wave, but I never got on the hidden-relay bandwagon for lights.  All of my lights which are on the Z-Wave network are wall switches, so they work as dumb switches if the controller is down.  Number 1 rule, do not ever rely on the controller for basic on&#x2F;off operation.<p>But I agree with his points about maintaining the network.  It&#x27;s a pain to add new devices.  I bought a bunch of new switches, and they&#x27;re all Kasa WiFi switches.  Easier to set up, more responsive than Z-Wave, and a lot cheaper.<p>Perhaps the one downside is that a WiFi device by definition has one less (really big) hurdle to become Internet-connected.  So I did have to be careful with my WiFi configuration and firewall rules.  But I&#x27;ll take that trade-off.  The experience has been far superior.')
