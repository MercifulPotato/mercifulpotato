Item(by='arcturus17', descendants=None, kids=[25751655], score=None, time=1610476043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25750329, text='I&#x27;ve been developing web apps in Node for a couple years and I&#x27;m done with it - I&#x27;m all in on Django + DRF now.<p>I only made the switch a couple months ago and it&#x27;s amazing how cozy I am with it: everything feels mature, stable and reliable. I reach out for 3rd party packages as needed but it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m gluing a Frankenstein together, or that I&#x27;m rolling out a bunch of code I don&#x27;t want to own, or that I&#x27;m overthinking for the umpteenth time how I should structure my app. I think after a couple months with Django I&#x27;m nearly as productive as I ever was Node.js. Granted that many web dev concepts just carry over, but the feeling is uncanny regardless.<p>Also, the &quot;language context switch penalty&quot; is a complete myth. I picked up Django by reading two books in 2-3 days, and didn&#x27;t need to even bother front-loading Python - I just picked it up as I went. I now switch between Python and JS&#x2F;React seamlessly; I enjoy writing both and I really like the variety (though as dynamic, duck-typed languages maybe they&#x27;re not that dissimilar). Every thousand characters I type in Python I&#x27;ll make a silly mistake where I write some JS syntax and that&#x27;s it - hardly what I&#x27;d a call a cognitive penalty.<p>As it stands, I&#x27;d only develop something in Node.js if I really needed its performance characteristics (and then, I may be able to get close to them with Python&#x27;s asyncio - though I haven&#x27;t researched this avenue yet so there may be pitfalls I&#x27;m not aware of).<p>All in all, I find it baffling that in over a decade of existence Node.js hasn&#x27;t produced a web framework that even comes close to Django or Rails.<p>I do wish OP, Nest, Prisma and all the devs in the Node ecosystem the best of luck nevertheless. I love JavaScript and if someone produces a web framework that really emphasizes developer productivity and happiness I would consider coming back in the future.')
