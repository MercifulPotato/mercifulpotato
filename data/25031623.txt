(we didn&#x27;t really need another PC in the house, but he wanted to build another)  Christmas school holidays approaching quick -- wanted to find an interesting&#x2F;useful online linux course for him to do during holidays.<p>What are contemporary course recommendations?    I&#x27;ve seen a lot of lame stuff, especially course that just cram lots of incantations down your throat.  Any recommendations for a course that is interesting and sets up the initial seed that will allow him to later move in whatever direction he wants with it. (For example recently I heard him speculating perhaps the box could help him do streaming, etc)')
