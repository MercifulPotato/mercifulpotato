I rmeber thebfounder of duck duck go saying lack of PII made little difference to him - someone is searching for &quot;PC Monitor&quot; then the range of ads seems pretty obvious.  Is this true in &quot;persuasive&quot; mode? Are there bidders trying to serve political ads or lingerie when I search for a monitor?  How can you tell?<p>- is this a zero sum arms race ? A study I cannot find should that Political races are decided by who the public prefers not by total spend.  Congressional races showed that if ad spend was matched the winner stayed consistent - it&#x27;s only when one side out spent the other did ads have an effect.  If I am outraged by ad X do ai also get served the anti-X advert? Would it work if I was?\n(this is the equalicalent of how many adverts saying fruit and vegetables are good for you outweighs adverts for sugary drinks?  There is probably a lot of metrics out there on that - how comparable is it?)<p>good luck')
