Each consumer might take the most rational action locally and result in a poor result overall.<p>Think about how at the start of the pandemic it made sense for each consumer to attempt to secure food, medicine, toiletries, etc.  Toilet paper became a punch line for a while, but the logic was simple.  Toilet paper is shelf stable, it&#x27;s low cost for a large amount, it has guaranteed demand as long as you are alive, and the cost of needing toilet paper and not having any is high (for a nation like the US where alternatives like bidets are less common).  Each consumer runs the numbers, if they have sufficient storage, the cost of buying and storing additional toilet paper up front is low compared to the potential cost of needing but not having it later.  This resulted in a run on toilet paper and widespread stock outs.')
