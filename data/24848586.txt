For me, colour didn&#x27;t actually impact the guess much since I don&#x27;t know when colour photography became mainstream, and even then, you get B&amp;W pictures even today.<p>The hardest part for me was having no context of <i>where</i> the pictures were taken (although I should have guessed in the US). The picture of the farmers &amp; the horse could have been taken today in many parts of Africa.')
