This comment made me think about how I personally started to both really hate advertising&#x2F;advertising companies, and I also find it more morally questionable than I find porn, to the point that if someone told me they worked for google or some other advertising network, I would silently be judging them for their life choices, but if someone told me that they worked for a porn company I&#x27;d probably be like &quot;oh, what&#x27;s that like?&quot;. Right or wrong, advertisement is leaving a very sour taste behind, to the point where for me personally it seems to have overtaken other things, like porn.')
