If the hedge funds go down, the clearinghouse wouldn&#x27;t have been able to front their cash, and they would&#x27;ve gone down as well.<p>You&#x27;re also missing the point that the clearinghouse firms didn&#x27;t just ask for more money from brokers. In many cases they told brokers to step selling these securities.<p>There&#x27;s increased risk on both sides, but the long side is at least finite (and probably there&#x27;s not much margin). The short side is not. The unknown risk the clearinghouse needs to worry about is the short (hedge fund) side.')
