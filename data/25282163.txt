Either you have not been paying attention or you don&#x27;t know what the definition of a paper rocket is.<p>&gt; small fairing space and<p>Its not actually small. Its a little smaller then the biggest that you could launch on Delta 4 (that you can&#x27;t buy) or a New Glenn (that you can&#x27;t buy), but to just say its &#x27;small&#x27; is just not accurate. Essentially its size is big enough for 99% of payloads.<p>There are like a few military sats in the next 5 years that need a slightly bigger fairing and they will have that for those launches.<p>&gt; not the most efficient beyond LEO<p>By what definition? Just because it doesn&#x27;t use hydrogen doesn&#x27;t mean its not the suitable for beyond LEO. There is a reason the alternative for SLS is Falcon Heavy and not anything else.<p>&gt; Also, it may not be suitable for some sensitive payloads (military, etc...).<p>That is just false. Falcon rockets are fully qualified for all military orbits and payloads.<p>The only thing they can&#x27;t do right now is vertical assembly and that will be built by the time they have the first contract.')
