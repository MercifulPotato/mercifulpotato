Right now we have to notice that some bacterium or another produces some interesting protein, <i>and then</i> engineer a bioreactor to get more of that protein. With this tech, we can work backward from an <i>entirely hyothetical, under-specified</i> &quot;interesting protein&quot;, to figure out what catalogued-but-unstudied DNA sequences produce never-before-catalogued proteins that fit that particular functional &quot;shape&quot;, and therefore might do the interesting thing. Then we can either directly synthesize that same DNA, or find the organism we originally sampled it from and study it more.')
