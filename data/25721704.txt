I used to do this when I was younger as well, if I&#x27;d feel really down I would just skip class and take the day off to walk endlessly in the city, always made things better for a while.<p>I think this idea has been echoed multiple time in history. For example, the Peripatetic school[1] (in ancient Greece)  etimologic roots is in &quot;walking&quot; or &quot;the pleasure of walking&quot;. Some rumors say that it is by walking that thinkers could achieve correct or deeper thinking.<p>Apparently, a lot more philosophers have a very deep relationship with walking. Nietzsche and Kant both spent hours walking to think[2].<p>I think inherently, we are not souls, we are not brains without a body. When we do something, our entirety gets to work, and sitting all day in front of a screen is no way to think or live.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peripatetic_school" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Peripatetic_school</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-philosophy-of-walking&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fs.blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-philosophy-of-walking&#x2F;</a>')
