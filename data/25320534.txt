Barnes &amp; Noble lets me buy the particular edition.<p>Amazon lumps in rip-off photocopy books with the actual print editions and calls them all &quot;hardcover&quot; or &quot;paperback&quot; with different prices. You get an ISBN for some edition of the book, but not necessarily the one you have selected when you add it to your cart.<p>I&#x27;ve taken to buying more print books from B&amp;N for this reason. (War and Peace, Shogun, Moby-Dick... it&#x27;s hard to find proper hard cover editions of these books, especially if there&#x27;s a particular translation you&#x27;re looking for, like in the case with Tolstoy.)<p>I have this silly hope that the market will begin to swing away from Amazon as consumers attempt to avoid the rampant counterfeiting, and the lack of specificity and control for what you&#x27;re actually buying.<p>Time will tell.')
