So it&#x27;d be really stupid to enter the lottery with those as your own numbers because you&#x27;d only win 1&#x2F;10,000th of the jackpot.  In this story 20 people shared the jackpot because of a common sequence.<p>This seems to indicate that if you are going to enter, you should choose high numbers that aren&#x27;t, for example, part of memorable sequences, dates, etc.  So all numbers &gt; 31.  Avoid all even or all odd, progressions, etc.')
