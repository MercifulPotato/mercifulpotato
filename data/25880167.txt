Personally I didn&#x27;t enjoy that game, a bit too much trial and error, but it is a &quot;real&quot; platform game.<p>I have been trying various other ones to try find something really creative and unique, and the best one I have found is called Another Adventure from ThankCreate Studio. This one is neat, a bit of a commentary on high tech&#x2F;programmer&#x2F;996 lifestyle.<p>Another game I liked was 雨纪 Flood of Light. It is a fairly simple puzzle game, very low stress and easy, with a bit of sad anime style story. There was a very relaxing fish sim too called 鲤 Koi.<p>I am a bit out of the loop, I think it&#x27;s hard to keep up with all the latest indie games if you are not following local media, but it definitely feels like last 3-4 years there is a small and growing scene. Some games even translated in English and got some press in western media too, like Tales of the Neon Sea.<p>Of course, the vast majority of games are still pay to win, anime style clickers, not really my thing at all.')
