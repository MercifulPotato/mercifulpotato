But how would you do that?<p>Facebook, Reddit, Imgur, Youtube, HN, SO, and others are where all the people go because it&#x27;s easy and, well, all the people are there.<p>Those are your potential readers and customers. So you go there, as well.<p>I remember having to visit multiple forums and buying stuff directly on small websites. I needed to have credentials for all of them, but that was the hardest part, really. I liked the experience more.<p>Reddit et all are the same, they&#x27;re technically a collection of smaller forums, with the important difference being that they&#x27;re controlled by a single, big company.<p>I think it&#x27;s a dangerous thing for the future of the Internet and information in general. As Google and Facebook demonstrate, one ban and you lose potentially <i>everything</i> digital that you &quot;own&quot; (don&#x27;t get me started on that).<p>Anyone would be insane to take that risk, but most people don&#x27;t even realize it exists.')
