Probably should do it more.  I receive BCC&#x27;ed mail more frequently, but that frequency should be higher.  There should probably be a feature in Outlook that stops and asks &quot;Are you sure?&quot; and makes you wait 30 seconds when replying-all to anything more than 10 people.  Maybe the wait should be 1 second per recipient.')
