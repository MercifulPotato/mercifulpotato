But I note that in Gore v Bush (2000), the court stretched the 14th amendment&#x27;s guarantee of equal access to voting to intervene in a single counties count on that one occasion. Obviously there have been far more egregious disenfranchisements that did not have such intervention and the same court also diminished the voting rights act which does seem a bit inconsistent.<p>So in an even more extreme court, such a strategy could conceivably work.')
