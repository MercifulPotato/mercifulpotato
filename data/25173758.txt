Item(by='andrekandre', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606004410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173722, text='&gt; boiled down to some mistake in my code.<p>yes, this is the hard part i think, and it was a similar issue with even storyboards&#x2F;xib... since everything is in the same module, an issue somewhere else prevents compilation and hence the preview dies*<p>* maybe that is a reason until recently, declarative xml layout was used for a long time, no need to worry about compilation failure to get previews (in theory anyways)')
