But... I don&#x27;t know now, this was pretty convincing, to be honest. Not really a &quot;proof&quot; of anything, of course â€” this guy could be anyone, and of course it is really weird how he didn&#x27;t recognize Navalny&#x27;s voice and talked about all this stuff over the insecure line... But I can believe that. I mean, if it was fake, it was some really impressive fake, with much better script and acting than anything I can now remember. My biggest issue was believing that people doing important stuff in FSS can really be useless idiots, and this was such a convincing portrayal of such an idiot that I&#x27;m starting to accept it.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m looking forward to hear more of that story.')
