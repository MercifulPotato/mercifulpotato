I thought that you were referring to traditional package managers, not language package managers (such as cargo or npm).<p>I have most experience with Rust&#x2F;cargo and packaging Rust applications is really easy with <i>buildRustPackage</i>. As a bonus, you can also easily pull in necessary native libraries.<p>On the other hand, things like Python packages are pretty tricky.<p>One of the problems is that the Python ecosystem does not have a strong tradition of semantic versioning. For that reason, a lot of Python packages have (perhaps overly) strict bounds. That works fine for something like <i>pip</i>, which can pick any version of a Python package and can typically find a way to resolve all dependencies. But it&#x27;s harder with Nix, because nixpkgs only ships one version of Python packages (for good reasons).<p>Another issue with Python packages that I encountered several times is that some Python packages directly modify their own paths (e.g. until recently Huggingface datasets), which breaks with the read-only Nix store.')
