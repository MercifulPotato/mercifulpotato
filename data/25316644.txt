In, e.g. the embedded world, software is often written by those who are electrical engineers by profession, who use assembler, C, C++, FORTH or Python if they are lucky and rarely venture further.  Consequently for some MCUs available tools are only for C&#x2F;C++ (and of course assembler).  Often those engineers are more concerned how much the MCU costs or how much power it dissipates, rather than how elegant the language is they are programmed in.  It&#x27;s a pity, but part of reality.')
