It certainly helped, but I think they won because it made multitasking possible.  Multitasking from the users perspective that is,  the ability to interact with more than one application at the same time.  That was just not possible on a console, so even people who didn&#x27;t need user friendliness were able to do things they couldn&#x27;t do before.  I was young at the time, but that&#x27;s how I remember it at least.')
