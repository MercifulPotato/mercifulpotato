Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=[25976060], score=None, time=1612056901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25974632, text='&gt; We can get rid of the kidnappers and the evil concentration camp-building bastards.<p>&gt; In the world I&#x27;m envisioning no one could build concentration camps.<p>Okay, but you don&#x27;t have a way to <i>get</i> to that world.<p>If we&#x27;re talking about what we want society to look like, then I might as well say that in the world I&#x27;m envisioning, we don&#x27;t have concentration camps or kidnapping or mass surveillance. Let&#x27;s imagine that we&#x27;ve figured out a way to get rid of all of it without any cameras anywhere.<p>But having an end goal isn&#x27;t enough, you need a feasible path to get there. I don&#x27;t believe there is any possible world where you have perfect mass surveillance that doesn&#x27;t result in totalitarianism. I think it is a trade between kidnappers and totalitarianism, and saying you&#x27;d prefer it not to be a trade... well, great, but it is.<p>If you have an actionable plan to get to the society you&#x27;re envisioning then go for it, but in the meantime let the rest of us try to invent invisibility cloaks, and build E2E encrypted chat apps, and promote Tor, and legislate&#x2F;restrict State surveillance, because even if those solutions are imperfect we still want to try and protect the people who are suffering under the oppressive regimes that exist right now.<p>At the very least, even if privacy can&#x27;t be preserved forever, every day that we delay the world of perfect mass surveillance is another day that people like you get to spend figuring out how to create the utopian society you&#x27;re imagining. And frankly, it kinda sounds like you could use all the time you can get, because I don&#x27;t see how you plan to get from point A to point B. So if it helps, think of the privacy advocates as buying you time to make sure that facial recognition won&#x27;t be applied selectively against civilian populations while police officers don masks and cover up their badge numbers.<p>Once you&#x27;ve figured out the laws that need to be passed to make your utopia, and once they&#x27;re far enough in the process that they have a pretty good chance of passing, then we can stop advocating for privacy.')
