Save your progress to disk periodically -- for a genetic algorithm, that will be the seeds passed to the next generation.  That way, you&#x27;ll only lose one generation if you need to unplug your box.  As a programmer who does any amount of research, this is a superpower.  Godliness is achieved when you automatically commit this data, summary metrics, and the code that generates it into a git repo.<p>2. Invest in a UPS.  If you need to do a project that will take longer than your UPS will last, you can just move the box &amp; UPS onto another circuit.<p>But, yes, be careful with electricity.  Lessons from my grandpa, who survived all of his live-circuit edits and died of lung cancer:<p>3.  Wear rubber-soled boots.<p>4.  Keep one hand behind your back.<p>5.  Use rubber-handled tools and do not touch the metal bits.<p>6.  If a ladder is necessary, it should be non-conductive.<p>7.  Equip your child with a 2x4 and give them the instructions to pry you away from the source of electricity with that, and to not touch you under any circumstances.')
