You said the media don&#x27;t care about verifying their stories.  I said you don&#x27;t understand journalism if you think that is true.  That isn&#x27;t intended to be a personal attack.  Maybe there is something else I said that you took offense to.  I will happily apologize if you point it out and it truly crossed a line.<p>You are free to ignore this since you said you have no interest in this conversation.  If that is the case, I will take a cue from the upvotes I am receiving and the downvotes you are receiving that the HN community thinks I am in the right here.')
