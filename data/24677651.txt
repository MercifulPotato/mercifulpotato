A study in China found the virus in air samples taken inside the central air-condition system, far away from any patients (see bottom). \nAnother found correlation between infected and where they were sitting vs AC duct outlets.<p>Also the fact that mandatory masks have had zero effect on the R value in any country, same as for influenza and other &quot;flu&quot; viruses.\nIf it was spread by droplets&#x2F;surfaces then masks should at least have some effect to slow or contain the spread, like make a dent in the curves.<p>Yes there are masks that prevent TB transmission but this bacteria is more than 10x larger than typical respiratory viruses. They look like duck beaks, are very uncomfortable and require training to use properly.\nI haven&#x27;t seen these anywhere during this pandemic and they wouldn&#x27;t help either as they are designed to prevent aerosols down to about 2um size. \nThere is plenty of space for ~0.1um viruses even in 0.5um droplets. Some researchers even claim the virus can stay potent a while after the droplet evaporates and float around like dust.<p>CDC meta study showing medical masks had no effect neither as PPE or source control: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;5&#x2F;19-0994_article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;5&#x2F;19-0994_article</a>\nStudy comparing medical masks and N95 masks found no difference in transmission of influenza: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;31479137&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;31479137&#x2F;</a>\nMore links and summaries collected here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;face-masks-evidence&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;swprs.org&#x2F;face-masks-evidence&#x2F;</a>\nThis Time article has lots of links and info (but the argument for masks is complete fail): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5883081&#x2F;covid-19-transmitted-aerosols&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5883081&#x2F;covid-19-transmitted-aerosols&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s funny how some claim we didn&#x27;t need masks before, but now we need them since it&#x27;s spread by aerosols?? \nThe truth is in fact the opposite and don&#x27;t get me started on cloth masks...it&#x27;s absurd. This seems more like covering their asses than following the science.<p>Most of these studies involve health personell, with high-end masks, the general public will of course do much much worse.\nThis survey of studies and history of mask use in dentistry is also informative (why was it taken down?): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;My2jr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;My2jr</a><p>The WHO reversal on mask use is also revealing:\n On July 12, Deborah Cohen, the medical correspondent of BBC2’s Newsnight, revealed on Twitter that: ‘We had been told by various sources [that the] WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying.’ She said the BBC had then put this to the WHO, which did not deny it.\n In March, the WHO had said: ‘There is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can protect them from infection with respiratory viruses, including Covid-19.’<p>-Van Doremalen N, Bushmaker T, Morris DH, Holbrook MG, Gamble A, Williamson BN, et al.
