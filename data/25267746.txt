It&#x27;s clear the M1 <i>is fast</i>, so clearly some of the things they did to optimize it worked. Why Apple would lie about what those optimizations are is a head scratcher.<p>It strikes me as odd that so many people claim there is zero benefit. I&#x27;m left wondering if people think Apple is lying about all of the actual reasons the CPU is fast and have presented this as a smokescreen. Makes zero sense to me.')
