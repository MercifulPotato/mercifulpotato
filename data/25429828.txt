In the past politicians would suck up to foreign businessmen like Rupert Murdock and he would attack their rivals.  The EU probably doesn&#x27;t want to see that repeated elsewhere with Zuckerberg.<p>* When Boris Johnson was a full-time journalist he often made up populist stories.  One well know example is the EU attempting to ban prawn cocktail flavoured crisps.  Completely untrue and only written to get the naive frothing at the mouth in anger and advance his career.  He repeated that lie, amongst others like his famous NHS bus poster, during the Brexit campaign.')
