I still have one of these and it was a truly amazing thing to use.<p>It was powered by a clockless 80C86 processor and lasted for 40 hours on just 2 AA batteries.<p>Most of the in-built applications (e.g. Quicken and Lotus 1-2-3) ran directly from ROM rather than being copied into RAM and then executed.  That meant when you pressed the button to switch to that program it was available instantly.<p>Quite frankly, compared to the HP 200LX our replacement handheld device (mobile phone) is actually a backward step.')
