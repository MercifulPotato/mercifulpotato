That&#x27;s a killer feature that almost makes the watch worth wearing even if I used it for nothing else.<p>I really like using it for runs but I haven&#x27;t used a Garmin so I can&#x27;t compare. Seems to work well but I keep my phone on me as well. I&#x27;ve tried going without my phone and using Pandora but it eats up the battery really badly. I don&#x27;t think you could run for more than an hour or two with everything going. (I have a series 5)<p>I also use it with Things for checking off todo items, siri very occasionally, sometimes answering quick phone calls, and as a quick way to ping my phone if I can&#x27;t find it in the couch cushions. These are all pretty minor things but moderately improve my life.<p>All told it would be a mediocre product I might not even bother to charge and wear every day. That unlocking my computer though is the one thing it does I find helps my life a ton.')
