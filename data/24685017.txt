It just adds layers of obfuscation to the subject.  You spend all of the time explaining what a &quot;resolver&quot; is, for starters, and <i>then</i> have to explain how that model then doesn&#x27;t really match how the softwares fit together on their operating system and LAN, because it was intended to be an operating system neutral model.  And <i>then</i> you get to explain that almost no-one will understand you correctly if you use the term properly.<p>Whereas explain to them that it&#x27;s a form of publication, from content servers through proxies to client libraries in applications, like HTTP, and it generally clicks what part of the overall system talks to what other parts.  People have some absurd models of how things work, from ISPs talking to ISPs to relays along chains of content servers.<p>Explaining that it&#x27;s actually like HTTP gets people using the correct mental model, and matches how the softwares in reality fit together.  There <i>really is</i> a DNS client library, and it has a name such as (for example) libresolv.  There <i>really is</i> a proxy DNS server, and one can point to a specific process running its program, again with names (dnscache, pdns-recursor, et al.), to its back-end and front-end traffic, and to whether it is configured to forward or to resolve.  There <i>really are</i> content DNS servers, again with nameable programs (nsd, tinydns, walldns, pdns_server, et al.), with specific locations, and with content sources that one can point to.<p>The fact that RFC 7719 exists should tell one something, even if it weren&#x27;t <i>spelled out in its introduction</i> that the RFC terminology is confusing, contradictory, and going to change wholesale &quot;real soon now&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a mental exercise:<p>Configure your machine with 1.1.1.1 in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf.  The RFCs, including RFC 7719, tell you <i>both</i> that your &quot;resolver&quot; is the program that does the entire job of &quot;resolution&quot; <i>and</i> that it is located on the same machine as the program requesting the lookups.  You have a DNS client library locally, linked into your applications, that is talking to a resolving proxy DNS server running on a machine operated by Cloudflare.  The resolving proxy DNS server is doing all of the grunt work of query resolution, retrieving content from content DNS servers with back-end transactions, and Cloudflare&#x27;s machine is where its front-end and back-end are.  It&#x27;s simple to explain that way.  Now point to your &quot;resolver&quot;.  Then further try explaining it to someone else.  Then try explaining that Cloudflare&#x27;s server is a DNS server, but <i>not</i> a &quot;name server&quot;.  See what happens when you tell them that for an explanation of &quot;name server&quot; they just need to use RFC 7719 to &quot;research it more&quot;.')
