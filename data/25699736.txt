The haskell ecosystem is missing a certain kind of pragmatism. There&#x27;s a lot of beautiful type abstractions, talking about monads, etc., but not enough builders doing actual application development. In my opinion it&#x27;s not the language that is bad, but the ecosystem. Missing documentation, missing tooling and infrastructure, no focus on actually building applications.<p>We&#x27;re trying to fix that with IHP, a new haskell framework with a focus on actual building applications. Imagine the productiveness of rails combined with the typesafety of haskell.<p>6 months after it&#x27;s release it&#x27;s already the second biggest haskell framework, and we just had a new record of weekly active users last week. To me this shows that by fixing the ecosystem haskell can reach a lot more than it&#x27;s currently doing.<p>Check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihp.digitallyinduced.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihp.digitallyinduced.com&#x2F;</a>\nGitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digitallyinduced&#x2F;ihp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digitallyinduced&#x2F;ihp</a>')
