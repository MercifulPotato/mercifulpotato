People will have a stronger incentive to put their money to work instead of hoarding it.<p>- Not difficult to measure since it can be weighed and banks could print paper bills that are backed by it using weight as the units of account.<p>The main downside I can see is that it will encourage people to eat more and demand for laxatives would grow significantly.')
