I send a response saying I will only read Signal or similar messages from them.<p>Some think this is a hardline, but my security is important to me, and true friends and family need to respect that.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like how my sister is vegan, so when she comes over for dinner, I cook vegan dishes for her. I respect and accommodate her lifestyle choices, and she does likewise by communicating with me via my preferred medium. Conversely, for example, I no longer talk to one cousin because he ignored requests to use a safe messaging app, and that is OK too.')
