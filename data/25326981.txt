Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25327183], score=None, time=1607291533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326552, text='&gt; A particularly beautiful outcome is that the implementation has consistent semantics for the edge cases<p>Not sure if this is actually a benefit or not. Edge cases are notoriously hard to debug, so it&#x27;s sometimes actually <i>nice</i> to have a branch that specifically handles edge cases. Conceptually, it&#x27;s also much more difficult to wrap one&#x27;s head around. I would be interested to see how much of the cs101 solution is compiled away and if there are any tangible benefits of being clever here.<p>PS: If the linked list is stored in contiguous memory (if you&#x27;re using a slab allocator, for example), you can actually be even <i>more</i> clever (I&#x27;ll leave that as an exercise to the reader).')
