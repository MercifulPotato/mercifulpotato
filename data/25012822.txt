Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=[25012981], score=None, time=1604715720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012745, text='So would playing Civ6 on ironman mode (assuming it was enforced and&#x2F;or you did it by honor) and with a random map and a randomized tech&#x2F;civics tree count as a rogue-like?<p>When you move that scout you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re going to encounter a barbarian or a tribal village - do you hold off on building a warrior to escort your settler hoping that you can settle without it being captured?<p>I have a clear picture in my mind of what roguelike is, and that picture is nethack because someone introduced me to nethack and said &quot;This is a roguelike&quot; and I still basically believe them - trying to abstract the specific mechanics that make something a roguelike is hard... Here are some questions:<p>Do you have to just be one person - can a roguelike be a party of adventurers?<p>Does a roguelike need to have an rpg-style leveling system - can strength be gained by item acquisition alone?  Does a leveling system make it not a roguelike?<p>Do you need to use pixel graphics for display?<p>Does the PC need to be precisely on coordinate pixel big?<p>Dwarf fortress, for instance, is turn based but the only real difference between turn based and real time is that twitch factor - if you made a version of starcraft where the game paused every five seconds to let you revise as many orders as you wished would that suddenly be really close to a roguelike?<p>My core thing here is that rogue was a collection of game mechanics, and games can be judged to be similar to that in an entirely subjective manner - you can objectively call out different features that differ or are the same, but those features only really matter if the person you&#x27;re talking about strongly believed (subjectively) that that feature was &quot;core&quot; to the gameplay.  A young kid playing rogue today is probably just going to walk away saying that rogue-likes use ascii art and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to accept that definition - for that kid.')
