Those were the only two results that seemed truly surprising.  Results like North Carolina going from Biden ahead by 1% to Trump ahead by 1% or Michigan going from Biden up 7% to up 3% are perfectly normal polling errors. In a normal election, I think there would have been a good chance that the polling miss in Wisconsin would have been an afterthought after Biden was declared the winner late Tuesday or early Wednesday.')
