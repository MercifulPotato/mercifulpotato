Which is more clear to you?<p><pre><code>    repeat special-task 5 times. \n\n    (do special-task n times) = (do special-task n - 1 times)\n    (do special-task 0 times) = Don&#x27;t do anything. \n    do special-task 5 times.\n</code></pre>\nClearly when we communicate with others using regular language we use a repeat keyword rather then recursive grammar. No natural language on the face of the earth ever communicates the concept of repetition via recursion*  There&#x27;s always some keyword or number for repeating something.<p>*(not 100% sure on this, HNers, prove me wrong if possible, I&#x27;m open to being wrong).')
