There you will find your answer on who is more adversely affected by censorship.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a valid metric at all. This doesn&#x27;t reflect the quality of censored expressions, their factual validity (<i>mere facts</i> are not opinions) or evolutionary adaptations to the discourse, like deflection (&quot;No u!&quot;). You assume a zero sum game.<p>See how diversity initiatives and co are confronted with &quot;this is racism against white people!&quot;. Does this reflect an increase in discrimination against &quot;white&quot; people, or an decrease in discrimination for &quot;non-white&quot; people?<p>Then, people getting kicked off a Platform for being mean and abusive, doesn&#x27;t mean they got censored for their political views, even if they claim that&#x27;s the case.<p>All, I am saying is, your metric is problematic.')
