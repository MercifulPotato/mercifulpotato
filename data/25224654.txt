At the same time, it rewards you for keeping libraries small and modularized.<p>Particularly liked this part.This nuance of not going too far in either direction is what makes the idea effective, I would think. Will keep it in mind for every future project.<p>And hey, writing the readme first will very likely make tdd easier, as the first few tests to write would be essentially transcripts of the readme into code.')
