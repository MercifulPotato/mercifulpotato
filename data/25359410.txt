Specifically, it allows for mirror vdevs to be rebuilt in LBA order. Depending on the pools average block size, overall fragmentation, and the performance characteristics of the devices (SMR) sequential reconstruction can restore redundancy in less time than a traditional healing resilver. However, it cannot verify block checksums as part of the rebuild. Therefore a scrub is automatically started when the last active sequential resilver completes.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;10349" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openzfs&#x2F;zfs&#x2F;pull&#x2F;10349</a>')
