Not even the extremely biased &quot;victims of communism&quot; calculus comes within orders of magnitude of that.<p>And the Chilean military would have been part of that civil war.  &quot;There would have been a civil war because we would have attempted to overthrow the democratically elected government and they would have fought back, so we took american money and &#x27;advisors&#x27; to move so quickly that there was no chance of the legitimate government fighting back&quot; doesn&#x27;t really hold moral water with me.<p>Also, the Beagle Conflict was five years into Pinochet&#x27;s reign so not really sure how that&#x27;s a reason to overthrow Allende.<p>&gt; Allende was a demagogue on the KGB&#x27;s payroll with drinking issues<p>The KGB hated the shit out of Allende.
