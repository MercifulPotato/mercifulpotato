In other words, if you&#x27;re not using today&#x27;s release (0.3.5) you&#x27;re on stale data.  For context, dendrite.matrix.org (running 0.3.5) has ~5K users on it, and is in ~3K rooms spanning 162K users... and its RAM usage is stable at 488MB (occasionally spiking to 2GB during traffic spikes).  This doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable at all for a chat server of that size.  Meanwhile, Synapse has been steadily improving too.<p>On the client side, Hydrogen (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydrogen.element.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hydrogen.element.io</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;hydrogen-web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;hydrogen-web</a>) is our next-gen client implementation, which gives you full E2EE, complete with backup (I have no idea what Durov is banging on about in the OP) - and uses 14MB of RAM for an account in 3,000 rooms spanning 350K users (i.e. my personal one).  This is an 100x improvement on Element Web which uses 1.4GB for the same account, although there&#x27;s also a lot of optimisation that can be done there too.<p>If I was going to criticise Matrix, I&#x27;d focus more on the fact that there are still a lot of papercuts on Element&#x27;s UX which are holding us back.  We&#x27;re painfully aware of this though and are trying to fix as rapidly as we can.')
