Item(by='cure', descendants=None, kids=[25063360], score=None, time=1605105270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058405, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t figure out the economics here. They project $2.7B to construct each 440MW plant. This is presumably an optimistic estimate since they haven&#x27;t even designed it.<p>Same here, this makes no sense from an economic perspective.<p>The article quote was even worse: they think that <i>after</i> they have built a few, they think they will be able to build them at roughly $2.7B a pop. How much will the first few cost?<p>Who pays for the handling and storage of the nuclear waste? That&#x27;s never included in the cost estimates for nuclear plants, mini or not.<p>How much grid-scale battery would $2.7B buy today? Looks like a Tesla megapack is ~$300&#x2F;kWh with all the batteries and electronics included (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;tesla-megapack-powerpack-powerwall-battery-storage-prices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cleantechnica.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;05&#x2F;tesla-megapack-powerpac...</a>). $2.7B would pay for ~9GWh of grid-scale storage, or about 20 hours of output from a 440MW plant. Of course you would still need to add the generation piece - solar or wind is cheapest today.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess that in 10 years, when those mini-plants may finally be a reality, the combination of grid-scale batteries with solar&#x2F;wind or wave generation will be so much cheaper that there will be no market for mini-nuclear plants.')
