Parts of them look so bizarre due to the image composition, my brain simply cannot comprehend that part of the image.  It&#x27;s a very awful feeling, like my brain acknowledges that what I&#x27;m seeing is terribly unnatural.  I don&#x27;t experience this when looking at artwork, or some random scribbling, but with ML images it seems like they&#x27;re generated in such a way that it defies any kind of recognition.')
