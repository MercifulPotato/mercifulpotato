But now the text isn&#x27;t really surfaced - folk have automatic updates turned on, and the text is deep in the app store now.<p>My changes are mostly technical when I use the &quot;bug fixes and performance improvements&quot; text, but I tend to write more for the app store reviewers to let them know what is going on. I know they read it.<p>In the end my audience of users are very non technical. I am authentic to them, that is the image that I sell my apps with, and I am good at it. So they just don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;ve updated library X, or improved error handling somewhere, or I support Apples latest devices now. They do have faith that I am doing the right thing, and they write to me as if they know me, and I like that.')
