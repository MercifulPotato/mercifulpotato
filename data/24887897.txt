In Great Britain and most jurisdictions in the world, public domain kicks in 70 years after the death of the author. Orwell died in 1950, so all his corpus entered public domain at the beginning of this year. (In Australia, where these ebooks are hosted, the public domain for this period starts 50 years after the author’s death.)<p>In the US, the public domain system is different: works enter the public domain 95 years after the initial date of publication of that work. <i>1984</i> was published in 1949, so will arrive in the US public domain in 2044. For the next 24 years it’s illegal in the US to download a copy of the book that’s free by virtue of being in the public domain in a different jurisdiction.<p>This is a bit of an extreme example, as Orwell died just one year after <i>1984</i>’s publication. In other situations it can work in reverse. For example, Thomas Mann died in 1955, so his works will typically enter the public domain in 2025. However, <i>Der Zauberberg</i> was published in 1924 so is now in the public domain under US law. This (among works by other authors) lead to Gutenberg being blocked in Germany as they weren’t willing to build a geoblocking system.<p>At the end of the day, if you want to stay legal (big assumption), it’s your responsibility to check PD in the jurisdiction you’re in. Going just by what websites claim is in the PD is not the best idea.')
