My favourite stack right now is Django with DRF+Admin for backend, Typescript+NextJS (React) for frontend. I front the backend with Caddy, have django live on both admin.example.com and api.example.com with a couple of rewrites, and put cloudflare access in front of admin.example.com.<p>Currently I still use allauth for social authentication, though I&#x27;m not a fan of how little flexibility I get with it especially in such a setup (it makes a lot of assumptions about a template setup).<p>The other weakness in this stack is the lack of API typings. I haven&#x27;t bothered messing with OpenAPI yet; I probably should but I understand that it&#x27;s not a silver bullet in terms of typings either, so I just end up writing my own types for the API and it does become a very repetitive maintenance burdenâ€¦')
