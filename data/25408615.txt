It will only compare equal to itself, but it&#x27;s even clearer to read if you  check for identity with `is`. You&#x27;ll need to define it outside of the function definition.<p>It&#x27;s not the most concise, but it works, and it&#x27;s an established pattern used in many high quality open source projects.')
