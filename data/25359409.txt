I sure do hope you aren&#x27;t on vacation and&#x2F;or have to order a drive online.<p>It all depends on your use case. For me, raidz3 wins easily. Performance during resilvering is not something most users would suffer that much from anyway either. And that 8-drive recommendation comes from many factors and don&#x27;t apply to most home-users anyway. Not that you should go overboard with it but it will easily pay for fast cache or whatever else you might want.<p>If performance was the goal you would not be using spinning rust anyway, and if you are still limited by a single gbit then don&#x27;t even think about it (but don&#x27;t over-utilize your pool).<p><i>But there are still lots of potential ways for your data to die, and you still need to back up your pool. Period. PERIOD!</i><p>Of course! Yet for home users there is not a single reasonable way to do it if you have decently sized pool. There is bound to be sacrifices on what you choose to backup.<p>Except for maybe another pool. Which is going to hurt since ZFS with buying everything up front is <i>VASTLY</i> more expensive than RAID where you can grow the array as needed - under the assumption that the storage needs grow slowly, which they typically do for home users.<p>As a ZFS user and fanboy the temptation of a dual raid6 setup is tempting. But I can&#x27;t compromise on the filesystem so in the end I&#x27;ve compromised on backups instead. Likely not the smartest move considering how rare bitrot is, I am very well aware.<p>For many drives I&#x27;d go for raidz3. And for a 4-drive NAS I&#x27;d go with raidz2 rather than a mirror setup for the ease of mind.<p>For fast SSD pools I&#x27;d go with mirrors. Much easier to backup the entire pool as well.')
