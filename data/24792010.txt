Take the case of an owner with one employee.<p>If I own my own business and I&#x27;m the only employee, let&#x27;s say a plumbing business. For years I did my own work, own accounting, own taxes, etc. I decide to add an apprentice who I hire in full time. This apprentice starts evangelizing his political views while on jobs. This turns off customers and doesn&#x27;t agree with my political views. I don&#x27;t want my employee to do this. It is not my point of view and it&#x27;s affecting business. Now in your world, I can&#x27;t fire this person, or tell him to stop. But by not being allowed to fire this person, and allowing his speech to continue via my company, the government is forcing me and my property to endorse his speech. Why stop there? Why can&#x27;t I put a Trump sign in my neighbors yard?<p>Now we&#x27;re in a contradiction. Who&#x27;s right to speech matters more in a private setting? Typically the owner of said private setting. By and large, this is true. Does this lead to sticky situations where people are profiled racially? Yes. But I&#x27;m not willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>&gt; Do you think making it illegal for employers to discriminate against their employees based on their race is a violation of the employersâ€™ rights?<p>Do you think it making it legal for an employee to bark racist words towards their minority colleagues all day at work is a good idea? Because under your free speech rule, that would be OK. Oh look, another contradiction. In any case, we have laws for these scenarios that are largely constitutional because the constitution largely ignores these private settings, thus it is up to us to legislate, hence we have laws on discrimination.')
