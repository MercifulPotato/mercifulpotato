The bigger they are, the less innovative they are.<p>I cannot emphasise this enough: Elements of the ITER project have been planned <i>30 years ahead!</i> That&#x27;s insanity. That&#x27;s using 1990s technology in the 2020s! There is <i>no possible path</i> through ITER and then DEMO to achieve commercial power generation before 2050. None. There is not even a hope of such a thing.<p>Most critically, ITER used a legacy superconducting wire in their designs, which has a lower maximum magnetic field strength compared to more modern types. Because of the <i>highly</i> nonlinear scaling (quartic?) with increasing field strength, this is the fundamental limit to achieving break-even fusion, but they were forced to start planning without it.<p>They should have done what Tesla did: Focus on the batteries as the primary thing, everything else is secondary. ITER should have focused on the superconducting wires above all else for <i>at least</i> the first two decades of the project, before even thinking of actually opening a CAD program to design a Tokamak!')
