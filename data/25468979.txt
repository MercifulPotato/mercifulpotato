Dry it. Tan it. And sew it into wallets, belts, book covers, and shoes as gifts to the ever growing number of authoritarians who dare command economies and tell everyone what to do from far far away.

Destroy with as much motivation as wiping out polio.<p>It&#x27;s one thing for international marxists to do this. It&#x27;s another thing for the cannibals of Borneo, or Supermax inmates to do this. Blame them regardless. They opened the door. We&#x27;ve lead them well into the technology frontier. Time to shoot their scouts, and let the wild devour them.')
