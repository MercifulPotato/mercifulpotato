Imagine taking a lit candle. You can wave your finger through the flame without issue. But now if you burn that finger, any heat, no matter how small is going to burn and cause an upset. Eating bland foods allows the stomach an easier time digesting, preventing reflux into the throat and allowing the burns to heal so that in the future when you get the occasional bit of reflux like most people, it won’t burn and you’ll carry on your day like normal. If I get particularly stressed and eat badly for example and don’t notice I’m burning up inside, I need to take 3 months of just bland foods, boring diet, Gaviscon and Nizatidine and then I’m back to normal again. It’s a fun ride!')
