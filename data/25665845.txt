I wrote a ton of IPTSCRAE as a youth for it -- both server side and client side.<p>The Palace quickly taught one why it was a bad idea to allow clients to draw programmatically. Many a rooms ruined by script kiddies that got taught how to ruin every bodies day with an array of seizure inducing redraws.<p>That said : Man, we&#x27;re moving backwards in a lot of ways on software. The Palace didn&#x27;t have rich media embedding and webcams, sure -- but the server software was free for anyone to run , with many large broadcasting groups hosting many hundreds of people at once.<p>I understand the need for a marketing plan and idea -- but it feels weird when a brand new pay offering can handle less traffic for more money than a solution from the 90s.')
