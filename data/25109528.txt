Some libraries are easier to patch than others, I can think of a couple of libraries I&#x27;ve wanted to quickly patch and soon (not soon enough) realised that it&#x27;s unpatchable because it&#x27;s a mess (or perhaps even worse, is too clever by half and has far too much indirection and not enough comments) and would need extensive surgery.<p>That&#x27;s not to diminish the strength of your story about Bill Schelter but only to point out that it&#x27;s easier to do your best work if others are doing theirs.')
