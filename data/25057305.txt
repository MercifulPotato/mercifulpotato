It had all &quot;mainstream&quot; hardware. It&#x27;s WiFi adapter was an Intel one (and a very common&#x2F;popular one at the time), but it was one that wasn&#x27;t open source.<p>How did Debian approach this? It&#x27;s installer gave me a not very subtle passive aggressive message telling me that although they have the drivers for the device, it was not going to install them... because the ISO did not include them. With no working WiFi, it of course could not connect to the internet to download them! Worse still, turns out that even if it had connected to the internet it wouldn&#x27;t have downloaded and installed them anyway. I found this out because I managed to use an Ethernet connection.<p>Completely stupid and frustrating and it felt like I was being blamed as if it was my fault.<p>Installed Ubuntu, included the drivers, connected to WiFi during the installation.<p>I have not used Debian on anything since.')
