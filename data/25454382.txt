I don&#x27;t want to &quot;contact you&quot; to get that information. We&#x27;ve been long enough in the 21st century that it has become an adult, and still I keep running into this archaic nonsense.<p>For example, you mention your &quot;sensor package&quot; in the FAQ and that&#x27;s it. Your DIY instructions mention the &quot;AirGradient PCB&quot;, _but there is no place where I can buy it_. For the love of god, put a &#x27;buy&#x27; button on your website.')
