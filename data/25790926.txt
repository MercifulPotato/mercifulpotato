Amber (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amber-lang.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amber-lang.net&#x2F;</a>) has one (but it is not plain JavaScript). The next complaint is that you need to host it.<p>Ideally, the system should have a good debugger and have an option to be self-hosted like TiddlyWiki (with an option to be served by a normal server). I did some experiment in this regard (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pavel-krivanek.github.io&#x2F;amber&#x2F;amber.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pavel-krivanek.github.io&#x2F;amber&#x2F;amber.html</a> - only &quot;legacy IDE&quot; work) but then you can save it and it will save the new version with all the changes you did as a self-hosted HTML file.')
