I found out by accident, and I think they have too much control.<p>Earlier this year, Google suspended my ad words account. I don&#x27;t know why but think it was their mistake. The sites and ads were ethical and well within their terms. Still, Iâ€™ve sent emails and letters without progress.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating not having an avenue to resolve the issue. Even more so because I&#x27;m in tech and though I understood these things. More so because I worked at google for a long time.<p>In the suspension dialog they warn all accounts under my name or the domain names linked to the ad words account will be blocked.<p>I don&#x27;t depend on ad words. If I did, I would be completely out of luck. I&#x27;m not aware of an alternative ads network or search engine.')
