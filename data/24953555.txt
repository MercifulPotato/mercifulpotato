I <i>think</i> in the study the rats were fully fasted, so you’re into unknown territory as far as the study goes. But I also assume you’re not a rat, so that’s not exactly the biggest difference.<p>There are lots of definitions of fasting and it’s not perfectly understood which consequences line up with which behaviors.<p>It’s pretty clear things are different once you break down the different ideas of “fast” and build it back up. In a dry fast, <i>nothing</i> enters your body except air. Now switch to a water fast and your stomach and kidneys are going to start doing something with that water. Have some coffee and now your liver is processing that caffeine and other chemicals. Add some calories (milk) and more organs are doing more. And then once you get past 500 calories in a day, you’re not really fasting by just about any definition.<p>So your coffee is doing something, the milk is doing something, but I don’t think it’s perfectly clear what happens at each threshold.')
