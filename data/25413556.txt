The unions have sapped out once productive PSUs; they&#x27;ve killed&#x2F;burnt management if they haven&#x27;t gotten their way (Suzuki&#x27;s Manesar plant); and all of them want more subsidies and freebies.<p>The Indian state itself inherits the worst of Communism, Democracy and Colonial administrations. India probably has some more ways to go (down), before it realizes the folly in its self-conceit. Meanwhile, every bureaucrat in the kleptocracy is accumulating close to $50-100M in assets before retirement.<p>With the internet we now have dim-witted drunk Americans of all colors supporting assorted idiots here (recent agitations, being a case in point).<p>Humanity you suck. You really do.')
