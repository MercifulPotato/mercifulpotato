Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605307907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085635, text='1) I search youtube for cover versions.  I then sort the videos by number of views and I go to look at the videos with fewer than 10,000 views. Once I found someone doing covers I like I look at the other songs they cover.<p>2) I search youtube for &quot;tiny desk contest&quot;<p>3) Tildes has a new music group which is quite good.<p>4) I sub to YT channels that play sessions.  EG Western AF, Gems on VHS, Little Orange Room Sessions.<p>5) I used to use Usenet (alt.binaries.sounds.1940s.mp, (and 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and world-music) but it&#x27;s a bit frustrating to use now.')
