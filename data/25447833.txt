Quest 2 does not really hit that, but high end units seem to.<p>So it seems like we are about 1 generation away from having something mainstream for work, so probably 2 years away.<p>We are a remote team and I decided against Quest 2 but was borderline due to text legibility. I would probably buy everyone a Quest 3 though as a way to interact on some things.')
