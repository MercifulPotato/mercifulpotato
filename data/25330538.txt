For any work project I start that I anticipate taking more than a few hours to code, I spend an hour or so writing an &quot;architecture document&quot; which I then distribute to anyone I think will have an opinion about it. That gives folk a place to ask questions and &quot;bike shed&quot; the problem long before I&#x27;ve invested any &quot;artesianal coding energy&quot;. By the time the code reviewer looks at the code, they know what it&#x27;s supposed to do and why it was written that way. As a pleasant bonus, I usually code about 3x faster when I have the document to reference.<p>I try to get new hires into this habit as early as possible to varying degrees of success. The folk that embrace it tend to be very productive; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s causation or just correlation though. I have a slide deck to emphasize function over form, titled &quot;Writing Mediocre Architecture Documents&quot;. It&#x27;s a cult classic hit.')
