There&#x27;s a ~30-40 year delay between greenhouse gas emissions and fully realized warming. A ton of gas released today doesn&#x27;t cause warming tomorrow. Because these targets haven&#x27;t been met, even if all emissions stopped today, enough ice would melt over the next century that the Solomons, Marshalls, Maldives, and other low-lying island nations will be swamped.')
