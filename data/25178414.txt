Because COBOL can&#x27;t really do much anything else ;? Eg have fun implementing an event-driven GUI app (actually there are&#x2F;were solutions for running COBOL green-screen mainframe apps on browsers, and things like IBM&#x27;s HATS for running 3270 apps in Java portlets). Though apart from batch processing, I guess COBOL the language but not necessarily the runtime works well also for writing backend service implementation code.<p>More seriously, as I recall it, COBOL simply has straightforward idioms for arithmetic, date calculations, statically-typed structured file I&#x2F;O, ISAM file access (and SQL?) as part of the language rather than Java&#x27;s BigDecimal and various date libraries that all suck in a different way and at best cause enormous fluent-style expressions with cognitive overhead. Plus, COBOL doesn&#x27;t have reflection and metaprogramming so self-important idiomatic Java code golf is spotted immediately as out of place next to actual business logic.')
