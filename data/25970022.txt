You seem strangely adamant that this is no big deal, while ignoring the many reports we&#x27;ve heard over the years of the kind of very bad stuff mods have had to deal with, regardless of your anecdotal experience.<p>Also, on AI classifiers, I think there are far too many nuanced situations to completely replace mods, and your comment about this is very hand-wavy, and even if you are right, we still need to deal with the problems we have now, not defer them by saying there will be a solution in the future.')
