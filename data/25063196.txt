Right now I&#x27;m using ~45GB of it, usually its up around 50 or 55. The CPU is at ~10%. While I&#x27;m developing locally, the workloads are highly bursty but sometimes they will chew up almost all of the CPU for about 10 minutes.<p>I used to have a 2016 15&quot; MBP with 16GB (4 core i7) and while I could still run everything, the RAM was always pegged. Before that I had a 2016 13&quot; MBP with 16GB (2 core i7) (I actually swapped with a coworker because I thought his 15&quot; had 32GB). With both of these the RAM was by far the limiting factor, and while the increased CPU cores have been nice, most of the time I haven&#x27;t noticed. The RAM increase on the other hand is always noticeable. Thus, 16GB is a nonstarter for me.<p>Edit: To add, I prefer the 13&quot; form factor when I&#x27;m not at my desk.')
