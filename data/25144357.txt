Anecdotes aren&#x27;t data and large tech companies don&#x27;t spend money for no reason (especially when they can A&#x2F;B test the impact trivially). Remember that at their scales even a 0.01% increase in revenue is worth $10+ million per year so they don&#x27;t need to be perfect to make a shit ton of money. There&#x27;s a reason ML engineers get paid $1+ million and it&#x27;s not corporate stupidity.')
