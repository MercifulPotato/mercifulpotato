If i travel somewhere it&#x27;s to enjoy a warm beach, the ski slope or something else <i>unique</i> i can&#x27;t find at home. Not to eat. If i thrift on the food it means i can afford another day in slopes. (Assuming of course fancy restaurants is something that can be found at home and not a main unique attraction of the destination).<p>Often the cheap street food can also be the more unique local attraction when traveling somewhere!')
