But you don&#x27;t need to exaggerate and say we are at war with all of our neighbors, there is no war, the situation is bad as it is.<p>Like it or not, people were literally burning their neighbors alive in Cyprus and entire west was watching. They&#x27;ve been in peace for 40 years now because of Turkish intervention. Cyprus war ended 46 years ago.\nTurkey isn&#x27;t fighting Armenia at all.\nIraq and Syria doesn&#x27;t exist, they are broken beyond repair thanks to US and EU and Russia. It&#x27;s the people that matters and there is a reson why we have 10 million Syrian refugees.')
