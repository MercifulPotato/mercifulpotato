One thing we heard almost universally was &quot;please don&#x27;t require us to install another agent on our boxes&quot;. So we decided to focus initially on transparent use cases that only require running additional nodes (Boundary controller&#x2F;worker) without requiring additional software to be installed&#x2F;secured&#x2F;maintained on your end hosts.<p>&gt; the endpoint can be closed off to incoming connections from the internet, and you don&#x27;t need to maintain various firewall whitelist<p>If you think about this a bit differently, a Boundary worker is also acting as a reverse proxy gating access to your non-public network resources. You can definitely use Boundary right now to take resources you have on the public Internet, put them in a private-only subnet or security group, and then use a Boundary worker to gate access. It&#x27;s simply a reverse proxy running on a different host rather than one running on the end host. You wouldn&#x27;t _need_ to add a firewall to ensure that only Boundary workers can make incoming calls to the end hosts, it&#x27;s simply defense in depth.')
