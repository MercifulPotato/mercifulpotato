They have now accepted a slow increase in $ and BBL from here as predictably too low in light of their encumberances to support going forward with what was considered a full staff a year ago.<p>They&#x27;re producing less oil at a lower price and they&#x27;re going to use fewer people to do it.<p>Otherwise the shareholders would take too much of a beating.<p>When balancing the books boils down to headcount versus dividends, it is considered as bad as it gets.<p>Some could also say major employers have been very generous so far preserving many jobs as long as they have.<p>Well, Shell actually raised their dividend this week but they&#x27;re not planning on kicking out as many people either.')
