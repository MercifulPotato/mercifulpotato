Item(by='pashamur', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610278760, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711045, text='&gt; If it&#x27;s a marketplace of ideas, the current situation is equivalent to monopolies stamping on startups to prevent them from ever becoming competitors. An actual marketplace of ideas would work without censorship in the first place, like it used to. Note that most minorities right now who obtained civil rights would never have been able to claim them had they be silenced from the get go.<p>The fundamental problem is that truth and lies don&#x27;t operate on the same playing field. If we can make an assumption that the game is being played fairly within the marketplace of ideas (people are being reasonable and accepting rational arguments), then the marketplace works as intended. If certain actors are subverting that system by design, then you cannot have an unmoderated idea-sphere, unfortunately. Studying some Nazi and Communist propaganda techniques should certainly convince you of that (and how effective they are when applied against a gullible populace).<p>There is no good solution to this, unfortunately. Once a radical movement takes over the idea-sphere moderation and certain censorship is sadly inevitable &amp; needed. Something akin to Denazification in post WWII Germany (which specifically and forcefully suppressed any Nazi ideology from the mainstream)')
