If you want the joys and sorrows of woodworking, look into making boxes.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about apple crates here. Some people make some <i>very</i> nice boxes. You can start simple and get more complex, but even the simple projects require precision and care. You can involve all sorts of advanced woodworking techniques like inlay, homemade veneers, marquetry, hidden joints, it&#x27;s an endless list. You can&#x27;t really buy nice boxes like you can build, unlike furniture. And you end up with nice gifts, especially for people who appreciate fine craftsmanship.')
