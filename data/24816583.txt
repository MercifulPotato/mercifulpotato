No, that capacity is still there and you can run it when the sun doesn’t shine.<p>It still saves you money, because the fuel costs more than the solar power. It also reduces CO2 emissions in the period the sun shines.<p>I guess your counter argument is “but it doesn’t remove ALL the CO2!!”<p>But why should it? That is a long term goal. First we remove all CO2 emitted when the sun shines. We still got plenty of work to do there. Only when that has been done all do we need to think about storage. By that time storage solutions will be cheap.')
