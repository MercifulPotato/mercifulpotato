It&#x27;s pretty common to have the positive scores be a smaller band than the negative. For example, with Net Promoter, 9 and 10 are positive, 6,7,8 are neutral and 0-5 are negative. In the case of Net Promoter, 6,7 and 8 are neutral because mild satisfaction does not correleate with being willing to recommend a business.')
