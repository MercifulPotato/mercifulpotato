I agreed, made a mental note to cancel it in 5 months, and was shocked to find the next day that my card had been charged. There weren&#x27;t any purchase screens, any terms to agree to, or anything to indicate that the trial they were peddling was in fact just an ordinary Prime Student subscription which would then renew in 6 months.')
