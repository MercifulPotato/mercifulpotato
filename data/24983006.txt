Doctors, at least, make more in rural areas than they do in urban areas.  The estimations vary, but they&#x27;re in the 5-30% more than their urban counterparts range.<p>The average wage for internal medicine doctors in urban areas (as an aggregate) is still above $208,000.  It&#x27;s actually roughly right, imo, to prevent depressing doctors&#x27; wages.  It&#x27;s right around the average, so you&#x27;re paying above average rates to get an H1B, which is the intended purpose of the program isn&#x27;t it?  The idea being that it drives up salaries for those jobs, encouraging more people to train to do them.')
