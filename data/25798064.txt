It&#x27;s quite persuasive. You&#x27;re really just saying that 1-based indexing is okay if you use convention c), as indeed, Lua does.<p>But you&#x27;re not even touching on why he says not to. If you do, I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll conclude, as the field in general has, that a) is the more powerful and general choice.<p>But I would like to do more than just gesture at Djikstra&#x27;s magnificent argument and say &quot;reread this!&quot;.  The One True Wiki has a useful discussion of the subject: in particular, I find the observation that 0-based indexing unifies counting and measurement to be persuasive, and it&#x27;s found nowhere in the paper in question.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ZeroAndOneBasedIndexes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?ZeroAndOneBasedIndexes</a>')
