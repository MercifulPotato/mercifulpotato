But it has never clicked in my mind. I feel melancholy in a different way. I’m lucky though, I had a happy childhood and I have a happy adult life too, I also haven’t lost too many relatives&#x2F;friends in my lifetime. So when something reminds me of my childhood I’ve never experienced sadness. Is there another word that would fit better my feeling?')
