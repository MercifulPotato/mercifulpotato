(EDIT: Pfizer’s agreement is an advance purchase but unlike Moderna’s it is contingent on FDA approval.)<p>Warp Speed provided ~$5 billion in guaranteed prepayments which meant the companies could ramp up manufacturing without waiting for approval first in order to have a large number of doses ready by the end of the year.<p>That’s never been done before, but the bet has certainly paid off spectacularly so far.<p>Novavax got $1.6 billion and GSK got $2 billion for another 100 million doses each.<p>Assuming all 4 companies produce highly effective vaccines, the US has prepaid for 400mm doses &#x2F; 200mm courses of vaccine. This will save a lot of lives not just in the US but worldwide as well, because it shifts the manufacturing curve sooner until the point where several billion doses have been made.')
