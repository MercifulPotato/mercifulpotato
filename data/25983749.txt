Item(by='badatinterviews', descendants=2, kids=[25985345, 25984277], score=3, time=1612136016, title="Ask HN: How to find a new job if I'm bad at leetcode style interview questions?", item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for a decade now, with nearly all of that time at VMware where I&#x27;ve been consistently recognized by my peers, tech leads, and managers as an engineer that writes good clean code (as well as some other positive attributes, but no companies appear interested in anything beyond coding skills when it comes to hiring). Yet despite writing (and reviewing) countless lines of actual production code for a very non-trivial product I&#x27;m unable to solve the types of problems I encounter in interviews.<p>Of course I&#x27;ve tried practicing on leetcode and similar sites and watching youtube videos of problems I&#x27;ve particularly struggled with but nothing seems to help. Over the last couple years I&#x27;ve bombed interviews at Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon (the first two I made it to the onsites, the last two I didn&#x27;t even get that far). Anyone have suggestions beyond &quot;just practice more&quot; or &quot;watch more vids&quot;?')
