What&#x27;s counterproductive is saying that the policies aren&#x27;t <i>actually</i> popular and people were just, in the author&#x27;s words, &quot;bamboozled into supporting the measure&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen many people (including a friend) with that attitude, and it makes engaging with anyone who <i>does</i> support Prop 22 impossible, because you&#x27;re forced to assume they either don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about or don&#x27;t mean what they say.')
