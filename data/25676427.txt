Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610049397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676002, text='&gt; Are there any popular old computers (Commodore, Amiga, Mac etc) that used a 5¼” drive?<p>Yes. Pretty much all PCs prior to the PS&#x2F;2 era (so, the IBM PC, XT, and AT, and clones thereof, but not the PS&#x2F;1, which, oddly, was later than the PS&#x2F;2) came with them as internal drives (except the lower-end model of the PCjr). They were also common accessories to the Apple II&#x2F;IIe&#x2F;II+ computers (and I think the IIc, though I never saw either one of those in the wild).')
