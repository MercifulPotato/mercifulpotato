Even when it&#x27;s sold it&#x27;s never really sold. If someone with more money comes along they get your spectrum. Just look at the incumbent satellite uplink operators who had half of C band taken away from them and resold (to 5G telcos).<p>As for spectrum usage, I can only talk about my region, but I have been monitoring all of 70-1000 MHz at ~10 second intervals and storing the data since 2014. For periods of that I monitor 700-2700 MHz as well. The cell operators are <i>not</i> letting their bands sit idle as far as I can tell. It&#x27;s nothing like what the top level comment thread implies re: ISM vs. Cell bands. If anything it&#x27;s the reverse.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean they should get this 6-7 GHz of new ISM spectrum the FCC returned the original owners: the people. They really, really shouldn&#x27;t. And they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to operated unlicensed LTE in the ISM bands either.')
