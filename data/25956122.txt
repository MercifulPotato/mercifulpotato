Thanks for answering.<p>I&#x27;ve seen similar situations before. In my case it was mostly due to having a team that is larger than than necessary. Having multiple UI designers with differing opinions, developers that don&#x27;t question redundancy in UI (or don&#x27;t have time to check), managers that don&#x27;t coordinate, and just communication problems in general.<p>This led to a lot of reimplementation and duplicate code. In the end they changed the frontend framework a couple times, but the issue started creeping up again.')
