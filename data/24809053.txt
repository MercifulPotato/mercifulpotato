You discover something awesome every once in a while, but most of the time it&#x27;s trash, and you get frustrated looking for something really good. It doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of Netflix productions have 20 episodes or so, of which only about 3 are really good.<p>Back in the day, you&#x27;d have your Simpsons and Power Rangers and just learn to enjoy it and talk about it with all your friends.<p>I think algorithms are built wrong too. We&#x27;d probably click on some show with a sexy model, or a rom-com twist on a zombie flick, or some reality cooking show with celebrities, or a gritty remake of a children&#x27;s show. We don&#x27;t really intend to watch it. But they pique curiousity and a little disgust. The algorithms register these clicks and long views as an &quot;interest&quot;, and gives us more of these clickbait-ish shows.<p>I think what would work is simply narrowed down genres, say, Animation &gt; Children &gt; Horror (e.g. Adventure Time) or Animation &gt; Adult &gt; Tragicomedy (e.g. BoJack Horseman). Past that, just arrange at random, alphabetically, and not even by popularity.')
