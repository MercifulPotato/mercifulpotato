One is a wealthy engineer, and the other (who has a kid in Marin) an incredibly fortunate person who was curious about this bitcoin thing 10 years ago..<p>I don&#x27;t know of any &quot;regular&quot; people who stayed in the bay, except for a relative who&#x27;s stuck there because of shared custody over kids with an ex and can&#x27;t practically move. She&#x27;d like to though.')
