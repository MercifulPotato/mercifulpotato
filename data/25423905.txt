One of my favorite distros, Void Linux, only has support for the Pi 1, 2 and 3:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;voidlinux.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;</a> (click on arm platforms)<p>The Pi3 image does not work on the Pi 4. There are mentions on the bug tracker and how to patch in support, but this wouldn&#x27;t happen at all on a UEFI+x86 system. You&#x27;d always be able to boot to a prompt on over 90% of motherboards.')
