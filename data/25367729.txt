The incumbent responded by offering free service for a year to all the startup&#x27;s customers if they switched back. An unsustainable move but hardly a bad decision - it had very deep pockets, and my friend&#x27;s employer ran out of money first.<p>If Uber didn&#x27;t have any competition, it could raise prices to profitability today. Investors still believe in it because they believe that Uber, like the Telecoms incumbent in my anecdote, can bankrupt the competition and then have its way with the consumer. Investors in Uber&#x27;s competitors presumably have their own reasons for a similar thesis.')
