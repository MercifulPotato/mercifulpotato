I know they are prone to be misused<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t deal with &quot;prone to misuse&quot; but &quot;provably safe, else explicitly unsafe, or made safe by the programmer through wrapping code.&quot; Global variables are <i>inherently</i> unsafe and need to be wrapped as such.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll need global state at some point in your life. What Rust does is yell to remind you that it isn&#x27;t thread safe.<p>If you stop thinking about a Rust program as a script where the runtime figures the hard stuff out for you, then these design decisions make a lot more sense. You have a lot more knobs to twiddle than in C#, no garbage collector, and no runtime. The compiler is pretty smart, but it tells you the things it knows and you&#x27;re responsible for working around the limitations to create sound programs that the compiler can optimize.')
