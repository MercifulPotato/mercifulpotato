The purpose of Brexit was very much sovereignty for the political elites. The entire point of Brexit was that the policital elites were ceding too much power to Brussels and explicitly campaigned to &quot;take back control&quot;. The Monarchy doesn&#x27;t enter into it, they&#x27;d ceded their political power to the elites centuries ago.')
