Since I was writing on a Linux machine with KDE I switched to Kate and the performance was in par with editing a small file in those other editors. The Vim mode isn&#x27;t perfect but was good enough to get things done. It comes with some pretty nice plugins and is def worth giving a try.<p>[1]: Distributed Systems with Node.js, O&#x27;Reilly')
