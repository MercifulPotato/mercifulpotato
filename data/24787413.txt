Amazon limits CCC to physical (that is, Amazon&#x27;s lowest margin) goods, ostensibly because of licensing agreements.<p>Amazon benefits here by <i>sanctioning</i> a price history tool with restrictions when others could take its place and include its higher margin goods (if you look, there are CCC competitors that aren&#x27;t sanctioned in this way, but you have to look). Less measurably, the price history tracker provides better consumer experience, in line with Amazon&#x27;s customer obsession. And finally, Amazon&#x27;s warehouse space isn&#x27;t unlimited, so informed consumers who know a particular price is extraordinary may help it free up space more quickly.')
