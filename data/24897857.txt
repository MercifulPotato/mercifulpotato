Item(by='fastball', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603729480, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892746, text='I think you might be projecting a bit here, as I have not &quot;attacked you&quot; at all.<p>I asked a question, and you answered it. In turn, I responded to the substance of your comment. In retrospect, my initial comment probably would&#x27;ve been along the lines of &quot;is the Daily Wire any more unreliable than mainstream news sources?&quot;, as I can&#x27;t think of any mainstream news org that <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> published multiple factual inaccuracies in recent memory. Which is what I said in my follow-up comment.<p>Then you asked me to not shoot the messenger and provided a link to your source.<p>At that point, I probably should&#x27;ve said something like &quot;shoot the messenger???&quot;, because I haven&#x27;t actually done that in this conversation. However, even if I had, the conversation is about information&#x2F;news (and its propagation), where <i>everyone</i> is a messenger, so I&#x27;m not sure who else there is to shoot. So that&#x27;s what I responded to. When I was talking about &quot;knowing the truth for yourself&quot;, that was specifically in the context of my previous statement about bearing &quot;objective&quot; truth. Sure, you think what you said about The Daily Wire is true, I&#x27;m just maintaining that this is a subjective truth and therefore a messenger is still responsible for its spread. Even the source you cited has a lot of subjectivity in their methodology, and they seem like they want to be objective.<p>But again, after re-reading my own comments I have no idea at which point you think I attacked you. In fact, the only person that can reasonably claim being attacked is me, who was called rude and insufferable for something I didn&#x27;t do. My unsolicited advice would be to not take disagreement on matters of substance as a personal attack, and even if you do feel attacked don&#x27;t go all scorched earth and start name-calling.')
