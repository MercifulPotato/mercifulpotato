Facebook and other ad companies have been caught knowingly defrauding ad spend customers, Amazon has been knowingly permitting counterfeit sales for years, Uber has been ignoring regional laws globally, Airbnb was (and may still be) ignoring or hiding data that illustrates their connection with increased housing pressures, and on and on.<p>Doing what you can get away with (because the cost of the penalty is lower than the profit that results from the bad behavior) is not ok.  It doesn&#x27;t contribute to an improved civilization, it pushes civilization back down toward a zero-sum, selfish survivalist mentality.  I know it sounds corny or hippie, but if people can try to better balance their own desires against the good of the community, the end result will surely be better.')
