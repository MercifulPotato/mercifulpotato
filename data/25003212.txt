It&#x27;s easier to do with natural gas.<p>But for electricity it would require something like a 100+amp electrical circuit and would have limits on flow rate and&#x2F;or temperature increase.<p>for a heat pump, it just wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>So for hot water the most common solution is to trickle charge a thermal battery - a hot water heater - and release it fairly quickly during a hot shower.<p>I can see the same sort of thing happening here.')
