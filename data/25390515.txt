And this has nothing to do with efficiency, or price, or anything else; pollution is pollution, and emissions != CO2.</i><p>This is an extremely reductive and absolutist way of thinking.<p>We have very real solutions to reduce emissions of cars with greener options, solutions that do not work with cargo ships.<p>Nuclear civilian cargo ships have quite disastrous potential considering the scale at which that would need to be introduced: More than 50.000 merchant ships would then be swimming nuclear reactors, good luck finding anybody willing to insure that.<p>Not to mention that it would require building a global nuclear fission centered infrastructure to support it; Expensive, and even more potential for catastrophic accidents, even more issues with where to store the waste.')
