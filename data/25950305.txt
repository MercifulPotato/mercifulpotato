We cannot use customer funds to front that cost due to regulation. So the brokerages or the clearing firms have to go into their own pockets to do it. And they simply can&#x27;t afford the cost of that trade clearance. That is the reason why these stocks are coming off. It has nothing to do with the decision or some sort of closed room cigar-- smoke-filled cigar room of Wall Street firms getting together to the dismay of the retail trader. This has to do with settlement mechanics of the market.<p>ZACK GUZMAN (interviewer): [...] We had the CEO of Robinhood on yesterday kind of talking about why they were taking a different tact [sic] and not restricting trading because, you know, they wanted to leave it to their individual retail investors to make these decisions. Didn&#x27;t want to step in and fuel into the nanny state idea.\nBut what about maybe curbing this a little bit earlier? Because the fact of the matter is, you&#x27;re going to have retail investors who are now kind of on the hook, who might want to dump some of these shares, who are stuck. And it seemingly looks like some of these moves have now triggered the bubble bursting. So what do you say to that?<p>ANTHONY DENIER (CEO Webull): Well, that&#x27;s absolutely false, actually, Zack. There is no way that a customer would not be able to sell a position they hold. We are simply stopping opening of new positions. Liquidations can happen at any time. This is general market mechanics. We have customer protections in place. We would never stop a customer from being able to get out of a position.<p>[...]<p>I think when you say the regulators stepping in, it will happen on both sides. It&#x27;s going to happen on looking into should a hedge fund be allowed to get a 10 times leverage and short 140%, 150% of a company. Should that be allowed in a regular-- you know, in a healthy market.<p>And then, on the other side, should it also be allowed to have mob and herd mentality of rolling into stocks? And should these things be curbed? Look at the examples that happened overnight in Australia, where a mining company, GME in Australia, was up 100% overnight because people just blindly went in on anything GME without reading below the headline.')
