But my appeal-to-authority has peer-reviewed models behind him. Does yours? [citation needed] :)<p>&gt; <i>I am curious though -- can you expand on what you believe Krugman&#x27;s position to be here, and why it makes sense? He doesn&#x27;t seem to worry about inflation from open market operations because it works until it doesn&#x27;t.</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard the explanation (probably more than once), and it made sense to me when I heard it, but it was not important enough to me to bother retaining. I think this is a decent blurb on it:<p>&gt; <i>Under these circumstances, normal monetary policy, which takes the form of open-market operations in which the central bank buys short-term debt with money it creates out of thin air, have no effect. Why?</i><p>&gt; <i>Well, the reason open-market operations usually work is that people are making a tradeoff between yield and liquidity – they hold money, which offers no interest, for the liquidity but limit their holdings because they pay a price in lost earnings. So if the central bank puts more money out there, people are holding more than they want, try to offload it, and drive rates down in the process.</i><p>&gt; <i>But if rates are zero, there is no cost to liquidity, and people are basically saturated with it; at the margin, they’re holding money simply as a store of value, essentially equivalent to short-term debt. And a central bank operation that swaps money for debt basically changes nothing. Ordinary monetary policy is ineffective.</i><p>&gt; <i>The flip side of this, by the way, is that all those fears about how “printing money” in this slump would lead to runaway inflation were predictably wrong. If you paid attention to the Japanese story from the last decade, you knew that simply expanding the central bank’s balance sheet did little, and certainly wasn’t inflationary:</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;monetary-policy-in-a-liquidity-trap&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;krugman.blogs.nytimes.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;monetary-policy...</a><p>So as long as rates are at&#x2F;near zero, &#x27;printing money&#x27; won&#x27;t be a problem.

Increase taxation&#x2F;redistribution. Top marginal tax rates are half of what they were during Eisenhower&#x27;s administration and the (adjusted) minimum wage is below what it was during Nixon.
