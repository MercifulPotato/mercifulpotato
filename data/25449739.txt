Provide free long term contraceptives to women. We&#x27;ve seen it work in places like Denver who cut their teen pregnancy and abortion rates in half while saving $6 in medical bills for every $1 spent on IUDs. We cannot get programs like this more broadly because half our country thinks outlawing abortion and teaching &quot;personal responsibility&quot; is the solution despite evidence that neither actually work.')
