I do not want to\nworry about how much I regularly pay where and constantly\nreceive payment confirmations in my inbox. I already have enough\nstuff floating in my head.<p>I use a really nice graphics application that&#x27;s missing out on\nmy money because it expects me to pay $50 a year for the\nunrestricted Pro version. But I&#x27;m not a professional, I&#x27;m an\noccasional user who just likes the intuitive interface. I would\ngladly pay that amount once to get the non-pro version forever\nbut without the constant nagging or the requirement to login to\nuse it. This &quot;you&#x27;re either a professional who pays the bills\nwith this software or you deserve to get spammed with popups and\nother annoyances&quot; stance is a pain.')
