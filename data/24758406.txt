Item(by='animal531', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602530817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753734, text='Me: Hobbyist game dev who&#x27;s dabbled in Unreal and a lot more in Unity. Experience in both C++&#x2F;C#, but a lot more in C# recently.<p>I pick Unity every time. Yes it has many many issues, but as a hobbyist you&#x27;ll pick a version of it and stick with it. Improvements isn&#x27;t where the end goal is at, it&#x27;s at allowing you to deliver a game&#x2F;product on a given version.<p>C# is definitely a lot better than old-school C. Unreal C++, everything is just extremely clunky and verbose. Sure there are blueprints, but then now there are free alternatives for the same on Unity as well (although not working as well). If you need to know something there are 10x more free resources for Unity. If you need to buy something, there are 1000x more items on the Asset Store.<p>You don&#x27;t need Unreal for Quixel, you can also use it in Unity. You can also use Substance. Sure there are many useless assets, but there are also many many many awesome assets in Unity. Use them.<p>Both editors have issues. I won&#x27;t comment on Unreal. Unity&#x27;s can be a real piece of work sometimes. They all give you issues and make you go arrrgh.<p>Networking. Unity has nothing by default, it&#x27;s all in the Unreal corner. If you want to do it in Unity, install Raknet, cloud options, etc., you&#x27;ll have to figure it out. It&#x27;s a big ball they have no clue about.<p>Financial terms, let&#x27;s see. Both are ok. As an indie first you need to produce, then it&#x27;s about the fine print. Both are ok, really.<p>Last point, 100% agree. It&#x27;s about producing a game. Both engines will fight you hard if you try to produce anything outside their default mindsets. Unreal by default focuses more on fps action. Unity is more open. but GameObjects are extremely heavy and restrictive. You&#x27;ll need to figure out instancing (until whenever DOTS becomes production ready and useful). Other issues, newer options like HDR isn&#x27;t supported in Unity by default yet, so if you&#x27;re heading that way it&#x27;s definitely not for you.')
