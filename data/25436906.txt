Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=[25437419], score=None, time=1608075276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436479, text='&gt;desktop app is a pile a donkey dung.<p>And you can put the stated criticisms of it in proper context. Then assess the costs and risks to yourself. Compare its use along with the rest of signal to the alternatives. And examine the response of Moxies team to issues.<p>At least that&#x27;s what I did and came up with a &quot;Hard Disagree&quot; on that statement. Signal desktop is pretty good. (And no I don&#x27;t like electron apps as a rule - it&#x27;s the only one I use).<p>Deviation from perfection is not donkey dung.<p>&gt;Signal desktop was missing basic features like answering [voice] calls...<p>vs<p>Messaging on phone and internet everywhere was missing end to end encryption before Signal. (Yes I used OTR with like 3 people, now I encryption with almost everyone, thanks signal).<p>Advantage signal. By a huge margin, for mine. Picked the essential feature. Got it right. Expanded from there. I find it pretty hard to fault what they&#x27;re doing. People who want to do it differently because they think it&#x27;s &quot;better&quot; (eg federation), don&#x27;t seem to actually get much done in comparison to signal&#x27;s massive win they chalked up for all of us.<p>I find it kinda odd that here, where people understand tech, there is more sticking up for facebrick, goo, appletax etc when they screw their users yet again than there is for Signal doing the opposite. The contrast between how they view people who use their stuff is very, very stark. Signal are pretty great. We need more love for anyone who can achieve at a similar level to make computing better for us. To push competition toward being better at privacy, security and so on and away from the direction of turnkey totalitarianism surveillance that the Stasi could only have wet dreams about. Alarmist right? Could bad things really happen here? Are the interests of Cook, Zuck, Seregey, Larry, Jeff et al not precisely yours or a wider population&#x27;s? They all do seem really quite friendly to despotic regimes. But I guess those reigimes are foreign?')
