I admit that I am someone who tries to avoid making decisions based on word-of-mouth or &quot;reputation,&quot; but you can&#x27;t deny that only considering objective truths takes a lot of work.<p>Sometimes I just want to buy a keyboard, not read and apply &quot;The 50 Tenets of Keyboard Comparison&quot; to find the objectively best (for me) keyboard.<p>It makes sense how this attitude can bleed into decision-making as a whole, even for higher-impact decisions like programming language choice. So I wouldn&#x27;t discredit (or lower the reputation of ;) ) too much the folks who don&#x27;t always go by objective truth.')
