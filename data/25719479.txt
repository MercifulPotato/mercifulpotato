It can take me a long time to see why non-technical people have some of views they do</i><p>One way I&#x27;ve thought about this is a difference in understanding patterns.<p>Imagine that you can see a picture of a landscape. You can see the sun in the sky, rolling hills covered in grass, and a town in the distance. You can probably reproduce this picture. You might not be able to draw it well, or maybe at all, but you could at least describe it.<p>Now imagine a picture of some English text. You can reproduce this rather accurately. Maybe even from memory.<p>After that, imagine a picture of text in Dutch. You can reproduce it when you can see it, but you&#x27;ll probably have difficulty recalling it. The patterns don&#x27;t make as much sense, because you don&#x27;t understand Dutch.<p>Now, imagine an image of Japanese text. Reproducing it, even when it&#x27;s right next to you, would be difficult. The patterns that make up the text don&#x27;t make sense to you. You don&#x27;t have enough experience with Japanese to even try to put pieces together to describe it to someone. You can forget about trying to memorize it.<p>Now<p>Think about people with different language backgrounds looking at these same images. They might be looking at the same thing, but they will <i>see</i> something different. People who aren&#x27;t familiar with Japanese and Korean might not even be able to tell these two languages apart! They look very different, but with no experience they both look like squiggly gibberish. It comes down to a difference in experience with different patterns.<p>This idea applies to basically everything in life. Be it understanding tech, playing sports, riding a bike, or playing video games. People&#x27;s past experiences will influence what they can recognize and reproduce in those activities.<p>If you want to experience this distance yourself then I recommend playing some video game where you can significantly improve at the game quickly. Something like Super Hexagon. At first, you&#x27;ll fail. You&#x27;ll fail within the first few seconds over and over. In minutes, however, you&#x27;ll fail less and less. Soon, you can go a whole minute without failing. You do this on a few different occasions and suddenly, it&#x27;s difficult for you to understand how you couldn&#x27;t do this right from the start. After all, the game is quite simple! It just wasn&#x27;t simple for you at the time.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>just</i> a difference in preferences.')
