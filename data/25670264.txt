In the video, inspect the state of the Lisp image, and I evaluate arbitrary code (redefining functions and variables) while not leaving the debugger. Perhaps HN can find this interesting, as it is a livecoding demonstration of how a Lisp programmer might make use of these techniques in real-life scenarios.<p>The examples are trivial and might be perhaps a bit too trivial for people used to programming, but the secondary point of the video was to demonstrate the livecoding techniques to people who possibly do not know Lisp whatsoever, and I didn&#x27;t want to burden them with complicated code examples. (The primary point was to describe the Common Lisp condition system, which I have written a book[1] about, and show the basics of control flow in Common Lisp that are the foundation of conditions.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pkqQq2Hwt5o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pkqQq2Hwt5o</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24867548" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24867548</a>')
