A lot of crazy people with blue check marks who get special privileges. After all, isn&#x27;t that the kind of internet you want? Where certain people you agree with have privileges over everyone you disagree with?<p>Also, the president generally gets special privileges on media platforms because he is the president. That&#x27;s just common sense.<p>Assuming you are american, I can&#x27;t believe there are people actually advocating for big tech to censor the president. It just sounds insane to me that anyone would support such an idea.')
