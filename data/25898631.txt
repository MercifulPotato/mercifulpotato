A lot of writers&#x2F;podcasters have made their name by diminishing issues as being purely about signaling alone. It&#x27;s not possible for some to imagine someone has certain beliefs for their own value. For example, they believe people support issues, not because they believe in them, but purely to show people in their social circles that they are a part of the club.
