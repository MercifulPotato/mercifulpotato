Even if a small one given a lack of supporting argument.<p>&gt; If tptacek, security researcher, says a case is no real case (even with arguments) and an attorney contradicts him then that is evidence tptacek is wrong.<p>There is no evidence lest it&#x27;s explained why the former is wrong. I know for a fact that a judge with actual credentials didn&#x27;t think the case had merit. Now LiquidmetalFish claims otherwise, without any supporting arguments or reasoning.')
