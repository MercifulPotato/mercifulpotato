Let them stay at the hedge fund instead, do hopefully more limited damage there.<p>&gt; <i>You get what you pay for.</i><p>No, not always. And it&#x27;s precisely this narrow vision, this absolutization of money that&#x27;s one of the major causes of the woeful state of the world nowadays.<p>People in government ought to be focused on doing what&#x27;s good for the nation, first and foremost. If they go &quot;well, $200k isn&#x27;t enough for me to do this job&quot;, kick them out. That&#x27;s precisely the wrong kind of person for the job.<p>I think actually the oodles of money being pumped into politics these days are responsible for drawing some awful characters to it. Remove that motivation, and perhaps you&#x27;ll have people with very different goals running the show.<p>You get what you, collectively, value and believe in. America believes in money above all. Well, yeah, then the piles of cash end up ruling supreme. Good luck fixing that mess.')
