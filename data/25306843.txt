Might even get a small thank-you from the recognition portal for it, and &quot;don&#x27;t worry about that early meeting tomorrow, someone else will handle that&quot;. That kind of thing.<p>With on-call there&#x27;s pressure all the time but it&#x27;s not visible to anyone, and if you happen to be not immediately available everyone&#x27;s angry. It&#x27;s the total opposite in terms of experience.<p>So I try to be around when needed specifically to avoid having on-call commitments. As long as the occasional issue works out fine this way, nobody will bother setting up a formal on-call requirement. Most of my colleagues feel the same and it works out great. When shit hits the fan we&#x27;re there anyway.<p>And the times I help out after hours... Plenty of times I&#x27;m not doing much during working hours, or have a personal things to do.. It&#x27;s give and take. I love that flexibility.')
