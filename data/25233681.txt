No matter what Coinbase does, they add only a sliver on top of what&#x27;s come before.<p>It&#x27;s just an absurd, transparent rationalization for selfishness to try to justify being a parasite, for not contributing to it and being responsible for making it work. Our community is us; nobody else will make it work. And it&#x27;s sociopathic to say that, about part of our community, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care what happens to African-Americans&#x27;.<p>But being a sociopath and buying into this transparently false argument has become trendy and admired by a vast swath of powerful people in American business, as if ignoring problems will solve them. I used to wonder if they really were smarter than others, but recently I&#x27;ve concluded that they follow the herd and are easily manipulated as much as other people are (and I could have seen it earlier in financial bubbles, etc.). And as they&#x27;ve followed the herd in disparaging liberalism and postmodernism, rather than thinking critically about them, they&#x27;ve unilaterally disarmed themselves, willingly discarded the tools that would protect them from being deceived, confused, and led.')
