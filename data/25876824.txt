It became a meme right away to the delight of people who already weren&#x27;t very fond of Christians. I thought this was particularly strange because even my most conservative Christian friends held opinions in the vein of &quot;If you&#x27;re a Christian and are getting upset about these cups, you&#x27;re way off&quot;. I was really curious to figure out who all of these Christians were that held this opinion and, lo-and-behold, it was one single Christian from Arizona. This particular &quot;weak man&quot; argument was the basis for much criticism of Christian culture for a couple of years.<p>Maybe this seems less significant nowadays after the media has shown us consistently over the better part of the last decade exactly what level of depravity it will sink to in order to gain a click, but at the time it was really surprising.')
