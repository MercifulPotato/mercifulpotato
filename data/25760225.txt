It’s clearly frustrating to deal with Apple’s platform lockdown, and he captures such in a professional and rational manner. Bravo.<p>What bothers me is that I’ve experienced an increasing number of maintainers of supposed cross platform projects simply not care about macOS anymore to the extent that they’re openly hostile towards macOS users. I know what you do is free and I have no entitlement to anything from you, but don&#x27;t antagonize me when I add suggestions to open discussion and feature requests to your issue tracker to try and help participate in improving the way your project works on macOS. I’m probably willing to do some work but also need to get the lay of the land first.<p>I would challenge those maintainers to be honest. Yes, it’s your time, but if you’re not interested in spending it actually supporting macOS, don&#x27;t market your project as a cross platform. Like it or not the macOS platform is changing and if you’re not along for the ride don’t grief everyone who is (either by choice or by requirement).<p>Just to be crystal clear: Json does not fall in this bucket, but this topic in general seems all too familiar lately.')
