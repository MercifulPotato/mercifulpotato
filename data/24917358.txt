Yes, managers needs good social skills. But those are not defined as &quot;be pleasant to all the people all the time&quot;. It is more of &quot;be able to negotiate and push for what you want when you wont be punished for it&quot;. Accomplishing more and more wont get you there. Guessing right when to demand what you want and going for it, including leaving when current company is not cooperating, is what gets you there. Even as real manager of multiple people, others will try to stack more and more on your team. And you have to negotiate and push back - but not when the person you are pushing back would retaliate.<p>Make following exercise: how many managers you know are actually spending much time with &quot;helping people solve their problems&quot; or &quot;patiently answering dumb questions&quot;? Managers I know spend some time with it, but frankly, much less then analysts and not much more developers.<p>Another exercise: Do you know managers that are unpleasant around, arrogant or misinterpreting people? Do you know managers who are actually not good at all at communicating down chain? Because I know a lot.<p>what the exercises show is that none of that pleasant communicating to all has to do with who is actually successful as manager or selected for management.')
