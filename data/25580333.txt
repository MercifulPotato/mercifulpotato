When my friend comes over for dinner, I could ask them what foods in my kitchen they like, and instantly query all recipes containing those foods. Maybe Iâ€™ve added how long each recipe takes to cook, which appears as one of the many RDF triples I can use to filter and sort the matching recipes.<p>Knowledge graphs enable incredibly rich, structured queries. This is the promise and power of semantic web. Otherwise all you can do is rudimentary keyword searching.<p>The vision of the semantic web is to enable these rich queries over the entire collection of human knowledge, not just personal notes.')
