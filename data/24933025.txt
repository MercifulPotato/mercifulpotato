It isn’t “don’t blame others for your ignorance” it is “the system should be designed so that it is harder to make a mistake than to do the right thing”. Design and testing doesn’t put the onus on pilots, it puts the onus on the design and the system. How can this documentation be clearer? Is this warning easy to ignore in certain situations and how can we change that? If a pilot gets confused in this situation, how can we design the system to help? How can we train our pilots so they can handle this? How can we test our pilots so we know they truly understand the system? They don’t just say “well the manuals were available, you should have known so that’s on you”. Saying “it’s the individual’s fault” doesn’t improve the system.')
