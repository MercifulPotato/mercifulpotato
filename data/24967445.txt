And can also be integrated directly into external tools like Vault.<p>Want to use service discovery? No need to set up Consul&#x2F;Istio&#x2F;etc., just use the managed service. Same with load balancers, and VPCs, and SSM, and route53, etc.<p>Sure, in 2020 none of those services are that hard to replicate pieces of, and open source tools abound. But setting up those tools all takes time.<p>Only other nit is that the article makes it sound like Terraform and IaC is meant to abstract away AWS vs GCP such that one terraform module _could_ be deployed to either just by changing some string value from &quot;AWS&quot; to &quot;GCP&quot;. I don&#x27;t believe any serious (and good) efforts are being made in that space, and you won&#x27;t find any popular modules like that on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.terraform.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.terraform.io&#x2F;</a>.')
