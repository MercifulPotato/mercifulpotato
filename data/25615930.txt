I can definitely see the difference between 4K running 1440p at 1.5x compared to a proper 2x scale factor, though. I can tolerate 1.5x or variations in between, but I&#x27;d vastly prefer 2x. If you play with enough resolutions and look at enough displays, you&#x27;ll develop a taste which cannot be quenched without an LG 5K display, which is ill-advised.<p>At least to my eyes, my Dell U2715H with EDID override looks worse at 1440p than my LG 27UL850-W. I&#x27;d prefer to have a 2x scale factor, but at 1.5x, I can&#x27;t see scaling artifacts or I&#x27;m used to them for still text. My poor GPU can&#x27;t handle this though, so all motion and movement is terrible, and thus, I can&#x27;t distinguish &quot;shimmering&quot; from just regular poor performance.<p>I&#x27;m really bothered that Apple sells an LG 5K display for the price they sell it at. Pro display XDR is joke-tier pricing for a developer. Even the 5K display is too expensive. The Ilyama 5K (XB2779QQS) was sold at the $999 price point, which actually kinda makes sense, but it&#x27;s gone.<p>So practically speaking, either shell out $1,200+ for a good display or settle non-ideal retina or 1x.')
