(Medical, Rescue, Law Enforcement)<p>Tier 1: Frequent contact with Tier 0 (elderly in care) and&#x2F;or high risk of complications (anyone in a hospital setting for an extended duration).<p>+++ My tier 2 seems to differ from public health models, at least that I&#x27;ve seen.  My logical basis is to break transmission vectors. +++<p>Tier 2: Those who can&#x27;t social distance well; essential workers with contact.  This group should include anyone in unavoidable public service positions of any sort.  E.G. (but not exhaustive): Teachers, grocery store workers, restaurant workers, chefs, warehouse and delivery workers.<p>Tier 3: High risk but CAN social distance and isolate.<p>Tier 4: Everyone else; possibly stratified by some score of age, prior medical conditions &#x2F; risk factors, etc.')
