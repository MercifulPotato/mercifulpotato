And, yes, I&#x27;d feel a bit better. Not much maybe. I might even question it in the long run. But think about the alternative. In Germany it is not at all unheard of that murderers (who murdered for sexual desire or greed) get less than ten years of sentencing and are on day parole after a couple of years. How would you feel about that? What &quot;good&quot; comes from that? Do you maybe even wish that person a happy life?<p>&gt; to expand, if (god forbid) someone did that to my daughter, my instinct would not be to kill them, it would be to find them, talk them, to understand why they did it.<p>You want to ask the guy &quot;Why did you rape and kill my daughter?&quot;? Are you kidding yourself? What would you expect for an answer? Also in this hypothetical situation you&#x27;d have to use force to even ask that question. You think you&#x27;d get an honest answer? &quot;Sorry, didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s your daughter.&quot; &quot;I was just so horny - didn&#x27;t know what else to do.&quot; What would you expect for an answer that even has the slightes potential of being meaningful to your pain?<p>&gt; to make them truly understand the consequences of what they had done.<p>People who rape and kill don&#x27;t tend to be the &quot;understanding&quot; type ... just think about how f&#x27;ed up someone has to be to do that.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t feel like killing them would achieve any of that.<p>How about asking questions, then torturing, then killing. You&#x27;d get the cake and eat it, too.')
