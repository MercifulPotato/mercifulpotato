Their ability to buy or afford a home does not improve. Why would that be preferable?&quot;<p>House prices are a function of interest rates.<p>As interest rates lower, house prices skyrocket because &#x27;everyone can afford to borrow more&#x27; and are pushed into doing so because &#x27;housing is a requirement&#x27;.<p>Ergo - home prices, as a function of income, increase dramatically with low interest rates.<p>By capping mortgage terms, and keeping rates reasonable (NOT too low) and steady, it means that 1) housing ticket prices are lower 2) rents (i.e. those not benefiting from leverage) are lower, 3) the size of of the real economy being dumped into to unproductive assets is smaller.<p>&quot;Lastly, you&#x27;ll make sure that much less capital flows to real estate&quot; - kind of, but not really - you are mixing &#x27;homes&#x27; with &#x27;real estate&#x27;. Those are different things. When homes get built, there is value added, the &#x27;land part&#x27; just economic rent, it&#x27;s a net neutral exercise. If the demand is there for homes, the homes will get built. The frothiness and excess profits won&#x27;t be quite as nice, but they will be built because money can be made.<p>&quot;And you&#x27;re doing all this, artificially. &quot;<p>The entire article is about an &#x27;artificial&#x27; move by the government to provide economic incentives to promote affordability.<p>The ECB (de-facto Danish central bank even though they have their own) &#x27;artificially intevenes&#x27; on the basis of asset prices.<p>&quot;Second, we need to consider government policy to deter hyper-concentration&quot;<p>Yes! And providing home-buying incentives will benefit those with the most capital to leverage, in the biggest cities - and it will &#x27;punish&#x27; renters (higher prices) and leave non-urban dwellers in the lurch as their city dwelling peers gain massive personal wealth over their artificial leverage.')
