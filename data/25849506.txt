What always struck me most about it was the sheer <i>ambition</i> of it - not just the raw scale of the drama, not just setting things up in Season 1 that wouldn&#x27;t pay off until the very end of Season 5 (if Michael O&#x27;Hare hadn&#x27;t needed to be written out), but getting compelling long-term character arcs (especially for Londo and G&#x27;Kar) into small-screen SF for the first time.<p>If I have one major gripe about the show, it&#x27;s the way it was constantly padded out with filler eps at a time when JMS&#x27;s ability to get the core storylines finished was still in doubt. The threat to S5 and resulting hasty rearrangement of S4 meant that the final season didn&#x27;t hit with the weight it could have done; it felt like an afterthought rather than a climax.')
