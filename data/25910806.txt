Item(by='ufo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611620434, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25904042, text='One of the main differences is that LALR parsers don&#x27;t use backtracking to implement &quot;choice&quot;. Parsing happens in a single pass over the input. With parser combinators, ambiguity is silently resolved by accepting the first option that the parser tries. Bottom up LR parsers also do a better job of dealing with left recursion, compared to top down parsers. If you want to parse something using a recursive descent parser (or combinators) you may need to rephrase the grammar to avoid left recursion.<p>Some of the main downsides of LR parsers are that you need to use a parser generator and you have to know how to resolve possible shift&#x2F;reduce conflicts. It&#x27;s more complicated than top down parser, which is just a bunch of regular recursive functions.')
