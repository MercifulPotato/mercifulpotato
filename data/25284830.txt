It&#x27;s also formalized in basic probability theory. The set of number sequences a human would find interesting or surprising is smaller than the set of all number sequences. If all number sequences are equally likely, by the third axiom of probability you&#x27;re more likely to draw an uninteresting number sequence than an interesting number sequence.<p>However that does change the problem statement; we do still expect &quot;123456&quot; to occur equally as often as any other sequence, interesting or not.')
