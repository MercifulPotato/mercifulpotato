I&#x27;d prefer to see Intel work with TSMC and&#x2F;or Samsung to build&#x2F;operate joint fabs or some kind of co-ownership over completely outsourcing.  I&#x27;d prefer to see a few more diverse production locations that include an EU fab, and updated US fab locations.  I&#x27;m concerned about instability with China stretching its&#x27; elbows in the region and I think having more geodiverse locations would be better for everyone involved.<p>It&#x27;s kind of the end of an era and sad to see in a lot of ways.  I do want to see Intel be more competitive as they&#x27;ll probably be treading water in mindshare for the next couple years.<p>Aside: I want to know how much Intel is paying laptop mfgs to keep higher end memory and GPU options out of AMD powered laptops.')
