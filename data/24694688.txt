Many of the products or technologies that have been &quot;killed&quot; were replaced by other compelling products in the space — either by Google itself or by third parties — or could not be monetized. Google is not a public utility and there is little incentive — nay, it would be strictly harmful — for them to continue building products that are non-competitive in the marketplace.<p>Killing products is beneficial and non-monopolistic as it allows other developers to build products as opposed to Google offering them for free ad-infinitum. By contrast, this is in direct opposition to Amazon&#x27;s strategy, which is to offer an incredible number of products and services at a loss, thereby depriving other players from competing. One day, people will realize that Amazon&#x27;s actions unquestionably drove down the quality of products (they already have, one need not look far — just consider the quality of Whole Foods goods post-acquisition or the myriad scam products listed as real on Amazon&#x27;s website).<p>Side-note: should Google have continued to maintain Angular when other solutions are clearly better? What would be the point?
