Item(by='Snild', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611229318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857309, text='&gt; They priced an entire month of music at about £10, the same as a CD. That&#x27;s 720 hours (30 days)<p>Yeah, but who listens for 24 hours a day, all month?<p>Also, that £10 CD can be played infinitely. That&#x27;s <i>infinity</i> hours of music, which comes out to around 0p per hour. That&#x27;s completely unreasonable! ;)<p>The convenience of Spotify converted me from piracy, getting my money back into the recorded music game. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone in that. That 29% cut quoted in the article doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to me, especially when some of that is &quot;new&quot; money. What were the margins of old record shops?<p>That was the main thing I wanted to discuss, but let me also question some assumptions you seem to make.<p>&gt;  the labels have less control to &quot;dictate&quot; or push specific artists.<p>Why is that a problem? The curation and popularity lists are not gone, btw: the streaming services have taken over that role.<p>&gt; The availability of everyone to release their own music has diluted the market so now there is so much volume, nobody gets heard<p>On the flip side, more people get the opportunity to be a little heard. Seems like a win to me. Also, there are definitely still those who are heard more than others.')
