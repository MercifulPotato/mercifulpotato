Signs at the laundromat.<p>I guess the presumption is there needs to be enough clickbait via outrage&#x2F;victimhood to portray the startup as an evildoer by presenting that average people are so completely helpless and inconvenienced by this since they can&#x27;t even tell which door leads outside. Are thinking, Gargling&#x2F;DackDackGoething, and&#x2F;or calling a friend to crash on a couch really so difficult?<p>Perhaps OTOH and in reality though, it was marketed to SV carpet-bagging gold rush-types who have little in the way of business acumen, domain skills, and&#x2F;or inherent relentless resourcefulness as some sort of &quot;quick fix shortcut&quot; housing-meets-social intros to the right crowds? With the exception of badass folks from completely different countries, RR folks would never need such a service because they already know people. It seems like more of a magical service trying to allow people to &quot;buy-in&quot; to the illusion of a social standing rather than earning&#x2F;demonstrating their way in; this is the same as a lot of golf clubs, which doesn&#x27;t confer a sense of community, but who really wants the bar to be so low that anyone is allowed in just because they have money?<p>I&#x27;m conflicted on it at as service, but if it makes some people happy even though they&#x27;re actual stuck at the ITT Technical Institute-Junior Varsity league, whatevs. The story title was a bit clickbait-ish.')
