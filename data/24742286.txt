Perhaps it&#x27;s because of some alignment with our instincts for raising children, perhaps because of some instincts for strengthening a like-minded tribe (what could be more like-minded than a copy of you), perhaps for some other reason I don&#x27;t understand, but the feeling certainly is there that I would prefer having some additional instances&#x2F;copies of me existing in the universe. It&#x27;s not very strong, certainly not on the strength of self-preservation or preventing harm to my loved ones, not a strong desire but more like a preference - but still positive, like, I&#x27;d do that if it doesn&#x27;t cost too much.<p>On the other hand, e.g. sharing half of my wealth or half of the time with my spouse would definitely be too much, so probably <i>that</i> would be a sufficient reason not to make copies unless they&#x27;d be living in a virtual world wher they could get the things they want without a need for scarce resources - which raises the question whether copies of me would <i>actually</i> have a pleasant subjective experience given these constraints.')
