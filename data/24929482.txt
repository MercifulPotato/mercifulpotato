People who behave badly will behave badly. People who don&#x27;t generally won&#x27;t. The drumbeat of CoCs may make some difference at the margins but I&#x27;m skeptical. In any case, as you suggest, a refusal to have a CoC is itself a political statement that sends the message that you don&#x27;t believe in good behavior and is pretty much a non-starter for that reason.<p>In general, they&#x27;re well meant. And in my experience issues arise not so much from the conference organizers but some attendee taking offence over something in a way that most would consider hypersensitive. And the organizers feeling they have to take their side even if they personally disagree.')
