These are minor offences that would be too expensive and burdensome to pursue individually by hand. If it were enforced reliably, almost nobody would do be doing it.<p>People get charged a late penalty for not paying their power bill. It&#x27;s enforced with 100% reliability. But expired inspection tickets is less obnoxious because you can just stop driving your car when it becomes illegal to do so. You can&#x27;t just return electricity you already used but haven&#x27;t paid for yet.<p>If you believe people should drive cars without safety certifications, that&#x27;s a different issue. In that case, the solution isn&#x27;t haphazard enforcement but no enforcement at all.')
