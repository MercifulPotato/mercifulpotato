I thought it was weird, but now I have one and I started to like it. I think Apple did right here in choosing one design and sticking to it through generations. My guess is that they will never deprecate this design, so that it becomes an accepted watch design, but instead will introduce a new competing design for the 10y birthday of the Apple watch.')
