To replace visa we would have to make enough changes to it that I don&#x27;t have much of an idea of what the energy usage of the modified system will look like.<p>Though let&#x27;s consider Nervos&#x27; NC-Max, which gets a lot closer to replacing visa than an unmodified Bitcoin can. It works by, effectively, massively increasing the block size limit. In a NC-Max world energy usage would still be proportional to the coinbase but the coinbase might stay small because there&#x27;s so much room in each block that transaction fees stay low.')
