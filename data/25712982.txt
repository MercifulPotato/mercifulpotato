Sites, companies and services have rules of engagement which if broken even in the flimsiest sense (e.g snark, I&#x27;ve been snarky here and have been rightfully warned). Break those rules of engagement and expect the consequences. I think for those who have issues with this latest outcasting of Parker by the big three, you will have to encourage your government to treat them as utilities and support anti trust cases against them. I predict that suggestion to clash with the libertarian nature of those concerned.')
