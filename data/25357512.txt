I&#x27;m not really aware of any open source projects where I can go submit a PR without talking to anybody and have the expectation that it&#x27;ll be merged without discussion.<p>Bazaar is not a myth at all. The distinction was never &#x27;are patches always merged&#x27; but is the development done in public. The issue with Google projects is more about in-group and out-group and if you&#x27;re not in Google, it&#x27;s hard to be considered &#x27;in-group.<p>But even if the complaint was that all projects had this issue; it&#x27;s just wrong. I&#x27;ve made and received plenty of drive by contributions with no discussion before the PR was made. You can&#x27;t expect it to be merged any more than you can expect a romantic interest to agree to a date. But that&#x27;s just interacting with people.')
