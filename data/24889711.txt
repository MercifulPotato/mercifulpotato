This is the land of Dunning-Kruger and nobody should ever directly believe anything here, no matter how trustworthy it seems.<p>Always verify.<p>If effort was put into censoring bad information, that might instill a false sense of trust that could never be met by mods. Instead, effort should be put into making sure everyone knows to be skeptical. That, to me, seems more in line with how this site operates.<p>If people want to be believed, they should cite authoritative sources.')
