So by definition a sound isolating case has poor airflow. Poor airflow could require you to run your fans at higher RPMs to compensate, which is then introducing more noise than you would have had with a more open case that could run low RPM fans.<p>Gamers Nexus did a good piece on this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamersnexus.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;3391-airflow-vs-silent-cases-noise-normalized-thermals-silent-base-601" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gamersnexus.net&#x2F;guides&#x2F;3391-airflow-vs-silent-ca...</a><p>(as he points out, there are still reasons to prefer sound isolating cases, it&#x27;s just not as much of a clear win as it might sound at first)')
