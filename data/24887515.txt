The stroop effect, and that&#x27;s it to be honest. Can you supply some more?<p>&gt;Can you explain why you do not believe IQ to be rigorous?<p>That&#x27;s a much longer and more complicated argument than what I&#x27;m saying, which is simply that IQ is not anywhere near the most essential nor the most studied question in psychology. Classical conditioning is another. Attachment and critical periods in developmental psychology have received a lot of attention. In particular, pretty much any effect which generalizes in a simple and reliable way from humans to animals is easier to experiment on and has a stronger evidence base than IQ: instinctual drift, childhood amnesia, most of the theory of perception, etc.<p>The actual content and priorities of psychology as a field of scientific research is quite different from the few topics which get debated with unreasonably high frequency on the Internet.')
