Actually we have a C helper per instruction and generate IR blocks full of CALLs to such helpers. Then the inliner and other optimizations take care of doing their work.<p>Anyway, if you never used LLVM, be ready to spend some time getting familiar with its IR and its C++ magic (though as a user I never had too much trouble... and I&#x27;m not a C++ guy).
