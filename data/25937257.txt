From another comment I made:<p>&gt; <i>Why is a Audi &quot;worth&quot; $60K but a VW &quot;worth&quot; $30K? A Porsche &quot;worth&quot; over $100K? Why is a Patek Philippe or A. Lange &amp; Söhne Tourbillon watch worth $100K? Why should I pay $300 for one All-Clad pan when for the same price I can get a 10-piece set at Costco?</i><p>[…]<p>&gt; <i>And to go back to my first paragraph: a Porsche is not &quot;worth&quot; $100K to me—because I&#x27;m not willing to pay for it, or even for an Audi. But it may be &quot;worth&quot; it to someone else because they are willing to pay for it.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25935968" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25935968</a><p>It&#x27;s a convenient fiction that allows for a complicated society to run relatively smoothly, but it&#x27;s a fiction nonetheless when you get down to it (IMHO).')
