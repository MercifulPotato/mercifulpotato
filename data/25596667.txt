From what I can tell, NDI is video codec intended for use in broadcast studios (high-quality, high-bandwidth, some compression but not a lot, UDP, assumes a local non-lossy network), and there&#x27;s a batch of tools around it to emit&#x2F;accept those streams: mixing decks, monitors, routers, etc. Resolution and frame rate seem excellent, latency feels to be about 1.0 seconds.<p>Bonus points: it&#x27;s made by NewTek, the original Amiga Video Toaster folks.')
