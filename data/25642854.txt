Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=[25650247], score=None, time=1609829366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631717, text='&quot;Contractor&quot; is a bit of a misnomer in the case of Google (and other tech companies). You have FTEs and &quot;TVC&quot;s, which is a large group of non-Google employees (of which contractors, the &quot;C&quot; is by far the smallest). The largest are &quot;V&quot;, the Vendors. Employees of third party companies contracted to Google to do <i>stuff</i>. Vendors do all kinds of things: clean, cook, manual QA work where necessary, drive cars, etc.<p>The vast majority of the TVCs Google works with are Vendors, and most of them are paid much, much less than tech employees, because they aren&#x27;t tech employees. But there are a variety of other requirements around working with vendors. The ability to give them gifts, recognition, and treat them like human people is limited by labor law, as if you start to treat them too much like everyone else at the office, they suddenly turn into Employees, despite being employed by a Vendor company, and Google really doesn&#x27;t want this to happen.')
