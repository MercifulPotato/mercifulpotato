Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610134570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687936, text='I don&#x27;t think ISPs should be in the business of deciding what content is allowed or disallowed. If there&#x27;s illegal content, that&#x27;s a different thing. But politically disagreeable content? Infrastructure and utility services should not be permitted to make decisions about that even if they are private entities. And I extend this to Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. since they all are so big that their ability to censor and control speech is comparable to a government&#x27;s power. And if you can&#x27;t exercise speech on those platforms, which are now the public town square, then you effectively don&#x27;t have that right. Put another way, they are utilities and should be regulated&#x2F;treated like a public entity.')
