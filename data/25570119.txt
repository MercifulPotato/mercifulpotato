You don&#x27;t have to invest that money in the same country where that money was created in the first place. If you exchange USD for yuan and the Chinese exclusively buy US assets with their newly acquired USD then there is no reason for workers to produce anything in the US. The factory can be in China after all.<p>In theory you could build housing with that money and employ construction workers but that is crazy talk in the US.')
