Item(by='ericmay', descendants=None, kids=[25449083], score=None, time=1608147840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25447400, text='&gt; Let&#x27;s start by assuming that the city has a reason for their stance; as I assume you do for thinking that politics in the city is out of control.<p>Not really sure what you&#x27;re trying to get at here.<p>&gt; Requiring your own name to appear on everything from street signs to labcoats for fifty years as part of the conditions of the donation, however, seems unusual at the least<p>Maybe. I mean if I had a hospital renamed after me I&#x27;d probably want that too, but if it was unusual or the hospital didn&#x27;t want to do that, certainly they could have either not accepted the money or tried to remove that requirement? Here in Columbus where I live we have the Wexner Medical Center which is named for Les Wexner who is the co-founder of Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Limited Brands. Physicians, nurses, and staff wear a logo on their uniforms which says The Ohio State University and then under it Wexner Medical Center.<p>So at a minimum, it&#x27;s at least not unusual to me. Although yea sure I can see how people can say they don&#x27;t like it and whatnot.<p>&gt; It&#x27;ll probably all become clearer with time if you talk to people rather than antagonize them.<p>If you&#x27;re speaking to me, I&#x27;d like to know who you think I&#x27;m not talking to (or talking to) and who I&#x27;m antagonizing or not antagonizing.<p>If you find my statement about politics in San Francisco to be antagonistic, well, I apologize that you feel that way but I also believe that statement based on the variety of news sources I read, comments and news stories here on Hacker News, and my own opinion from having visited a few times and seen first hand how some policies have affected the city.')
