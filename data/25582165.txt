IntelliJ IDEs have been my go-to since giving it a try during the End of the World sale in 2013. The IDEs have a robust feature set that makes development a pure joy.  That joy has subsided in recent years with performance on Mac Intel. There are several open YouTrack issues regarding this: looking to move to Metal; 4k external monitor performance issues; scrolling.<p>This release makes the IDE so incredibly fast! Indexing dependencies happens magnitudes faster than Intel version.  With many of my projects I have used in it, if you tried to hold your breath from the time you started the IDE until it was ready to begin editing you&#x27;d have passed out unconscious. Now, the IDE is ready to begin work quicker than you could recover from a heavy sneeze!  It IS a breath of fresh air.  Searching all files is about instantaneous; navigating file trees is snappy and responsive; opening Settings modals happens quickly.  What a joy!')
