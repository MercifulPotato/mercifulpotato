This is a problem only few worry about, the system is perfectly happy the way it is.<p>This whole incentive - corruption relation reminds me about greek democracy: You want to chose the leader that doesn&#x27;t want to be chosen, so that he would not have incentives. The athenians also chose people at random instead of elections, to minimize the chance of picking someone with special interests.')
