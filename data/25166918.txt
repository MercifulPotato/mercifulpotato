I don&#x27;t think the average person realizes how bad it is.<p>I abandoned a financially successful independent contracting business of 15 years and went back to being an employee (ugh) because the Republican efforts to repeal the ACA freaked me out. I&#x27;m old enough that my wife and I both have some pre-existing non-chronic conditions, and I have a young daughter. Paying ~$20K of premiums annually for the privilege of having a $13K deductible was grudgingly acceptable to me. The uncertainty was not. The stress of wondering if insurance was going to be available year-to-year (in the final year I operated the business my County had exactly one marketplace plan available) was extreme.<p>I happened to get a job offer from a Customer. I decided that, though I swore I&#x27;d never be anybody&#x27;s employee again, it was irresponsible in light of the efforts by the GOP to repeal the ACA to continue gambling that insurance would be available.<p>I had a taste of being uninsured in 2014 when, on pre-ACA grandfathered insurance, I had to pay out-of-pocket for treatment related to a pre-existing condition that wasn&#x27;t covered. The idea of just how close we all are to a medically-induced bankruptcy really hit me at that point.<p>My quality of life is much worse now. I used to bill in 20 hours what I now have to report to the office &quot;40 hours&quot; to earn. I used to be able to spend more time with my family. I used to have the flexibility to make decisions about how and when I wanted to work, take time off, etc.<p>My Customers, some of whom I&#x27;d worked with for 10+ years, ended up stuck going with drastically more expensive (and less attentive and skilled) &quot;managed services&quot; companies to service their IT needs. The emails and calls that I get regularly asking for my help, along with the out-right statements to the fact, tell me that the situation for them isn&#x27;t better either.<p>It&#x27;s a racket.')
