However there is strong evidence of those who instated censorship creating vast swathes of human destruction.<p>The most egregious I can think of is the Russian government after the Bolshevik revolution.  It had the death penalty for being in possession of certain books.  In the end these censorship loving people (for other people, not them) killed tens of millions of people they governed (gulags, deliberate starvation of masses of people for instance), yet it is hardly talked about.<p>These bad effects of not censoring that people talk about seem so pitiful and small compared to what has happened when people willing to censor other people have got into power.  Seriously, people stating things like &#x27;sunlight is the best disinfectant&quot; does not seem to have much evidence going for it&#x27; are promoting things that totalitarian groups are very pleased to have, and despite asking for evidence, they provide no evidence that what they are trying to push is not far worse than what they are purportedly against. Along with the destruction of freedom that censorship brings to all the people that it applies to.  Those that promote censorship can not be hypocritical and start with themselves first, but they won&#x27;t,  I&#x27;m sure they will scream loudest about how horrible censorship is if some other group got the power to censor what they may want to say.')
