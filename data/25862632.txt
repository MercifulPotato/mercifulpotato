I think it&#x27;s in the area that typically elicits antigen response.  That&#x27;s super bad news.  If you look carefully, it&#x27;s near the cleft of a representative antibody (fig 1a), and the buried surface area is high across the board on (clinically?) sampled antibodies (fig 1e), suggesting its importance.<p>2) it&#x27;s a mutation that changes the charge state of one of the amino acid residues.  E-&gt;K, changes a negative charge to a positive charge, potentially very bad if typically antibodies have a positive surface charge to interact with it, now they will be repelled.  Since individual humans make random antibodies, even if there is no charge interaction, K amino acid is bigger than E, and so there is likely a shape interaction that could get disrupted by the &quot;new bump&quot; in the spike.<p>Is it a serious cause for concern?  Yeah, almost certainly.  The current round of vaccinations will probably be rendered inactive.<p>IMO the fastest way around this is to quickly approve a reformulation of the moderna&#x2F;pfizer vaccines that encode for the new amino acid, or better yet, a cocktail of both.<p>For the more traditional protein-based vaccines, it could be more challenging, because the gut feeling is that an amino acid change like this could pose more of a risk to the effectiveness of the formulation for delivery of the vaccine (mrna is more &quot;neutral&quot; information medium that typically exerts less of a chemical change to the delivered product when altered).<p>In any case this emergent phenomenon will be certainly challenging to the regulatory landscape around vaccination.<p>disclaimer: I own MRNA stock.')
