I&#x27;m sure many of us watched the original SANS broadcast (which wasn&#x27;t for public release; youtube-dl is a great tool. I download everything before I start watching it now before it disappears).<p>In the SANS report a research tries to discredit people who claim this is CIA or a US state sponsored operation, yet also claim there is clear evidence of a &quot;signature&quot; from &quot;Cozy Bear&quot; ... what is this signature? Shell code? A known compiler flag? FireEye and SANS have released zero information on this or anything that connects things to Cozy Bear.<p>Also from that report, there were excluded IP ranges that were all Microsoft IPs (not all of the Microsoft IPs, but all the ranges belonged to Microsoft).<p>Vault 7 shows the NSA and CIA are involved in domestic operations (and if you go back far enough Church Committee) and there is a chance this was a US based State Actor. Let&#x27;s not forget about STUX.<p>The level of this attack was incredibly sophisticated. It had built-in delays for several days to avoid network sandboxing tests in the CI&#x2F;CD pipeline. It was signed and released from Solarwinds CI&#x2F;CD pipleine as well.<p>Let&#x27;s not dismiss Snowden so easily and not realize this could have been an American state actor as well (or even the UK, the EU or any other &quot;allay&quot; or enemy).')
