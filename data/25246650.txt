Economist try to turn consumer behavior into a science governed by rigid laws like Physics. Rory shows in Alchemy that consumer behavior is soemething akin to a soap bubble made of a spongy rubbery material - translucent, confounding, delightful and liable to bursting but sometimes resilient.<p>The only thing that bothers me the use of the word non-linear in the context of rules - e.g. how increasing the price for some products makes demand goes up in direct contradiction of the the linear rules of economics which dictate the opposite.  I guess by non-linear they mean <i>not</i>-linear but my brain sees non-linear in a mathematical context ;)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B071DCWRG3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B071DCWRG3</a>')
