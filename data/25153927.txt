It seems most, not just in mathematics, feel that learning is the same as if the student can simply be played a tape that cannot be paused or rewound but can sometimes be sped up. Nearly nothing works like this, and it’s just that the penalties in mathematics are greater.<p>I think of the ideal learning path as a sort of circular, recursive path that bends back and goes back over itself from time to time. Imagine a human painting a canvas. One does not simply do a raster scan, painting pixel by pixel in a linear fashion. By the time the painting is done, the piece has been gone over multiple times with multiple layers of finer and finer detail. A painting is a mishmash of broad and finer strokes, with some layers simply forming foundational layers for the later portions.<p>A pyramid is the wrong metaphor. In my opinion, learning mathematics should be like creating a painting.<p>One of the best examples of this I know of is the book <i>Advanced Calculus: A Differential Forms Approach</i> by Harold Edwards. The first three chapters introduce the material heuristically. The next three chapters circle back on the material, thoroughly proving everything introduced in the first three chapters. The remaining chapters greet the student with applications and extensions of the material. In the preface, Edwards states that he wanted the book to be able to be opened to any page and be read and make sense. It’s a wonderful goal, and he achieves it.')
