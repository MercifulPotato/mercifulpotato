Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[24732807, 24733263, 24732239], score=None, time=1602257061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729370, text='The meme war between the two camps on either side of the conspiracy theory divide is quite interesting if you&#x27;re able to view it from a <i>truly</i> disinterested (disable your priors) and abstract (observe the <i>nature</i> of the discussions, not the topic) third party perspective.<p>The anti-conspiracy-theory camp can read an individual conspiracy theory and identify erroneous assertions and logic, with ease.  Similarly, the pro-conspiracy-theory camp can read an individual mainstream news article and identify erroneous assertions and logic, with ease.  And then when observing each other&#x27;s camps (in sufficient qualtities over a long period of time), they each consider the other community to be foolish (and unaware of it) in an aggregate sense.  <i>And they&#x27;re both correct</i>.<p>The anti-conspiracy-camp is correct in that if one spends any time in the conspiracy community, it is not difficult to observe that many of them clearly <i>and passionately</i> believe things, with absolute certainty, for which there is not sufficient <i>conclusive</i> supporting evidence.  Similarly, the pro-conspiracy camp is correct in that if one spends any time in mainstream communities, it is not difficult to observe that many of them clearly <i>and passionately</i> believe things, with absolute certainty, for which there is not sufficient <i>conclusive</i> supporting evidence (aka: axioms).<p>Members from both communities will take offence (usually &quot;quite&quot; passionately) at some portion of the above, and attempt to rebut the assertion in the standard form:<p>[rhetoric, narrative, &quot;logic&quot;, &quot;common sense&quot;, &quot;facts&quot;&#x2F;axioms&#x2F;intuitions <i>presented as</i> facts] + [<i>and then therefore</i> we shall conclude...]&quot;<p>...but there will almost always be a flaw in the respective rebuttals: invalid epistemology.<p>At least part of the reason these two camps cannot have a productive dialogue and agree to a compromise <i>somewhere</i> &quot;in the middle&quot;...to agree on <i>some</i> things (that which they agree on) and only disagree, explicitly and precisely, <i>on the subset of points where disagreement actually(!!) exists</i>, is because both camps suffer from <i>loose epistemology</i> - a willingness (and often, <i>extreme eagerness</i>) to believe things (<i>that are consistent with their priors</i>) to be True(!!!), without adequate and conclusive supporting evidence.  So, the minds then seem to develop a kind of all-or-nothing, total war defence of each respective <i>comprehensive</i> idea they hold (each of which is typically <i>riddled</i> with errors and untruths), and hilarity inevitably ensues.<p>I think the same argument is also quite applicable to many other realms, politics being perhaps the most obvious.<p>I wonder...if members of the two camps could come to realize the above, might it diminish the ability of those in power to so easily pit them against each other in a never ending cultural meme war, and in turn free up their minds and time <i>to be able to</i> more closely <i>and skilfully</i> observe and analyze the actions of those in power (who can currently operate largely unmonitored, unanalyzed, and unopposed, who can censor anything that gets too dangerous to their interests with &lt;some semi-plausible reason&gt;...something which is in the best interests both camps, and typically the majority of all peoples regardless of group affiliation?  And if we extended this principle even more broadly, across all current hot-button topics in the country, and in the international world, could we maybe usher in an era of more calm, reasoned, cooperation between various parties who disagree on a few specific details, but largely agree (but don&#x27;t realize it) on the vast majority of issues from the &quot;big picture&quot; perspective?')
