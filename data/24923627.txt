They seem factual and specific with some background thrown in. When you twice asked for it to be toned down, I went looking to find offense and couldn’t.<p>Contributing to open-source by stating concerns as a user of the system is a minor positive way to contribute. Writing docs for workarounds is a greater positive. Contributing code patches is a yet greater way, but those don’t take away from the fact the filing bugs (literally or conversationally) is still a positive action.')
