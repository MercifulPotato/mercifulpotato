Waymo has been doing amazing work, but the problem is that they PR department is a little bit too good at it&#x27;s job.<p>Waymo has these kinds of announcements very couple of months (sometimes more often) and if you don&#x27;t pay close attention all of them sound like Waymo finally had a breakthrough. But if you look closer each of them is only small incremental progress from their last announcement. In this case, Waymo was already doing driverless rides and they also didn&#x27;t open them up to everyone. So even though I think that Waymo is making great progress towards a self-driving future, I understand that people get Waymo announcement fatigue.')
