Ctrl + H on Firefox, click the top-left dropdown for Bitwarden.<p>&gt; 2. If you open up bitwarden before the page is loaded, it says it can&#x27;t find the password box to fill in. This is probably an extension limitation, but still annoying.<p>The sidebar trick above also helps this issue. When it can&#x27;t find the password box you just click the &quot;refresh&quot; icon on the Bitwarden sidebar and it&#x27;ll fill it in. This limitation may be by design so it doesn&#x27;t have constant access to everything you browse, only allows a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the HTML to fill in when loaded (or refreshed) - complete guess though.')
