It&#x27;s also more flexible in that, if I decide later to bring others onboard, there&#x27;s no need to later rebrand into a business.<p>However, it does add a level of obfuscation and I find it more difficult to speak directly to my experience and what I have to offer. I can state all the same things, but the content is buried deeper.<p>What do you think?')
