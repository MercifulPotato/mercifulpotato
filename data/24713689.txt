They needed one so they copied the Java api and created one from there. They did not use the Api to create a compatability layer. It was used as a starting point to make their own copy of Java.<p>This <i>isn&#x27;t</i> an argument that has been made in court in anyway, and Google&#x27;s use of the Java <i>language</i> hasn&#x27;t been questioned.<p>Google could have used the Java language with completely different APIs (<i>google.lang</i> instead of <i>java.lang</i> for example). It&#x27;s the APIs that this case is about.<p>Also, the key analogy is wrong anyway: while Android used java.lang and java.util and other related APIs, the key functionality of the phone was accessible via custom APIs that aren&#x27;t copied. Note that the &quot;interoperability&quot; argument was lost by Google because of this exact thing.')
