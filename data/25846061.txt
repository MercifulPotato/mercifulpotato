Like someone else pointed out, it&#x27;s already the case in animation that the pros do the keyframes or even concept art, and the interns&#x2F;low-paid workers do the rest of the frames. <i>Maybe</i> this could be automated and it&#x27;d be a win.<p>In the general case I&#x27;m still skeptical though. Consider the case of comics, with the jobs of penciller and inker. Is the inker an automatable job? Do they not add important artistic decisions to what at first sight would seem like a merely mechanical job, to the point some inkers have their own fan base? (And, it is argued, a good inker can &quot;make or break&quot; the pencil art). And if this is true, could it be also the case that even the lowly in-betweener brings his&#x2F;her small grain of artistic input to the final piece?')
