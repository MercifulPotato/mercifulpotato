At best a tiny settlement after years of litigation. Congress will have a few hearings for show, so reps can get face time and claim to be &quot;for the people&quot;. SEC will wag their finger, might even levy a few hundred thousand in fines.<p>Citadel and gang operate this casino. If they think they&#x27;re losing, they change the rules so they aren&#x27;t.<p>What it tells me is that they&#x27;re getting increasingly desperate if they&#x27;re willing to brazenly manipulate the market like this. Seems like they didn&#x27;t close out their short position, like they claimed they had 2 days ago. It&#x27;d be interesting to see if the casino wins this game.')
