I am not justifying one company&#x27;s actions based on another unrelated company&#x27;s poor business decisioins.<p>I am stating that given this deal with Microsoft, the &quot;Open&quot; in OpenAI&#x27;s name is now meaningless and&#x2F;or dishonest. I used the example of Progress&#x2F;OpenEdge as another example of a company putting &quot;open&quot; right into their name but failing to live up to their name - implying that Progress&#x27; name-change (and also: OpenAI&#x27;s initial name) was a cynical marketing ploy to make people believe they&#x27;re the _good guys_ in all this, especially when the AI&#x2F;ML field has many detractors from the altruistic camps, especially after Deep-Fakes, Palantir, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook have all left a bad taste in everyone&#x27;s&#x27; mouth.')
