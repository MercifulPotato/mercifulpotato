However, you&#x27;ll never drive a Tesla and buy $4000 road bikes when you&#x27;re on $27k&#x2F;y.<p>&gt; Just because a software engineer in SF can make $100k&#x2F;year doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s what the position is worth<p>It means exactly that in a free market capitalism (and while we&#x27;re not living in a pure free market, we&#x27;re not _that_ far). Why would a company overpay? (Sometimes they do, but not 4x, and not consistently.) In case everyone&#x27;s massively overpaying in SV, then you could just start a company there and pay people half the salaries and be extremely competitive.')
