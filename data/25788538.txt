That looks interesting I’ll check it out and add it to the list of topics to revisit.<p>Summarized in another comment but I am a bit worried about hand tracking for a couple reasons. Also mentioned in reply to another comment, but will summarize here for convenience as well!<p>1. While I know there is promising tech in this area (and I am very interested in it!) the tolerance for error while playing&#x2F;performing music is slim to none. Will a solution end up being 75% accurate? 90%? Both are two low IMO. Pure MIDI keeps things in a relatively more controllable realm<p>2. Camera rigging. There are just so many variables here for things to go wrong&#x2F;right. Quality of the camera, position, lighting. It’s challenging just finding a good method of positioning a camera even if you have the right equipment to locate it.<p>All that said, I’ll still reinvestigate this zone of ideas in the future and your insight is much appreciated! First, need to prove that I can make the simple case work as well as I think I can :)')
