Some should face the inescapable truth: no one cares. Another year and it&#x27;s the same BS without change. As is the plan.<p>At the advent of anything, it won&#x27;t matter. They&#x27;ll just be some place.<p>People want to work there still? Separate from just wanting to work (who wants to be unemployed)? Why? It was stupid to be that way as far back as 2003, as they had already IPO&#x27;d by then. Stupid like an idiot trying to buy once&#x2F;since a stock started to surge upward. Stupid. Anything after is in a class by itself.<p>I wonder how they are viewed among young people now. Both college students and those with 2 or so years of experience. Hmmm..<p>Maybe it&#x27;s still the same.')
