In the office, I have often the situation &quot;Gosh, I&#x27;d love to finish this, but if I don&#x27;t catch the next train I have to wait another half hour for the next one&quot;, which automatically makes me stop work at fixed times.<p>Sure, I could also just stop at the same time at home, but ultimately I always end up working longer hours. Same in the morning; having to catch a train is really something that forces me to hit certain timings; when working from home, staying in bed just a little longer doesn&#x27;t make me miss any trains.<p>It&#x27;s a silly problem and could easily be overcome with enough willpower, but it requires the willpower where otherwise there are already external factors in place that soft-force me to start&#x2F;stop work.')
