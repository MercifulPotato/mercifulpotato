If you’re on call, you’re obligated to your employer.  If you’re obligated to your employer, you should be getting paid.<p>If your employer wants to pay you for time that you spend at home doing non work stuff until they call, that’s up to them.<p>How is the pressure of “on call” any different than any other day at work? Unless you mean that your employer wants you to work 7 days a week, with 2 of them where you’re at home waiting to get a call.  But then that issue is working 7 days a week.')
