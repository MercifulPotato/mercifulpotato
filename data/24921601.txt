So unlike a &quot;standard podcast&quot; we don&#x27;t upload Artifacts into Spotify, Stitcher, etc.<p>Instead we share Artifact episodes with you (the buyer in this case) via your Artifact account. You can then share out each episode as as weblink via text message, email, or however you prefer to share with your parents and they can listen from the browser on their mobile phone or computer. Example here of an Artifact that we are authorized by the interview guests to share publicly: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heyartifact.com&#x2F;daryl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heyartifact.com&#x2F;daryl</a><p>So, no set up required!<p>Of course, happy to further clarify &#x2F; answer any additional questions you might have - we&#x27;d love the opportunity to serve you as a customer.')
