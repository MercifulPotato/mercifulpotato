Growing food for your family should not be a crime. What a racket. We might as well find people guilty of conspiricy to commit murder simply because they didn&#x27;t report a murderer when they saw them speeding prior to the crime. It could have stopped it!<p>The reason it&#x27;s supposed to go that other way is because you are to be assumed innocent until proven guilty. Any benefit of doubt or uncertainty is supposed to go to the defense.')
