That&#x27;s a bummer because obviously you want to do native operations of these, datediff, datepart, etc. without having to cast all over the place. We manually set them to timestamp and they work perfect (awesome!), even in Athena, so we thought the problem was solved.<p>However, once we did anything with those columns in Glue ETL, those fields got set as nulls.<p>The problem can be fixed of course, but these types of issues happen fairly often and they quietly fail (no errors, just values set to null).')
