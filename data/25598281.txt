How it will replace fiat, how it will revolutionize banking, how it will continue to go up in price.<p>The fact is that the technology powering Bitcoin is not great. There are better alternatives to Bitcoin, transactions still take a long time to finish on Bitcoin. And the alternatives themselves need to be refined too.<p>There are also still a lot of scam coins in play, I personally know a few founders (no relation and no business doing work with them), where they admitted to me their coin was a scam in them getting rich.<p>So I’m skeptical, very very skeptical. These “friends” got rich off poor chaps looking to make a quick buck. I am almost envious, then I remember that the feds or IRS or some other institution will come after then at some point.<p>One of them is paying off their current user base because they got hacked.')
