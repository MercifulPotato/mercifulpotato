So if an area has nothing but single story homes, and we raze every single one and replace it with two story homes that have twice the occupancy, it would only reduce rents by 10%?<p>I&#x27;m also somewhat annoyed that NIMBYs everywhere, regardless of political preference, seem to ignore the elephant in the room of giant employee&#x2F;education campuses. High home values need demand to support them, and that comes from lotsa people. Controlling campus size to me seems like the most straightforward way to control home prices, but then you lose out on that juicy, juicy revenue&#x2F;spending.')
