(of course people shouldnt be that political, they&#x27;re all on the same team, etc etc). it&#x27;s less useful because Product, Marketing, Community all could feasibly lay claim to this same metric, and importantly, when its not doing well, they each can blame the other.<p>objection 2:<p>internal politics aside, i think my primary source of discomfort comes from 2 angles - A) punting the &quot;what is the value of community&quot; question to the &quot;what % of our signups are organic&quot; question (which as we know is often up for manipulation&#x2F;debate), and B) ARR from services doesn&#x27;t count?<p>anyway, its no worse than the nothing we currently have, so i think a worthwhile exercise, even if not objective.')
