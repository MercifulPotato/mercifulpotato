I believe that Free Speech is one of the most important rights we have, but I also believe that people utilize their free speech to mislead and do harm.<p>While it would be nice to believe that &quot;the solution is simple more free speech&quot;, and that the truth will win out in the end, is not fully backed up by the evidence. Lies can be carefully crafted to exploit the way human brains work, to mislead people into believing them... the truth is limited, because it has to be true.<p>So what do we do? I am not able to read the article, but it sounds like they are arguing for some limits on free speech. I share the concerns that people on here, like yourself, have about that. So what techniques can we use to stop misinformation that don&#x27;t rely on limiting free speech? We can&#x27;t just sit back and hope the truth will come through, we have too many examples in history to know that doesn&#x27;t always happen.<p>If we just sit back and wait for the truth to win out, we might end up in a world where the people using free speech to mislead grab enough power to stop people from using the truth to fight their misinformation.')
