Item(by='WindyLakeReturn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610330239, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25719802, text='Our current law makes a sharp divide between children and adults, but I think when you ignore the current law and instead look at the reasoning and the data we have, the comparison is pretty sound.  The gap in knowledge and domain specific reasoning ability between the average child and adult is smaller than the gap between the average adult and a corporate team of lawyers.  While I think that is already a sign the issue needs to be considered, we have corporations exploiting this knowledge gap to their advantage.  There are also many countries have recognized this as a problem and have developed different attempted solutions, such as creating limits on what sort of contracts can be enforced.<p>So I do not see how the overall idea can be dismissed as nonsense.')
