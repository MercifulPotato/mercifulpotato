They said it was sort of yes and no because he said  “you have to show strength” and “demand that Congress do the right thing”.  No those are not telling people to storm congress, in the context of what he was saying before, this clearly refers to showing strength and making demands in the form of a protest.  The answer is just No.  He did not say this.  They didn&#x27;t even give this a &quot;Mostly false&quot; and give a spiel about how &quot;He encouraged people to protest at the capital + his supporters may have interpreted his words that way&quot;, they said it was half-true, it was mixture, that claim is no more false than it is true.

I just ignore the ratings they give at this point, the articles are much better.')
