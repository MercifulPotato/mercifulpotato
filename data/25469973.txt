It&#x27;s very much possible (and common) to give away software without giving away any rights to it.<p>If that was the only point GNU was trying to make, I&#x27;d be in full support.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be their only point.

And I think that&#x27;s nonsense (again, after the first sale).<p>Am I wrong to read their philosophy this way?')
