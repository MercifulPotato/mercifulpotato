And once you do get a `File` you know that from then on it can&#x27;t be null.<p>On the other hand, using a nullable `File` requires that you remember the null check. And that you remember it for every function that takes a `File`. Yes, that last part shouldn&#x27;t be necessary with sufficient care but historically people do make mistakes that go unnoticed when refactoring or generally just editing code or reusing functions in large projects.')
