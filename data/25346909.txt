When not in use, when I&#x27;m out (say I&#x27;m about to check-out at the grocery store and don&#x27;t want to be rude), they hang on my neck. I&#x27;m not going to want to carry around an empty carrying case at the same time that I&#x27;m using my device so that I can neatly put it away when NOT in use. Maybe overnight, if there&#x27;s some benefit?<p>I suppose if they were in a suitcase, it could prevent damage? But airports are one of the main places I love over-the-ear headphones, so they wouldn&#x27;t be in my bag. Also, if in a bag, you wouldn&#x27;t want the carrying strap because it just adds bulk.')
