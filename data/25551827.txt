But many countries have similar weird rules about this. In the UK the fee is about Â£400 so not too bad, but for instance in Poland the only way to do this is to write a letter addressed to the current President of Poland and only they can grant it(my understanding is that they always do, it&#x27;s pretty much an automated process, but you do actually have to send a letter to the president).')
