Item(by='sparkplug94', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610515750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752397, text='There is a lot of not-quite-correct information about Egyptian hieroglyphs in the replies to this comment. Hieroglyphs are actually a hybrid system, incorporating uniliteral glyphs (representing a single consonant sound), bi- and triliteral glyphs (representing two or three consonants), and logograms, representing a full word or concept. They also include &quot;determinatives,&quot; which are basically helpful pictures at the end of a word that tells you something about the category of the word. Sometimes, a word incorporates all three types of symbol. For example, the word &quot;Ra,&quot; if it refers to the sun god, might have the two consonants r and &#x27; (which is close to a), followed by a picture of the sun, followed by the seated god determinative.<p>So I guess the real answer here is that the Egyptian writing system incorporates elements of alphabets and logographs, used together. Vowels were (mostly) not marked, though some &quot;consonants&quot; are treated as vowels in transliteration. I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the distinction is there.')
