The issue is just who to assign the &quot;alpha&quot; term to: Alpha wolf is the top of the hierarchy, not the strongest.<p>This post just wants to redefine the &quot;top&quot; wolf, because of specifics of his knowledge: that strength is not the defining factor of alpha wolves, which is fine, but it seems to be like a grammar nazi yelling &quot;well, actually, it&#x27;s spelled xxx&quot;.<p>If a wolf can&#x27;t keep up a fight then it is bound to be killed unless every time he gets into a fight 10 other wolves defend him, in which case he&#x27;s not weak anymore: he won a numbers game, or a social game, whatever, in other words, he&#x27;s strong, the because is irrelevant, but in this case it is because he probably has a family and&#x2F;or is useful to other wolves.<p>In the end, the alpha wolf is an alpha wolf because he&#x27;s resourceful. It could be a purple wolf, maybe you want to call it monkey wolf, I don&#x27;t care, he is still the &#x27;top of the hierarchy&#x27; wolf and I will simplify this to &quot;alpha&quot;.')
