For example, language learning tends to focus on single-phase progress. In practice, a tourist such as myself, bad at many languages, will study before a trip and hope it all comes together during the trip. One realistically doesn&#x27;t continue studying during a trip, but one&#x27;s mind shortens available connections to develop a working facility. This favors committing a radio play to memory, over the staggered recall patterns of single-phase language study. Von Neumann could recall entire books, but in sequence. That&#x27;s key.<p>For keyboards, the most novel designs are better at intense coding sessions, but worse at hunt-and-peck finding an arrow key, or muting one&#x27;s computer in the middle of the night before the dog wakes everyone up. For me, the middle &quot;tap&#x2F;hold&quot; zone of my Leopold FC660C is perfect for long coding and typing sessions, while the periphery does a great job of supporting casual use.')
