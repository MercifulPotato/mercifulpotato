Emotional vibe in the limbic system retrieves motor agency to recite a fact and relay it.<p>Our society pushes constant contact. Our cortex responds in that habit.<p>Over time the dialog with a friend seemed superfluous. As if my cortex finally learned to ignore that as part of fact retrieval.<p>Just a weird vibe from a one time shroom head. YMMV')
