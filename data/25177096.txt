For example I think if you asked John Carmack about pragmatic programming he probably wouldn&#x27;t spend a chapter on the importance of a knowing a text editor inside out because he has always used an IDE. Or the emphasis on using a scripting language and pipes etc to automate processing of text streams. Not a lot of that going on in game programming. Also, the authors tend to pontificate a bit which is fine but not what I would have thought to be primarily &quot;pragmatic&quot;')
