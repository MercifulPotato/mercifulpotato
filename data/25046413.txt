Usually the odds are reaching 1 vs 98 toward the end, because the betting platform is limiting the multiplier to about that and because there&#x27;s actually money to make there in the last few percents.<p>Things do happen in the last second and results do change after a match (goal in the last second in football, horse falling in horse racing, candidate disqualified, re-scoring). For this event it&#x27;s relatively normal for the betting company to wait until the candidate is in the white house before redistributing the money.<p>What is unusual here is for the odds to be this close this late in the game. We&#x27;re at a fairly late point in the election when the outcome is relatively settled, is there 10% chance for trump to win?<p>The money is real, indicating there are many people who think so. Yes you (and 9 other people) could bet £1 on Biden and hope to make £1.10 back, because there&#x27;s one person on the other side willing to bet £1 on Trump hoping to make £10 back.<p>P.S.
