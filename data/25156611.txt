What is the cost model for software? How do you\nmeasure the cost of an abstraction vs. duplication?<p>It’s really silly to argue about this stuff. This claim has no evidence. For example, I feel the exact opposite, that abstracting early always makes it easier to refactor, and does not prevent ending up at better abstractions later on in any way.<p>I _feel_ like that’s true. And you can’t prove or disprove either side without agreeing on a cost model.')
