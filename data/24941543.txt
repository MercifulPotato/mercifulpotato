Item(by='Ace17', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604061107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24941265, text='&gt; Why would I want to solve puzzles with known answers that thousands of people have already solved?<p>For the same reasons you might engage in any entertainment activity.<p>Real-life still-unsolved puzzles are hard ; whereas puzzle games keep the difficulty under some control (except for the infamous boat puzzle in The Witness).<p>Real-life problems are hard because, often, proper domain modeling&#x2F;formalization is part of the problem. Puzzle games generally don&#x27;t have this &#x27;domain modeling&#x27; part, they provide you with an extremely consistent set of rules, and you have to build a solution inside it. Sometimes this set of rules is partly implicit, and discovering it is part of the fun (e.g The Witness, Antichamber) ; but you never have to worry about the real-world and it&#x27;s complexity.')
