However I find D can be written in a very script like manner, using the GC. Only when chasing performance do I need to go GC-free. The fast compilation means I can iterate as fast as python, and it has replaced a lot of python in our group.<p>Side note,I would like to learn OCaml and am interested you drew a distinction between Haskell (former group) and OCaml (latter group).')
