It does sound like some systemic issues are at work here.<p>That said, this <i>&quot;my personal belief is that it&#x27;s likely a result of the absurd taxation the middle class gets. It&#x27;s basically impossible to build up any saving to start entrepreneurship around here&quot;</i> reminded me that many of the people who start new companies in the Bay Area have often accumulated a bit of wealth from the equity sale of the previous company they worked for.<p>For example, estimates vary on how many millionaires Facebook created when it went public and its stock value grew, on the low side it is a one to two thousand. Of those, over 200 according to Crunchbase have founded or co-founded new companies on their own.  I&#x27;m more familiar with Sun Micro since I joined the day <i>after</i> they went public and was in the first 2000 employees. Of the 1999 that came before me, over half started new companies. At least 8 that I know of became general partners in VC firms that went on to fund hundreds a companies. There are also outliers like Eric Schmidt who got both the Sun boost, the Novell boost, and then the Google boost after that.<p>The point being that spreading out the success of a company widely is likely a big component as well.')
