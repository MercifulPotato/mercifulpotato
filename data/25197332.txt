You can solve this problem in many ways, maybe NN aren’t the best for this kind of trivial problem.<p>...but, if you want to solve harder problems with more than random trial and error tweaking parameters, solving easy problems with the same tool is a good way to learn how.<p>...and we have like 20 years of proof that using hand crafted models has been proven not to scale effectively.')
