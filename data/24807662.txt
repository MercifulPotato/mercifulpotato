Oh, and spent some major goodwill from the security community on stupid gimmicks.<p>Here&#x27;s to hoping they can pull something off (for example by sponsoring this project or something, I don&#x27;t know) to make themselves relevant again and stay relevant by again capturing the power user &#x2F; enthusiast niche.<p>Because right now we are starving for better alternatives, there isn&#x27;t exactly much to be enthusiastic about at the moment IMO: browsers just get more and more complex and enable more and more crazy applications.')
