Item(by='louwrentius', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605923163, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164551, text='&gt; Do you know of any new technology that come into existence already free of issues and as efficient as physically possible? Me neither.<p>After 12 years of crypto and blockchain the tech has nothing to show for itself, but to facilitate crime and people chasing lambo money.<p>&gt; Also: should I assume that you don&#x27;t fly anywhere? Don&#x27;t buy anything from China? Only consumes local produce?<p>Oh so predictable. I should warn people up front not to come up with whataboutism that just deflect valid criticism.<p>You can’t get away with theft by pointing at somebody else and cry “but but (s)he stole too!”.<p>&gt; The instrument does not &quot;solve&quot; anything. But it allows people to change the scale of the problem.<p>It all reads like after the fact reasoning to me by people just chasing lambo money. Your story was never why all those firestarters bought mining rigs to consume 3KW 24&#x2F;7.<p>But back to those poor countries: I would like to see (hypothetically) actual independent evidence of a positive impact of crypto for those people, but I am very skeptical<p>&gt; Quite frankly, are you the type of person that always waits everyone else to do something in order to think it is worthy doing? Must be horrible to live with such apathy.<p>What remains is a weak ad hominem, I think I’m done now.<p>Anyway, I do wish you good luck, if I am proven wrong, that would be a good thing.')
