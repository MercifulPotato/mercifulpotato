Item(by='abraxaz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604948717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037310, text='&gt; This just confirms my already existing stance to never buy anything from HP.<p>Can second this. I bought a HP Elitebook, and so far I have to replace the keyboard every 8 months and the USB-C port (which it charges with and connects to screen and other peripherals) keeps coming loose from the motherboard and then motherboard  needs replacing. I doubt it will last 4 months after warranty runs out.<p>Never again.')
