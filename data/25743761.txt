Or your order doesn’t trade, it “rests” because your price doesn’t match what anyone else is offering. At that point your order is at the back of the queue at that price and all other participants get an update showing the new state of the market with your order added to the state.<p>So why is latency important? The most important reason is not adding orders, which is only important if no one is already quoting your price, it’s for cancelling orders. If you get some information that makes you think your orders are incorrectly priced you want to cancel them before anyone can take advantage of that and then get new orders in at the new price you think is correct. This information is either off exchange (e.g. the fed job report) or is on the current exchange or another similar one (e.g. some big hedge fund is selling a ton of Swiss Francs in European exchanges).<p>On the map in the article exist 2 exchanges, the CME and the ICE which trade different but highly correlated symbols (CME WTI oil and ICE Brent oil). If I see a price change on the CME for those correlated symbols I can bet with high confidence the price will change for the ICE symbols as well, so I’ll race to cancel my orders that don’t reflect that new anticipated price.<p>For market makers providing liquidity order management is as important if not more so than inventory management and that’s where speed reduces risk, allowing them to provide cheaper liquidity.<p>A market maker wants to end the day flat on inventory with well positioned orders. Holding a big portfolio of inventory is the worst case scenario.')
