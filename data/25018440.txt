For all the negatives of what the US has done with its military since then, they&#x27;re not a hundredth as bad as what went on before by any objective measure.<p>The <i>Pax Americana</i> has been good for stability and with stability comes prosperity.  If the United States truly gave up its hegemony and turned isolationist, you&#x27;d see a resurgence of rearmament and jockeying for power among nations, inevitably followed by a new era of war after war.')
