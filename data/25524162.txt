Philip Glass has 27 albums on Pandora, 105 on Spotify. Nico Mulhy? 7 vs 14. Maarja Nuut. Only 1 album on Pandora. For her, Pandora makes no recommendations for others to listen to, Spotify lists 20. Pandora has no bio, Spotify does. Third Coast Percussion? 8 vs 10. I&#x27;m just randomly clicking in my library and doing a comparison, they aren&#x27;t artfully chosen examples.<p>I recognize this isn&#x27;t mainstream listening, and for all I know the ratios are reversed for more popular music.<p>I found the Pandora choices of songs annoying. I love Philip Glass; I don&#x27;t want to listen to a bunch of other people playing triplets against eighths. It&#x27;s derivative and boring in comparison. I do want to listen to his contemporaries that compose in different ways. Or let&#x27;s take Nuut again. I came across her recently while surveying contemporary Estonian composers. Pandora doesn&#x27;t let me do that so far as I can tell. I&#x27;m interested in what is going on there compositionally over the last 2 decades, I am not looking for another person that writes something that is very &#x27;similar&quot; (according to the Pandora algorithms).<p>Finally, I never use shuffle.
