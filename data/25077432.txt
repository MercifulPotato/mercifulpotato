There’s no detriment to flipping between a Twitter and Mastondon&#x2F;Parler account depending on which big accounts you want to read.<p>Contrariwise, people sign up for Facebook to socialize with their friend group as a whole. An alternative platform with only a handful of your friends would be pretty useless. Worse, having your friend group split between platforms would completely prevent being able to socialize as a group, defeating the whole point of the platform.')
