Otherwise, there is no breach of contract to sue over. If Parler believes they have a case against Amazon, they are able to file a lawsuit.<p>That said, Parler almost certainly has no case since private companies may do business with whomever they please and any terms in place almost certainly contain an at-will termination clause. Parler will need to find a new host and AWS will forfeit any future revenue from Parler. Thatâ€™s an even exchange.')
