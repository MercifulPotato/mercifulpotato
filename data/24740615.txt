CEOs answer to the board, who answer to shareholders, who work at investment funds that have bosses and shareholders and LPs of their own, and down the rabbit hole it goes. I wonder if there&#x27;s any general way out of this, different from &quot;bootstrap a SaaS&quot; which is a little specific to be good general advice.<p>This is one of the many points Kaczynski makes in his argument that “the Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.” The complete lack of true autonomy seems inherent to the system.')
