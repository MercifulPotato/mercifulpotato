Man I miss VB6.<p>For rapidly prototyping an idea, I have yet to find anything that was as good as VB6. Drag a button, write code. Want to change things about the button? Use properties, that live update the GUI without recompiling. It was so simple that a reasonably intelligent person could grasp it in an afternoon, but in the hands of a capable developer could do some very impressive things.<p>It was also a fun game to hunt for OCX controls that you could use in things that were downloaded or came on random disks or CDs.<p>I really feel like VB6 was the peak of that development model and we&#x27;ve been moving away from it since. And I get some of the reasons why (just look at the mess that comes from trying to do anything with Xcode storyboards and version control.) But for just rapidly trying out an idea, I have yet to find anything anywhere that was as good as VB6 was.')
