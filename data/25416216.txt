The language certainly was at fault.<p>I don&#x27;t blame the language for this.<p>It wasn&#x27;t <i>that</i> hard to read&#x2F;write objects using JDBC (it did usually create a lot of boilerplate)<p>Please name a major programming language that has built-in ORM features -- a library is the best place for this sort of stuff.<p>For Java this was J2EE&#x2F;EJB (stupidly over-engineered) and Hibernate&#x2F;JPA (decent if you avoid the footguns). For Ruby you have ActiveRecord, Python has Django and SQLAlchemy, etc.')
