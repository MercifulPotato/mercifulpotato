The good ones will also walk you through a basic physiology course so you can understand the why of it all (why did I become injured, why does this prevent or reduce the risk of a future injury).<p>This is a big part of why I have avoided it thus far... I have a hard enough time getting a doctor that I feel like cares about my issues (rather than just getting me out the door as quick as possible) enough to listen and understand. I don&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of time and money trialing different therapists. I wish there was a resource for this online.<p>I agree though, if I plan to continue the type of cycling I did last year, it&#x27;s probably going to become a necessity.')
