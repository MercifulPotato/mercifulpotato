Most communication goes through outlook and PowerPoint. I’ve seen people building intricate and bespoke interfaces in Access with only later the data storage layer removed from access internal to ms sql; whole graphs and pivot tables created from many data sources in excel, and even finite state machine simulators integrating real time Prometheus dashboards.
