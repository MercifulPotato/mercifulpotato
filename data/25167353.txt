If you&#x27;re using Fedora, you have to add a kernel parameter to Grub to use cgroups v1 instead.<p>RedHat seems to be pushing a standard ecosystem for Linux: systemd, Wayland, SELinux, GNOME, and now maybe podman. I&#x27;ve been on Linux for a while; it&#x27;s a welcome change from all the fragmentation I&#x27;m used to. Whereas others try to work around the kernel and implement their own things in parallel (see: Canonical&#x27;s AppArmor, LXC, OpenZFS), RedHat just goes with what Linux already has like SELinux&#x2F;cgroups v2&#x2F;btrfs, which I think is more likely to last and just feels better. If RedHat goes away, I&#x27;m fine since I&#x27;m ultimately only relying on Linux features. If Canonical goes away, then I&#x27;d have to switch to a different stack. That&#x27;s probably why government, enterprises, Amazon, etc. still prefer RedHat.')
