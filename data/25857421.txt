It will slowly solve the existing housing problems but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s primarily for. It&#x27;s about preventing housing problems from happening in the first place. It&#x27;s like a vaccine. If you want to stay healthy you have to take it even if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>The reason why market rate housing alone is insufficient is because how slow it is. Highest bidders get filled first. Cities have a lot of bidders, but not an infinite amount and those who are hit the hardest are at the bottom of the list. Public housing is about meeting demand at the bottom first. So in a deeply mismanaged housing market you need both at the same time. The other factor is that if the government is unable to build because of existing policies it can just change those self defeating policies (things like zoning).')
