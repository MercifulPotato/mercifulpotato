Let me explain why with the example of a small ecommerce business, consisting of one Wordpress site, a server host, a payment service and a delivery service. The user will interact with these 4 in some way. Now let&#x27;s say a customer &quot;Drek&quot; decides to send support a message like the one I linked to, what are the implications for the company if they want to comply with GDPR using the current infrastructure? (Btw, all &quot;Drek&quot; ever bought was a pair of glasses, a purchase which he immediately regretted and asked a refund for after the purchase was finalized).<p>What happens? You say we need a (couple of) SELECT-statement(s)? I say we need more than that. Also, I&#x27;ll tell you right now that doing a SELECT-query isn&#x27;t something customer support can handle, this is something you ask from a developer or server administrator (== more wasted $$$$). So think about that while we go through the information retrieval process:<p>(1)-(3) You&#x27;ll need select-statements, retrieval from log-files (such as access_log and error_log). Text explaining the data and explaining what it is used for. The data should be categorized and machine-readable in a common format. These requirements require a deeper understanding of the systems than just running a Wordpress site with a few plugins.<p>(4) &quot;the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;&quot;, that includes the payment, hosting and (possibly) delivery services.<p>(5) &quot;where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;&quot;. Again, this requires extra knowledge.<p>(6) Since we haven&#x27;t mentioned analytics services or any other privacy invasive service that knows more about the user than what they explicitly provide, this is not applicable in this example. However, it is still applicable for many real-world websites.<p>(7) Not relevant.<p>To be fair, the information retrieval can be automated, and a template can be used to compose a GDPR response. However, this does require the company to hire someone competent to do it, and also keep this process up-to-date so that it doesn&#x27;t conflict with newer versions of Wordpress&#x2F;plugins. And there WILL be newer versions because exploits are found on a regular basis. The developer will also have to make sure that the data is retrievable, and isn&#x27;t stored offline or in an inconvenient format (such as the case with compressed logfiles). All of this costs money, and different solutions must be prepared for different systems. If the owner decides to move away from Wordpress to another CMS, he will have to hire someone to also replace the GDPR automation process.<p>This is not practical for a start-up, or a small business. Unless the infrastructure adapts (again, when?), people will have to write custom scripts&#x2F;solutions to automate the process.<p>&gt; And to be fair, GDPR was npt imposed by elites, it was demanded by an awful lot of consumers in Europe.<p>People are rightfully worried about their privacy, of course we are! But that doesn&#x27;t give the elites the right to willy nilly impose (because that&#x27;s what they have done) any solution without at the very least making sure it doesn&#x27;t infringe upon other rights, and consult experts before writing the law. If they would&#x27;ve bothered to consult a seasoned and non-partisan server administrator, I think GDPR would&#x27;ve looked very differently.<p>I personally believe that the current infrastructure must change to respect user privacy, but this is not the way to do it.<p>And aaallll of this doesn&#x27;t directly address the main issue, which is that the accumulation of laws has caused everyone to become a criminal in one way or another.<p>&quot;Every law is an excuse for violence.&quot;')
