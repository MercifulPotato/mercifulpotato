From the article:<p>“The retirement age in China is 60 for men and 55 for women. At Huawei, however, according to our sources, it is common to end one’s career already in one’s mid-40s. When long-serving Chinese managers reach this age, they often cash out the value of their company shares and effectively retire.”<p>-<p>It is great to see the funders of this journalism are against this ageism in tech and include the likes of the McArthur foundation and Soros affiliates.<p>Great that the article highlighted some potential management glass ceilings for Europeans in the Chinese company. The Chinese should learn from the lack of glass ceilings to non-Europeans in European companies. Or how egalitarian and meritocratic they are in hiring and don’t even care about formal diplomas or your ethnic background.<p>It baffles me why any (western) European would move to the US and leave behind such great meritocratic European tech companies.')
