But there&#x27;s a stronger argument for more columns in Java: The standard library itself uses very long names, so you can&#x27;t escape them, and the syntax of the language creates many levels of indentation even when you avoid things like nested conditionals and loops.[1] No matter what you do with your own coding conventions and naming, Java ends up feeling cramped in 80 columns all by itself.<p>In general, though, I heartily agree with the article. I just disagree with the tacit assumption that one size fits all. Make your code as skinny as is feasible, but no skinnier. My Java code&#x27;s 100 columns, but my only strongly-felt complaint about Black is that I think Python code is happier at 80 columns.<p>[1]: For example: An if-statement within a try-block within a method within a nested class. That&#x27;s five levels all by itself, probably with no straightforward way to refactor your way out of it.')
