I just compared my family car to a somewhat equivalent EV, and it takes 40,000km to break even in CO2 emissions. This is very much in line with my original point (and my &quot;back of the envelope maths&quot;). In the online calculator you linked, I assumed a car life of around 150,000km, as the longevity of mass-produced EVs is yet to be determined. It also addresses none of the additional points in my original comment, as we have so far talked entirely about CO2 emissions. If it is all about CO2, and the impending climate catastrophe, then the relatively small reduction in CO2&#x2F;mile from an EV is just not even close to what is needed. In the calculator linked, it&#x27;s a 40% reduction per mile. An EV is not the answer. Significantly fewer travelled miles is the answer.<p><i>Edit:</i> Just for reference, the UN is calling for a 7.6% reduction in CO2 every year for the next 10 years. Either way you calculate it, an EV alone does not acheive that goal. And if you massively reduce your miles (say, 10x), it doesn&#x27;t matter (relatively speaking) if you use an EV or an ICE car.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unenvironment.org&#x2F;explore-topics&#x2F;climate-change&#x2F;facts-about-climate-emergency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unenvironment.org&#x2F;explore-topics&#x2F;climate-change&#x2F;...</a>')
