It takes effort to donate that exercise bike or old piano to Goodwill because you have to face your demons that you will _never_ become that version of yourself, there&#x27;s no future you that will be really fit, and without evidence I&#x27;ll assert that it&#x27;s that very conscious act which symbolically represents the destruction of ambiguity is difficult for most humans.
