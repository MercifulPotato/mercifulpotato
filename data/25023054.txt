These things have names, zygotes, embryos, fetus. None of these are living humans yet. They&#x27;re pre humans. collection of cells without an identity or awareness. Simplest of brain function where they might only respond to stimulus.<p>The difference between fetus and infants is the first is still attached to its mother. Its continued growth depends on its attachment to mother. Similar to a tumor.<p>I don&#x27;t think you actually understand what you are talking about if you are confused about the term viability <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fetal_viability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fetal_viability</a><p>Your link to photos means you are forming your opinion based off emotion and not understanding the difference between cells splitting, and what a independent human is.<p>At what point do you think the sperm and egg are human? Even the first split after they join is still just two cells.<p>What proof do you have that says a fetus at 16 weeks is alive? How are you defining alive?<p>&gt; it has all its organs. It just needs to grow.<p>This is still dependent on the mother, it is not its own thing at this point.')
