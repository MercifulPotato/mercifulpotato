It would have been much better to take a third option and <i>truncate</i> the oversized packet. That would avoid both the bad effects of fragmentation (slow path in the routers, memory use in the receivers, non-initial fragments which lack the higher level headers making it a pain for firewalls) and the bad effects of dropping (waste of the bandwidth to send the dropped packet, broken firewalls discarding the ICMP message, CPU use in the router to send the ICMP message).')
