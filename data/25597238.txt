IRBs exist to shield research organizations from risk.  That risk can come in many kinds: the research may be unethical, or would have bad PR, or could be dangerous, but the goal of the IRB is to make a determination that protects the interests of the research organization.  Think of it like the HR department- it may pitch itself as a resource for line employees, but it exists to prevent the company from doing things that would get it into trouble.')
