Don&#x27;t do things in the container that you wouldn&#x27;t do on the host (like curl-ing from the internet into bash as root :-D, or using questionable base images).<p>My deployment life has been vastly improved by shipping in containers, but I have seen a lot of security regressions because people feel safe to be reckless (like running the app as root) due to the container guard rails.  Don&#x27;t think this way.')
