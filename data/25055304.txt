Of course in theory you could install the bare minimum to run the utility using X-forwarding, in practice anyone doing this usually installs a full environment because it&#x27;s much simpler to manage.<p>Plus, there are a few admins out there who simply prefer to use VNC over a straight terminal. I&#x27;m not here to judge; while this is uncommon, it&#x27;s certainly not unheard of. Personally I would rather not have that much attack surface on my servers, but there are a few legitimate use cases here and there.')
