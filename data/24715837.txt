Whether that&#x27;s encfs or luks or ZFS encryption or whatever.  (Caveat: some of these have very specific security properties that you may find inadequate (encfs is poor against an attacker who can see multiple versions of a file over time, IIRC), or efficiency issues with syncing (you&#x27;re not gonna git commit a ZFS dataset))')
