But also there were lies that led to the Iraq war in the more fractured Fox News&#x2F;internet age so it seems like the more fractured, politicized news didn&#x27;t help protect against that.<p>&gt; To claim there was sometime in the past where the news was good and reliable would require overlooking a huge amount of actual historic malfeasance.<p>Sure, my point was there was a past where we had a more common narrative. That certainly has downsides, but now we&#x27;re seeing that it had some advantages compared to our current fractured era.')
