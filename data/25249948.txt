In colder weather, there&#x27;s a major advantage to sleeping during the day in that the sun keeps you warm. It&#x27;s easier to stay warm through the night&#x27;s cold awake and alert than tired and asleep.<p>If the weather is nice around the clock and there&#x27;s plenty to do, I may only sleep a couple hours a night, the excitement of new experiences carrying me. Rainy or gray weather typically means sleeping more.')
