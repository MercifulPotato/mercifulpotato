Adding new instructions can&#x27;t help with that. But I&#x27;m just repeating what I heard elsewhere:<p>&gt; Other contemporary designs such as AMD’s Zen(1 through 3) and Intel’s µarch’s, x86 CPUs today still only feature a 4-wide decoder designs (Intel is 1+4) that is seemingly limited from going wider at this point in time due to the ISA’s inherent variable instruction length nature, making designing decoders that are able to deal with aspect of the architecture more difficult compared to the ARM ISA’s fixed-length instructions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16226&#x2F;apple-silicon-m1-a14-de...</a>')
