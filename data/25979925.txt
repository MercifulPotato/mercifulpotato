And it has many more uses, as it&#x27;s a generic federated PubSub platform. Facebook, Whatsapp and many other popular proprietary solutions use the XMPP protocol. Even games and gaming platforms like League of Legends or Nintendo use XMPP. So do Firebase and others.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing in favor of these corporations. I&#x27;m a proponent of non-profit federated networks like the Jabber federation (based on XMPP protocol). Not that XMPP is better than ActivityPub&#x2F;Matrix in all regards, but it has stable standards, rock-solid implementations with very good scaling stories, and there&#x27;s a vibrant non-profit community working on:<p>- better, modern clients for chatting: Conversations, Dino..\n- unified branding&#x2F;UX across platforms with Snikket client&#x2F;server distribution\n- social networking: Movim (web), salut-à-toi (multi-platform)\n- decentralized forging to replace github: salut-à-toi uses it for own development\n- onboarding people with prosody&#x27;s mod_invite\n- federated chat over tor onion services with prosody&#x27;s mod_onion<p>Matrix, SMTP and ActivityPub have other strong points going for them, but i could argue most of the Matrix criticism in the article does not apply to the Jabber ecosystem.
