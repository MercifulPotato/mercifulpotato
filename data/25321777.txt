I think more ire will be directed at national public health officials than state and local ones.  The national ones obviously screwed up when it came to messaging regarding masks, and I think less obviously but just as importantly screwed up when it game to rolling out the vaccine.<p>These decisions are probably more impactful than the decisions state and local health officials made around whether bars are open or not.')
