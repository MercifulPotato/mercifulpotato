Item(by='egwor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611924659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955910, text='&gt; Robinhood played with people phschology<p>I disagree. They&#x27;ve offer a way to trade like other platforms. Other platforms did the same thing and blocked trading.<p>The question you need to be asking is why did they ALL block trading?<p>They&#x27;re competitors to each other, so why did they make the same decision? Remember that these firms make money on every trade done. They want to take your trades. BUT they have to manage risk. They lose money if the client can&#x27;t pay. They&#x27;re there to facilitate but they are taking risk themselves if they provide leverage. They, like banks providing mortgages have to have limits set. If would be unprofessional and irrational to do otherwise. These firms are there to make money in a highly competitive environment. They are professionally run to ensure that they stay in business.<p>The comments here are of the theme &#x27;RH has screwed us to make money&#x27;. No, what they&#x27;ve most likely done is made a decision to take no more risk to ensure that they remain in business. EVERYONE is speculating though. If that&#x27;s the case these arguments that the clients are somehow being screwed over is really unfair and shows a lack of understanding. Clients need to understand the risks of what they&#x27;re doing, and need to understand the risks associated with executing via one broker. It&#x27;s a professional environment and drive by retail unfortunately are mostly unaware of the true risks.<p>Examples: \n1. Traders have multiple brokers to trade via because there are technical issues<p>2. If something is too good to be true, it probably is.<p>3. If you&#x27;re betting against some professionals, you need to ask what they know that you don&#x27;t. Why are they comfortable taking on the risk. The professionals will try very hard not to be emotional and have more info that a retail customer will.<p>4. The retail investor need to understand the business model of the brokers. Why are they in business and what are their limits?<p>I see the real problem here is that it is easy to put a trade on. It is difficult to know how to risk manage it and understand the risks. This squeeze has identified a limit in the market that wasn&#x27;t considered.')
