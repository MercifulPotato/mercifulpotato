Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603729484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24897261, text='&gt; By &quot;instantiate&quot;, I mean to insert the actual implementation in one .c&#x2F;.cpp file you write<p>I know. In my original comment I tried to make it clear that some (but not all) of my points applied to these libraries that have some separate compilation. In my second comment I apologised for not making that clear and tried to stress it even harder. I&#x27;m not sure what else I can do to make it clearer.<p>&gt; The owner of this repo ... His libraries<p>If you just use this guy&#x27;s libraries, and that works out for you, then all power to you.<p>But I&#x27;m worried about C++ beginners stumbling across this page on Hacker News and thinking, hmm, using C++ libraries is so hard that I need to restrict myself to libraries like these. That is simply a myth - using vcpkg is really not hard at all, and well worth it for all the other libraries it gives you easy access to. Again, if that doesn&#x27;t matter to you then that&#x27;s fine, but I want readers to know that the option is available.<p>By the way, that the vast majority of libraries linked to from this article are not by the author and do not have the separate compilation model you talked about - they&#x27;re simply header only with inline functions.')
