Of course Google copied them, or a nearly identical paraphrase of them.<p>Well, they aren&#x27;t part of the <i>implementation</i>, since they just describe the interface.  Google&#x27;s theory is that interfaces, being needed for interoperability, are not protected by copyright.  Google&#x27;s alternate theory is that, even if they are protected by copyright, using them is fair use.')
