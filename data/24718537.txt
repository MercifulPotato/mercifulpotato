You&#x27;re saying that those who disagree with tech unions are:<p>- Autistic<p>- Uneducated and naive (&quot;real soon now,&quot; presumably said with a folksy twang)<p>- &quot;Very young&quot;<p>- Too cowardly or ethically naive to object to bad working conditions<p>Here&#x27;s a more charitable possibility: Opponents may just not see the need at this point. Or they may dislike union culture.<p>Unionizing isn&#x27;t all positive. There are costs that go beyond union dues. You&#x27;re establishing what in many ways is a more exclusive culture. And you may end up stifling innovation. That shouldn&#x27;t be a tool to be used indiscriminately.')
