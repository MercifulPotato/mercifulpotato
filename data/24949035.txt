Patient reports symptoms A, B, C? Order tests X, Y, Z, prescribe drugs 1, 2 and 3.<p>Now that&#x27;s probably appropriate for (say) 70% of patients. But what about the other 30% of patients whose symptoms or conditions don&#x27;t fit squarely in the checklist? That&#x27;s when some kind of analytical&#x2F;critical diagnostic skills are needed, and in my experience, very few doctors possess these skills.<p>Once you&#x27;re in uncharted waters, they&#x27;re not helpful. In fact, they&#x27;re often actively <i>unhelpful</i> because they refuse to acknowledge that some things might be outside their expertise and they either need to actually hit the books, or do the work to find a specialist who <i>can</i> help you.')
