The way that the chamber contracts down to a tiny nub gives you the high compression ratio. The nubs being fixed in the stator lets you have injection. The fact that the combustion happens while the tip of the rotor is sliding over the nub gives you constant-volume combustion. I suppose the rotor being asymmetric lets you have overexpansion.')
