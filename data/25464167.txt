All staff would be do 3 weeks on, 3 off, but while &quot;on&quot; (think oil rig workers), living on-site in trailers or [hm]otels, not going home every night (movies do this when filming on location; juries get sequestered for important trials, why can&#x27;t we do this here?).  When staff go on-shift, they must be isolated and then tested before being allowed to go onsite.  Deliveries left on the loading dock and properly sanitized, and no visitors -- AT ALL.  For Medical emergencies (local FD &#x2F; EMTs), the resident &amp; 1st responders would have to be isolated for triage, then taken off-site and go back through quarantine &#x2F; testing to get back in.<p>It&#x27;s totally doable and the cost is a heck of a lot less than an economic shutdown &#x2F; lockdown, or the continued high death toll.')
