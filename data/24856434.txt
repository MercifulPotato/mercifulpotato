Item(by='names_are_hard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603361208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850710, text='If it&#x27;s any consolation, Israeli names (presumably the names you&#x27;re encountering in Hebrew) are often ambiguous with respect to both first&#x2F;last and gender. The latter might be a nice thing from a progressive standpoint, but is particularly challenging in a language that is strictly gendered - you can&#x27;t say &quot;you&quot; in Hebrew without decided if the subject should be addressed in masculine or feminine.<p>Example from a quick DDG search for the name &quot;Arnon&quot; which was the first thing that came to mind. Both Yigal Arnon and Arnon Segev are names of attorneys, so Arnon is definitely ambiguous. The latter&#x27;s law firm employs an associate named Chen Moshe, where Moshe is a common biblical first name (Moses) and Chen could be a man or a woman.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;segevlaw.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;segevlaw.com&#x2F;</a>')
