I can see how easy it would be to make these bots - but not how they manage to be the first responses so consistently. Surely there are other competing bots trying to do the same thing?<p>Others are direct responses to the content the president tweeted about. Dr.Gu frequently writes paragraph length rebuttals but I assume such responses take time to craft - so there&#x27;s no way he could have been the first to respond with so much content, right?')
