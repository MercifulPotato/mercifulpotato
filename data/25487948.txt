Perhaps you skim a few percent off the top due to inefficiencies of the scheme. Are you saying the 5&#x2F;6 people here didn&#x27;t benefit? Sure seems like they did!<p>Slave ownership was strongly concentrated. A relatively small class of plantation owners got rich off slavery. They didn&#x27;t redistribute the proceeds across the entire white population. Economically, the slave-owning South, as a whole, lagged far behind the North, and slavery is a likely cause for that economic backwardness.<p>&gt; didn&#x27;t encode a right to vote (for anyone, that was left up to the individual states) until reconstruction.<p>That has nothing to do with slavery. The Constitution was written at a time when democracy was viewed with suspicion, and moreover. Nevertheless, the United States was, at the time, rapidly becoming one of the most democratic polities in the world. One way to see this is to look at the state constitutions written in this era.')
