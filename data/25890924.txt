People just don&#x27;t do stuff with their neighbors or largely don&#x27;t even talk to them. The older ones, who&#x27;ve been in the building for decades, at least know the names of the other older ones and maybe a little bit about them (where they work, what&#x27;s their family structure etc.). Younger gen is mostly completely isolated though. At least that&#x27;s my experience.')
