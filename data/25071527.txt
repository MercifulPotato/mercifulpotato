Bravo.<p>Although this does not yet have the same sort of real-time push syncing (or subscriptions) the way Firestore (or Firebase) both have, it looks like it has the right foundation to support that.<p>Also impressed that this has such wide client SDK support already. Again, I can tell a lot of work went into it. I&#x27;ll be trying this out and following the project! Excited to see where it goes next.')
