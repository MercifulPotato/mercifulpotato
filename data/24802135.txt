The people of France were itching to go to war with Prussia&#x2F;Germany to reclaim Alsace and Lorraine. Which created a massive arms race till WW1. Also, while Japan isn&#x27;t in Europe, the Russo-Japanese war did happen in 1904 in that period resulting in a major loss of trust in the Russian monarchy and the subsequent 1905 Russian Revolution. The Europeans were still sending troops to aid in the subjugation of Africa (Boer wars, Anglo-Zulu wars etc) even then.<p>However, I do agree with you that people then thought that world peace was achieved. The 1910 book &quot;The Great Illusion&quot; [2] ironically argued European war was unlikely to start due to the great economic costs of destroying trade between nations. It got the consequences right at least.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Franco-Prussian_War" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Franco-Prussian_War</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Great_Illusion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Great_Illusion</a>')
