Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=[25144868, 25142298], score=None, time=1605730489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25141740, text='&gt; What&#x27;s the problem with style attributes? I would use them instead of regular CSS if I could add pseudo-attributes and make them responsive.<p>Imagine styling a table row. That is one style attribute. Now imagine styling a 100 tables rows. That is style attribute duplicated a 100 times. Think of the amount of unnecessary bandwidth consumed to load that HTML file with 100 duplicate style attributes. Not only does it slow down page load times, it also slows down page render times.<p>Now if you add selectors to style attributes then it solves the above issue altogether. But, then you are just re-inventing the wheel. Instead of CSS in a separate file you now have the same functionality but all inlined in style attributes.')
