You need to essentially program the drivers from scratch, using assembly...at the end your board has inputs and outputs like a speaker, switches, keypad, infrared remote control...everything was in assembly and you need to RTFM to know how each chip...pin out, clocks etc work.<p>It gives you a great knowledge and appreciate of what goes on beneath the covers. It was a grueling, but satisfying class.')
