This includes scope and state relationship. Think more powerful lambdas with better interface syntax and options. OOP languages typically hard-wire such relationships into a limited set of relationship conventions. This results in OOP graphs that don&#x27;t fit the domain or need well.<p>Sure, one can do such in Lisp, but many find Lisp hard to read. With C-style languages, the &quot;ugly&quot; syntax gives helpful visual cues. Stuff within (...) is usually a parameter list, stuff within {...} is usually sequential code, and &quot;[...]&quot; indicates indexing of some kind, for example. I find such helps my mind digest code faster.<p>Lisp aficionados will often claim &quot;one gets used to&quot; the uniformity. But that&#x27;s like arguing we don&#x27;t need color because one can &quot;get used to&quot; seeing in black and white. To a degree, yes, but the color adds another dimension of info. Easily recognizable group&#x2F;block types is another color.')
