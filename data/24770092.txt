I&#x27;m going for 5000IU (the dose that the Shannon person in the article was taking for supplementation).<p>All the bottles at my pharmacy were 1000IU so I just bought one of them and take 5 of them.<p>I was surprised to read in the article (and elsewhere) that 5000IU doses was mentioned as a common OTC dose as I couldn&#x27;t find it. But I live in Canada so maybe it&#x27;s different.')
