Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25029843, 25029933, 25030976], score=None, time=1604875102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25029433, text='Thanks—we&#x27;ve changed the URL from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fm4.orf.at&#x2F;stories&#x2F;3008930&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fm4.orf.at&#x2F;stories&#x2F;3008930&#x2F;</a>. Submissions to HN need to be in English—we have great respect for other languages, including German, but HN is an English language site. Happily in this case, following the site guideline that calls for original sources solves this problem as well.<p>(I&#x27;ve taken the title from the new URL, btw, which uses the rather strong preposition &quot;against&quot;—I suppose this is a matter of interpretation since the document itself seems to fall over itself insisting on the opposite.)')
