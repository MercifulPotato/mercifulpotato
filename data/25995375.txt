For example, swipes like &quot;Yeah keep spreading lies&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25979836" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25979836</a>), &quot;You are just trying to avoid answering&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25979695" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25979695</a>), and so on, are completely unacceptable here.<p>It&#x27;s all too easy to assume that you&#x27;re following the rules when you aren&#x27;t—we all suffer from this, because we have our own good intentions in mind when commenting. But those intentions don&#x27;t communicate themselves, and when you&#x27;re arguing, your comments are likely to come across as 10x more aggressive (if not 100x!) as they felt to you. It&#x27;s as if, when sparring, people land punches much harder than they think they do. You don&#x27;t feel it that way, but the other person sure does—and then they land a punch back that feels (to them) like it&#x27;s about equal, but feels to you like it&#x27;s 10x harder—and suddenly there&#x27;s a brawl in which everyone feels like the other person started the conflict and escalated it, while they themselves are merely reacting. In reality, both are doing it, and both are subject to the same cognitive bias that makes it feel like we&#x27;re the innocent one and they&#x27;re the guilty one.<p>For this reason it&#x27;s super important to err on the side of scrupulously editing swipes and aggressive language out of your comments, especially on divisive topics. As the guidelines say: &quot;<i>Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</i>&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Even if your intent is good, the burden is on you as an internet commenter to disambiguate your intent for the reader.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...</a>')
