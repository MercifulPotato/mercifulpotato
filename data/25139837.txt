It gives you enough time to build something with substance, and test the idea thoroughly.<p>This is a similar timeframe that Basecamp uses for internal initiatives. I&#x27;ve been pushing for us to switch from 2-week sprints to something closer to 6-week features. If you&#x27;re building on existing product or a brand new one 1-2 weeks is just not enough time for meaningful progress.')
