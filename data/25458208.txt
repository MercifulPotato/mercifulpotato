It does little to clear up confusion.<p>What constitutes a synthetic flavor? Is vanilla extract an example or do you have to go further than that?<p>Emulsifiers are things that actually get used in regular cooking. According to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thespruceeats.com&#x2F;what-does-emulsify-mean-480592#:~:text=Common%20emulsifiers%20include%20egg%20yolks,%2C%20miso%2C%20and%20garlic%20paste" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thespruceeats.com&#x2F;what-does-emulsify-mean-480592...</a>. egg yolks and honey are both emulsifiers. Based on how that sentence is phrased, you&#x27;d think that an emulsifier is something synthesized chemical that the average chef has never heard of.<p>Hydrogenated oils and soy protein isolates have long been recognized as things to avoid, so their inclusion in the list is not a surprise.<p>Like I said, the definition is overbroad and does little to help someone like me actually identify things that are very bad for me. I already know eating a bag of Doritos for dinner is not a great idea. What sort of food items do you typically see these nutritional monsters hiding out in? Are they so awful that they shouldn&#x27;t be enjoyed even as a once-in-a-while indulgence?<p>The article specifically mentions Coca Cola and Mars, among others. I mean golly gee, thanks for the big brain insight. Are there people out there who didn&#x27;t know that soda and candy bars are not paragons of nutrition?')
