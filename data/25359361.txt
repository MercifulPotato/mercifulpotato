Chance is that your target audience is running an adblocker &#x2F; DNS blocker of some sort and that this will heavily skew the analytics results: The absolute numbers will be a lot lower and you will only capture folks not savvy enough for adblockers. I removed any external analytics about a year ago when I realized that more than 50% of visitors to my service were blocking Google Analytics and that GA numbers had become meaningless (cross-referenced against access.log).')
