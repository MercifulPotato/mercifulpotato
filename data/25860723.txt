OTOH, it would allow earthlings to become visitors.<p>Commerce. If we use our experience as a basis here, this is the #1 interest that would lure alien explorers to this neck of the woods. Commerce is what got us to cross the Atlantic: looking for routes, buyers, suppliers, riches and land. All science-first approach (&quot;they should come to study us&quot;) is so 20th century utopism.<p>But without really being sure what matters to aliens the most, commerce, tourism or science, makes it hard to lure them. We sent Voyager with curiosity in mind: songs, poems, language samples, pictures... But we could have sent instead a list&#x2F;sample of our prime minerals, water supplies, preferred payment methods and our &quot;1-800 number&quot; for contact. Scientists can be so un-enterpreneurial sometimes!<p>Now, what then could get their attention and provoke a visit?<p>Become a menace.<p>Without really being sure what matters to aliens makes it tough to envision a way to get them really interested on the 3rd rock enough to launch a mission or send signals. So the most effective (and reckless...) is to become a menace, or at least a nuisance, to them. Fiction has played around with that idea, nuclear capability being the trigger that got them to notice or outraged enough to wipe us out...<p>Let&#x27;s say we develop a gravitational wave cannon capable of making Sirius shoot over as a billiard ball into Procyon. Oh, now that would get their attention!')
