Am I losing performance? Power efficiency? Features?<p>From what I read a year ago before doing this, you don&#x27;t lose much, and software-based RAID (if you go for that sort of thing) in GNU&#x2F;Linux is just as efficient&#x2F;reliable, and maybe more so. And anyway, if you only have one HDD&#x2F;SSD, there is no point in RAID.<p>&gt; It also makes dual booting trickier if you don&#x27;t plan it beforehand.<p>I don&#x27;t think so: installing Windows will work just the same with Intel&#x27;s RAID turned off.')
