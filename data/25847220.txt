Maybe there&#x27;s a better way.<p>I agree. This is volunteer work. And despite the bad apples there&#x27;s quite a few good mods out there! I just wonder about the ways in which Reddit motivates its moderators. It certainly isn&#x27;t positive.<p>As I said I don&#x27;t believe in the wisdom of crowds. I think we become a herd easily and forget the crowd.<p>I think the entire system of upvoting&#x2F;liking is flawed. It encourages our worst behavior. At least the way PG and friends have designed it.<p>It only works for tight use cases like HN. It doesn&#x27;t work for Reddit IMHO. It&#x27;s too big. It&#x27;s become a herd.<p>We are not witnessing the wisdom of Crowds. We are witnessing the chaos of herds.')
