Stick to that voice. Replace the stock images and marketing-speak with halt-and-catch-fire design&#x2F;quotes, code snippets and sample output.<p>Don’t try to get customers. Get early adopters who share the vision and want to come along for the ride as you experiment and push the envelope.

Those same people are your best market and will make great future employees.')
