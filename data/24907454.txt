Item(by='HelloMcFly', descendants=None, kids=[24912972], score=None, time=1603807089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24902601, text='&gt; The contempt a person must have for their fellow man in order to deem them as unworthy of free speech, is gut wrenching<p>You don&#x27;t know me. That you feel I have so much contempt for my &quot;fellow man&quot; because of this disagreement of ours is wild. I may just as well bemoan - in equally bad faith - your contempt for honesty, transparency, or reality.<p>At no point have I argued that anyone should be prevented from free speech, yet there your accusation sits. My argument that purveyors of socially-distributed content have some level of responsibility for the real-world impacts this creates, particularly on marginalized communities that are often not sharing&#x2F;consuming this information and only victimized by it. Did I say anyone should be prevented from expressing themselves? No. Neither do I offer solutions because I am not an expert. But I don&#x27;t believe a completely &quot;hands-free&quot; approach is viable because of how easy it is to manipulate content, trick people, and use tricks to ensure your message is spread in non-natural ways (e.g., bot farms). That is not &quot;contempt&quot; for the intellectual prowess of others, it&#x27;s a recognition of the reality we&#x27;ve already seen; I&#x27;m not immune to it and neither are you.<p>I find your seemingly dogmatic belief well-intentioned (a courtesy you certainly did not apply to me) yet naive, hopeful but damaging. I believe - wholeheartedly - that the position I take is much more respectful of people and communities than yours. Because I&#x27;m not taking an ivory tower principled stand as if there are no real world implications. There have been, there are, there will be.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong. I&#x27;m willing to admit that. But this isn&#x27;t merely an intellectual exercise for me as I feel it often is for so many.')
