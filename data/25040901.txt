Item(by='paulmd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604962033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25036188, text='Apple and NVIDIA are excruciatingly unpopular amount the &quot;techie&quot; crowd precisely for choosing proprietary licenses and closed, proprietary environments.  Every single time they are brought up you can be guaranteed a screed about how Linus gave NVIDIA the finger that one time, or people don&#x27;t like the extent to which NVIDIA supports Wayland (which is not zero!).<p>People absolutely do not accept the explanation that these companies are businesses that spend R&amp;D money developing novel hardware and software and won&#x27;t immediately race to interoperate with copycat standards from competitors who want to leech off that R&amp;D once it&#x27;s proven commercially viable.  Nor do they have to expand the scope of their work to implement that one feature 0.1% of users want, nor are they obligated to open things up to allow you to implement the things they won&#x27;t.  And nor are you obligated to use their product if you don&#x27;t find it satisfactory.<p>I guess it really goes to show how much Copyleft has won the war that people are immediately hostile to proprietary licenses today, particularly in consumer-facing technology.  Oddly this does not seem to apply to more industrial or embedded use-cases, you don&#x27;t see anyone ranting about the awful proprietary Xilinx toolchain or Broadcom&#x27;s awful binary SOC blobs any time those products are brought up.  But then again it does apply to software APIs and such?<p>It&#x27;s probably not unfair to say that &quot;anything I use should be free and open but also enough people should pay me that I should be able to make a living&quot; is not an unfair characterization here.  Everyone wants nice things, they don&#x27;t want to pay for them.  That&#x27;s why gmail and Windows 10 and other spyware-funded services are so popular.')
