Even here on HN, you can say a great deal of stuff that others will consider wrong without being &quot;censored&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m certainly against &quot;wrongthink&quot; which is just a stupid re-use of a literary trick currently being massively over-referenced online in response to various events today. There&#x27;s wrong, there&#x27;s false, there&#x27;s stupid. There isn&#x27;t any wrongthink in my conception of the world.')
