Banks don&#x27;t give &quot;business loans&quot; to poor people.  The first question they ask is what kind of security or personal guarantee you can give and when the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, their answer is &quot;no.&quot;<p>If you do manage to borrow money and things don&#x27;t work out, you have to pay it back and that takes a <i>long</i> time when you&#x27;re going back to the crappy income level you were trying to escape.  It&#x27;s not like Silicon Valley venture capital where you say sorry and get another bag of cash to try again.<p>&gt; Also the cost per year is less relevant, if you earn more from selling domains every year. Only the difference is relevant (costs vs income).<p>Yeah, but the person with the money to start has 200+ domains and a (supposed) $1 million portfolio.  The person who bought 1 domain using the same strategy might have a portfolio worth a few thousand dollars.  They&#x27;re not going to be writing a blog bragging about their portfolio or landing business deals because of the million dollar business they built.<p>The point I was trying to make is that if you take a rich person and a poor person with the exact same skill set and idea, the rich person will be viewed as being super successful (making a million dollars) while the poor person, although personally happy with the outcome, would be viewed as a loser if they make $10k and &quot;waste&quot; it on something like a reliable vehicle.<p>It&#x27;s also a bit amusing to me that if a poor person wanted to start flipping domains using a 5 letter .com, like the person in the article, they&#x27;d have to buy the domain from a squatter.')
