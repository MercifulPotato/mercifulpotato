They’ve pretty much out of bullets: more cores, higher clock frequencies, better manufacturing, etc.<p>The point they can’t process as many instructions per clock cycle and there’s nothing they can do about it. They can’t match the M1’s performance per watt.<p>And certainly there’s no Intel&#x2F;AMD laptop processor with 8 or 16 Gb of RAM via a 128-bit memory bus on the same die. Same thing with a 16-core Neural Engine with an OS with the APIs to take advantage of them.')
