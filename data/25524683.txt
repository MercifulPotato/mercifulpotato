I absolutely answered. What I didn&#x27;t give you was some bad thing to make up for the bad thing that they did. Because I think that is stupid. Notice that I think punishment is generally stupid. I didn&#x27;t say that people who use punishment are stupid. Sometimes they are, sometimes they&#x27;re ignorant, sometimes they just have a blind spot, and sometimes they just disagree with this position.<p>&gt; is a fundamental deterrent that has been used by societies around the world for thousands of years.<p>Lots of things have been done for thousands of years, and we now realize that some of them were bad ideas. I believe that punishment should absolutely go in the bucket of last resorts. IMO it represents an absolute failure of the imagination of our society.<p>Your last sentence doesn&#x27;t make any sense, doesn&#x27;t address any point I made, no matter how briefly. It&#x27;s just you insulting me. I don&#x27;t think that is likely to convince anyone. Like punishment, we do it because it feels good. I think we can be better than that. This is a point that we might not agree on.')
