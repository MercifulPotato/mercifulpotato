Either you like to fight very low stakes or you&#x27;ve given into the rhetoric that causes these things to spread (eg tide pods look delicious so I can see why people would want to do it, but it is obviously stupid). I have conceded that I cannot explain it as racist on the surface, but you cannot accept that it is racist in its mechanism of spread as an idea that it could be racist... Which is racist enough for racists.')
