Multi-platform distribution is built into web apps, but it takes a lot more effort to create good native apps on several platforms.<p>Also, of course, no need to install anything on the web, which  is important for frictionless collaboration.<p>---<p>It&#x27;s no surprise that both desktop and mobile OS-s are very much not optimized for cross platform development. It&#x27;s a feature (for owners of those OS-s), not a bug.')
