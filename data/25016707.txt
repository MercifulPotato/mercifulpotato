We use a REST and Redux architecture. It&#x27;s worked very well for us, but we&#x27;re starting to hit some pain points. As we look to re-architect, our list of challenges pretty much mimic the challenges GraphQL looks to address. These aren&#x27;t scaling issues or &quot;big company issues&quot;. In my opinion, they&#x27;re core issues with every client-server code base.<p>* Client Data and Statement Management<p>* API Coordination and Versioning (even more complex if you have a public API)<p>* Payload Management and Relational Data (it can be very expensive to pro-actively return embedded&#x2F;dependent data, so you need to manage it somehow)<p>* Caching and De-deduping<p>* Typing and Data Interfaces between Client&#x2F;Server<p>* Error Management (not that hard to standardize, but still something you need to account for)<p>* Pagination, Filtering, Sorting, etc.')
