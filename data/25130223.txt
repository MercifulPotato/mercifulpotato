It&#x27;s obviously not advisable, but plenty of people do just fine without regular doctor checkups because they keep healthy and live balanced lives. And, interestingly, given how many each year die in traffic accidents, it&#x27;s not such a stretch that being _able_ to afford a car would kill you.<p>We all have really different reasons for wanting health insurance and owning a car. We have different components, considerations, and properties, which we value about these decisions. Given this, it seems ludicrously complex, inefficient, and cruel to subject all citizens of a nation to the same exact process of obtaining and using health care.<p>We all know how bad of an idea it is to centralize services, but because some linguistic jokesters have gotten the phrase &quot;healthcare is a human right&quot; to be passed around the globe enough times, people seem to drop context when it comes to this discussion.<p>As soon as youtube-dl got hit with its recent DMCA takedown request, GitHub obliged and the whole dang HN community lost their collective minds. &quot;Decentralize your git repos&quot; we all saw people writing - and they weren&#x27;t wrong. But for reasons that continue to escape me during these awful lockdowns we&#x27;re all facing, people don&#x27;t seem to think that their government-provided healthcare workers and price negotiators will do anything of the sort.')
