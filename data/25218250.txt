But the causation is from engineering to science.<p>Similar for modern states.<p>Also specifically central banks are a fairly recent idea in many parts of the world.  And areas like Canada, Scotland, Australia etc did just fine without them, or actually even better.<p>(I actually do like economics and think it&#x27;s very important and useful.  But politicians and civil servants can run a modern state just fine without economists.)')
