You will generally read &quot;Man&#x2F;Woman convicted for X&quot; and sometimes just their first name.<p>This is a consequence of systems that mostly focus on rehabilitation and reintegration. Having your name show up in newspaper articles would seriously hinder that.<p>If your main focus was punishment instead, then publishing the names of criminals just goes well with that.<p>And finally you can&#x27;t just ask to see the criminal history of X, and it would be illegal to discriminate based on such knowledge if it is not relevant to the job. In Germany only yourself can obtain your own criminal record (FÃ¼hrungszeugnis) - your employer can&#x27;t obtain it directly. It&#x27;s generally thought to be illegal for an employer to ask you for this (it was never tested in court though, because nobody was stupid enough to try). The only exception are if you will be working with minors or if it&#x27;s specifically relevant to your job (compliance officers, financial stuff...).<p>*If you are a high-profile individual you are fair game. For instance the Wirecard CEO and COO.')
