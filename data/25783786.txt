Unless he&#x27;s majorly stupid (I suppose that&#x27;s a possibility...), why would he just choose a random computer repair store and leave his laptop(s) there. According to snopes.com, the owner didn&#x27;t even see Hunter drop off the laptop: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;hunter-biden-laptop-giuliani&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;hunter-biden-laptop-g...</a><p>If I were Hunter Biden, I would certainly have connections who I can call and ask about fixing a laptop which has secret information, and I would check that they&#x27;re not a Trump supporter first. OTOH, if it really was Hunter Biden and he wasn&#x27;t an idiot, then him giving the laptop to some stranger would mean he was sure there were no secrets on that laptop. (Then again, people don&#x27;t understand tech and he might&#x27;ve thought deleting a file removes all traces of it).<p>But Twitter and Facebook censoring the story isn&#x27;t that neutral either, it&#x27;s obvious who they wanted to win the election.')
