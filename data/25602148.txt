It was fraud. Prosecute it as such.<p>Offering to courrier food from place A to B, including ordering the food from place A, should not be illegal. Pretending to be A to engage in that business is fraud, because you pretended to be A. It&#x27;s that simple. This law is a giveaway to the companies that have already engaged in fraud.')
