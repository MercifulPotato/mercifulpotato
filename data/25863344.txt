The winapi crate binds the functions in the Windows headers explicitly. You can call `winapi::...::CreateEventW` because winapi has a `pub extern unsafe fn CreateEventW(...)` in its code.<p>This new crate is a generator. If this new generator requires access to the .winmd files or .h files from the SDK or whatever, where is the non-Windows builder going to get those from? And will this generator look for them there?<p>For example, I used to maintain a generator that took COM typelibs and generated Rust bindings for them, but it required calling into the Windows API for working with typelibs and thus obviously required a Windows builder. The functionality of this crate is split between the windows_gen and windows_macros crates, and from a cursory glance I could not tell how it works wrt win32 bindings.<p>Edit: Answered by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25863581" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25863581</a> - the win32 API is now also described by .winmd files.<p>So the question is, can a non-Windows builder get these files, and then convince this crate to look for them wherever it placed them?')
