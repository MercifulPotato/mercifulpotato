First of all it takes a ton of energy to build a home, so housing would be fundamentally cheaper. Then, every month, I&#x27;d be spending less money on heating or air conditioning. I&#x27;d also be spending less of my own money on transportation (either through less gas costs, or buses&#x2F;trains being cheaper). Then since goods are cheaper at the store, I have more money to spend at the store.<p>There is one mode of transportation that is currently REALLY cheap and that&#x27;s huge ships. That&#x27;s why we import so much from China -- sending a huge ship across the ocean is really cheap. If all forms of transit were that cheap (trucks, flights) the world would be very different.')
