There are no OTC Z-drugs or benzos on the market.<p>The paper also notes that only chronic use of Z-drugs and benzos were associated with increases in mortality, and not intermittent use of Z-drugs. Even then, they issue a disclaimer about drawing such conclusions:<p>&gt; <i>In short, while no relation with mortality for intermittent users of Z-drugs was found, the current study showed that use of benzodiazepines and chronic usage of Z-drugs both were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Most of the effect estimates were reduced, but remained significant, after adjusting for confounding factors (except for Z-drugs). However, the low numbers of individuals reporting chronic usage indicate that the data should be interpreted cautiously.</i>')
