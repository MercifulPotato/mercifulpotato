Apple is more like Singapore, slick, seemingly benevolent, citizens honestly question why the rest of the world isn&#x27;t run the same way.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d add another way in which Google is like Russia and Apple like Singapore. Everyone kinda knows that Russia&#x27;s leaders are a bit&#x2F;a lot evil. There&#x27;s still a debate about whether Singapore&#x27;s leaders are evil.')
