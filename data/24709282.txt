I thought it was not a big deal so I tried signing in again but then it asked me to verify my phone number which I did not have at the moment, my phone&#x27;s screen had just broken and it was gone for repair. Eventually, Google just gave up on my device when it even stopped asking me to verify. I tried clearing cookies, switching VPN on&#x2F;off, restarting my system, using location spoof but literally nothing helped and now I&#x27;m just locked out of my own account on one of the devices. Not sure what to do next.')
