Systems such as Substance, which create algorithmic textures to replace manual texture creation in Photoshop, have resulted in at least a 10x increase in productivity.<p>Naturally, one may wonder if this has resulted in the labor market disappearing for artists. But it hasn&#x27;t. The demand for high quality art skyrocketed because the tools economically allowed for it. (In some ways the market for artists has gotten smaller, because there is less appetite for low-skill Photoshop monkeys, but highly skilled technical artists are much more in demand, because we are starting to see dramatic differences in productivity between artists just like we have seen in engineering.)<p>So, yes, we will see AI in content generation, but it isn&#x27;t going to be in the form of replacing art bottlenecks. It will manifest in new tooling for artists, who will become more productive, and there will be even fewer artists who have good mastery of these tools, and the demand of quality will increase further. Which would lead to similar bottlenecks to today, though I believe artists will be paid better, and it will become even tougher to break in.')
