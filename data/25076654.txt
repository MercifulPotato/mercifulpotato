How would the binaries you&#x27;re running have anything remotely relevant to say about this?<p>Because your temporary IP address is part of the hash request, and that&#x27;s usually enough to identify which major organisation&#x27;s network you are on, not counting any geolocation.<p>Thus, coffee shop (which brand), library (government network), home or mobile, at least.<p>I expect the websites and services I&#x27;m using to have this when I&#x27;m using them.  That&#x27;s reasonable, I&#x27;m reaching out to them.<p>Apple itself is not a service I&#x27;m using constantly, so I don&#x27;t expect it to be sent a minute-by-minute update of my movements whenever I&#x27;m doing work in a CLI, and happen to have wifi on.<p>(I don&#x27;t use iCloud, btw.  Perhaps people using iCloud expect activity to be streamed constantly.)<p>&gt; From a PR perspective Apple would never intentionally and publicly share this data.<p>Again, the question was whether the information is personal and sensitive.  That&#x27;s a property of the information itself.<p>Not whether Apple intends to store it and share it.')
