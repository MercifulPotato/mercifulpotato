Note that omitting a question mark actually makes a message less friendly, so itâ€™s a matter of observation and convention rather than inherent nature. For example, repeated commas,,, give more of a trailing off tone than ellipsis... which indicates a pause. I think kids get this kind of stuff intuitively and adults have to be told more often.')
