I got the same problem with my 2015 MBP screen and got it replaced for &quot;free&quot; (had to pay Rs. 2500 service charges) in Mumbai. My speakers got busted[1] too after 4 years but so did my previous laptop&#x27;s (Dell XPS 13 - 2011). While neither is acceptable, my point is that it is not unique to Apple.<p>However, I agree that Apple services are crap in India where they&#x27;ll charge you Rs.2500 for even telling you what is wrong with your laptop and then maybe ask you to get the motherboard replaced for a minor repairable problem.<p>[1] It is fairly easy to repair them by using rubber cement but don&#x27;t expect the original audio quality.')
