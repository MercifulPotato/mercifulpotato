And there is a strong grid operator that can do strategic planning.  This worked for wind, solar, and maybe battery storage now.  And this regulated&#x2F;grid based approach is what deals with issues like intermittency.  People may forget these things in a discussion on the web, but the grid and regulators do not.<p>And actually Hinckley and Sizewell do fit within this model.  They have been given very high strike prices and hopefully will be able to deliver a more cost effective pipeline of projects later on.  But this approach is more difficult with large, monolithic projects.')
