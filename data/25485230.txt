Maybe it&#x27;s also the time when the generation having learned computing from the ground up (assembler, C, hardware hacking) was starting to fade from the job market, or rather the then-new devs became eager to carve out their niche with arbitrary abstractions (but not entirely - I remember OOP bullshit from early 1990s and WS-* SOA crap from 2000s).')
