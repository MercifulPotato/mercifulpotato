It costs me about 9 USD a month for unlimited data (I mean, about 2 GB a day, BUT, with carry forward, so I have about 250 GB of data to use in my account), unlimited calls and sms. I stopped worrying about data a long time ago.<p>And I don&#x27;t even use JIO, the provider that brought in massive reductions in data prices.<p>Edit : I stopped using WiFi even at home, consume about 40 GB a month.')
