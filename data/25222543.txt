That&#x27;s my point. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;my car costs £10000 and my house is £300 000 and my car goes everywhere so this house is a rip off&quot;. It&#x27;s apples and oranges. People are being irrational about software purchases because MS etc. are cheap.<p>&gt; It’s like those epi pens that went up in price right?<p>it isn&#x27;t, because the price of the SaaS hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>&gt; Relative ROI is also important as we have to prioritize. GitHub seems a much better value to cost than this tool.<p>For something that costs tens of dollars per month for a company that employs software developers, there is zero debate about whether they can afford it. Provided ROI &gt; cost, why on earth wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>This just seems like irrational behaviour caused by the fact that software has near zero marginal costs and most people don&#x27;t understand that.')
