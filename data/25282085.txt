With an ensemble of online learning models for different blobs of taxa, it is a way to prevent concept drift and give weights to the different subdomains of training data to fight bias.<p>This kind of topological approach is great. One challenge in SQL is that class membership can only be so expressive and I have a nagging desire for slightly more RDF-like edges of predicates&#x2F;verbs, but that still feels like overkill to me since I can already do rule engines with facts based on the labels. Therefore I end up with class names like &quot;things that verb&quot; or &quot;things that are verbable&quot; like would be done for naming interfaces.<p>Scanning the paper I don&#x27;t understand the math well enough (am more of a code plumber). How would different &quot;types&quot; of edges be encoded to get past the perceived limitations of class membership?')
