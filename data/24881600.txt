So someone can&#x27;t simply hack or bribe that party. But what prevents a malicious actor from pushing their file&#x27;s signature onto the blockchain? If only certain keys are allowed to use for signing, we&#x27;re back to the trusted party: those with key access. What is the benefit here?<p>&gt; Imagine that all land records are in a distributed ledger. The land owner has a signed certificate that can be verified anytime for authenticity.<p>Is this related to the file authentication thing? Perhaps because I don&#x27;t know what benefit the former should have, I don&#x27;t get what this is supposed to have in common. Here too, though, I don&#x27;t see an advantage of doing it on a blockchain. The department of land records can publish a public key corresponding to the private key they use to sign land certificates: &quot;that can be verified anytime for authenticity.&quot;')
