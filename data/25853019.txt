Breaking into cars is a billion-dollar business.&quot;<p>In Brazil they rob the sound system, and other things, in place. Maybe that&#x27;s more common with older cars, that only had a CD player, but it happens.<p>With my sister&#x27;s car, they just broke down the door (like, folded it down a bit), stole the stereo, the CDs, and other stuff that was inside.<p>You know those car stereos that you could take the front off? A friend of my parents did that. They keyed the car, screwed with the door, and wrote that the stereo would have been cheaper...<p>So yeah, I would say that an alarm might have helped in those cases.')
