I now see where the inferential gap is.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re claiming that it&#x27;s some kind of call to action against &quot;unfettered free speech&quot; (which we already don&#x27;t have in the US anyways). Present an actual argument instead of taking a quote (properly attributed but sans context) and jump to conclusions that aren&#x27;t in it.<p>I was attributing the context to the quote. I hadn&#x27;t really considered that people were unaware of the context, because I had read the quote in context. Context being an editorial titled &quot;Why America needs a hate speech law&quot;<p>&gt; TL;DR: You are terrible at argumentation.<p>Thanks for the reply.')
