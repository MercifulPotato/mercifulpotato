Their PC game market was annihilated by Steam. Now Xbox and PS5 are going the same way, both limiting resales and cutting out physical retail.<p>GME are a retailer that was deep in debt before covid. Now they&#x27;ve had months of covid. All those rents still have to be paid or the stores closed. Ditto staff.<p>What makes you think the company will even exist in 6months?<p>Right now, they&#x27;re WSBs pet project. But I don&#x27;t see that lasting till the end of Feb. If it weren&#x27;t for RobinHood shenanigans and all the media coverage, they&#x27;d likely already be selling. As soon as the reddit hive mind withdraws, there isn&#x27;t much support even for a 1usd price level.<p>This is basically the analysis of the hedge funds who shorted it in the first place.<p>Of course, all this is my personal prejudice against physical retail. I&#x27;m just explaining the other side..')
