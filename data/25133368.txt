Are they shitting their pants or is this something that was somewhat expected given the progression of Apple&#x27;s chips and their announced plans? Do Intel&#x2F;AMD understand how Apple managed to so outmaneuver them? Is the performance gain Apple has delivered an inherent advantage of ARM over x86, and if so, does that imply that we are going to be seeing a migration to ARM in the PC space in the coming decade?<p>I&#x27;m deeply fascinated by these questions. I&#x27;d love it if someone in the chip design industry who is knowledgeable about the situation would comment.')
