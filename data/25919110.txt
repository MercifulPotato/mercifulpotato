Gave it away to the OpenBSD project. The screen is just too small to be useful. The 12&quot; MacBook, while equally anemic, is far more usable. Hopefully they make future M1 MacBooks that are lighter, the M1 MacBook Air is significantly heavier than the 12&quot; MacBook.<p>I also have a Planet Gemini, the spiritual successor to the Psion 5, that I still have but to be frank almost never use. That would be a much better candidate for tiniest laptop in the West (it ships with Android but you can install Linux).<p>I&#x27;ve had a bunch of other similar ultra-compact computers with keyboards, from the Cambridge Z88 to the HP95LX and 200LX, Sony Cli√© UX50 and Nokia E62 and N800. The reality never matches the dream.')
