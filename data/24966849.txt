Damn terrible turn up for the books, isn&#x27;t it.  It just illustrates how messy things have gotten and how we need to bring major change to the internet.<p>That said, for me Office 365 is a step too far.  On Windows I still ocassionally use the 2003 version along with LibreOffice and the latter on all my Linux machines.')
