Instead, what’s more important is finding that which is unique. That of which we can print no more. That which is finite.&quot;</i><p>The trillions of dollars in QE are mostly hoarded in banks, not pumped into the markets. This is evident as M0 has increased greatly, while M1 hasn&#x27;t. The purchases made in QE are mostly government bonds, the revenue of which is mostly spent on government salaries and entitlements. That&#x27;s why there is very little general inflation, there aren&#x27;t any big sums of <i>new</i> money flowing into consumer goods.<p>The trillions of private dollars chasing returns are still mostly risk-averse. It&#x27;s not venture capital. It&#x27;s not going to small business or home-owners. It may have gone into government bonds before, now it&#x27;s going into the S&amp;P. That&#x27;s asset price inflation.<p>Buying commodities such as gold (or Bitcoin) as a hedge against inflation is irrational, when assets such as stocks are both inflating in terms of price <i>and</i> appreciating in terms of actual value, at the same time.<p>Of course, irrationality has never prevented prices to rise, but when your fundamentals are based mostly around &quot;greater fool theory&quot;, you should perhaps reconsider your allocation.<p><i>&quot;It’s only a matter of time until people figure out that bitcoin is the ultimate collectible.&quot;</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t deny that there&#x27;s a certain sentimental value to owning one of &quot;only&quot; 21 million Bitcoins, but I wouldn&#x27;t personally put it anywhere near five figures.<p>For comparison, like many others, I enjoyed playing the original Super Mario on the NES as a child. It came on a cartridge of which about 40 million units exist, with a current value of around $10.')
