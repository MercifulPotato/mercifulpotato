Imagine seeing your friends, family and coworkers publicly denounce you because either they themselves are afraid to stand up to the mob, or maybe because they have something to gain. There have been people who were ostracized because they wouldn&#x27;t sufficiently (and publicly) denounced their family or if they attempted to defend their children (!!).<p>In a few years, these kinds of shenanigans are going to be characterized as a moral panic, in the same vein (though orders of magnitude more broad) as the &quot;Satanic ritual abuse&quot; in the 80s, and heck, even the &quot;Salem witch trials&quot;.')
