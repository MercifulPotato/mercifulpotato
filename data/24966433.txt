I wanted to create a company that was 1) fun place to work for devs and 2) that was able to deliver on time and on budget on every single project (I&#x27;m obsessed about customer satisfaction).<p>15 years later and many many projects later I think I have definitely succeeded in my goal. So I think I have proof that software consulting doesn&#x27;t really have to be that way. I can be fun, profitable and beneficial to all parties involved. We never had to hire a single sales person until 2020 because word of mouth kept us going.<p>By the way, we work at much better margins than those listed in here (I&#x27;m too shy to say the number though).<p>I think a lot has to do with passion and dedication. Knowing when to say no to customers and when to call bs on their deadlines.<p>I have definitely lost deals to other companies with a not-so-good value proposition but in the end those same customer come back calling us once they project melt in front of their eyes. I lost count how many times that happened. At least 30% of our project are a re-do of other companies fuck-ups.')
