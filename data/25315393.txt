Like this:<p>I had Fugu in 2009, in Tokyo, in some high-end sushi restaurant in the Ginza district (I don&#x27;t remember the name).  It was crazy expensive and not particularly good.  I wouldn&#x27;t have it again.  I mainly did it so I could say I&#x27;ve been-there-done-that.<p>(In point of actual fact, I really was in Tokyo in 2009, and I really did have some crazy-expensive sushi in the Ginza.  But I did not have fugu.  Never have, never will.  The thing that will make you lose respect and credibility in <i>my</i> eyes is being the kind of person who thinks there is value in bragging about having had fugu.)')
