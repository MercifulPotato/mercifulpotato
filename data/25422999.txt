I&#x27;ve worked for G as well as for a &quot;fruity&quot; FAANG company, and the difference between how they approach product and UI design is stark. At Pineapple, the HI lead, often working closely with the eng DRI, simply declares: &quot;This design is best for users. We know this because we are professionals, have good taste, and [sometimes] there is research to support it.&quot; Maybe they&#x27;ll measure it later as an afterthought. Unless a higher-up intervenes, the product is then designed that way, and often succeeds. If it is a failure, the responsibility lies on one or two (at most) leads.<p>The Google way is totally different. UX and product management works together to brainstorm potential designs, but there is a lot of uncertainty. All the alternatives go into a slide deck where comments pour in. The comments don&#x27;t really resolve anything, they just add more uncertainty. Meetings are had where more people weigh in, including directors and VPs if it&#x27;s a big enough project. Nobody can prove which design is best, and we cannot launch something that isn&#x27;t backed by measurement, therefore we must conduct a thorough <i>UX research study</i>. This leads to a low-risk compromise design with a slate of minor unknowns still left that must be A&#x2F;B tested with real users in order to know which way is correct. Oh, and Legal has to weigh in. Finally the product is launched but we&#x27;re still nervous and don&#x27;t know whether the design is right, so it&#x27;s launched with dozens of flags to turn off various things in case we&#x27;re wrong. In the end, nobody can point to any one person responsible, and nobody in the entire process had to stick their neck out and make a judgment call.')
