Some of us know the health side well a lot of us don&#x27;t. Then we get an issue, like I had a heart attack and stents, and besides what the doctors and the family say, we read and read and read. And then when we see all the healthcare industry is trying to do is to make money from our sickness, when we see a friend in similar or really tangential pain, we try to help based on our experiences. That is life.  I have offered my (unsolicited) help and knowing my condition some people have also seemed my help. That is again life.<p>What you and I need are skills to move on if not interested, but blaming people for trying to help in a social setting is probably not the right way to look at it. Apologies for being blunt.')
