Pricing of pharmaceuticals is independent of the cost of development.  Nobody will pay $200 per Covid vaccine dose just because the cost to develop it went up 10x.  Every extra dollar spent on development, is one less dollar of profit.<p>That&#x27;s why some drugs never make it to market - the cost to bring them to market and the low price means they&#x27;ll never be profitable.')
