If the discussion is short enough, the way it&#x27;s displayed doesn&#x27;t really matter either way.<p>&gt; Other examples would include threads with real-time reactions to events, like a sporting event or political debate<p>I think the line between a mostly synchronous chat and an asynchronous discussion forum as been blurred a bit.  In chat, it&#x27;s a lot easier to follow a discussion as it&#x27;s happening because you can read the messages as they come in and only pay attention to the ones you&#x27;re interested in.  But trying to read the log after the fact is a bit more time consuming because you have to search for the relevant messages amongst many.<p>In a threaded and asynchronous discussion, it&#x27;s easier to go down a subthread to follow a particular discussion than it is to find that discussion mixed in with all the other posts.<p>That said, I find it interesting that email clients have moved towards displaying messages in a conversation view, yet newer chat clients like Slack are introducing threaded discussiion as a feature.')
