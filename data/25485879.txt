You&#x27;re probably only looking at a relatively small area but it&#x27;s unlikely to be evident from optical images.<p>As an indication of how sensitive it is, you can use SAR interferometry to see where Crossrail tunnels have been bored under London, despite the elevation change of the buildings and roads on top being too small to have had any impact on their structural integrity. The caveat is that this level of sensitivity you get when looking at smooth, undisturbed surfaces like the roofs of buildings isn&#x27;t matched when you&#x27;re looking at fields with growth and soil movement')
