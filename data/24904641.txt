FB et al didn&#x27;t want to choose between editorial and common carrier status and the government acceeded to that whine. 230 is what we got, and now we find that 230-protected companies want to exercise editorial control. I don&#x27;t know what the perfect solution is, but reversing to the common carrier distinction ain&#x27;t gonna be it.')
