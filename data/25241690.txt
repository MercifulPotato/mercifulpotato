This was a deliberate and overt tactic by the Taiwanese government. It&#x27;s been heavily discussed in geopolitical circles for decades.<p>TSMC is not something that can be &quot;acquired&quot; by military force. That&#x27;s not how things work. If China does follow through on their threats to take the island by force, they won&#x27;t be able to simply operate TSMC as if they were new management. The organization itself will cease to exist, along with all the institutional knowledge necessary to duplicate their success, even assuming China was able to secure the fab lines without damage. Likewise all customer relationships become essentially void, and the finely tuned money machine that sustains TSMC&#x27;s intense R&amp;D ceases to exist as well.')
