And learning vocabulary takes a lot of time. You can join exactly zero conversations about everyday topics without knowing at least a few hundred, better a few thousand words. You can&#x27;t even read stories for toddlers without knowing a few hundred words. Grammar won&#x27;t help you understand sentences if all the meaning you extract is Noun (singular, female) Verb (present tense) Object (plural, neutral).<p>Learning grammar on the other hand is relatively easy, because there are far fewer rules to remember and you naturally develop a &quot;feeling&quot; for correct sentence structure after you&#x27;ve used the language enough, even passively.')
