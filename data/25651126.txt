They wrote a completely new UI toolkit for fullscreen tablet apps that only Store apps could make use of, then shipped an ARM port that refused to load anything but those signed fullscreen tablet apps. The comparatively less-locked-down Intel models succeeded far better than the WinRT&#x2F;ARM ones, so the lesson was mislearned as &quot;people want Intel&quot;.<p>Apple knows that interfering with how people get their software to try and collect revenue is not a great idea; that&#x27;s why the M1 Macs have the same security policy as Intel&#x2F;T2 ones. If they had locked it down iOS style, creative professionals would be fleeing the Mac in droves and Adobe would seriously start considering native Photoshop on Linux.')
