Item(by='tannhaeuser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610013489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668321, text='I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve added that last paragraph, because I had the impression you&#x27;d welcome our new F&#x2F;OSS overlords, even though I factually agree with your point about open implementations having replaced open standards.<p>What I mean is that, while people love to argue about F&#x2F;OSS free vs open licenses nuances ad infinitum, the reality is that power has shifted to a very small number of players (FAANG, RedHat&#x2F;IBM, MS et al) who&#x27;ve captured F&#x2F;OSS, without choice, discussion, evolution (of competing ideas). What you call &quot;design by committee&quot; can alternatively be seen as a defense against unilateralism with the power dynamics we&#x27;ve headed into.<p>&quot;Open implementations&quot; means nobody can make a buck and sustain development and innovation. The only gain to be made is through integration and attention economy, creating perverse incentives.<p>Take Linux: they&#x27;re trying to implement an operating system for like 30 years now in a monolithic fashion. The power of Unix is not that it&#x27;s the most advanced operating system, even by 1970s standards, but that it is a minimal portable system that can be created from scratch in one or two years.<p>Linux being GPL hasn&#x27;t prevented it from being used for a giant spynet (Android) nor a lock-in scheme (&quot;the Cloud&quot;, k8s) taking Unix principles of site autonomy and small parts working together ad absurdum (the absurd part being that to shield against minor F&#x2F;OSS version conflicts we need opaque almighty container orchestration and an accompanying zoo of tools, all the while we&#x27;re doing largely the same we did 20 years ago on much less capable hardware).<p>Take so-called web standards: the idea of standardization is  originally motivated by digital humanism, eg. that we do the best we can to come up with idioms and languages for digital communication and its preservation, accepting inclusion over perfection. The reality is that this idea has been usurped by an ad company taking all communication into an analytics-heavy medium more idiosyncratic than ever, leaving a single browser capable to render web content in its entirety, where &quot;standards&quot; (HTML, http) are created by the dev team of said browser. We didn&#x27;t need that; we had CompuServe, AOL, and desktop operating systems for this purpose.')
