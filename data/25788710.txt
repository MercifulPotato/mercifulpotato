Item(by='berkes', descendants=None, kids=[25788966], score=None, time=1610702516, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788655, text='&quot;planting trees&quot; is not &quot;just greenwashing&quot;.<p>When agricultural (or similar) lands are transformed back to forests, that has a real and direct effect on the ability of the environment to absorb CO2 emission.<p>Obviously it needs to be done well, which often is not the case. Quite often there&#x27;s no tree planted IRL, just some &quot;promise to probably do so in some future&quot; sold instead. And quite often the tree is planted but then abandoned (so that each 2 years everything dies off and the same plot can be re-used to &quot;plant more trees&quot;). But that is not the only modus operandi.')
