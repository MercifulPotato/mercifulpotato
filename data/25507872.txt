That CAN be the right answer for some people and they will find meaning in that. It is totally fine to pursue that if your heart tells you that is meaningful. Just make sure your hard work actually moves you towards that goal (working for a paycheck versus working to increase the value of equity in something, for example)<p>But, it is totally fine if you personally prefer to have a quiet family life and spend as much time as you can with your children. If that is what your heart tells you is meaningful - set your life up that way.<p>It’s a personal decision always. Neither is right or wrong. People are different. It’s ok to find something meaningful that others don’t value the same way.')
