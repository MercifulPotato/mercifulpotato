Manpages don&#x27;t exist and there is no useful substitute. And this in a Git distribution <i>that ships with its own GNU environment</i> (MSYS2). And then, there&#x27;s Git LFS, for which I haven&#x27;t even found a working help command yet.<p>While the original idea might have been that the terminal way of looking things up is too confusing for Windows users (which I find ironic, given that said users installed a terminal program), I find it still makes Git even more arcane on this platform.<p>Edit: Coming back to `man`: Git is in the useful position of shipping their own GNU environment. That means, they could still introduce manpages. Other, small CLI utilities usually don&#x27;t have that luxury. In those cases, <i>some</i> kind of access to the information in the manpage would still be very handy, even if it is just in `tool --help`.')
