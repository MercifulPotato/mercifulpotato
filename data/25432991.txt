I don&#x27;t have the inner voice either, so it&#x27;s less like reading a text and somewhat more like reading code. No narration, just a stream of... invisible &quot;variables&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to explain without having experienced what other people see or hear, I have no point of reference.<p>I also have the bad habit of forgetting people. \n&quot;Out of sight, out of mind&quot;, except I do have object persistence. I imagine it is easier to randomly think about someone when you can hear or see them at will.')
