It was very similar to WebAssembly today, just a fair bit chuggier.<p>Two things caused people to backpedal from the applet strategy:<p>1) Because there was a large hiring pool of millions of fresh grads leaving college with a little Java under their belts, it having displaced C++ and Pascal as an introductory language, companies began Java projects and Java came to be seen as an enterprise language.<p>2) The JVM that Microsoft implemented inside IE had proprietary Microsoft extensions for greater Windows integration. Sun sued Microsoft over this, and won.

The browser plug-in was way clunkier even than the original embedded JVM was.')
