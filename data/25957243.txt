A UI that works well for inexperienced users is better than one that isn&#x27;t. But the real measure of a good UI is if it works well for inexperienced users <i>and</i> actively allows for them to gain experience while using the software.<p>A good example is how, in classic application menus, each entry would have its keyboard shortcut printed next to it. A fresh user can navigate the menu to find an action, and the same option is open to anyone how forgot about how to invoke the action, but whenever they land on the action, they can see the keyboard shortcut and eventually they&#x27;ll remember it and learn to invoke the action faster without having to make an active effort.<p>This is good UX.<p>Then designers or product owners or someone decided that the shortcuts made their menus look cluttered (or maybe they really took that &quot;treating your users as incompetent&quot; mantra to heart and thought the shortcuts looked too technical or intimidating), thus condeming inexperienced users to stay inexperienced forever.<p>This is bad UX.')
