I don&#x27;t think the vast majority of conservatives are intransigent, just so emotional wrapped up in their beliefs that they&#x27;re completely unable to distinguish fact from fiction. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that it happened to the party that Barry Goldwater referenced in this prediction: <i>&quot;Mark my word, if and when these preachers get control of the party, and they&#x27;re sure trying to do so, it&#x27;s going to be a terrible damn problem. Frankly, these people frighten me. Politics and governing demand compromise. But these Christians believe they are acting in the name of God, so they can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t compromise. I know, I&#x27;ve tried to deal with them.&quot;</i> It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the qanon conspiracy is chock full of rhetoric about satanic rituals either.<p><i>&gt; And as much as I want to encourage a new spirit of unity, I fear that if that becomes an excuse to not confront this problem, then it will actually just make things worse.</i><p>Here&#x27;s why I have absolutely zero faith that a spirit of unity will work: this &quot;situation&quot; has been festering since the founding of this nation and every time &quot;unity&quot; prevailed, the can was just kicked down the road. We wanted &quot;All men are created equal&quot; and got the 3&#x2F;5ths compromise. We tried to save the Union, only to give up on Reconstruction before it could even really begin while institutionalizing slavery in the 13th amendment. Instead of letting general Sherman raze the south, we paid for their rebuild on the backs of &quot;free&quot; African Americans and let them institute Jim Crow laws to continue the oppression. When the Civil Rights movement and desegregation finally came home to roost, it caused the biggest political realignment in this country&#x27;s history taking us up to this point.<p>We wanted the best, but it turned out like always.')
