You&#x27;re not in the &quot;flow&quot; at that point.<p>The article is correct that expecting average drivers to do this without training is a high risk move. I&#x27;ve given flight instruction, taking over a landing 20ft off the ground is way harder than landing a plane yourself. And that&#x27;s with a lot of training, not just an average driver being put in a place to supervise Tesla autopilot with no training at all.')
