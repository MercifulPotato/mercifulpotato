What we do assume is that at least <i>some</i> aliens would be interested, because we assume intellect comes with innate curiosity. In an advanced culture, even a small number of individuals exhibiting an interest would be enough to form a field of study, just as it is here on Earth.<p>Asserting that nobody us studying is because we&#x27;re uninteresting to every single alien creature is a baffling statement, given the odds. The odds are far greater in my opinion that we&#x27;re alone or at least functionally alone, even though I must admit I hate the notion.<p>We also don&#x27;t assume everyone builds megastructures or emits huge technosignatures, but it throws us off that apparently <i>nobody</i> does.')
