It could be as simple as selling a special version of the documentation for $25. That&#x27;s obviously not at the same level as dropping a $5000 donation, but it&#x27;s more than zero, and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier for an employee to ask them to pay $25 for a tool they need to do their work than to ask them to donate $5000.')
