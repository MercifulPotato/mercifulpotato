Funny how that works when you constantly prove everybody wrong but nobody remembers all those idiots who were wrong. Elon himself says he is giving median outcome predictions, half of his predictions are assumed by him to be wrong.<p>Also funny how one accident of a system that save countless lives is used to shit on him, but giving him credit for the countless lives that the system saved are ignored.<p>You should reevaluate your priorities.')
