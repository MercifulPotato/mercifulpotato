She got her paper approved by the normal, written process, i.e., a reviewer reviewed it and accepted it and thereby gave her formal permission to publish it. Then management said that anonymous people had concerns.<p>Furthermore, the review process does not involve anonymous review. And no similar process does. (This was not scientific peer review: no scientific process has peer reviewers <i>from one&#x27;s own institution</i>. This was pre-submission review, and the venue would have appointed anonymous peer reviewers, almost certainly avoiding reviewers from the same institution specifically to avoid conflicts of interest.)<p>A more analogous process would be code review. If I made a code review, a coworker approved it, and my skip-manager said &quot;This was reverted because some people said we couldn&#x27;t ship it, but I&#x27;m not telling you who,&quot; I&#x27;d feel entirely justified in objecting. (This process is neither scientific peer review nor code review, but it&#x27;s much closer to code review.)')
