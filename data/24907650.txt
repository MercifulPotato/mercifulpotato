Any company with Hans Robertson on the board should be avoided.<p>They really shouldn&#x27;t be able to change the company name to hide their guilt. They should be seeking other lines of work, out of the surveillance industry forever.<p>People worry about a culture that doesn&#x27;t seem to allow for grace, but this is the sort of case that seems appropriate. There&#x27;s no real recognition of fault here, and the affected women are still forced to work alongside their harassers. Horrific!')
