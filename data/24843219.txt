My company only has one small team so we all do a bit of everything: frontend web, react native app, backend, ops stuff. We&#x27;d never hire someone who was only front-end or only backend because that would leave half the job they weren&#x27;t doing. But we have hired junior engineers who have only a little professional experience.<p>Seeing full-stack on a resume shouldn&#x27;t set any expectations other than they have and intend to continue working on both front-end and backend code.')
