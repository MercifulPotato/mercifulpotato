We called them telephones.</i><p>Telephones are not public communication.<p><i>&gt; An internet where 3 weeks out from an election, the major providers of information ban information that hurts their political candidate is not a functional internet, it&#x27;s an Orwellian dystopia.</i><p>It’s interesting to me that the same people who are up in arms about the response to the NY Post story — the veracity of which has been questioned by several prominent publications — had nothing to say when Twitter announced that they would suspend accounts of users wishing the President would die of COVID. If I had to label one of those an “Orwellian dystopia”, it would not be the suppression of pro–ruling party agitprop.')
