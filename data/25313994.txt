I felt the same way as you two days ago.<p>You might be interested to know that I’ve changed my mind. The reasons are documented here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25308233" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25308233</a><p>Basically, every one of those arguments evaporates when you dig into the details. She was doing her job. The paper was anodyne and perhaps even boring. She was rightfully pissed off that some middle manager was telling her and her four coauthors that they must retract their paper (the reviewers later posted on Reddit that they would have been happy to accept edits). Jeff was micromanaging her citation list, which is almost unheard of, apparently. Multiple google employees came out of the woodwork to say “there is no such review process, other than a quick scan to see if you’re leaking company secrets by accident.”<p>All of this is fascinating. Because, as far as I can tell, the entire AI community is now on her side. The only people who keep bringing up her character flaws are people who don’t do AI &#x2F; ML. Or at least, they seem to be pretty quiet now that Jeff revealed Google supposedly has some weird academic review process no one’s heard of till now.<p>Your feelings about the journalists are completely warranted, to underscore that point. But it’s odd how much momentum is building. Try to ignore the circus; you’ll be surprised to find there is substance behind the claims. I was as surprised as anyone.<p>And to reiterate, pick any one of the arguments you mention, and really dig into it deeply for details. Try to verify the claims. The most you’ll get is that she was curt. And I remind you that it’s usually known who the reviewers are at any given venue. Even if it’s blinded, you at least know the general group of people involved. In this case it was highly unusual to do some kind of anonymous, selective, ad-hoc enforcement of rules that really don’t seem to benefit the scientific process in any way.')
