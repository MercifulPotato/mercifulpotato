According to Ethereum website, &quot;Customers have a secure, built-in guarantee that funds will only change hands if you provide what was agreed.&quot; Person B provides goods&#x2F;services. Person A says no goods or services were provided. The assumed guarantees turn out to be fiction.<p>Here&#x27;s a real world example. A typical contract between a supplier and a chain store common in many parts of the world goes something like this:<p>- supplier provides goods on a continuous basis<p>- the chain store pays for goods once every three months<p>In the real world this contract is enforceable by, well, centralised laws of the respective countries. If the chain store reneges on payment, it can be taken to court and forced to pay.<p>In case of &quot;smart&quot; contracts, well, keep sending goods for three months in the hope that you get paid.')
