Pornhub just purged 10 million videos because they couldn&#x27;t moderate out child porn and rape videos.<p>PornHub is not a good example here.  Reactive content moderation doesn&#x27;t work for porn, because it&#x27;s too hard to distinguish a positive from a negative.  Content moderation for porn has probably been solved...by using a per-clearance model coupled with strong identity verification.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s terrible content all over Facebook<p>That&#x27;s probably true, but the worst appears to be much harder to find.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to detect and ban all porn (especially if you can ban all nudity) than just certain heinous kinds of porn specifically.<p>&gt; - Facebook’s improved AI isn’t preventing harmful content from spreading <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;facebooks-improved-ai-isn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;venturebeat.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;19&#x2F;facebooks-improved-ai-isn</a>...<p>&gt; - Despite Facebook ban on Holocaust denial, it’s still easy to find <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;diaspora&#x2F;despite-facebook-ban-on-holoc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;diaspora&#x2F;despite-facebook-ban-on-holoc</a>...<p>Facebook seems to have more problems with trickier things, like hate speech, holocaust denial, and mis&#x2F;disinformation.  We have pretty good technology now for recognizing things in images, but we don&#x27;t nearly technology that good for understanding the meaning of speech and text.')
