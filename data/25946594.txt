Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611858875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25943058, text='&gt; Robinhood is a margin-lending options-trading broker. If a customer falls down on a trade, it is ultimately liable. If a retail customer loses money and makes a FINRA complaint that Robinhood induced them to buy through its gameified interface, it is liable. Risk and compliance likely made this call.<p>This is a very tenuous argument. By law, options customers in the US have to receive an information packet and accept an Options Agreement, wherein it&#x27;s clear that they could lose 100% of their premium outlay (or more). Options trading is approved based on levels; not every account can buy options, and not every options account can sell naked options.<p>If we are assuming good faith from RH, maybe they are trying to prevent margin-call suicides. But I don&#x27;t assume good faith from RH.<p>Not to mention that they turned off all opening trades -- not just large trades, margin trades, or options trades.')
