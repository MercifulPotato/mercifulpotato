Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609200777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562632, text='&gt; I am an individual, not some nameless entity that can only think as a collective.<p>Yes. We all are. That’s <i>why</i> rules need to be made.<p>&gt; I, personally, don&#x27;t believe that a free society should be told what kind of merchandise they can sell or not sell at a checkout line. That goes for literally anything.<p>That seems... pretty extreme, and probably not shared by most people.<p>&gt; A business that does &quot;harmful things&quot;, such as stocking chocolate bars next to customers while they are idle in a queue (Shocking! How dare they commit such a heinous act! This is a public health atrocity!), clearly sees a mutually beneficial arrangement in where they put what merchandise. The customer has a need fulfilled (They see something they want and agree to purchase it for a marked price), and the business generates revenue. There is nothing inherently wrong with that.<p>Most places, at least in the parts of the US I’ve lived (major cities on both coasts) and visited (roughly 2&#x2F;3 of the country) don&#x27;t offer a choice at all, so it’s hard to ascertain how many of their customers find it mutually beneficial. In the few places I’ve seen that offer a mix, I’ve seen people intentionally queue up in those non-junk stocked aisles. Often they’re parents shopping with their children. So it seems likely at least some people would prefer this change.<p>&gt; Do you people really sit there and think anyone that buys something because they want it and it&#x27;s readily available is too stupid to know the dangers of eating too much unhealthy food?<p>Why does it have to be a matter of intelligence? I’m plenty smart but still make a variety of decisions that are bad for my health. I drink and smoke for example, and I’d likely at least never have started smoking if anti-smoking efforts had been employed more aggressively when I was a teenager.<p>&gt; Do you think that they are being physically manipulated into buying it?<p>Do... you not even know what marketing is? Of course people are being manipulated to buy products they otherwise wouldn’t buy.<p>&gt; Yes, unhealthy foods generally stimulate the brain and create a desire for more, but the same justification can be used to go the full mile and ban them outright if you are so concerned. That&#x27;ll probably happen eventually anyways, and you don&#x27;t want to be on the wrong side of history!<p>What a silly slippery slope argument. If there was any interest in actually banning these products, they would have levied a sin tax and added labeling requirements indicating their health impact. All they’re doing is removing the impulse marketing.')
