You wouldn&#x27;t need to sell <i>user</i> data, but there certainly is something of value from the cloud offering you (and your users!) should be aware of.<p>The logs of location sharing uploads and queries contain two pieces of information that together would allow for certain types of analytics:<p><pre><code>    * Approximate location even from partially redacted IPs (via geoip lookup)\n    * Timestamp of action\n</code></pre>\nThe value of that information is not in individual users or their data. It&#x27;s in their aggregate behaviour in locations over time. Want to know where privacy-aware users are more likely to be found? Or how about where the trend of privacy awareness is increasing or decreasing?<p>The people who are actively aware of their privacy are more willing to pay for good services. That&#x27;s a marketing cohort all by itself.<p>NOTE: I&#x27;m writing this with my DPO hat on, because even if the impact assessment for using this kind of service would be pretty simple, it would <i>not</i> be a no-op.')
