I really liked my own calculations on Lambda costs similar to yours until I figured I&#x27;d need to use API Gateway too.<p>Edit: another thing is the amount of RAM used by functions. The CPU speed you get is proportional to RAM so if your code fits in the RAM but has poor performance, doubling the RAM is what you have to do. Another hidden cost.')
