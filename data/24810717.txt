Devote ALL of your time to it. Once you&#x27;re spending all of your time on it, you have a consulting business. You will figure out over time how to optimize your business, find the clients you enjoy working with, earn more money, etc.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re concerned about finding new clients? There is a market rate for your services. As long as you charge that market rate and do good work, you will find clients. Client will refer you to other clients. Some clients have an unending stream of work, etc. Getting started can be a bit difficult, look for clients where clients are looking for you (angel.co and similar sites). Now is a good time to get started, there is a mountain of work out there.')
