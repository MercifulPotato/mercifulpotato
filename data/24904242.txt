I put the essentials about Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition Cost together in one short book. This isn&#x27;t short-lived growth hacking stuff but calculations and models that will last and apply to multiple business types. Lots of case studies included too.<p>This is only the second time I&#x27;ve been paid for something I wrote, but I&#x27;m happy to share what I learned so far, so feel free to ask me anything.<p>The book (called Growth Units) is on Amazon and Gumroad. Here&#x27;s a discount link for the book if you&#x27;d like to check it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;AKtmRM&#x2F;Hn')
