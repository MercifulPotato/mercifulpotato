Item(by='ineedasername', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607817937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402285, text='<i>&gt;rule on what the law is, not decide what the law should be</i><p>There&#x27;s a huge grey area there. Both require the court to insert its judgement instead of that of elected officials making the law. Whether or not they are ruling on &quot;what the law should be&quot; is not a binary determination and different people draw the line in different places. Every judicial act at that level is one of interpretation, and that will always necessarily carry the risk of an interpretation that is not in keeping with the legislative intent. In which case the remedy is additional legislation to clarify that intent.<p>In this example, should Congress decide monetary damages should not be in the scope of &quot;appropriate relief&quot;, they can change the law. Right now there are undoubted some-- the DOJ who fought this issue for example-- who believe the court just &quot;decided what the law should be.&quot; That&#x27;s probably in the nature of most decisions the court makes-- the losing side will thing the court got it wrong.')
