Learning any mathematics is a complete waste of time.<p>&gt; gives the (false) impression that it plays some important role in modern mathematics.<p>What are you talking about?<p>HoTT is broadly regarded as an exciting and important new area of mathematics; your view is absolutely the minority view. I mean I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to be able to convince you otherwise if you genuinely think that there&#x27;s &quot;not much content&quot; in HoTT, but there are loads of well-regarded and prominent mathematicians who hold the opposite view to yours.')
