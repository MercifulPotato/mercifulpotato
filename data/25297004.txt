UBS Securities, a Swiss bank, owns a minority interest in that Chinese bank.<p>UBS Securities was paid some amount of money by State Street Capital in connection with a $400 million offering of securities by State Street Capital.<p>State Street Capital co-owns, with Dominion&#x27;s management team, Dominion voting systems.<p>There is no rational way this set of facts supports the conclusion &quot;China owns the company directly involved in USA voting&quot;.<p>&quot;China owns the majority of a Chinese bank in which a minority stake is owned a Swiss bank who received money in relation to a securities offering by a US private equity firm which co-owns the company directly involved in USA voting&quot; is not really a cause for any particular concern that I can see.')
