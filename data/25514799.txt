I suppose that is exactly what the ACLU was trying to find out, but I thought something like AES-256 should be impossible in principle to break.<p>So what type of thing is most likely happening? Are hardware vendors secretly installing back doors? is there some sort of software encryption standard that&#x27;s compromised? Or some kind of secret breakthrough in computation theory that easily &quot;solves&quot; encryption? Or maybe, bolstered by NSA surveillance, they just know passwords and unlock codes to devices?<p>Again, I understand that that is the exact mystery here, but I would appreciate knowing if one or more of the possibilities is conceptually more likely than the others.')
