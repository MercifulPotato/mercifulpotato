After an initial, though slow neurological recovery, spontaneous movement and speech disappeared. The patient developed such a severe impairment of arousal that he required intensive auditory and tactile stimulation to maintain a wakeful state. No structural lesions were found using a computerized tomography (CT) scan to explain this secondary deterioration, and conventional EEG-recordings showed no evidence of epilepsy. After a stay in the ICU and neurology department, the patient was transferred to a nursing home without a formal diagnosis explaining his hyporesponsive state. A structural MRI at follow-up showed signs of diffuse atrophy without hydrocephalus.<p>Eight years passed without any further improvement and neurological follow-up. Eventually, a new nursing home physician with experience in hyporesponsive disorders took over the patient&#x27;s treatment and performed a new neurological examination to find directions to improve his care. Upon clinical assessment, the now 37-year old patient seemed awake, but showed a complete lack of voluntary movement (akinesia) and absence of speech (mutism). More specifically, the patient showed no affective reactions, initiation of eating or drinking, and remained incontinent. Although the patient showed no signs of spontaneous speech or vocalization on request, he was able to respond to questions or commands with movements with a significant delay (usually a couple of seconds) and with evident ataxia and muscle rigidity. Despite his intact awareness, the patient&#x27;s initiative was so severely impaired that he remained wheelchair-bound and entirely dependent on nursing care for all daily activities, including the need for enteral tube feeding.</i><p>It&#x27;s incredible how little we still know about some things. They couldn&#x27;t pin down a cause and this is apparently a significant detail as to why this patient was basically warehoused in a nursing home with no real treatment for literally years until they tried this new thing, which had some short-lived effects.')
