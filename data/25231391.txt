I&#x27;m not going to remember everything I read anyway - but I can suspect some content, that I don&#x27;t care about consuming now (and possibly ever) MAY be useful at some point in the future in some way, and I&#x27;d like to skip few steps of consumption (like reading the whole thing, watching whole movie) and use it anyway (have a conclusion, post a gif reaction). It&#x27;s still transhumanist sci-fi, but it looks doable now.')
