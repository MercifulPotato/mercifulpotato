My name is Sam, and my Co-Founder Justus and I founded Canvisi.<p>I’m looking forward to hearing what feedback the community has for us.  But first, a little about what Canvisi does.<p>Canvisi is Customer Success for startups.  We all know the limited time and resources we have as founders, and our aim is to help startups with truly proactive Customer Success earlier than they would otherwise be able to afford.<p>Our experience: I have over 10 years experience in CX &amp; Customer Success.  Eight of those years have been spent working in Startups at various stages.  One problem I’ve seen at each organization where I’ve worked, Customer Success never evolved beyond reacting to every emergency that comes up.<p>Realistically, this is because by the the time the company had the ability to establish Customer Success, they really created was an Escalation Management team.  CSM’s typically spend their time reacting to emergency after emergency.<p>Ultimately this caused the company to miss critical feedback, make and set a floor in churn that would not budge.<p>A few things about what Canvisi offers:<p>1.  Full service Customer Success for your customers&#x2F;partners.  We we proactively engage with your existing user base, helping ensure they are making the most of your product.<p>2.  Tracking customer heath &amp; finding who’s an advocate, and who’s a detractor.<p>3.  Gather data that matters specifically to startups, helping guide product-market fit.<p>4.  Grow revenue from existing customers.<p>5.  Keep founders engaged at critical steps in the customer’s lifecycle.  Founder engagement must still be of critical importance at early stages.  We know this and don’t act as knowledge &amp; process hoarders.<p>Our goal, by helping founders establish Customer Success earlier, we help them move faster, learn more, and identify issues that would otherwise be in a founder’s blindspot.<p>I’ll be keeping an eye on the comments, and will be sure to answer any questions &amp; address feedback.')
