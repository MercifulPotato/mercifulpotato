There are tons of people that appreciate open source with exceptions to prevent managed offerings by cloud providers as long as self-hosting to support your own stuff is allowed (including ability to customize&#x2F;extend&#x2F;patch).<p>I for one will (with a few exceptions) only pay for a product that is open source (at least enough so that I can self-host for my own product if I want should things change).  Vendor lock-in is a serious problem and concern for many, and open source is how you address that concern.    The best example is GitLab, which gets a <i>ton</i> of money from me that would otherwise go to GitHub (which I like better) if GH were open source.<p>By going proprietary you avoid the vocal minority on the internet, but you also (silently) shrink your potential customer pool.  Especially with the AWS&#x2F;Parler stuff, there are even more people that want the option to self-host in case they get de-platformed if the Overton Window continues to shift.<p>May I ask what your product is?  Just curious :-)')
