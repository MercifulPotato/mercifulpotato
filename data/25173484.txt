For reasons I won&#x27;t go into Let&#x27;s Encrypt isn&#x27;t an option. The certificates that Cloudflare provisions (even when not using their universal SSL feature) are issued by a CA which isn&#x27;t supported by all versions of Apple Podcasts. GoDaddy was the only viable option.<p>GoDaddy has repeatedly fucked this up. Once, they renewed the cert, but didn&#x27;t publish it to the logs of issued certs. So Chrome started rejecting the new cert. Hard downtime. It took almost 24 hours for them to issue the guidance to &quot;just renew it again and hopefully it will work this time...we&#x27;ll refund the first one&quot;. Crazy.')
