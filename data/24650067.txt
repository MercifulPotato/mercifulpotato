The complete sterilization of the human race is so different from “multi child households will be less likely to have a third child”. They are incomparable to actual living child deaths because they are theoretical vs real. A theoretical person is not a conscious creature. It is an idea in an actual conscious creatures head. It cannot suffer. Its value is measured purely in how it could affect society, positively and negatively, if it had have been born. A real person is conscious and can suffer and their death is a direct loss to them and those around them. That is not comparable.')
