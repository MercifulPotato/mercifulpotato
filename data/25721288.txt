It&#x27;s the only way to form opinions outside of your expertise fields, because you simply don&#x27;t have the time to personally research everything.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very important to have a healthy dose of skepticism when receiving info from people who we trust, because we chose the gatekeepers based on our opinions which implicitly selects for our own biases.<p>For example I don&#x27;t actually know that the election wasn&#x27;t stolen. It&#x27;s an opinion that I hold due to choosing to trust a specific gatekeeper (main stream media) and a lack of hard evidence from the other side. If hard evidence were to be presented, the I would have to reexamine my beliefs even if they go against everything I believed in previously.')
