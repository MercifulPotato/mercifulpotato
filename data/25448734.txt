Tabs!<p>Ah how this resonates with me so much, I remember the difference of tabless IE and oh so magical Netscape &#x2F; Firefox when those were new.  I consider myself Mozilla fanboy to this days.<p>But alas, every time I try clean installation with default settings I cannot believe how â€¦ bad this became and how far it diverged from original experience: by now Firefox is browser with the WORST user experience regarding tabs usage, from my perspective.<p>Current defaults are:\n- Super slow Ctrl+Tab modal tab switcher, mimicking OS alt+tab app switching mechanic. But slow. And distracting. And not pretty. And considering tab bar, mostly redundant.\n- Ctrl+Tabbing order is, naturally, in most recently used order, so visual tab proximity means nothing.\n- Ctrl+Shift+Tab does mostly nothing [1].  No, it does not select the least recently used tab. No, it does not switch to tab to the left. When tabs don&#x27;t fit the tabs bar width, Ctrl+Shift+Tab opens <i>another</i> (vertical) tabs list and lets you read titles and navigate with arrows. But usually you just instinctively press Ctrl+Tab to &quot;undo&quot; it, but now you stare on that Modal over the opened list and question your browser choice. From there Ctrl+Tab finally stops working predictably and whole experience breaks into horrible mess.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Ctrl+PgUp&#x2F;PgDown still operates well. You can still change some settings to get even Ctrl+Tab working the way original Firefox popularized. But still, this state of things makes me very sad.  I&#x27;d really like to spread Firefox, but with such details that I cannot explain even to myself it is impossible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1576130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1576130</a>')
