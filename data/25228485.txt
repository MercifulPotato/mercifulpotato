When I started my recruiting business, I wanted to become so good that I eliminated unemployment.  That was a bit lofty, so I paid attention to things smaller in scope.  One thing holding back my recruiting business was was index finger hurt too much.  I could review a few hundred resumes in an hour, and processing each resume took about 10 clicks of the mouse.  My finger started to hate me, so I designed a recruiting application that got the number of clicks down to 1 per resume.<p>So maybe try to start big, and zoom in to focus in on one piece of the puzzle.  There&#x27;s a good chance that whatever you choose can be used in other ways if the primary idea doesn&#x27;t work out.')
