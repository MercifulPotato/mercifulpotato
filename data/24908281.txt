People thought some computers were powerful but we were always aware of their limitations. We just never imagined those limitations would go away as spectacularly as they have.<p>I also don&#x27;t agree with the iPhone comparison. Maybe smart phone (generalised) but the smart phone idea was about long before Apple entered the market. Whether it was PDAs (which I owned), Blackberry or Palm handsets (which I had as a work phone) or feature phones like Sony Ericsson handsets that had the web, maps and games (written in Java). For me, the thing iPhone and Android changed was the UI from being a physical key or stylus interface to a multi-touch glass screen. But there are some lost benefits to this (precision with the stylus and tactile buttons are faster to type on than touch screen) so, for me at least, the transition was bitter sweet once I&#x27;d gotten over the honeymoon period of owning a shiny new gadget.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about VR being one of the next big leaps. AI&#x2F;ML definitely feels like another one of those &quot;wow&quot; techs. That last one leads to greater autonomy (like self driving cars) which definitely feel like science fiction. But for me, the most exciting innovation yet to happen is augmented reality. I mean sure, we had some products that fizzled out (like Google Glass) and some cool phone apps that use AR. But I think wearable AR will take off again in our lifetimes and that will be as monumental a culture shift as the rise of the smart phone.')
