COL is obviously a function of location, but it&#x27;s much less obvious that market rate should be. In fact, if you assume that the market rate of an individual is based on the options available to them, and that individual has the option of moving to the Bay Area&#x2F;Seattle and is just as happy to live there as anywhere else, then the Bay Area &#x2F; Seattle rate, minus the COL difference, is <i>that individual&#x27;s</i> market rate, regardless of where they actually live.<p>Of course some SE&#x27;s in London don&#x27;t have a visa to work in the USA, and others wouldn&#x27;t want to even for a huge pay boost. But it&#x27;s still quite fascinating that a location-dependent &quot;market rate&quot; materializes from this dynamic. In some cases it seems like location is used as a proxy for skill -- as though an engineer who opts to drive three hours south from Vancouver, BC to Seattle, WA is now a higher-skilled &quot;Seattle dev&quot; than they were three hours before.<p>If that assumption is taken away, then the fascinating thing is not that companies would pay less in areas like Vancouver or London, but rather that they are willing to pay such a high premium to engineers who live in Seattle and the Bay area.<p>It&#x27;s hard to think of any explanation other than that very profitable companies (like Google and Netflix in the Bay area, and Microsoft and Amazon in Seattle) started there, and paid a lot for engineers to move in and join them in an era where remote work was rare; then, when remote work became common, the legacy of a location-dependent market rate created a self-sustaining expectation (Schelling point) that engineers in that area wouldn&#x27;t work for less to compete with talent elsewhere, sometimes using high COL as an excuse. That might gradually be reversed as companies seek to reduce their payroll expenses, or it might not.')
