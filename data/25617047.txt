Item(by='catblast', descendants=None, kids=[25618888, 25617452], score=None, time=1609625500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614632, text='&gt; I did fairly deep research on this beforehand, looking into actual pharmacological aspect of interactions with things like dopamine, etc<p>While you can read about mechanisms and in vitro this and that all day, this is not the same as quality applied clinical research, which frankly just doesn&#x27;t exist in any meaningful quantity. I am a practitioner, and I am very sympathetic to the movement of alternative treatments counter to established standards of care, however at the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the controlled research is non-existent or poor, and things like the MAPS manual are essentially woo.<p>And specifically the problems I have is that ironically, these alternative treatments which are supposedly trying to overcome boundaries of established care are extremely proscriptive themselves.. they&#x27;re limited, just differently, and the justifications have very little evidence based backing.')
