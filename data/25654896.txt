At least back then, the people I met were super smart (a lot of them were ex Facebook, again back when those teams were super good). I never met Kevin Frisch and don&#x27;t know if anything he said was taken out of context, but the first impression is not good. Also it&#x27;s a bit strange for a well-respected Uber guy to go to Intuit - it&#x27;s not a common career path.')
