France peaked on 2 November, 14 days ago, deaths attributed to those cases are just now being reported, but willdecrease rapidly.<p>Meantime US cases are still growing exponentially, with over 1 million new cases (at a 3% CFR) in the past week alone.<p>Calling the US situation &quot;better&quot; than Europe is ignoring the inevitable tragedy facing the US.  As with this past spring, a few weeks lag on the epidemic curve <i>can not</i> be represented as evidence of superior situation.  The future is here, it&#x27;s just distributed more in Europe than the US presently.  The US will get what&#x27;s due it within 2-3 weeks, possibly sooner.')
