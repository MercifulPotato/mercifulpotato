With your Math MS, you might actually do really well in the Machine Learning&#x2F;AI courses that they offer. The projects are mostly in Python and a lot of students do not have a CS undergrad, so you won&#x27;t be alone there. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omscentral.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;omscentral.com&#x2F;</a> is a good resource if you want to see per-course reviews on what the courses are like or how much programming you do. The systems engineering courses (compilers, distributed systems, operating systems) are heavy in C&#x2F;C++, but the machine learning courses are heavy in Python (AI for robotics for example, which is a great course). You can go to Udacity or Youtube and check out the videos if you want to try it out.')
