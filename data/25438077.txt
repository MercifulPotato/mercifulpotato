Even Linode charges $1000 per month, or $1.50 per hour (look at the GPU plans: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#row--compute" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linode.com&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;#row--compute</a>)<p>As AVX-512 becomes better supported by Intel and AMD chips, it becomes more attractive as an alternative to expensive GPU instances for workloads with small amounts of inference mixed with other computation')
