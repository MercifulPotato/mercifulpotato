Maybe the guy writing the article misrepresented Stoicism. &quot;Work toward as serene a degree of acceptance as you can muster instead. This doesn’t mean suppressing emotions. Rather, it means shifting your emotional spectrum—away from unhealthy emotions like anger and toward the mindful embracing of healthy ones like joy—by working on consciously altering the way you think about yourself and the world.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s the one that said anger is an unhealthy emotion. So my comment may be a perfect example of people misunderstanding Stoicism, but I&#x27;m merely the messenger. The guy who wrote the article is the one that made the claim.<p>By the way, I don&#x27;t think this is a small or unimportant point. Suppressed anger is extraordinarily unhealthy. Telling people their anger is bad for them just makes the problem worse.')
