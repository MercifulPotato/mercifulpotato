Often they contain good knowledge which confuses me even more.<p>For anyone unaware - it seems a lot of people must be, otherwise I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would choose to publish there - this is the flow for most users trying to read your articles:<p>- See a Google search result that goes to Medium<p>- Click the link and start reading<p>- Read the first two paragraphs, then see a popup saying you need to login to continue reading for free (the rest of the page isn&#x27;t rendered, so you can&#x27;t just block it with adblock)<p>- Reluctantly decide to login, waiting a few minutes for the email link to click on to do so<p>- Log in, then have to navigate your history back to the article, as they take you to a different page<p>- Start reading again, and after the first two paragraphs get a popup saying you need to pay $5&#x2F;mo to see the rest of the article<p>- Rage quit your job and go live in the forest<p>I understand there are ways around the paywall, but that&#x27;s not what most users are going to do.')
