Thus, the ones that exist are privileged over the ones that do not exist (yet), and the adjacent sequences are privileged over a random sequence.<p>&gt; No DNA sequence is more likely than any other to exist.<p>It is far more likely for a DNA sequence very similar to my own to exist than a random sequence.<p>&gt; we need to identify strong physical processes that produce useful DNA strands<p>We have already identified those processes! We know quite well how the machinery of DNA replication works.<p>If we care about the first DNA molecule to ever exist it&#x27;s a very different question. We don&#x27;t need to find a physical process that produces a modern DNA molecule from &#x27;raw parts&#x27;, rather one that takes not-quite-DNA and converts it into DNA.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s hard to imagine what those physical processes might be since the strands they must produce are extremely, unimaginably rare in practice.<p>Can you imagine slightly simpler DNA? Say just a bit shorter? What&#x27;s the simplest molecule we might still call DNA, that is reproducing? Can we imagine machinery that would produce that?<p>I think it&#x27;s very reasonable to think such machinery could exist, even if we don&#x27;t know the exact mechanisms involved. We know that RNA can self-reproduce, and also produce proteins, so it&#x27;s reasonable to think that machinery to produce RNA strands could evolve to produce DNA strands (for example).<p>The only involvement randomness has in this whole process are (relatively) rare and infrequent changes to self-replicating molecules, and (potentially) the initial formation of a self-replicating molecule.<p>It is irrelevant how many possible DNA sequences there are, or how much information is stored within them, as we know new sequences are derived from previous ones.')
