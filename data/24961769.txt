Thank you again for your reply and explanation!<p>I don&#x27;t think the field of chronobiology is snake oil. My only problem is some of SRBR&#x27;s citations seem to be used to make stronger claims, stated with far greater certainty than the research actually supports. So the question, naturally, is why? You do care if the links you&#x27;re posting, even as starting points, are fully true, partly true, or not true? Have you checked any of the citations I called out? (It would take no more than a few minutes.) Do you agree or disagree with my take?<p>&gt; A lot of the discussion on DST seems to be &quot;well I like later sunsets&quot;. Great. I like not having to wear a mask everywhere but do so anyway because that&#x27;s what the expert consensus is.<p>Let&#x27;s not get too carried away with analogies, there&#x27;s a pretty big difference in the study, certainty, magnitude and consensus of disease prevention strategies right now than there is in the barely directly studied and marginal tradeoffs of DST. More or less all of the research you&#x27;ve posted talks about lack of direct study of DST time shifts and the need for more research (which is why the &quot;strong&quot; claims and conclusions seem especially problematic).<p>A lot of the research you&#x27;re posting seems to boil down to &quot;well we should wake up with the sunrise, not before&quot;, which could well be true. Abolishing DST in favor of standard time is being advocated for the reason that staying on DST pushes winter waking to before the sun comes up. I don&#x27;t want that, it&#x27;s a little difficult and depressing and puts the morning winter commute into darkness.<p>If standard time is that much more important than DST, what is happening to people in Finland, Norway, Iceland and Svalbard, where the time shift becomes irrelevant compared to the sun shift? Are they unhappy, unhealthy or dying?<p>Getting rid of DST means we&#x27;re out of sync with the sun in the summer. <i>If</i> you believe it&#x27;s important to rise with the sun in the winter, then it&#x27;s probably not fair to characterize DST as &quot;I like later sunsets&quot;. Is it also bad to sleep well past sunrise, and then go to bed well into darkness, or would it be better to let the sleep schedule slide to be more aligned with sunrise and sunset in the summer? It seems like all the biological reasons to advocate for winter alignment shouldn&#x27;t be selectively ignored during the summer, right?<p>This is why I asked in another subthread whether neither daylight not standard is ideal, and we should rise with the sun. That&#x27;s what animals do naturally, and what humans likely did before industrialization, right?')
