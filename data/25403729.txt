May I ask in which department of Red Hat? The reason I ask that is, are you part of the decision making team which made this decision? If not, then no matter how good you think the intentions of Red Hat management here are, I can assure you that they haven&#x27;t been made for the betterment of the CentOS community. If this was anything to do with the betterment of the community then this wouldn&#x27;t have been a sudden announcement but instead would have been a long drawn discussion involving the community. I don&#x27;t say this just for the sake of it, but I have closely followed how they killed the JBoss application server community and the project, as I note in my other comment[1] and this whole CentOS announcement is exactly on similar lines. I have known people in the application server team, who initially tried to justify the whole process, just  like you are doing it now for this CentOS &quot;migration&quot;, but even they have now realized there wasn&#x27;t any truth to it.<p>It&#x27;s not a co-incidence or an accident that the messaging around the community side of this CentOS announcement is confusing and unclear (they are letting the community members try and decipher what this all means for the CentOS project) instead it is intentional.<p>The bottomline, just like in that other case, is that the sales team at Red Hat cannot justify the hundreds of thousands of dollars they ask for supporting RHEL, when customers (or prospective customers) note that they can get the same quality from CentOS (stable release, regular bug fixes, community help).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25358847" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25358847</a>')
