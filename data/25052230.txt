The few days it was happening were some of my least productive in a while.  Doing work while having a live camera pointed at my face all day made me nervous and unable to have deep thoughts.  On top of that, there was constant noise coming from my headphones of other people&#x27;s conversations.<p>My immediate response was to shut off my camera and drag my icon all the way to the corner of the screen so I can work alone.  If the goal is to reproduce the distracting nature of the open office, I gotta say projects like this are a huge success.  Also, streaming live video all day every day for no reason seems like a waste of resources on all parts.<p>I can see how this would be a cool tool for normal social events like parties and conferences though!  Just not every day work please.')
