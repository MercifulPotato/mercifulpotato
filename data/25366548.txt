Where does that right originate, and who gets to decide what those  circumstances are?<p>Liberals tend to believe that the constitution is a living document and can protect rights even when those rights didn’t exist at the time of the founding. Even if you accept that, you’re only halfway there. The right must still come from somewhere. Where does the right to an abortion, as defined by <i>Roe</i>—which conceives of a right to an abortion all the way to the point of viability—come from? If you can’t find it in the text of the Constitution, and you can’t find it in the history books of what rights the framers thoughts were fundamental, it has to derive from broad public recognition, correct?<p>Going to your second point—the right protected by <i>Roe</i> is very different than the version of abortion that has broad public support. Roe invalidates any law that bans abortion generally before viability (22-24 weeks), even if the law has exceptions for health of mother, etc.<p>That, however, is a much broader right than either Americans or most people in the rest of the developed world support. Support for “generally legal” abortion falls off a cliff after the first trimester: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-...</a>. Just 28% of people think abortion should be “generally legal” in the second trimester. There is a biological basis for why any parent who has had a 12-week anatomy scan might think that should be an upper limit on elective abortion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parents.com&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;week-by-week&#x2F;12&#x2F;your-growing-baby-week-12" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parents.com&#x2F;pregnancy&#x2F;week-by-week&#x2F;12&#x2F;your-growi...</a>. Not surprisingly, in Europe, 10-14 weeks is a very common time limit for elective abortions. Under <i>Roe</i>, the abortion laws of France and Denmark would be unconstitutional. This is not a theoretical issue: 1 in 10 US abortions happen after 13 weeks, and birth defects are not common enough to explain most of them.<p>So where does <i>Roe</i> come from, even within a liberal theory of what’s protected by the constitution?')
