Also struggled with application startup requiring far more CPU than at runtime leading to ridiculously slow startup times if you had a low limit.<p>So far our solution has been to just remove CPU limits, but hoping things will get better.<p>Removing the limits really improved our latency tail, and so far hasn&#x27;t resulted in CPU saturation at the node level but your mileage may vary')
