These 200-ish animals killed by housecats are on top of the food they&#x27;re already receiving at home, which is made from slaughtered animals.<p>A sports hunter who doesn&#x27;t eat their kills but only hunts for fun is an apt comparison, but do they really kill 200 animals <i>per year</i>? That&#x27;s more than one every two days. Typically that would be a weekend hobby and even if they went hunting 52 weeks of the year that&#x27;s almost 4 kills per hunting weekend. You really think that&#x27;s plausible (or even legal, given restrictions on hunting)?')
