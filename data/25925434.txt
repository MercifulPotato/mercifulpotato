But ultimately for better use (and having applications focus on the stuff they&#x27;re supposed to be about) the underlying system should allow for such uses - after all one of the original ideas behind Windows was to avoid having every application reinvent its own UI. But we just seem to be stuck around that point in most OSes (Cocoa probably being the exception of an OS framework that provides more than the basics)... if anything we&#x27;re regressing with every application (on the desktop at least) ignoring the OS GUI and doing its own anyway.')
