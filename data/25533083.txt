Type &#x27;suicide&#x27; into google and they show you a number above all results.<p>To everyone who doesn&#x27;t have a support structure, please just search for &#x27;suicide&#x2F;depression&#x2F;anxiety&#x2F;* hotline&#x27; in your language. You most likely will find someone who will talk to you for an hour at 4am. Don&#x27;t feel bad about it, you are not bothering anyone, they often do it voluntarily and just want to help others.')
