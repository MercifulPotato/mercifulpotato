There were just 12 of us in the class. Due to a bad strain of flu that winter, our final test on Catullus was postponed 4 times as various people were home sick. By the time everyone was back in class, we had studied them so thoroughly we knew many of the poems off by heart...<p>So 34 years later, I can still recite &quot;Odi et amo, fortasse requiris, ...&quot; and &quot;Sirmio, gem of islands and peninsulas, ...&quot; [peninsula = paenae insula = almost an island :)].<p>Another interesting side to Catullus comes from the music of Carl Orff. He is of course the composer of Carmina Burana, a collection of medieval drinking songs, with the most famous being O Fortuna! [1]. He also set Catullus&#x27;s poems to music, in his Carmina Catulli [2]. [3] is a version with the musical score in the background.<p>Here are two other Catullus resources for anyone wanting to learn more:<p>* Bilingual edition by Peter Green - Latin and English on opposite pages: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Poems-Catullus-Bilingual-Gaius-Valerius&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0520253868" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Poems-Catullus-Bilingual-Gaius-Valeri...</a><p>* Wikipedia has a very good list of all Catullus&#x27;s poems: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_poems_by_Catullus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_poems_by_Catullus</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GRjyxr1ysKw?t=77" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GRjyxr1ysKw?t=77</a> (O Fortuna starts at 1:17)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catulli_Carmina" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Catulli_Carmina</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0UDc2KdnuAo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=0UDc2KdnuAo</a>')
