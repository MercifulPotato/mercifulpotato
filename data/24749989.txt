Only TN panels are clocked that fast, and TN are ugly.<p>If you want nicer colours you go for IPS, which has a very slow response time (especially when compared to a CRT).<p>The only modern display technology that comes close to CRT in terms of colour, contrast and responsiveness, you need to go OLED. And that&#x27;s great (Oled with scanline emulation and black-frame insertion is incredible!) but OLED has the issues everyone knows about regarding degradation of the organic compounds (burn in).<p>I want my cake and to eat it, I want great colours and contrast <i>and</i> a stupid fast response time, with a panel that won&#x27;t burn-in my desktop.')
