There are ways to generate methane sustainably (from C02 and water); that&#x27;s even an essential part of the plan for Mars. I strongly suspect they&#x27;ll want to test it on Earth before, and having an appliance on the platform that generates the needed propellant for passenger flight would be a very good test (developing something that works reliably with minimal &#x2F; no human intervention).')
