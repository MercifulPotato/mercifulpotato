From there, we probably selected seeds from the tastiest&#x2F;easiest to harvest plants to replant, and thus that&#x27;s how we ended up where we are today (or at least before we figured out more advanced GMO techniques).<p>I thought that was the direction this article would end up going. I mean, could we or banana trees have evolved differently so that we wound up eating the banana leaves and not just using them as wrappers? Would our teeth have to look like a squirrel&#x27;s? Would the bananas themselves have to be different for the tree to grow so that leaves are tasty to us?')
