Sometimes we end up in situations that are unpleasant and the time it takes to change those situations is not necessarily short. As usual it&#x27;s easier said than done. But it is doable, sure, I agree. But they still take a huge toll. Think about the hiring interview wall that&#x27;s been going up recently. If stressed already one doesn&#x27;t feel like jumping to leets code in preparation for an interview. Also there are other circumstances that make some of us not leave a job right away when we feel something is not right.')
