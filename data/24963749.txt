To me, it seems pointless. But a lot of companies are buying into it so I&#x27;m wrong<p>Why would you ever want a standard ISA? If you&#x27;re buying chips you either want a cheap standard one or a powerful efficient one. To be efficient (or cheap) you&#x27;d want to only support what&#x27;s required and what works best with the implementation.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the point of a generic ISA. Why not have some kind of bytecode or standard format (like llvm-ir) that gets optimized for the CPU and gets a native binary that doesn&#x27;t need interpretation.<p>Like how the f<i></i>* is it easier to make something regular+generic fast rather than something custom for your hardware&#x2F;chip&#x2F;cpu fast?<p>Do you want to know how many times I used XML when it&#x27;s not required? 0. Do you know how many times I used SQLite or my own binary file? I lost count. SQLite has far more constraints than XML and custom binary files&#x2F;formats aren&#x27;t hard after you done than a few times.')
