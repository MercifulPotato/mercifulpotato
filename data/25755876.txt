It works just fine. The problem is that there are these &quot;waste&quot; humans that nobody knows what to do with.<p>There is also a glaring flaw in your comment. Automation increases economic growth. If a single worker is 10 times more productive he can ask for 10 times the salary. A lot of low income jobs pay badly precisely because there is not enough automation to turn them into productive high income jobs.<p>Ok, back to the waste humans. The default answer to a surplus with no buyers is to just let the wealthy hand out a loan so that those with no possessions can buy the surplus and use it productively and earn money. For obvious reasons interest rates are down to 0% so this is not a viable strategy. However in principle it works the same with automation. Humans with zero net worth cannot work because robots are doing their job can instead borrow robots and use those robots productively. Debt is just a way to convince people to work today so that their productive output doesn&#x27;t get lost.<p>The borrowing strategy works out if there is enough demand for the robot labor, but what if there is no demand at all? You can just create demand out of thin air. Let the government print money and use it to buy consumer goods and services or let the government invest into domestic jobs that would otherwise not be done. Again, it&#x27;s just a trick to make people work today so that their productive output doesn&#x27;t get lost. The benefit from working is higher than letting the money sit around.<p>Why? Because that&#x27;s the policy. 2% inflation is a target. Your money gets increasingly less valuable so you cannot sit on it. You will have to do something with it. If you put your money in gold you are doing so with the expectation that society as a whole is doing productive work. If you put your money into stocks you are doing so with the expectation that this individual company is doing productive work. Yes, these assets are inflation proof, but only because someone is actually working. If everyone put their money into gold the assets would just become worthless eventually because society as a whole is not doing productive work.<p>If CPI inflation is driving asset inflation then you simply cannot sit around and do nothing. Unfortunately the Fed is driving asset inflation directly and completely skipping over CPI inflation. At that point the system is built on circular logic without any connection to productive work. Capitalism without the capitalism.')
