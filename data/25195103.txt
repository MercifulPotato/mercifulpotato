HN has been a den of Apple, Microsoft, etc worship for a while now. In another thread on the frontpage, people are encouraging people to buy Apple TV. It&#x27;s partly the social media PR teams these companies hire, it&#x27;s the advertising and it&#x27;s also the type of people HN attracts. It&#x27;s sickening but what can you do.')
