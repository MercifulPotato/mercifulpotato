It&#x27;s part of the Great Western Trail now, but is not heavily traveled by hikers. I&#x27;ve never seen a single other hiker or biker on the trail. It&#x27;s overgrown now, and has narrowed down to a singletrack trail. But it&#x27;s easy to ride on, even without a fancy full suspension bike, because over 100 years ago, it was graded for a railroad, so it&#x27;s a gentle slope, and all of the big boulders were removed. Even though it&#x27;s been derelict for a century, it&#x27;s still gentle sloped and mostly free of big rocks. Most of it is overgrown with shrubs, but the occasional hiker is enough to keep a footpath clear. It could be ridden even with a city commuter bike along most of it.<p>In a post-apocalyptic world, bicycles would definitely be a great way to get around. The roads would get cracked and overgrown, but with moderate traffic, they&#x27;d develop into smooth single track trails. What to do once you run out of tires and tubes would be the bigger problem.')
