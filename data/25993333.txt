I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll like the container solution because I don&#x27;t want (all other containers, ... | bedrock(X, Y, Z)), I want (flatpak-A, bedrock-X, ...). I want a bedrock-like package to be a top-level package.<p>I&#x27;m not against needed-complexity, I&#x27;m against the complexity being in the base OS. I should be able to have bedrock-like solutions alongside bedrock and not entwined with it.')
