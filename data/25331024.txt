Shallow similarity makes it easy to thread a boolean or do something tricky with dependency injection. What I&#x27;m getting at is folks who are very capable, very fast programmers. if things aren&#x27;t easy to reuse, they&#x27;ll just go ahead and implement a whole new subsystem with different logs, metrics and error conditions.<p>I guess an example might be a type checker versus a compile time evaluator. They have a lot in common. But they&#x27;re different. Adding another traversal of the AST isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, really. But, there will come a time when all those passes start to be an issue, they have a lot in common. Maybe it&#x27;s better to fold them all up into one or two passes.<p>Sometimes things are complicated. Sometimes you need to hold all that complexity in your head at once and really pick out the commonality. But that&#x27;s rare. Just adding more code is a great answer for a long, long time.')
