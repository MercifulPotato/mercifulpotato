I&#x27;ll talk from &quot;virtual&quot; experience. It&#x27;s food production in a virtual economy. I have the option of overcharging people and expanding my business faster or charging less so that even the poor players can afford it and not having enough money to expand. If I go with the &quot;charity&quot; route it will take much longer for the underlying problem to be solved.<p>By doing economic charity (not to be confused with donation based charity that charges nothing to the people receiving help) you&#x27;re also ruining the price signal for other people. They see that the market has been saturated with cheap products but a few weeks later there is a shortage again because the &quot;charity dude&quot; is not producing nearly enough.<p>This is also one of the reason price gouging laws don&#x27;t make sense. People will scalp and sell for market rate. The one who is losing out is the original manufacturer of the product. They could have used that money to fund extra production or you know, just reward them for producing the valuable product in the first place. It would still mean less money to scammers.<p>If you think that the product should be provided at a lower price then involve the government and let it sell the product at subsidized prices. That way it can fulfill an obligation to the people but at the same time also eat it&#x27;s own words. If the manufacturer is overcharging too much then cut out the middleman and produce yourself.<p>Transfer this to someone who isn&#x27;t running a business but instead just tries to get a better job. That person still has the moral &quot;obligation&quot; (it&#x27;s obviously optional) to do effective charity or at least not make things worse.')
