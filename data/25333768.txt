Obviously it can&#x27;t be 52 weeks. Probably it can&#x27;t even be 10 weeks. So the question is where that unstated number is.<p>If the number is the same for everyone, state it. Go ahead and say &quot;Everyone gets 6 weeks vacation.&quot; If you don&#x27;t feel comfortable saying that, then it wasn&#x27;t unlimited at all, was it?<p>If the number is <i>different</i>, i.e., junior employees can take less, politically-connected folks and people who figured out how to coast can take more, that&#x27;s probably a bad thing for your company. At best, make additional vacation a defined promotion benefit.')
