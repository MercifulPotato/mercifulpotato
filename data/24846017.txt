Start transaction &gt; mutate data &gt; end transaction is not nearly as distributed as invoke SP &gt; let the database do something (?...) &gt; wait until it&#x27;s done. The first is a distributed system in the same way that an application writing to a filesystem is a distributed system.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that ORM is not the only alternative to stored procedures. In addition to that, there&#x27;s nothing unique about ORMs that make them susceptible to bad code, or poor SQL understanding. Somebody who doesn&#x27;t understand data structures and how the CBO works is going to write equally poor stored procedures. Removing the ORM is not the solution to your engineer not know how RDBMSes work. ORMs also don&#x27;t suit every use case, but again, having a bias against ORMs is not the solution to failing to understand how your use case fits in with your RDBMS.')
