Moving your hand should produce a hazy trail of after images in the early part of a moderate or stronger dose. I find mushrooms to be way more visual than LSD but you have to do a bit more to tip the balance into a otherworldly trip. I also think mushrooms are safer to play with than LSD since the most intense phase will peak up and come down between roughly 90 minutes. There is a second or third wave after some hours but nothing like the peak.<p>Since potency can vary a great deal between strains (one type of mushroom could be very  intense at 2 grams [this is rare] while another maybe require 6, and so on) I recommend buying much more than you need at one time. Like 20 grams. Take two, see how it goes. Few weeks or whatever later take three grams. My experience From back in the day is that on average, 4 or 5 grams will usually do the trick. 5 grams of dry magic mushrooms usually tastes pretty gnarly so chew them up with a nice premium chocolate bar.<p>Be careful here. Make no mistake about it, magic mushrooms and LSD can definitely be a humbling, pants-shitting experience that one can’t merely nope out of. So exercise caution and don’t feel pressured to do too much at once.<p>If you really want it, buy 50x Salvia from a head shop. Fill a bong with the powder, use a torch lighter (the crystals release from the extract at a high temperature, regular lighter won’t be enough) inhale and hold the smoke in for 15 to 30 seconds. Exhale, take another hit. Inhale, hold, and be sure to send the funhouse gnomes my warmest regards.')
