As Lord Cooper said in <i>MacCormick v. Lord Advocate</i>, &quot;the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional Law&quot;.<p>&gt; no sitting parliament could ever restrict a majority of a future parliament from passing any law they saw fit<p>If the British Parliament tried to amend the Acts of Union 1707 to remove the protections granted to Scotland – for example, if it sought to abolish Scots law and replace it with English law – it is quite possible that the Scottish courts would rule such an Act of Parliament unconstitutional under Scots law, and also quite possible that the Supreme Court of the UK would uphold their ruling.')
