They can ramp up a lot more power in that machine without a battery and with a larger, active cooler.<p>I&#x27;m much more interested in actual benchmarks. AMD has mostly capped their APU performance because DDR4 just can&#x27;t keep the GPU fed (why the last 2 generations of consoles went with very wide GDDR5&#x2F;6). Their solution is obviously Infinity Cache where they add a bunch of cache on-die to reduce the need to go off-chip. At just 16B transistors, Apple obviously didn&#x27;t do this (at 6 transistors per SRAM cell, there&#x27;s around 3.2B transistors in just 64MB of cache).')
