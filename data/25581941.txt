These people know little else. They do Webex and Skype, not zoom or slack. They use Microsoft Project and Sharepoint, not Trello. They outsource or purchase e-commerce, HR, and supply chain. If any programmer knows anything not Microsoft, they&#x27;re either &quot;not a team player&quot; or &quot;a god&quot;. Hell, even one CEO once told me, &quot;I do not allow my people to use I.T. as an excuse. They have Excel.&quot;  That&#x27;s pretty much the thinking and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that it&#x27;s changing anytime soon.<p>Any enterprise people here have similar experience?')
