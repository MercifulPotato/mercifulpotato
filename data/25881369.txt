If you don&#x27;t execute it straight away, you potentially create bugs.<p>I think the reason why Microsoft was telling people not to call gc.collect is that it interferes with the optimisations and heuristics that the garbage collector maintains to optimise when to do a GC. But I must say I didn&#x27;t notice any abnormal behaviour when I did. But I would only do if I absolutely have to.')
