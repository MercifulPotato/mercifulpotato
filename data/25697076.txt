The fact that anyone could defend this decision is ridiculous. I&#x27;m tired of people defending censorship in the most brain dead of ways when it has never worked in the past and it most certainly will not work now. Censoring unpopular ideas only allows them to fester in the dark where they can&#x27;t be brought to light or addressed in the open. This was never about &quot;racism&quot;,&quot;bigotry&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot;. We are in this boat because of a much deeper set of problems that are currently going to lead to the further regression of society.<p>Those in power, people here and the arrogance of many others have created an entire generation of people who&#x27;ve been banished, shunned or shouted down any time they had a differing opinion on anything. I personally am done dealing with this bullshit and the problems that have been inflicted on society. I&#x27;m done being quiet and, personally, I&#x27;d rather join the damned than continue this circus. I&#x27;m willing to put everything on the table to end this and ensure that this will never happen again. EVERYONE deserves a voice and a platform; you are more than free to not listen.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;First_they_came_</a>...')
