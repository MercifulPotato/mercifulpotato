Item(by='chroem-', descendants=None, kids=[24901155], score=None, time=1603744435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900483, text='&gt; You are describing the abridging private organizations&#x27; right to free speech by congress...<p>There is a large amount of legal precedent in the US for the government being able to compel speech of private businesses, both in laws and court rulings.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, go look at your nearest &quot;nutrition facts&quot; label.  But we have precedents that go much deeper than that, up to and including compelled speech that goes against the religious principles of a business&#x27;s founders.  There is no realistic argument for the government being unable to compel a private company like Twitter to cease censoring posts on political grounds.')
