Once the pins were removed and I started walking again (after lots of physio), my ankle would swell up to the point where it would literally not move without cracking it first. Cracking would also instantly relieve 90% of the pressure and pain in the ankle for at least an hour or two, it was marvellous.<p>I&#x27;ve regained all of the extension motion and probably 70% of my retraction motion (moving toes towards knee), but only about 30% of the muscle strength. Unfortunately it still swells up after long periods of standing or hiking but I&#x27;m rarely able to crack it anymore, and really wish I could on those bad days.')
