Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=[24752300], score=None, time=1602467717, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750710, text='&gt; is it that unusual to want to watch a few YT videos or a 25-60 minute episode on a streaming service?<p>To <i>want</i> it perhaps not, but do you see people do this around you? I&#x27;ve seen more people gaming (laptop and mouse) on a train than people watching streaming video on the train. There have been more people that watched videos but when they pause for the conductor it&#x27;s virtually always VLC or WMP, revealing that it&#x27;s pre-downloaded. (I know VLC can do streaming but I&#x27;d have seen buffering here and there and they&#x27;re much more likely to use the service&#x27;s own client because of DRM.)<p>So while I don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s weird to have that desire (it would certainly be easier not to have to plan this ahead), yes, it is unusual in the Netherlands. And now that I live in Germany I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not just unusual but impossible, given their mobile data network coverage.')
