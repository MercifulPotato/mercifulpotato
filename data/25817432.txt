For instance, some people would prefer to have some shitty but portable kitchenware instead of expensive, bulky and representative &quot;professional&quot; units.<p>This is a bit of &quot;urban&quot; lifestyle against &quot;suburbia&quot; lifestyle, or &quot;downshifter&quot; lifestyle, or &quot;countryside&quot; lifestyle.<p>For instance, I am a bit aware of the &quot;zero waste&quot; community. These people would probably buy a single macbook (because it is stylish and looks as if you had taste, not neccessarily because it is high quality), but no kitchen device at all, because such devices express the &quot;wrong&quot; style of life. Similar arguments could probably be made about some certain kind of hacker culture. People buying hoodies and thinkpads because it is &quot;in vogue&quot;.<p>This is probably the main reason why just another review page won&#x27;t take off: The products are not &quot;in vogue&quot;.<p>Just my two cents. Very emotional, not objective at all.')
