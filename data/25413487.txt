We think that a hundred years ago that was implied, and products without enough quality lost on the market; today the opposite is true.<p>Can we somehow take into account all those advancements which happened over last century or so in materials science, electronics and software etc. to build a quality-meter for an arbitrary product? So customers could better understand what it really is - that is, how long and well it&#x27;s going to serve under what conditions - for what they are paying X dollars today?')
