While that&#x27;s technically true at the API level, I was referring to things like the “Sign-On with &lt;service&gt;” widgets – you can make a completely static version of that which doesn&#x27;t use cookies but there is a nice UI improvement if the button can load and say things like “Login as @tootie” or “@tootie, you have 5 DMs” anywhere you see it.<p>Instead, I think we&#x27;re going to recognize that this is too broad to be secured and either come up with ways to scope it down (e.g. requiring the third-party to have some sort of opt-in prompt) or that entire market category replaced with browser-controlled alternatives, which isn&#x27;t great for companies other than Apple, Google, and maybe Microsoft but does have the appeal of not trusting an entity which the user isn&#x27;t already trusting.')
