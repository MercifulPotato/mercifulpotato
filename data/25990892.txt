It’s the same thing, so why is one illegal but not the other?<p>That was the case prior to 1666f. Now, both &quot;credit surcharges&quot; and &quot;cash discounts&quot; are permitted.<p>It was just a perspective thing, card brands didn&#x27;t want to have cards feel &quot;disadvantaged&quot; relative to cash. Instead they had cash &quot;advantaged&quot; related to credit. It was never illegal to do either, this change just rendered terms of service which included them unenforceable.')
