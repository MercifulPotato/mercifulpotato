It’s that people who receive security clearances sign ridiculous life-long contracts that require they have their publications vetted, and Presidents don’t. It’s not a perfect system, but one can see the need for it once you accept the idea that clearances should exist. There’s no equivalent rule for Presidents, nor should there be.<p>(Also Presidents profiting off of speaking fees is problematic, but the ethical problems with that practice don’t really apply to a President writing a popular book.)')
