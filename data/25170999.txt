The great thing about this way to create systems is that you don&#x27;t expend time doing glue code, just in the real business logic.\nBut a big pain is to maintain your database code, by example the version control of your functions. There are not suitable linters, and testing can&#x27;t be done over postgres functions but must be done over GraphQL instead.\nUsing things like this will save you months of development time!, Even if I agree there are some systems that will not be good idea to implement in this way.')
