We know thatâ€™s not the case. The Universe is only a billion years older than that, and started off as a near homogenous field of hydrogen and helium. All the heavier elements we know today were forged in stars, and distributed when those stars aged and exploded, spewing heavier elements into space. This went through several cycles before reaching the element rich environment we evolved in. It may well be that heavy element densities only reached a viable level in the last generation of stars, maybe the last 1&#x2F;3 of the history of the universe, or the last 4 to 5 billion years or so. That changes the playing field considerably. Our system might be one of the first capable of supporting life.')
