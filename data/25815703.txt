If you are using Linux, use a window manager (sway or i3 are a good start). I&#x27;m running Archlinux with Nvidia and it&#x27;s going great. No problems with the card, performance, and I have 3 screens of different DPI. I&#x27;m yet to try Bluetooth, though.<p>ps: If you are using an Nvidia card, you can&#x27;t, unfortunately, use Wayland.')
