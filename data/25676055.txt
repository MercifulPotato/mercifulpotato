We rushed the testing of the vaccines, so we could be forcing people into harms way.  That could also have legal blowback and other social implications even if governments grant immunity to the medical facilities and vaccine producers.  Everyone is already on edge, so at best this could be dumping fuel on the fire and lead to more riots.  Additionally, if we have the power to force drugs on people, then I would also expect that we have the power to force people to get healthy and not be at risk in the first place.  This will eventually happen anyway as not a single government will be able to absorb the medical costs of diabetes by 2050, per the CDC. [1] [2]  There are additional CDC PDF&#x27;s that break down the cost by 2050 and will be in the trillions.  By 2040 there will be no money left for anything beyond medical. [3]<p>In my opinion, a more ethical option would be to make the vaccines available to anyone that wants it and prioritize access to those at highest risk.  Those at risk should self isolate.  Those not at risk should get back to work and open their businesses up.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;2010&#x2F;r101022.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;pressrel&#x2F;2010&#x2F;r101022.html</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2017&#x2F;p0718-diabetes-report.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2017&#x2F;p0718-diabetes-repor...</a><p>[3] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5LTWJOi3bCo?t=3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;5LTWJOi3bCo?t=3</a>   [video] <i>skipping rude intro</i>')
