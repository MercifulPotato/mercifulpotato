The big idea with the Perseus algorithm, I think, is that instead of lending a reference at a function call, it is <i>given</i>. This leads to numerous optimizations where memory can statically be reused. They still do dynamic checks that an object has only one reference, too, when it&#x27;s not statically known.')
