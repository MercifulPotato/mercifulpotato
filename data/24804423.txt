Item(by='tropdrop', descendants=None, kids=[24805737], score=None, time=1602878203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803943, text='Perhaps further evidence of too reductive of an approach:<p>&gt;The LSD has an estimated $5B in annual revenue, with an estimated $100B in funds, and protestants can make claims to nearly every US president.<p>Importantly, this is the <i>LDS</i>, not the LSD. Do rationalism&#x27;s thinkers <i>engage</i> seriously enough to be able to make important cultural contributions? Or do they have such a surface-level view of everything (too much breadth, not enough depth – too much depth is unpractical, and practicality is key for rationalists) that even in this post they cannot be bothered enough to cross the <i>t</i>&#x27;s and dot the <i>i</i>&#x27;s enough to avoid a confusion between a psychoactive substance and an influential religious institution?<p>More to the point, rationalism&#x27;s great age has passed. Rationalists <i>did</i> carry import in the post-Reformation era, but in philosophical concepts, we have long left the era of classical Enlightenment behind. We have even left <i>Modernism</i> behind, which was arguably born out of Rationalism. We are at the tail end of postmodernism – of course you don&#x27;t find &quot;highly successful&quot; &quot;rationalists&quot; in the post-modern age. While you don&#x27;t necessarily have to be conversant (or even aware) of Barthes&#x27; structuralism, &quot;success&quot; (at least, in the sense that is discussed in this post – cultural import, legacy, etc.) is dependent on <i>living</i> and <i>breathing</i> postmodernism.<p>Like a fish in water, you don&#x27;t have to know what postmodernism is, exactly. I do not think any TikTok star knows what postmodernism is. But they intuit that they must be a chimera that is the product of its audience, that the signs they create must be readily meme-able and able to live a life outside of their author. Rationalists do not breathe in this water – their hierarchical approach is stuck at the turn of the last century, and so they will not find themselves carrying import at the beginning of this one.')
