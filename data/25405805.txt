If people pay for content and feel ripped off, they can ask for a refund. Then cheaters can pay to access the content then ask for their money back if they want to. This puts the content provider in a bad position.<p>If people pay for content, then they want to have that content themselves forever. In some sense, this is fair. But then they want to share that content with others. Then the other person&#x2F;people don&#x27;t need to pay. Now you have a problem where everyone can just get the content when one person has paid for it. This is a bad dilemma where content providers and consumers both seem to have a good case.<p>Since neither pay model seems to work, companies just show ads. Then people ignore ads, so the ad companies make them more attention-grabbing and intrusively targeted. So people use reader mode and ad blockers. Now no one is looking at the ads that pay for the content.<p>I wish I knew the answer.')
