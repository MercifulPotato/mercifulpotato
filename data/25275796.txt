The LFH will randomize returned chunks of the same size, doesn&#x27;t matter if they were freed in the meantime or not. That makes it hard to exploit, you need to groom the heap before LFH kicks in because afterwards the unpredictability becomes too large.<p>If you change the size of your request you will go either to another bucket or the backend allocator. So that makes type confusions slightly harder if you don&#x27;t control variably sized buffers.<p>Even before those 18 allocations, the specific tricks that used to work on the old manager, which is very similar to the behavior of linux kernel apparently, no longer work. It used to be that you could reliably get the same memory address if you allocated a same sized structure immediately after freeing another. But that no longer works.<p>The only technique that I currently know of is that the merging of free blocks on the backend allocator is still deterministic.<p>But to use that you must be sure your target has not already triggered LFH for the sizes that you&#x27;re using while grooming.')
