Ramen profitability is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it’s the most important threshold on the way, because this is the point where you’re airborne. This is the point where you no longer need investors’ permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen profitability was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food. They taped this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their apartment.<p>I wonder what the calculation for ramen profitability would look like in a fully remote-work environment, in a place where rent isn&#x27;t $3500 a month...  Anecdotally I&#x27;ve seen a few people renting pretty nice places in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for $500 a month. Some stayed there through the entire duration of the covid19 crisis due to travel shutdowns and have been working on various things.')
