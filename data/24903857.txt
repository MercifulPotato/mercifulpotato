Are you asking about rysnc developers or filesystem developers?<p>For a filesystem the developers are free to innovate on any form of filesystem-wide block checksumming and content-addressed deduplication approach.  This kind of global block-level content awareness is entirely decoupled from filenames and paths.<p>Using rsync to underpin a filesystem strikes me as a gross hack done by developers punting on the real challenges of modern filesystem development.<p>WRT rsync doing better than --fuzzy, the options are more limited since it&#x27;s a userspace tool working within the confines of filesystem APIs like POSIX.')
