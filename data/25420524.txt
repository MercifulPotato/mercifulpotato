I would argue that folks using millions of dollars in investment capital with no real goal other than to cause disruption, regardless of whether it helps anyone or even creates a viable business, is what&#x27;s extraordinary.<p>Think for a second what a dumb goal &#x27;disruption&#x27; is on it&#x27;s own. That&#x27;s what bored 15 year old&#x27;s do to amuse themselves, they disrupt and break things simply to see something, anything, happen. As an earlier commenter pointed out, disruption is often a side effect of making a large change in an industry, typically in business this has meant changing something for the better.<p>When the side effect of causing disruption becomes the main goal of a business owner rather than creating value of some sort, I really don&#x27;t know what to call that other than degenerate behavior.')
