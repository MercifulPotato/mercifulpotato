However (and Jose et al are very up front about this), the more DSLs and macros you use, the more confusing it&#x27;s going to be. Using macros is a tradeoff because it can be a very neat solution but it also obscures what the code is doing quite a bit.<p>Re. foo(hello: :world) vs foo(:hello, :world) - that one I got the hang of more quickly, though I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s confusing at first. In the first you&#x27;re providing a keyword list (which is merely a list of 2-membered tuples where the first member of the tuple is an atom). And when a keyword list is the last (or only) argument to a function it can be provided without the brackets. So the same thing could be written as foo([{hello:, :world}]) or also foo([hello: :world]). In foo(:hello, :world) you&#x27;re just providing arguments. When you&#x27;re first learning the language this can definitely trip you up but I think once you become a &quot;practitioner&quot; it&#x27;s not too bad and ends up being pretty nice.<p>God Elixir is so cool.')
