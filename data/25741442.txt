And no one pushed it as reality, it was more of a learn this fiction because it has historically been important and some people still believe it. Not once was it presented as reality or something we should believe in.<p>That is more than is legally permissible in the U.S. And even if people don&#x27;t perceive the education as saying &quot;this is true&quot; it still socializes kids in a shared religious history and helps them understand the people who still believe it. There is nothing comparable to this in the U.S.')
