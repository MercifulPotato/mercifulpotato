I use paper and pencil and the Freemind mind mapper to capture and evolve ideas, but I have to have a whiteboard.  When I was in the office, I had one behind me, and I used it all of the time.  On Saturdays (part of my regular work schedule), I would sometimes go wild with a 15 foot wide whiteboard in one of the conference rooms.  After we all began working from home, I ordered a 2ft x 3ft whiteboard for my home office.  I&#x27;d truly be lost without it.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure how to explain it.  Sometimes just putting something on the whiteboard, walking around, contemplating it, is what I need to do.  I also use at least four different colors as needed.  And today, with smart phones, it&#x27;s very easy to capture what I&#x27;ve done and share with others.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m creating a sketch, sometimes code, sometimes just a set of data structures.  Once it was a system architecture, highlighting data exchange and functions.  It can be one column or more, horizontal or angled, I can add curved arrows.  Try to work out a bilinear interpolation scheme for a 3D grid over multiple time sets on a computer.  Yeah, it can be done, but developing it on a whiteboard is, well, easier.<p>I need my whiteboard.  I would be lost without it.')
