It syncs back PR&#x27;s as well.<p>Example use cases:<p>- Create a mirror of a repo, changing or omitting a few files<p>- Open-source sub-packages from your monorepo<p>- Create &quot;workspace&quot; repos from your monorepo to give someone access to only parts of it (eg. temp freelance)<p>We are using nx as a monorepo tool, here is an example of it using the Copybara Action: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;olivr&#x2F;nx-copybara" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;olivr&#x2F;nx-copybara</a><p>Under the hood, as the name implies, it uses Copybara (Google), and this action can be customized to use the full power of Copybara if you wish so.<p>If you think of other use cases or put together another example you want me to link to from the README, just hit me up here or on GitHub.')
