Haversine layout systems tend to be more computationally inefficient than flexbox actually, but more powerful.  Yes the original programming API was horrible, but that was a quirk about how apple does API review, and they were mostly expecting you to use IB to do your autolayouts, and stuff like SnapKit put a sane API on top of it soon after.<p>TBH Obj-C once you looked past it&#x27;s ugly syntax is a better developer experience than swift today if your making large-ish apps.  Today the debugger is still buggy, build times are still way slower and swift code bases create stutters in unresponsiveness inside Xcode to this day. And it was way worse back in the swift v1-3 days.<p>TBH I think swift could solve a lot of their build speed issues if they removed type inference beyond a very basic set and brought back fine file grained importing like you have with C and Java.  You still get %95 the benefits with a couple of features that most IDEs like IntelliJ with java are shown to be NBD.<p>Stuff like Flutter &amp; Kotlin Multiplatform might make a lot of this stuff moot although, and swift will be regulated as an iOS compatibility layer and a nicer looking C++')
