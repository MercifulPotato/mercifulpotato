PDF is not the basis.<p>Lemme explain: for each format there is a basis and there is the most used format. For sound that&#x27;s .WAV &#x2F; .MP3; for pictures that&#x27;s .BMP &#x2F; .JPEG (or .PNG if you&#x27;re a purist).<p>And for documents that&#x27;s .RTF &#x2F; .PDF. You see a PDF is not the absolute basis, it&#x27;s just the most convenient trade between usability and fidelity. Nobody except snobs wants pure .WAV files for their preferred songs and everybody uses .MP3 instead. If you want the absolute purest form of a document, you use .RTF<p>My 2 cents.')
