It isn’t a radicle idea that people should be able to engage in basic actives like transportation, commerce, communication, etc. without having to give up their rights to safety, privacy, and other basic standards. “If you don’t want to risk getting poisoned, just don’t shop at that multination store”. How about any store should be regulated to provide a minimum level of safety in the things they sell. How about any communication platform be regulated to provide a minimum level of privacy and data protection for private user information.')
