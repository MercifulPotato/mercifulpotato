Typically I&#x27;d just ssh into a server and use vim when I was on windows as it was a better experience. WSL has been a game changer. Code... just works. It&#x27;s actually impressive how well integrated they&#x27;ve made it. I no longer have to do strange hacks or worry about different line endings on windows. It all just works now. If you&#x27;re on a decently powerful PC, I&#x27;d recommend trying it out. It&#x27;s more resource heavy than a native Linux install for sure, but it means you no longer have to dual boot for gaming. That&#x27;s a big win in my book.')
