Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607777491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397641, text='I don’t think ‘known’ really qualifies as a “weasel word” in this context. To me, “weasel word” is a somewhat wishy-washy or putatively unnecessary qualifier designed to weaken a statement in a way that allows the statement to be phrased in a way that seems much stronger. “Dozens of supporters” meaning “25 people” is weaselly; “virtual unanimity” instead of “99.9% support” is not always weaselly (though it could be depending on the context); “largest known in the observable universe” instead of “the largest we’ve happened to spot in a telescope” is not at all weaselly.<p>In this context: “are you sure it’s the longest long-exposure in the world? Have you checked every single camera or device that employs a camera obscura technique?” isn’t a very reasonable objection. And “known” isn’t a weasel word so much as a tautological qualifier. It doesn’t weaken the statement in anyway, it just clarifies that the author is not ominiscient.<p>If the headline was “believed to be one of the longest” because they were aware of a longer long-exposure, that would be much more weaselly.')
