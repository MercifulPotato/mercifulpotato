Item(by='anjc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602065936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702229, text='You and everybody replying to you are making the same baffling mistake, i.e., assuming that technical&#x2F;song writing ability&#x2F;education = star. If you want technical ability, there are 8 year olds on YouTube with better chops than EVH. Possibly <i>every</i> 8 year old has better chops than Kurt Cobain. But technical ability does NOT make you a rock star. Same applies to the other fields you mention, painting etc.<p>I&#x27;m sure young rock stars (in the same vein as EVH, Axl, Hendrix, Cobain, Morrison) would still exist as the personalities and talent are still there, but rock is not mainstream anymore, so they can&#x27;t exist. The closest thing to real rock stars now are the likes of Justin Bieber.<p>You should re-listen to the Beato&#x2F;Satriani clip you told someone else to listen to, because he essentially says this. The artists you suggest are <i>irrelevant</i> and can not be compared to EVH in any way whatsoever. Guthrie Govan?! Van Halen drove mainstream culture. Nobody outside of guitar forums know Guthrie Govan. The other suggestions in this thread of comparators to EVH and Chris Cornell (Tosin Abasi, Petrucci, Belamy) are just embarrassing.')
