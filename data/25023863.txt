An equivalent 1024 RSA bit key needs about 2000 qbuits.

Getting to the first part is <i>really</i> hard. If you can pull that off, you&#x27;re probably only a few years away from the second. The main thing that&#x27;s stopping us from doing that today is that the (physcial) qubits we&#x27;ve made so far aren&#x27;t stable enough; getting to a single <i>logical</i> qubit is anticipated to take 1000 physical ones.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Physical_and_logical_qubits" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Physical_and_logical_qubits</a>')
