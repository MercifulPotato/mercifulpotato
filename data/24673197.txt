There is the consistent argument that the US Constitution, and the Bill of Rights in particular, doesn&#x27;t make any guarantee toward non-US persons.  Except, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s actually the case.  If I look at the text of the first amendment, for example:<p>&gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.<p>This doesn&#x27;t say anything about whose freedom of speech, only that Congress may not abridge it.  The existence of the freedom of speech is taken as a given, regardless of whose speech it is.  The restriction is on Congress to not be able to abridge that freedom of speech, no matter who holds it.')
