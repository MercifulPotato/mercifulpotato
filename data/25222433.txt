I&#x27;m no Bob Culbertson, but I should say that I find the Stick to be rather easy to learn.  Its inverted fifths tuning for the bass side makes a whole lot of sense to this recovering guitarist.<p>What&#x27;s certainly not easy is to play patterns between hands that are not merely interlocking or interlaced but truly independent.
