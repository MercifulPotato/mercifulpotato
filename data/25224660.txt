If I need a debugger, it probably means I don&#x27;t really know the code that I am working on.<p>Good IDEs with good static analysis, good unit test&#x2F;integration test&#x2F;e2e test coverage, a true understanding of the code base before changing it, all these avoid most bugs.<p>When the production hits a bug, good monitoring and logging can help root-causing. It is extremely difficult to debug and reproduce a bug in a distributed environment. Many bugs I have root-caused are purely based on monitoring and logging then show the proof with mind-execution of the code.')
