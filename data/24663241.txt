For example: &quot;Reach viewers who saw your competitorâ€™s ads as quickly as 60 seconds after linear ad airing.&quot; Since they&#x27;re capturing and analyzing screenshots from all TV inputs (even HDMI sources), they can target based on not just what you&#x27;re watching, but which ads you&#x27;ve seen.
