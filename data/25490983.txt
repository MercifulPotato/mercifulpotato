Not only that he was able to accumulate assets, like shares in a bank, that put him in middle class.<p>However he did have some unfortunate twists - war caused him to lose a stipend income, promised to him so that he doesn&#x27;t take up a well paid position for Napoleon&#x27;s brother.  Then of course a period of inactivity due to depression.<p>For the sonata... are you referring to the Hammerklavier?  That was simply a monstrosity of a piece, but it was played in concert only a decade or two later by the virtuoso Liszt.<p>I agree though, the audience that Beethoven could reach today would well exceed what he could from 1800&#x27;s Europe, even if most people today prefer pop.')
