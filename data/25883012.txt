Then I&#x27;ll read what was sent because I was interrupted anyways. Then I&#x27;ll discover it was incomplete and I can&#x27;t make sense of it. I&#x27;ll go back to productive work until the next snippet of this flow of consciousness madness interrupts me. Then I&#x27;ll read that message, plus the preceding ones for context. Now you interrupted me multiple times, forcing me to read partial stuff over and over again, just to have to wait for your next snippet for it all to maybe make sense.<p>People messaging like the above cause me to mute them and just look at their messages once in a blue moon.')
