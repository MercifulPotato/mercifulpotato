Seems people are less willing to pay for high quality tools these days.<p>On the technical side, the qt quick desktop styling is intriguing. My main use case for Qt is for desktop applications and while qt quick is often recommended I usually go for qwidgets instead. 9&#x2F;10 times I need a traditional interface with menu bars, forms  and tables. While qt quick lets me make nice looking UI, I often need something that just works similarly to how a traditional desktop application works, looks be damned. Im curious if they&#x27;ll manage to close that gap in qt6 but I&#x27;m skeptical which means I&#x27;ll probably stay on widgets for the foreseeable future.')
