My computer gets hacked. I am a low level target so the Ransomware asks me for something trivial like $1000. Now I have a couple choices. Not pay and not break the law or pay and break the law but get back all my baby pictures. I am going to pay and take the consequences. In Canada we had a guy literally decapitate another man and then cannibalizes the body. He did 7 years. We don’t jail people for things like paying ransom and if we did we slap people on the wrist. This law will have no teeth for some because we watch the revolving door court system where all criminal are given a slap on the wrist. It is only repeat offenders getting anything other then probation. So at worst I would risk a fine or probation. I live in Canada though so we don’t bend over backwards to screw people so my fine would be insignificant compared to the loss of all my baby pictures. Even if the punishment was 5000$ I would still be leaning towards paying to get those baby pictures I haven’t backed up. If the punishment was a week in jail again I am still going to pay we have really nice jails with all sorts of rights when you get there.  I guess my point is we need a better way then telling victims they can’t pay. Thankfully I have backed up my pictures and don’t worry about this scenario currently.')
