I&#x27;ve ranted on this before [1] so won&#x27;t do so again here.<p>I get the impression that the poor handling of multiple profiles is because they expect you to use multi-account containers instead.<p>Those are fine if you just want, say, to access multiple instances of the same site without using the same cookies for each, or want to make it harder for cross site cookie tracking, but for most of the times where I want to access multiple instances of the same site I also want separate bookmarks and add-ons and history for each instance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819714" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819714</a>')
