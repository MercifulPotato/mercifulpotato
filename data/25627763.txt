If not most of them, then I suggest people stop comparing the two programs - there is no point in asking people to stop using Emacs and use something that doesn&#x27;t do what is needed.<p>If VSCode <i>can</i> do it, I&#x27;d love to look up the plugins&#x2F;extensions needed.<p>[0] And many, many do it. I do over half of these things in Emacs (and most of the last item).<p>[1] Easily over 70% of my Emacs usage has nothing to do with programming.')
