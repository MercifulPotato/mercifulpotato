The rates vary depending on location, provider, insurance carrier and other factors.<p>Health insurance companies pay their executive staff huge salaries while working as hard as they can to deny medical claims to patients. And the ACA mandating the minimum medical loss ratio for insurance companies had the unintended side effect of incentivizing health insurance companies to pay more expensive medical bills, because they can only pay their exec staff a fixed % of what they spend on health claims. The more they spend on claims, the more they can pay their executive staff.<p>Doctors can be corrupt in many ways, but not being transparent about what they&#x27;ll bill isn&#x27;t an important one.')
