You can even see in aerials that it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a lawn with walking paths and a prefab outbuilding. I think this SAR image may be from before the outbuilding was there, and historical imagery shows that it used to just be an extension of the lawn. I think the bright objects are a distorted reflection from elements of the building facade, perhaps. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m squinting at the SAR image having a hard time deciding if it depicts the outbuilding or not, and it perhaps says something about the <i>limitations</i> of SAR images that it&#x27;s not clear to the untrained eye whether or not an entire building is there. I think it&#x27;s possible the building is there and is just made of materials with very low reflectivity, there are sort of &quot;ghost lines&quot; that seem in the right place for its edges.')
