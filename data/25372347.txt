Item(by='lwansbrough', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607597930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367917, text='&gt; If a community says &#x27;we&#x27;d rather be homes and don&#x27;t want to turn everything in to high-rises&#x27; then that&#x27;s entirely their discretion.<p>Nobody is arguing it’s not their discretion. I’m just saying it makes you a bad actor in the larger community of people who would like to benefit from the opportunity of living in a city that they otherwise might not get if they weren’t living in the city.<p>&gt; especially for the benefit of people who do not even live there.<p>They don’t live there because they’re being systematically and economically excluded from living there by people of means who are unaffected by the damage they’re doing to their own local economy.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s plenty of physical space in Cali, if anything, the opportunity might be in Sacramento and in-between.<p>So... not in your back yard?')
