And faith is what it is, you can&#x27;t have evidence for what went on in the inspector&#x27;s mind.<p>Good faith is basically the goodwill be give each other that we&#x27;re deciding things according to what we say we&#x27;re deciding things by. If you&#x27;re judging a  figureskating contest, you are supposed to do it based on the desire to promote good technique and artistry. If you do it based on who you think looks good, nobody will ever know, they can only suspect it after you&#x27;ve given full marks to a few good looking people with bad technique.<p>Once that is undermined in a society, we end up with a mess, because just about every decision can be questioned as a political move, which is what is happening in the US.<p>Take that appointment of Merrick Garland. How many people now think that it was a good faith decision to not hold a hearing for him? Is it believable that people opposed the hearing for non-partisan reasons? I think it&#x27;s hard.')
