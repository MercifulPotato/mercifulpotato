To a non-programmer, C and Python look the same.<p>Take Citizen Kane. I&#x27;d call it a 7&#x2F;10 film and kinda boring, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m seeing it in a &quot;post-Kane&quot; world. At the time, however, it was so revolutionary that people still call it the best film ever made. Nowadays it&#x27;s quite standard because <i>everyone</i> has been building on it ever since<p>While I&#x27;m not going to disagree with you regarding <i>some</i> art, there is a point to be made that what to us, un-cultured people, may seem like random scribbles could actually be something revolutionary. We simply don&#x27;t notice it because we are missing the context.<p>I do believe, however, that you are right and that there&#x27;s an element of luck too. But that&#x27;s not exclusive to art - how many technologies are we using right now not because they are the best but because they got a lucky break at the right time? And then again, while many good painters may never get their big break, I doubt there are that many <i>bad</i> painters who get famous.')
