Spotify is an excellent way for independent artists to get free promotion and make money in 2020. Spotify pays about 3$ per 1000 plays, which is quite a bit more than YT will for music.<p>We&#x27;re long past the 1990s, where only a very select number of major label artists made it big and sold millions of copies. We need to stop using these numbers as a benchmark for todays music landscape -- so much has changed and most of it for the better.<p>Music creation and distribution has been heavily democratized. Where you needed connections and thousands of dollars to even get something released (outside of niche DIY tape style releases) you can now basically do it for free from your room or band practice space. The amount of money per working musician has gone down significantly but there are more of them in 2020 than has ever before.<p>We can certainly argue about what kind of value art should have in society. Should there be more money going around? What industries should this money be taken out of? Suffice to say independent artists are better off than they have been, creating music and making money has never been easier and Spotify&#x2F;digital music distribution in general have been great enablers.')
