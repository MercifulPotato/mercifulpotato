In 2020, the top 37% bracket starts at $518,401. So, not only is the top rate lower, you have to be making more than 3Ã— as much, adjusted for inflation, before you start paying it.<p>&gt; And before then it was lower.<p>Only from 1987-1992. In 1986, it was 50%, and the top <i>4</i> brackets were 42% and up. The 42% rate cut in at $44,781 ($105,746 in 2020 dollars, lower than where the 39.6% in 1993 applied) and even the penultimate 48% rate applied from $59,671 ($140,908 in 2020 dollars, still less than the cutoff for the 1993 39.6% rate.)<p>At that 50% top rate? It was the result of cuts from Reagan&#x27;s famous giant tax cuts; prior to that tax cut (which was applied in steps from 1981 on) the top rate was 70%.')
