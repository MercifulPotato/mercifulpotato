All available data for both, Biontech&#x2F;Pfizer and Moderna&#x27;s vaccines suggests that one dose is enough for &gt;90% efficacy which would be sufficient to reach herd immunity. There was a very good opinion article in the NY Times [1] about that, but not much more.<p>The problem here is that a one-dose regimen was not studied in the trials. While it is good medical practice do not deviate from trial designs (see the Oxford&#x2F;AZ vaccine), the data is very clear here. The vaccines are effective 14 days after the first dose and before the second dose.\nSure, there are risks (maybe the efficacy drops later on or it is more difficult to reach the full efficacy if the booster shot is delayed) but these risks seem to be negligible compared to the hundreds of thousands additional unnecessary deaths due to limited vaccine supply and delayed vaccination with a two-shot regimen. We know from other vaccines that the timing of the booster shot normally is not that important and it is very probably that a booster shot after a few months would be exactly as good as a booster shot after 4 weeks.<p>In my opinion, nobody seriously contemplates the one-dose regimen because somebody has to take responsibility to deviate from the proven and tested protocol - politicians have nothing to win here but much to loose in case anything goes wrong. And big pharma has no interest in financing and starting one-dose trials asap b&#x2F;c it would hurt their own bottom line and there is no financial incentive at all, quite the opposite (+they have the same responsibility problem). This is a deadlock which will cost many, many lifes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;coronavirus-vaccine-doses.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;coronavirus-vacci...</a>')
