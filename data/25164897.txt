Possibly quite a bit. I get what you are saying about different cues that are missing, but for me it caused very mild nausea, some odd dreams and a bit of mild disassociation that passed after a few sessions. I wonder if there is some neuroplasticity factor that allows some people to more easily rewire to the new sensations and still feel natural.')
