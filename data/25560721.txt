Between Phase I failures due to toxicity, Phase II failures which are half due to toxicity, and Phase III failures, and Phase III trails failing 17% of the time due to toxicity <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6092479&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC6092479&#x2F;</a> it is overwhelmingly the biggest problem. Only half of Phase III trials fail due to a lack of efficacy.<p>At the same time effectiveness and safety are not independent variables. Safety often a matter of dose. The dose required to achieve a clinical effect may turn out to be unsafe.<p>The issues goes back largely to model validity. That our models don&#x27;t allow us to accurately establish safety margins and dosages, in addition to often being misleading about the wider effects that drugs will have.')
