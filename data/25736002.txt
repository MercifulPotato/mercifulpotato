People will e.g. generate keys with broken rdrand, and AMD will later fix it with plausible deniability, just saying &quot;oops, sorry, it was just our silly usual mistake, and we don&#x27;t even promise we won&#x27;t do it again, lol!&quot;. In the meantime the NSA will enjoy the resulting compromises. And well, even if it <i>was</i> just the same silly mistake made over and over again, the NSA is likely to still enjoy the results?<p>So it does not really matter if it was intentional or not: regardless of the root cause of this bug, it should now be considered that rdrand should <i>never</i> be trusted (unless you truly don&#x27;t care that your systems risk to randomly break or you risk to randomly generate compromised keys) and its mere usage (except maybe indirectly in mitigated ways designed by experts and audited for years) considered a very likely security vulnerability.')
