I explained why this was unfounded.<p>Adversarial patterns against computer vision based ADAS are only a real issue for system which are not sufficiently redundant . Autonomous systems in particular should also apply a degree of sensor fusion between multiple sources of data such as optical computer vision, radar, long range ultrasound and LIDAR (once it becomes cost effective). If any of those systems provides erroneous data the remaining ones can negate that and allow for a fail-safe behaviour.<p>If you  want my opinion, as someone who has moved away from automotive R&amp;D a few years ago, Tesla&#x27;s decision of depending too heavily in computer vision systems without addtional sensor redundancy seems like an architectural defect that has already cost lives. Either they are not integrating other sensor data sources or their voting weight appears underestimated.')
