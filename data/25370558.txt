Much of the rest of the opinions expressed (especially in the most upvoted comments) are done so in such a way that makes it seems as though there&#x27;s no debate to be had.  You&#x27;re either for or against free speech.  No in between.  Of course, counterexamples abound but it doesn&#x27;t matter in this discussion.  Truly a sad thing to witness.
