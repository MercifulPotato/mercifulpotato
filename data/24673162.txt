The high priced swiss etc watch market is purely a status symbol fashion thing for sure. Smart watches are an accessory as there&#x27;s very little reason to not be with your phone or check your phone for the basics (time, notifications). All the perks you all like about the Watch are frivolous&#x2F;luxury concerns. Even the health tracking. Having all the extra data and notifications (bleh, no more notifications!) are a luxury. Tap to pay, handy, sure, but man, is that a luxury. And all you parents out there loving the watch because you&#x27;re juggling kids and don&#x27;t know where your phone is half the time....... handy luxury, and maybe really you only need the one device (tied to the iphone still? bah)<p>The pandemic has also changed everything. Other than perhaps wanting the health tracking in covid times which could save a life sure, no one should be moving around as much or in the same way as pre-covid to need a watch.<p>It&#x27;s just another watch fashion accessory that keeps you tied to your phone for convenience, but not necessary = luxury. You&#x27;re paying a luxury fee for convenience that the Apple ecosystem has made you accustomed to from a glorified media company that happens to have some hardware made for you to access their media offerings. Just like the iPad made a market for tablets where there wasn&#x27;t really one and for years despite competitors entering the market was really only for the Apple iPad and nothing else.<p>meh&#x2F;apple hate in this post, whatever, just a different viewpoint not expressed enough in this thread.')
