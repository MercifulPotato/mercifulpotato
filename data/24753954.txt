Nuitkas main goal is not speed (compared to Cython), but the ability to output an executable binary (plus a bunch of dynamic libraries) needed to run your program in a portable, &quot;interpreter independent&quot; way. From the &quot;What is Nuitka&quot; page[0]:<p>&gt; It translates the Python into a C program that then is linked against libpython to execute in the same way as CPython does, in a very compatible way.<p>Once they managed full compatibility (I think it was in 0.4?) then they started to focus on optimizing and translating even more things to C (again, keeping compatibility at 100% -- so you shouldn&#x27;t event run into Nuitka-specific issues).<p>I&#x27;ve used it to deploy a few custom triage programs in the field for DFIR operations where we&#x27;d want to run a few specific things from portable drives without installing anything in the triaged computer.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuitka.net&#x2F;pages&#x2F;overview.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuitka.net&#x2F;pages&#x2F;overview.html</a>')
