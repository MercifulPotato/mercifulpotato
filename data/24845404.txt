I think its more a complaint about mutating objects not cleanly mapping to running UPDATE commands.  Live objects and partial updates are messy and dirty writes become an issue.  I often see a a pattern of a Save() method on an ORM type and its ambiguous as to what exactly that will write to the DB at any time.  Maybe there are better ORM patterns but the problem is its a common anti-pattern none the less.<p>If you use a more RPC approach to your data layer, partial updates based on an entity id are easier to groc.')
