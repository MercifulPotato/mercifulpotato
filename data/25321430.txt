You can&#x27;t get excel with powerBI without also having to buy teams.  It&#x27;s more how Microsoft sells Teams than the fact that Teams exists at all that raises my eyebrow.  Teams doesn&#x27;t sell Teams, Word and Excel sell Teams.<p>Really saying that Microsoft won&#x27;t let you buy their most popular products alone is just another way to phrase this situation.')
