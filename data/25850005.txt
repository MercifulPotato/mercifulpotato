The Amish know that technology and modern society exist, and they even participate some for work, but they don&#x27;t bring it back home, and they haven&#x27;t altered their way of life.<p>Coercion is like the Indian boarding school programs in the Pacific Northwest. Taking Indian children away from their parents and beating them if they spoke their native languages, with the goal of wiping out the culture and forcing assimilation.<p>I&#x27;m cool with the Amish method but not the boarding schools.')
