From their most recent SEC-10K (July 2020, pg 92, Part II Item 8) [1]: (revenue, in billion $)<p>* Server products and cloud services: 41 (in 2020), 26 (in 2018)<p>* Office products and cloud services: 35 (in 2020), 28 (in 2018)<p>* Windows: 22 (in 2020), 19 (in 2018)<p>* Gaming: 12 (in 2020), 10 (in 2018)<p>Windows continues to be important (probably a defensive revenue stream), but strategically I wonder what the advantage is of switching to a Linux kernel. So many things would break (the 3rd party driver ecosystem for one will have to turn over several times to catch up), plus MS would lose full control over the direction of kernel development. It also doesn&#x27;t really help or hinder their Azure strategy -- a large percentage of VMs on Azure are Linux VMs. But I pontificate without real knowledge, so I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.gcs-web.com&#x2F;static-files&#x2F;4e7064ed-bbf7-4140-a8cb-79aba77421b9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microsoft.gcs-web.com&#x2F;static-files&#x2F;4e7064ed-bbf7-414...</a>')
