I&#x27;ve been paying attention to constraint&#x2F;logic programming (CLP) recently, but I haven&#x27;t found the right thing yet &#x2F; haven&#x27;t invested enough time into it to find the right thing. In my very-layman opinion, CLP-based systems need three things to properly take off: 1. some kind of &#x27;type system&#x27;-like thing that enables robust symbolic reasoning over pure relations in any mode, 2. a critical mass of defined layers that is &#x27;deep enough&#x27; to reach the hardware, 3. a way to express verified alternatives and preference in the order they are applied.')
