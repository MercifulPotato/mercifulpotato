One you need a better input capabilities than what a normal touchscreen keyboard provides.  For this there are only a few options that are mobile.  Either whip out a blue tooth keyboard, which is hardly applicable if you&#x27;re standing, or use a chording keyboard such as the twiddler[0].  The later take some time to learn, and are still somewhat awkward, in that you look like you&#x27;re carrying a detonator device in your hand at all time.<p>The second problem is that most mobile devices are walled gardens that don&#x27;t allow you full access to your pocket computer&#x27;s sensors and filesystem.  This makes piping the output of one program into another (even say an editor, to email or a compiler) difficult, to say the least.  In this case you really need to jailbreak your phone, or purchase an open option such as a PinePhone.<p>[0](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twiddler.tekgear.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twiddler.tekgear.com&#x2F;</a>)')
