Those are a bit like filesystem labels, but generated during filesystem creation. Their format makes collisions virtually impossible. LUKS volumes have one, and partitions inside them have a different one too.<p>This is my prefered way of identifying partitions, as they are persistent even when you move them around with lvm, dd, or others. I think that&#x27;s also the default in many distributions.<p>PARTUUID is also a nice way to identify partitions when you can&#x27;t rely on a partition UUID for some reason. It works like UUIDs, but instead of being stored inside the partition, that information is part of the GPT (GUID partition table).<p>If you are more interested in the drives than the partition content, by-id makes sense, though I think the use-case is rather narrow :)')
