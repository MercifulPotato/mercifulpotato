Now it&#x27;s almost all &quot;free&quot; clips on these sites. I&#x27;m not an expert on the industry, but from the outside it looks to me like the pornhubs, xhamsters, xvideos, etc. of the world have been making money off content without charging for it by allowing arbitrary upload of mostly copyrighted content. Beyond the very dubious stuff that gets uploaded, there&#x27;s bound to be boatloads of copyright violations as well.<p>What&#x27;s that saying? When the product is free you are the product? Something like that applies here.')
