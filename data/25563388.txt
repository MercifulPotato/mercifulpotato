The public library system where I live offers free cards.  I think it&#x27;s just as likely for a school to include the library card cost in tuition and charge for it otherwise.<p>My guess is &quot;Santa Luna&quot; is actually Santa Cruz, and their library cards are free too (at least now, but I suspect that it hasn&#x27;t changed).  My guess is that since this was written after the fact, there&#x27;s just some haziness on what was actually the case, and why he didn&#x27;t frequent the library as much (which might be as simple as that the hours he was out and walking the neighborhood were often not library hours).')
