I&#x27;ve done projects over the years where I&#x27;m the &quot;expert&quot;, and on those projects there are a lot of organizational details (like tracking billable hours) where I have brought in or asked for a project manager to be brought in, not to &quot;manage&quot; me or the project per se, but to take care of details like that so that I can focus on the work itself instead. Has worked well for me.')
