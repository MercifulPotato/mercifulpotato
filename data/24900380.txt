I recommend his short story collections &quot;Kentucky Straight&quot; and &quot;Out of the Woods&quot; for a start. What I find unusual is his perspective: His fiction is set in a very rural and poor environment, and clearly he had a foot in that himself once, but no longer quite fits in (A dilemma spelled out in his memoir <i>No Heroes</i> â€” and there was a battle on comment sides whether he did or did not misrepresent his native area).')
