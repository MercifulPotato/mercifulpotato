What happened here is that you all GOT SCAMMED.  There is no magic short call coming tomorrow.  The stock was pumped (starting originally with a short squeeze, but of course now it&#x27;s just a regular bubble), and you were fooled into trying to buy it high.  You are the victims here, not the heroes.')
