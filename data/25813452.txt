If your office is in downtown Portland, and if you&#x27;re on the list of people with office access during pandemic, then you&#x27;ve probably received a bunch of emails warning about looting and&#x2F;or violence over the summer. Probably didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;Thug&quot;, but in this case there were actual literal nazis so the warning seems reasonable.')
