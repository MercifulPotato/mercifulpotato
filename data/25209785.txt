It’s “I pick my political allegiance based on the party that will most likely help those at the bottom of the totem pole” versus “not doing that”.<p>All of my fellow republican business owners were bristling at the idea of Obama’s executive order increasing the minimum salary for exempt workers.  This is because they would have had to pay their immigrant workers $44k per year for 60+ hour work weeks who they designated as “managers”, rather than $30k per year under current rules.<p>Again, I’m not saying Democrats are perfect, and they are far from it. But at least some Democrat states, and politicians are making an effort, whereas I can’t say the same about Repubs.  Hence, it’s not just color A vs color B.')
