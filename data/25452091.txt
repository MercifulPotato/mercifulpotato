People wealthy enough to afford to not bicycle or take the bus, but of modest enough means that taxes can mean putting car ownership out of reach.  The &quot;Liberal elite&quot; is putting a very manageable burden on the rich, actively promoting means of transit that help the poor, and is expecting the middle class to just suffer through the requisite sacrifices.  It&#x27;s a compelling narrative so long as you don&#x27;t expect to live another 50 years in which case it&#x27;s a rather dense one becuase you will actually have to pay the interest on your choices today.<p>What truly baffles me is people who are anti-immigrarion, anti-migrant, and anti-refugee but also against any form of regulation on carbon emissions.  As if they don&#x27;t quite grasp that if your goal is to reduce migration than environmental policy matters more than even immigration policy.')
