The only difference I see with the West is that the emperor of the West is less powerful than Xi.<p>The &quot;nice&quot; thing about a totalitarian king&#x2F;emperor&#x2F;dictator is that improvements in prosperity come quickly. The disadvantage is that the fall also comes quickly (easy example: Mao).<p>Aren&#x27;t the root issues as simple as that? I mean this is not exactly the first time in history that we saw &quot;The West&quot; V.S. dictatorships. It&#x27;s also not the first time that we saw a powerful Chinese totalitarian regime make the country very wealthy and then poor again. To clarify: regarding that last sentence I&#x27;m talking about the past 2500 years or so.<p>Don&#x27;t dictatorships by their nature come with massive corruption and eventual downfall. Or is that my - just world fallacy - talking?')
