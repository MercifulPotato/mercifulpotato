Item(by='fwip', descendants=None, kids=[25204060], score=None, time=1606255086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201513, text='I feel like I&#x27;m missing something fundamental in this paragraph:<p>&gt; Rainbow tables differ in that they don&#x27;t use multiple tables with different reduction functions, they only use one table. However in Rainbow Tables a different reduction function is used for each column. This way different tables with different reduction functions aren&#x27;t needed, because different reduction functions are used within the same table.<p>What exactly is the structure of the final rainbow table - does it contain a column for each reduction function, or does it still only contain &quot;start text&quot; and &quot;last hash&quot; of each chain? I would loved to have seen a diagram of the table structure here. (From my own reading, I think these &quot;extra columns&quot; are not stored anywhere).')
