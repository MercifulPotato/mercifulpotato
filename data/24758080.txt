Doctors don&#x27;t have governing experience, and they weren&#x27;t elected. They can and should serve an important advisory role, but the final call should be up to our elected leaders.<p>If we have elected unqualified politicians, that&#x27;s a separate problem. This is still a decision that&#x27;s within their domain.')
