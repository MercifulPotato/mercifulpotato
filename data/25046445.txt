They&#x27;re extremely easy to use databases and make computing data really easy. I wish they were even more programmable than they already are. A map function would be nice...<p><pre><code>  = MAP(A1:A, A + 10)\n</code></pre>\nThis would be so much nicer compared to a huge mess of ARRAYFORMULAs I&#x27;m using right now.<p>The ability to store multiple values in one cell like a dictionary would be awesome as well. With that I wouldn&#x27;t have to implement lookup manually.')
