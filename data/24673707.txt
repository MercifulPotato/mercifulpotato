What users don&#x27;t realize is that while they are sitting in awe of the amazing title screen, the game is finishing its preparations.<p>I did exactly this in my first video game.  It was an N64 game so the load time requirements from Nintendo were very short and we were 1-2 seconds over the limit.  Before the level loaded we already had a UI screen that showed you the map of the level you were about to enter and blinked &quot;OK? (A)&quot; waiting for you to be done checking the map.<p>So, I rendered the map with and without the prompt to the front and back display buffers.  Then installed a VBlank signal handler that just flipped the display buffers without actually re-rendering anything.  Then the loading started immediately without waiting for the user&#x27;s OK.  (We had no threading back then)  The only think that changed when you hit (A) was that the VBlank handler would flip to the No-Prompt screen for the rest of the load time.')
