In the past two weeks, CD Project Red:<p>- Told gamers the game &quot;runs surprisingly well on consoles&quot;, which is very euphemistic to say the least<p>- Didn&#x27;t give reviewers any review codes for the consoles, meaning console players could only find out about the game&#x27;s horrid performance on consoles on launch date<p>- Didn&#x27;t allow reviewers to post their own footage for the first review embargo, meaning the first wave of reviews only had B-Roll ad footage from CDPR<p>- After they were caught with their pants down wrt console performance, told customers they could get a refund <i>without consulting the platform</i>, so Sony was stuck holding up a deal they didn&#x27;t know about<p>CDPR used every scummy tactic in the book, and yet <i>still</i> got glowing reviews from the press: the game has an 87 on Metacritic right now, and it had a 90 for a few days after launch. Most reviewers praised the game and expected the bugs to be patched. In fact, in my experience the media has been far more positive about the game than actual players! And this is <i>after</i> they failed to deliver on several core promises. It is honestly hilarious that fans of the game are trying to pin the well deserved negative reaction from the general audience on the media.<p>(And I do have to point out the incredibly funny move of trying to pin this as a &quot;culture war&quot; thing. Yeah, people hate the game because of &quot;SJWs&quot;, not because CDPR literally lied to their customers multiple times. Great deflection tactic.)')
