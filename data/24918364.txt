If anyone&#x27;s interested in learning more about how previous cultures remembered vast amounts of information I would recommend the book I&#x27;m currently reading:<p>Frances Yates - The Art of Memory,<p>and the one I&#x27;m planning to read next:<p>Mary Carruthers - The Book of Memory.<p>One of the most interesting aspects for me is how the concept of memory in the middle ages was much more closely associated (sometimes conflated) with imagination than it is now. Most people I know now would consider memory and imagination as two quite distinct mental faculties.')
