Deploying locally to k8s (minikube) takes still some time (build the image, push it to the local registry, run the deployment manifests, etc.) which become a PITA for very small changes.<p>I prefer to run DBs using docker and docker-compose on my homeLab linux servers than installing MySQL through the package manager. A lot cleaner&#x2F;easier&#x2F;faster to configure.')
