Which is probably valuable if this is a situation you&#x27;re concerned about :-)<p>It&#x27;s not so much that as a negotiation technique it&#x27;s outdated, it&#x27;s more that you need to pre-select positions in some manner so you don&#x27;t waste your time. If you are being paid X and a company pays their best employee X&#x2F;2, but think they are paying &#x27;really well&#x27;, you&#x27;re never going to not be wasting your time.')
