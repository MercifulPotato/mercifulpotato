But it&#x27;s so general. And what do you do, treat it with therapy, diet, exercise and meds<p>While undoubtedly useful and necessary, we can find such diagnoses and treatment anywhere.<p>It elides the personal nature, and ignores specific causes.<p>The story was touching. I can&#x27;t offer advice, because it&#x27;s your life, but i can share what helped me.<p>When i got bored with boilerplate, i made my own frame works to make the boilerplate mine and bearable.<p>I made tools i love to use.<p>This made it better and less boring.<p>When i lose interest in things or feel I&#x27;m losing my spark...i consider what am i not saying that i really feel. How am i not living my true authentic life.<p>And then i start closing that gap. Saying what i want to say. How i really feel. Doing what i want to do.<p>It&#x27;s not easy. Bridges sometimes are burned. Connections lost. Opportunities declined.<p>But i feel i get closer to the life i really want. And that let&#x27;s me feel lighter and want to get up everyday and enjoy it. When I&#x27;ve got confidence my choices will lead me to a path that i will increasingly like, instead of feel like they&#x27;re trapping me in one that i don&#x27;t want.<p>I&#x27;m also careful with my diet. And double these efforts when I&#x27;m feeling off. Minimize processed foods, and increasing vegetables.<p>And meditating and relaxing.<p>I find this keeps me balanced, centered and me. And then what i want to do occurs natrally.<p>And i just follow some ideas i have. And don&#x27;t try to start something that will be too hard for me or take me too long.<p>If i don&#x27;t want to do something i don&#x27;t do it.<p>Like i said, not advice, because it&#x27;s your life, your choices and you&#x27;re different to me, and i don&#x27;t want the karma nor the responsibility of affecting your path.<p>But just sharing what helps me, because maybe they can inspire you and help let you feel things can be okay.')
