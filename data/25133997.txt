That&#x27;s because despite all the talk about anti carrier missiles, a carrier&#x27;s combat effectiveness still harder to degrade than land based airstrips because they can dodge. An airstrip covered in bomblets and mines is useless even if its aircraft hangers are intact. South Korea is investing in carriers because in a combat scenario with North Korea once the air force has sortied they still need a place to land and resupply. Even if all the airstrips in South Korea are cratered at least there&#x27;s a carrier out at sea you can resupply at instead of ditching them after one sortie.<p>All this revolves around the fact that launching and relaunching aircraft takes a lot of real estate, whether on land or on a floating metal island. Until there&#x27;s a replacement everything that combat aircraft can do, maybe autonomous missile swarms that you can fire at a region and forget because they&#x27;re intelligent enough to pick targets without someone in a plane handing them targeting info, then carriers will continue to be necessary.<p>Also, radar and wireless equipment powerful and sophisticated enough to detect and flag targets while bombarded with ECM is much more expensive than the missiles and we currently can&#x27;t make enough of them to send on one way missions.')
