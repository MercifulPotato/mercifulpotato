The biggest difference between ?&#x2F;: and if&#x2F;else is that ?&#x2F;: is an expression (returns a value) and if&#x2F;else are statements (a step&#x2F;command&#x2F;declaration&#x2F;etc). You can build statements on top of CEL (lots do), but the core Common Expression Language (CEL) doesn&#x27;t actually have them.<p>Note that python uses if&#x2F;else for the ternary expression form as well: `a = b if c else d`<p>Though personally, I like to have the condition in the front, instead of in the middle.')
