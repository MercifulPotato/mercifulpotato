He&#x27;s no Steve Jobs, but he&#x27;s done a fine job. Although he hasn&#x27;t produced any new cash cows so far, he&#x27;s been a decent steward of the ones they already had and he&#x27;s taken the company into new markets with the Apple Watch. It&#x27;s not the most inspiring product, but it is the premium wearable and clear leader. Then there are the AirPods, which fit in nicely in wearable category. And I love what Apple is doing with their own silicon.<p>Sure, there are no home runs here, but he&#x27;s effectively executing a coherent strategy and hasn&#x27;t really had any big mistakes. I wouldn&#x27;t put him as high up as Nadella and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t put him as low as Ballmer. It&#x27;s tough to be the guy who follows the founder and Cook has handled it well. I don&#x27;t know who is out there who looks like a better candidate or a suitable replacement for Cook.')
