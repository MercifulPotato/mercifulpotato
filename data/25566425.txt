Everyone meant well, but dined on me for entertainment.<p>First day of actual shooting, I taught my classes in New York then drove down to Princeton. Arriving in a blur, I noticed the catering had jumped another league, as I grabbed a snack.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re eating props!&quot;<p>Months later, I was mountain biking on a day off.
