Lineage is great if you want to turn an old device into a game system or something, but it should not be used on a device you need to be able to trust.<p>The only Google-free option to have a signed system-verified app supply chain on Android is use a ROM that bundles F-droid as a system trusted app manager like CalyxOS, RattlesnakeOS, or my projects, aosp-build, and #!os.<p>While F-Droid is far from perfect it is the only alternative path and Moxie refuses to allow apps to be distributed there because he openly admits he wants the usage metrics that come from Google&#x2F;Apple distribution.<p>In effect, you either use Apple&#x2F;Google ecosystems to run verified binaries, or compile yourself every week or two.')
