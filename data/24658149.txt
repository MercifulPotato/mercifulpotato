When something is on the tip of my tongue, I don&#x27;t search for it because I have a strange belief that what my mind is trying to do to remember it is fire off neurons associated with the thought or idea, near it, to create the action potential. It is strange that I will eventually remember it within hours or the next day. When the action potential fires the neuron, dendrites are formed between neurons strengthening the memory.<p>I wonder if there is any truth to that notion? That to solidify a memory, there can&#x27;t be outside help, that electric chemical signal has to trigger firing the neurons associated with the memory to strengthen their connections.')
