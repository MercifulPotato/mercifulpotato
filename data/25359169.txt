I have had an issue with this literal problem. I had a &#x27;consultant&#x27; we would farm out to other organizations. She was phenomenal with work quality, but her organization was garbage, and her billing was always late&#x2F;inaccurate.<p>Here&#x27;s what I did (and what the article seems to agree with):<p>1. Be clear about your expectations. Have standardized forms, and clear deadlines the two of you discuss. Also discuss and agree to consequences for not meeting expectations for timeline and accuracy. You WILL have to explain why this is important; to most of these folks who are rockstars, the work is important, not the follow-up.<p>2. Work through the documentation process, and find the pinch points. How can you help with that (provide resources).<p>3. If you have set consequences, follow through on them, or change the process to suit the person if they are valuable enough.<p>In my experience, being bad at ancillary things isn&#x27;t malicious. It&#x27;s either not a priority, or it has never been called out. Super high performers won&#x27;t understand why it matters (especially in the tech sector where &#x27;the work&#x27; is all that matters). It&#x27;s up to you to translate why it&#x27;s important, and what the impact is for the team. Be open to solutions you hadn&#x27;t though of.<p>Good luck.')
