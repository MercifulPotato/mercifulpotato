But I was not talking about the scientists, I was talking about the platforms where scientists talk. Science magazines (like this one), social media and (more broadly) the internet. More often than not the ones doing the censorship are not scientists. They are usually employees and these so called fact checkers. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good your argument is when a fact checker can declare your argument false based on a pedantic mistake. The rest will see the fact check and just accept it. Or in some cases they will simply delete it.<p>Also, how does one become anti-science in your opinion? Does questioning contradictory orders now means anti-science? Like how masks didn&#x27;t work at the start of the pandemic but now even a kerchief will work? Millions of people protesting in the streets don&#x27;t spread coronavirus but ten people indoors is a hotspot? I don&#x27;t know about you but my teachers taught me questioning everything is an integral part of science.')
