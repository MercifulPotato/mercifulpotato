Item(by='Guvante', descendants=None, kids=[25720198], score=None, time=1610311762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713120, text='It is probably a spam filter, downvotes are an imperfect proxy for post quality. Tons of low quality posts is a form of spam. You don&#x27;t have to be posting links to things you want to sell to be spamming.<p>No offense to you but typically there isn&#x27;t a ton of value to someones posts that are repeatedly downvoted. They tend to be repetitive. I didn&#x27;t look at yours so am not making a judgement on your statements but instead on others I have seen.<p>So an algorithm to slow down posts of that kind make sense even if it isn&#x27;t perfect.<p>No one sees a post with a huge number of replies and assumes that since not every reply is replied back the person gave up. It is generally known that keeping up is hard when you are outnumbered.<p>You should keep that in mind and focus your efforts. If you get a bunch of replies focus on the upvoted ones first since then your reply will be more prominent as well. Ensure you aren&#x27;t repeating your points, while some people carpet bomb replies most only do that when they are substantially similar.<p>On the topic of the post I replied to you got caught by several reasons for downvotes:<p>* Spreading a conspiracy. You emphatically say that those in power are lying.\n* Providing no evidence or even examples really. You have to back up extreme rhetoric with robust supporting evidence. You didn&#x27;t provide any.\n* Bad place to make a stand. You chose to complain about overbearing tech companies on a topic about Twitter stopping people calling for the death of the VP. Direct calls for violence are agreed to be bad for everyone so using it as a jumping board for overbearing tech companies is a bad idea.\n* You finally used yourself as the example of overbearing tech companies. Never ever do this. You are incredibly biased about your own actions. You understand why you are taking them and give yourself immense benefit of the doubt. Using a literal spam filter as an example of what is wrong with tech because you personally got caught by it is a fundamentally flawed argument. You are incapable of reasonably inspecting the quality of your own posts.<p>Finally your original post is woefully ignorant. No one can know whether the election was stolen based on their own knowledge. No man is an island I believe is the phrase. The actual information required to prove that without a doubt is impossible to obtain. You need to have the data summarized to stand a chance. So by saying &quot;acting on stuff that you don&#x27;t know&quot; after making it obvious you don&#x27;t believe in secondary sources you are showing that you are making a fundamentally flawed argument.')
