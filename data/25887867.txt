While I did start with Usenet, and do remember reading this long-long ago, I didn&#x27;t post it as a historical curiosity, but because I thought the advice within was still relevant to places on the internet today such as HN.  Or at least, still <i>should</i> be relevant.  For example, here&#x27;s the opener:<p><i>Never Forget that the Person on the Other Side is Human</i><p><i>Because your interaction with the network is through a computer it is easy to forget that there are people &quot;out there.&quot; Situations arise where emotions erupt into a verbal free-for-all that can lead to hurt feelings.</i><p><i>Please remember that people all over the world are reading your words.  Do not attack people if you cannot persuade them with your presentation of the facts.  Screaming, cursing, and abusing others only serves to make people think less of you and be less willing to help you when you need it.</i><p><i>If you are upset at something or someone, wait until you have had a chance to calm down and think about it before posting a reply.  A cup of coffee or a good night&#x27;s sleep works wonders on your perspective. Hasty words create more problems than they solve.  Try not to say anything to others you would not say to them in person in a room full of people.</i><p>It goes on in this vein.  While it would be easy to dismiss this as naive advice for a lost era, I think most of it still applies.')
