There was no &quot;collector market&quot;. Since the items were worthless to the studios when filming was complete, actors were allowed to take what they wanted.  This is why you rarely see items from the early days of movies (1920-1950) for sale, they were rarely saved.  The movie posters from the movies in those days were some of the only items preserved, and those can command premium prices, even into the millions for a poster like &quot;Metropolis&quot;. It also makes you appreciate the fact that the ruby slippers from &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; were saved.  (Source - the Hollywood ride in Disney Studios)')
