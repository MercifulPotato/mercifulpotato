Item(by='Quanttek', descendants=None, kids=[25402810, 25412877], score=None, time=1607814445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402605, text='Yes, you might not have seen her gender beforehand. But countless others have. I&#x27;m not saying GP went &quot;oh a woman, better tone-police her&quot;. Rather, the gender of the author entered into our (mine as well) subconsciousness and combined there with implicit assumptions about gender roles and the &#x27;proper&#x27; behavior of women. Any behavior that then doesn&#x27;t fit the stereotype of diplomatic, kind, etc., elicits a stronger emotional reaction in us and makes us more like to write or upvote such a comment.<p>It is not that HN doesn&#x27;t already have a &quot;baseline obsession&quot; with tone or that male authors never fall victim to this. But rather, one can observe a trend where such tone-policing comments are more likely to occur and get upvoted if the author is a woman. And on the flip-side, comments commending a harsher, &quot;more&quot; honest or rant-y tone are more likely to occur when the post was written by a male author.')
