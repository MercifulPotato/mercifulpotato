In the original version, according to the authors, it was a Soviet labor camp; but of course, even after Khrushchev more or less denounced Stalin and his activities, you couldn&#x27;t just remind people about Soviet labor camps. So, it had to become a German concentration camp.<p>A more funny (and sad) tale I remember from someone non-famous, is them trying to publish a children&#x27;s book, and the censors saying it&#x27;s good, but doesn&#x27;t have enough communist spirit. Like, instead of there just being kids helping little animals, it could mention that the kids were members of the local communist youth chapter, etc. The author decided to not publish the book.')
