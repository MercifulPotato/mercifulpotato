I got sometimes to scan some fake models to eliminate any legal reasons for publishing real patients data on the Internet.<p>I published all data in this Github repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thangngoc89&#x2F;dxd-file-format" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thangngoc89&#x2F;dxd-file-format</a><p>I also tried to scan something simple like an sphere or a pencil without any success. The software only recognize tooth-like structures.<p>Luciky, it can exports to STL files with 100% triangles that can be imported to others dental CAD software so I hope it would help with the progress.')
