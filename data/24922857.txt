I was able to be productive with right away back then. The JavaScript community freaked out because some Google exec in an email said Dart was a JavaScript killer. That did a lot of damage to it&#x27;s acceptance. Dart was written with 2 things in mind afaik: 1) Replace Java based Google Web Kit used to write JavaScript (GMail circa mid 2000&#x27;s) and 2) to serve as a backup language in Google lost the Java lawsuit with Oracle. Dart wasn&#x27;t designed to be a shiny new thing like Swift, Rust or Kotlin, but more of a working language for day to day needs at Google. By those measures, Dart has succeeded admirably with Flutter taking off in popularity. Dart drew a lot of inspiration from C#, so I don&#x27;t understand that complaint. C#, TypeScript and Dart are similar languages. Finally, Flutter&#x2F;Dart should be compared to Blazor&#x2F;C# and I think by that comparison, Flutter wins hands down.')
