I used to have a Synology box and it was great in terms of plug&#x27;n&#x27;play: you set it up via a nice web UI and it... just works! It also has downloadable plugins&#x2F;apps that let you bolt interesting functionality onto the NAS.<p>By comparison this Odroid box comes with Ubuntu preinstalled and that&#x27;s it. Much more flexibility, but much more work involved too.')
