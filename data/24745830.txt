Mobile phones are cameras and microphones in every house, school and workplace. All the mobile standards have &quot;legal intercept&quot; provisions, which basically allow law enforcement to listen to your conversations &#x2F; read your text-messages. This is just a demand to go back to the status quo ante, where Government had unrestricted access to all your phone conversations and mail if they chose to.<p>I would also wager that there is a non-zero chance that the baseband processor of all phones has a backdoor, which is why the US can&#x27;t allow phones to predominantly use Chinese made baseband processors. The baseband has access to your microphone and camera and is mostly out of control of the application processor.')
