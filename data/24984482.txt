So while I appreciate the spirit of Net Neutrality rules, the solution is fundamentally flawed.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to open an ISP in your neighborhood. Based on their history (When Google Fiber moved into my area), Comcast will call their existing customer base and offer them services below cost but at the price of a 3year contract. This delays profitability for you as a new player into the space. Comcast can take money from one market (another state) and move the profits into subsidizing a loss to prevent players from entering the space in another market. By breaking this cash flow, you end the stagnation of consumer choice, driving innovation forward.')
