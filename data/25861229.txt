Having a controlled environment in a sandbox of its own clearly has benefits, both for consistency of what you&#x27;re running and for safety if it doesn&#x27;t work as you expected. It doesn&#x27;t need to be Docker specifically that we use to create such an environment, but if not Docker then we&#x27;d surely have looked for some other way to achieve the same result.')
