The internet was an app you installed. For  a long time the core purpose of the browser was to pickup the slack&#x2F;gap in the OS treating the internet as a first class thing.<p>Now, as the internet clams down a bit, the OS handles everything natively, including the security primitives (at least on mobile) and so the purpose of the browser is sadly diminishing. It&#x27;s a less useful experimental side channel to the OS.')
