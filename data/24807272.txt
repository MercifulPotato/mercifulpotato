On one hand it doesn&#x27;t sound like FC waited for the report to be authenticated, on the other hand who knows if London Police would ever do that, I don&#x27;t know. I think it&#x27;s fair to have the protection of this law or legal framework if a reporter has a reasonable belief that what they&#x27;re reporting is accurate. But maybe it&#x27;s a strict liability sort of deal, where it doesn&#x27;t matter what the reporter believed but rather a factual question of whether the reporter published things that ended up being untrue, regardless of belief.')
