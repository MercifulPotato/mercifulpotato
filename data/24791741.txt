Considering I prefer to keep the important data&#x2F;emails on Gmail or Google drive for security and I really consider it important. Would it help if Google had a paid tier?<p>Say, if you can get into an annual plan, similar to what&#x27;s there for hardware devices like Apple Care+. Just that, in this there is someone to help you through issues.<p>We used to pay 10% of our AWS bill for the AWS support plan because when you needed the help, it really made sense to have someone looking at it with some SLAs.<p>A second option is, Google can just make consumer Gmail as an ad free paid service and then provide support for it as well. Plenty of people are paying $10&#x2F;month for email services, so we have a price point that works for people. Email is very crucial to online identity, and I would trust Google the most with security among the other providers so I would happily pay for it.<p>Edit: As someone pointed out, they have Google One at least for storage. It has proper support. Maybe it makes sense to extend it for other services as well. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;one.google.com&#x2F;about" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;one.google.com&#x2F;about</a>')
