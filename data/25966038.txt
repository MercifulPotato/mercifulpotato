There&#x27;s enough remote jobs out there now that I feel comfortable going back and forth between the 2 cities. There are times when I wish I could build camaraderie with teammates by being in the office together, but for the most part I feel pretty comfortable being remote. We do audio calls at least once a day so it&#x27;s nice to have that sort of communication. If it were only IM I think that would be too difficult to do.')
