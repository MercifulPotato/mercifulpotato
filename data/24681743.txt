Sony owns or co-owns several. Universal has common ownership with Peacock. Disney obviously has Disney+, also Hulu. Warner is part of AT&amp;T, so is tied to HBO Max by ownership. Paramount is tied to CBS All Access (soon to be rebranded as Paramount+). 20th Century is now a Disney brand. Lionsgate has Starz streaming. etc., etc., etc.')
