But there are two types of ways this happens in reality:<p>Case 1: An actual smart and caring employee bypasses the chain to give me evidence of a manager not acting in the companys interest. Usually that&#x27;s not the first indication of such a thing and listening around reaffirms the conclusion quickly. The manager is approached as quickly as possible and since at this paygrade it&#x27;s in no-one&#x27;s best interest to burn bridges, they suddenly decide to spend more time with their family, a sweet severance package changes hands, employees are happy again and you don&#x27;t read about this in the news. It&#x27;s exactly why I said this in the first place (and meant it).<p>Case 2:\nAn employee with issues not bringing the company further (usually one or more of paranoia, toxicity, not-seeing-the-big-picture, searching for problems instead of solutions or emotional health issues) bypasses the chain of command with &quot;evidence&quot;, but listening around almost nobody shares this employees&#x27; opinion. You fire them. Suddenly all problems disappear, employees are happy and then you read about this in the news, because the only person left unhappy did really not get the memo.<p>Judging from the type of problems here (something something starship about floor mats at a time when Model 3 just wasn&#x27;t ramping up production and cashflow almost ruined the company), I do have my opinion about the type of &quot;privilege escalation&quot; in this case but I obviously won&#x27;t share it.')
