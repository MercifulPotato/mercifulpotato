If an &#x27;infringement nexus requirement&#x27; is upheld, section 512 may still cover section 1201 violations by shielding service providers from any copyright infringement liability that would establish a nexus with the circumvention tool.<p>I don&#x27;t see this particular issue ever being resolved by the courts in any case, so there&#x27;s still quite a bit of ambiguity in this connection between the two sections of the DMCA.')
