I once waited 9 hours at an airport for a 12 hour flight; seldom been more exhausted than that. It wasn&#x27;t even the last leg, so even more airports&#x2F;waiting when we arrived.<p>Is there a worse place to wait than those airports? The shops sell Rolex watches, Hugo Boss suits, alcohol (let me lug some bottles of vine&#x2F;booze across the globe to save $12) + perfume. Obviously some overpriced cafe&#x27;s and restaurants there as well, but not exactly a cool place to &quot;hang out&quot;.')
