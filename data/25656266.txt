What we found allowed to compute the private signing key given two public signatures.<p>Due to some technicality this meant that you needed another bug which allowed to extract these plaintext signatures. (The best comparison today would be that we found a universal code execution bug but you still needed to find your own info leak to defeat ASLR which we either didn&#x27;t share or didn&#x27;t have for all keysets).<p>What happened then was that geohot used this flaw we found together with a simple bug that leaked two plaintext signatures to extract one of the most important keys and published that one on his website.<p>Sony responded by suing him and us as well - probably because they assumed that we worked together. After a few month they reached a settlement with geohot where he promised to never hack any Sony product ever again. At the same time they simply dropped the lawsuit against marcan, me and a few other friends from fail0verflow without having ever served us.\nThose months resulted in quite some stress for me and personal and legal issues for another friend.')
