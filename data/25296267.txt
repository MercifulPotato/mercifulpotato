As I recall, he barely survived. Under slightly different circumstances, he wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>Maybe he&#x27;s right about Tesla, though Tesla seems to have a real innovation that&#x27;s hard to price (and goes well beyond being a car maker). But even if he is, he&#x27;s playing a very dangerous game. Shorts are an enormous risk, and getting it right once doesn&#x27;t mean he can do it again.')
