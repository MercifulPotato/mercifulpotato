Item(by='IHLayman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610836179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25804938, text='There is an interesting game I played in the past week called MHRD  that has you start with NAND gates and gets you all the way to a CPU, challenging you to use as few NAND gates as you can each step. That was pretty fun and reinforced some of the ideas (although it elides a lot of the JK Flip Flop and RS Latch stuff by abstracting it into their own data unit). I agree with other commenters talking about eater.net and NANDtoTetris as they are both great instructional resources (Ben Eaterâ€™s YouTube series is extraordinary).<p>As far as learning assembly, you may want to try Zachtronics games TIS-100, Shenzhen.IO, and Exapunks as it does offer a bit of the instinct for assembly coding. To learn 6502, I could suggest finding yourself a good C-128 emulator. The C-128 how I learned both basic and assembly (using their MONITOR command) and the 6502 is pretty easy to understand even if underpowered.')
