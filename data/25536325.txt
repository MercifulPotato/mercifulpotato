I haven&#x27;t done any of it in anger but I did Advent of Code in it this year and have been having a great time. I miss some stuff like Python&#x27;s generators and some of the crates I&#x27;ve found (like ndarray and euclid for example) have felt a bit incomplete but overall the language and standard library feel very well thought out and enjoyable to use.')
