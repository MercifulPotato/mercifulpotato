I trust people in my life to be reliable and trustworthy to a certain extent and in certain areas. I don&#x27;t trust my party-animal buddies to be on time for breakfast a 8 AM, and I don&#x27;t trust my stressed out workaholic friend to just chill on a Friday afternoon.<p>You cannot simplify trust to a single variable; you have to go case by case.
