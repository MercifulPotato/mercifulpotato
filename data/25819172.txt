It actually was me, but younger. I imagined him when I was 11 and he never really aged.<p>I could see him everywhere, sometimes screaming at me from the bleachers on the football field, or right in front of my face. The unique thing though is that he would always comment on what I was doing. It was almost as if I was a machine and he would guide me to where I would go. This being said, there were a lot of disagreements I had with him.<p>I would notice that when I got overly emotional, he would disappear. When things settled down, he&#x27;d come back and comment saying how I shouldn&#x27;t have thought of&#x2F;done what I had. I&#x27;d have the emotional argument with my logical second personality. We were so distinct from each other that, even looking back on it now, he felt evil.<p>The biggest benefit for sure was that I never felt alone. People around me were genuinely worried about how much time I spent isolated from everyone else, but it never felt that way. It always felt like I had someone, arguably more important than friends because it seemed like he kept me alive.<p>The worst part about it was the &#x27;mob&#x27; mentality. Initially it didn&#x27;t seem like much but I noticed that there were some things that I wouldn&#x27;t have agreed with months before. My opinions would change constantly and it all depends on what he would say. Just imagine overthinking and then having a really close and trusted friend jump to even worse extremes because they feel like it would keep you safe.<p>Definitely bad to my overall health but I wouldn&#x27;t be alive if it wasn&#x27;t for him.')
