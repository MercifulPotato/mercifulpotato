Just dropping DST would be easy and the logical thing to do. That would just need some lead time ahead to skip the spring shift.<p>Having each country independently decide about the time zone sounds nice, but is of course a ridiculously stupid idea in the real world. At least some minimal constraints need to be enforces as in:<p>- no timezone differential when you go in north-south direcion\n- timezone offset increases monotonic when you move east\n- avoid to have more than 1-hour timezone steps\n- and of course try to keep countries in the same timezone, which work closest together.')
