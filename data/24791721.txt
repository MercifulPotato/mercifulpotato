We&#x27;re not talking about a service that is trying to help users achieve clearly definable goals like eliminating fraud with their customers&#x27; consent.  No one is claiming that Amazon customers object to having Amazon&#x27;s help to prevent being defrauded.<p>We&#x27;re talking about communication platforms where politically motivated decisions are being made to filter out information that the decision-makers don&#x27;t like, and the users are saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t want you to make those decisions for us.&quot;<p>But also think through my original point.  Why should we value democracy, the notion that each person has valuable and necessary input in building a society, when we hand control of information over to the very few?  Shouldn&#x27;t we cut out the middlemen and just have our information overlords be in charge of creating and implementing all our policies?  Why trust people to vote when we don&#x27;t trust them to choose and evaluate information?')
