Sometimes they will only have a hunch, giving their observations of things that escape most people of a particular candidate, and even without much to show of, they might be right.<p>Later the top screener&#x27;s would help the new ones to be better at their job, teaching their tricks.<p>This is very subjective and personalized, and even if there might be some objective ways to train the screener&#x27;s better, i think its just nuts trying to use objective tests to define a good hire.<p>I bet with you that there are a lot of &quot;human gold&quot; out there that would only be detectable only when its too late for the company.')
