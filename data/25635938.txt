We build stuff for other people, usually in .NET on Azure but we do other stuff occasionally. The company has been around since I started consulting independently about 20 years ago. Recently I started taking on larger projects that need more people and as a result, started hiring people. Sometimes a 1099, sometimes W2.<p>This is not super sexy stuff where you will get options that might be worth millions, but likely worth nothing. What you will get is a load of experience on new tech (asp.net core, azure, blazor etc) and a great focus on the best feature of all...shipping.<p>The job is remote so you don&#x27;t have to be in Louisville though if you are close that is cool.
