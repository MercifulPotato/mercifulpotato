IdentitiesOnly tells SSH that even if it knows how to authenticate as, say, &#x27;me&#x27;, if you&#x27;ve told it to authenticate as &#x27;employee&#x27; in a particular configuration it should insist on only authenticating as &#x27;employee&#x27; never &#x27;me&#x27;. If you don&#x27;t do that you can get confusing behaviour (and of course a privacy hole) on GitHub if your SSH agent knows your &#x27;me&#x27; credentials and you try to use an account set to &#x27;employee&#x27; credentials, as it uses the wrong ones.')
