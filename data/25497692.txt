Today healthcare providers charge different amounts to different insurers, and if you don&#x27;t have insurance you pay list price. The list price is a arbitrary large number (often 3x the price insurers pay) that has no relation to reality. So if you don&#x27;t have insurance, you are hit with a double whammy: You have to pay the bill yourself, and if that isn&#x27;t bad enough, they charge you 300% of the &quot;real&quot; price, meaning what insurance companies pay for the same procedure.')
