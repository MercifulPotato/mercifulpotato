The contraction in 1929-1933 was so large, that going off the gold standard was the simplest option.<p>Unemployment responds to increases of the money supply.  This pattern is quite visible in the macroeconomic data we have.  Also, &quot;employment&quot; includes everyone who has a job, so there&#x27;s nothing funny about the metric.  &quot;Unemployment&quot; requires some restriction, because there are people who have no plans to enter the work force in the near future, such as college students, the retired, or the fraction of spouses that plan on staying home.  If you don&#x27;t like the definition the media reports, there&#x27;s a whole spectrum of alternate measures that the BLS computes that you are welcome to look at, instead.  Over short time intervals they tend to march up and down together.<p>I may have forgotten the lesson of King Edward II, but I remember the lesson of the Great Depression, which caused Adolf Hitler to come to power.  He took Germany off the gold standard, and engaged in large fiscal stimulus, albeit for the grim purpose of conquering Europe.  I also remember that Karl Marx predicted that the internal contradictions of capitalism meant that it was doomed, and how those claims looked like they were being vindicated in the 1930s, because macroeconomic stimulus was applied so late.')
