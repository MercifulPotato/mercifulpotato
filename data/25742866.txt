But that is apparently no more the case...<p>For me, it noticeably started with Youtube and Reddit. Extreme censorship in the name of copyright or &#x27;toxicity&#x27;.<p>Companies used to do press release if they would ban something off their platform justifying with proof. But now, say a word that may make any advertiser unhappy and get deplatformed in an instant (cue: twitch).
