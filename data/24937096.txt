There are many smart people who have many children like Elon Musk, Antony Davies or Kirk Sorenson.<p>Edit: some people interpret this as saying that not wanting children is a genetic trait, but  what i was trying to say was that it&#x27;s a counterproductive idea which will eventually burn itself out, and there are many smart  people who are not suffering from it. So we won&#x27;t run out of smart people.')
