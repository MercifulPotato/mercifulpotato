All important review sites have these problems. Most businesses today live and die on customer reviews, so they do everything they can in order to maintain high rating. There&#x27;s obv a lot Amazon and others can do to fight it. But it&#x27;s a very hard problem, as your example suggests. The worse part is doctor reviews. Some people pick their doctor based on fake reviews.<p>That&#x27;s why when I buy things I usually look into the negative reviews first, then the time period of the positive reviews (many reviews too close is usually a red flag), the total number of reviews a product has (e.g., some items have too many reviews), and also search the product on other sites to see maybe there&#x27;s something I missed. I also rarely order something from a seller with &lt; 90% rating on Amazon. For something like picking a doctor, I always go with recommendations from people I know. I also check online reviews, but only read the negative ones.')
