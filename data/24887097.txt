The conclusion states:<p>&gt; Conclusion<p>&gt; All the claims from the article that I looked at, that can be interpreted as something specific and tested in a real data set, turned out not to be correct.<p>It&#x27;s true that Taleb&#x27;s article is a bit of a rant, in his specific style, and that it might not get its quantitative claims precisely right. However, I think that his core points are valid and that the current paper, by focusing on relatively minor quantitative claims, doesn&#x27;t actually provide relevant counter-arguments.')
