They forget how hard it is to solve new problems on the spot in an interview setting.<p>In my experience technical interview questions are usually way harder than they need to be. I don&#x27;t agree with getting rid of HackerRank style filters entirely because they save you a ton of time with candidates who just <i>can&#x27;t code at all</i> (or candidates that think they aren&#x27;t applying for a coding job). But the questions should definitely err on the easy side.')
