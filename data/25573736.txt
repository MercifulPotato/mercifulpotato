And is just as ridiculous anywhere else.<p>There are valid reasons to separate <i>some</i> folks from the rest of society (think John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, etc.), as they&#x27;ve shown themselves to be unable&#x2F;unwilling to respect the rights of others within that society.<p>Incarceration as a tool of <i>punishment</i>, while widely used, often poses more risk of harming society than any benefit from &quot;punishing&quot; offenders.<p>It&#x27;s a complex issue, and simplifying it to &quot;Law and order!  Lock &#x27;em up!&quot; is reductive and often detrimental to the societies it&#x27;s supposed to improve.')
