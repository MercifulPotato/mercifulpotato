When we need to track down changes we use the corresponding mr, which includes a description as well as a link to the relevant cards.<p>I personally like this format more because it lets you both be &quot;dirty&quot; in your branch writing commits for yourself, and not have to use amends&#x2F;rebasing. I can see how it would be annoying for someone that does all the digging on the terminal through git log and blame, but we all use gitlab instead.')
