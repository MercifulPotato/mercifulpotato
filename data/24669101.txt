Before, it was their shiny veneer of fanciness that barely covers the shitty working conditions. I see nothing but continuous witch hunts targeting people who didn&#x27;t toe even the most ridiculous lines quickly enough. I can&#x27;t imagine the anxiety of walking on eggshells 24&#x2F;7 only to wake up one morning crucified online for an opinion that was mainstream less than a decade ago.<p>What scares me is how ingrained in every SV company this is now. Nearly every company monopolizing some corner of my Internet life continuously spouts this rhetoric in terror. It makes me wonder what they are afraid of.<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t like X, then start your own.&quot; I watched Hatreon get shut down by Visa and probably every other processor. Is their name stupid? Yes, but that&#x27;s not the point. I would bet you dollars to donuts they worked ten times harder than Patreon to comply with US laws and regulations. They knew they were going to be under a microscope. It didn&#x27;t matter one bit.<p>Everyday, the Internet and the companies who sit on it are becoming more central to our lives. We are already close to an informal Social Credit System in the US. How long will it be until watching the wrong politician&#x27;s speech on YouTube means you can&#x27;t get a mortgage? Can&#x27;t get a middle class job? Is that where we want to be? It&#x27;s not where I want to be. It&#x27;s not where the vast majority wants to be, and it&#x27;s scaring us.')
