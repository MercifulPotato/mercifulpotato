It seems like the author wants a certain kind of programmer and wants to minimize false positives. If you want the top 1% (according to your own measurements about what &quot;top&quot; means) then it only makes sense that you&#x27;d have an interview process that more than 99% of applicants couldn&#x27;t pass. &quot;More than&quot; because you&#x27;re also making cuts to avoid false positives which will reject some good candidates.<p>In my view this strikes people as unfair because it excludes most people. It probably excludes them. I think I&#x27;d struggle with the tic tac toe problem and would probably need 30-60 minutes on it (hope to try this afternoon to see). It feels bad to see people say the bar is something you can&#x27;t reach, and that makes people upset at the author. The author is an elitist and people don&#x27;t like that.<p>Furthermore, the bar is arbitrary. No good programmer needs to implement a tictactoe counting program rapidly so it feels dumb to judge on that. This is like saying though that IQ tests are meaningless because I seldom need to guess which shape comes next in a sequence. However, just like predicting a sequence tells us something about the quality of your cognition (probably) quickly writing an arbitrary program tells us that you have some level of coding, thinking, intelligence, etc.<p>You may have that level of talent and fail the test, but you can&#x27;t lack that level of talent and pass the test. At least, that&#x27;s the theory in this essay. It seems mostly correct to me, barring an otherwise incompetent person who just coincidentally practices lots of tic tac toe problems.<p>Given that hiring a bad person is a lot costlier than failing to hire a good one, it seems logical that some people would need to structure hiring like this.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a good bar for FAANG companies. They need too many people. I don&#x27;t think this is a good bar for companies where software is mundane not core competency stuff, you don&#x27;t need high speed hackers. I&#x27;d doubt this is a good strategy for underfunded startups, you probably can&#x27;t afford extensive interview processes with high bars or to hire the folks who would pass them. This seems like it might be a good pattern for a well funded software startup that needs to move fast.')
