When the bottom falls out, the only people left standing will be the people who would have been able to use the nice water fountain back when America was &quot;Great&quot;, and anyone suffering will get individual blame for their lack of individual bootstraps.<p>e: In case I was unclear, I think this is a bad thing :)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wtfhappenedin1971.com&#x2F;</a>, but I would ask &quot;WTF Happened in 1968?&quot; instead.')
