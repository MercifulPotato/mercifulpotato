That risk is increased if the lab is known for poor controls and was flagged as a risk, as the one in Wuhan was in the us cables.<p>Additionally if a researcher did get infected, there is a high chance that they would be asymptomatic and wouldn’t even know it was them.<p>The only “proof” that it wasn’t from the lab is the dna analysis, but that only proves that the research wasn’t altering the genome &#x2F; that there was bio-engineering, there is still loads of research you can do without playing with the genome.')
