It seems the Chinese scientists achieved this Quantum Supremacy at normal room temperatures, and using standard industrial components used elsewhere in commercial telecom equipment.<p>At first, I thought this was more of a type of single-use quantum circuit, where you can only use it to solve this one problem. And you&#x27;d have to build a new rig to solve another function.  And on and on, until you sorta get a general purpose super quantum computer, with all these individual rigs solving different functions, that can finally do useful work.<p>Whereas the Google Sycamore is more of a general purpose quantum computer that can be reprogrammed to solve anything.<p>But, this guy believes that this might be a first step to a universal photonic quantum computer.<p>The last part was incredible.  They verified the results on a  supercomputer, and went up to n=40.  But the supercomputer time costed them $400,000.  So they decided to stop there.<p>Public Key Crypto Code breaking, here we come.
