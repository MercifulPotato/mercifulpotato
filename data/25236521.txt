If you ever work in big companies you will know that.<p>This is the logical fallacy &quot;appeal to the majority&quot;. Just because most companies do something doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s moral, required, logically correct, etc.<p>&gt;Assuming you are a male, you might be unknowingly harrasing female employees just by having a boys will be boys attitude.<p>&quot;Boys will be boys&quot; is not the legal definition of sexual harassment, so no.<p>&gt;So an employer has to give you training and explain you why its wrong.<p>They do that to cover their ass from &quot;hostile work environment&quot; legal suits. This is not baby sitting.<p>&gt;Some people use throwaway accounts to harass other employees on social media, if your employer gave you the training you would have learnt that is wrong.<p>There&#x27;s nothing a company can do in that instance, no one would even know if it is company related. If the harassment veers off into criminal territory, then police should be called.<p>&gt;Exactly, now you get it, the company may get into legal trouble if they dont have an official policy or they make it super difficult to report complaints.<p>Apparently you still don&#x27;t get it. Companies shouldn&#x27;t babysit employees if they&#x27;re committing such crimes. Employers shouldn&#x27;t be babysitting employees when it comes to crimes such as sexual harassment, rape, etc. These should be directed to the police. QED.<p>&gt;No its not simple as that, just telling the victim to go to authorities is just washing your hands<p>It&#x27;s by definition not &quot;washing their hands&quot; because these crimes are not something the company should be babysitting employees over.<p>&gt;a responsible company also makes sure that victims can file a complaint with the management.<p>No responsible company would make or direct a victim to &quot;file an internal complaint&quot; if they are victims of a crime. That is by definition irresponsible.<p>&gt;Not all victims want to file a police complaint, that does not mean they the abuser should get away with harassment.<p>That&#x27;s on them. If you&#x27;re being victimized, reporting the crime should be the only legal recourse. Companies are not in the business of handling justice, period.<p>&gt;The company should still investigate and fire the abuser and then file a complaint with the victim&#x27;s permission.<p>The last thing we need are companies replacing the role that police, laws, the judicial system, etc. provide.<p>If an employee is being victimized, the employer should 100% work with authorities to ensure justice is met.<p>&gt;These are some of the aspects which you will understand if you been through some training.<p>I understand companies not wanting workspaces to be unfriendly, but &quot;unfriendly&quot; isn&#x27;t illegal. Period.')
