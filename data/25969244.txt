At the time I learnt to program in 7501 ASM ( a 6502 derived CPU ) but the endeavour was too much  for a kid given the tools of the time.\nNowadays is way easier: I have a sort of IDE built over emacs, can easily design ( and rip ) sprites  and charsets,   can mix code in macro ASM and a C-like language and can easily debug on an emulator. It&#x27;s really a joy!')
