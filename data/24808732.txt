Some stories are history, some stories are stories. Some are a bit of a mix: they may have a kernel of truth, but they&#x27;re really more about the story than about historical reliability. I think it&#x27;s generally pretty easy to tell which is which, but clearly a lot of people have a much harder time with that.<p>I blame the biblical literalism movement. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything else that has done quite as much damage to Christianity as the insistence that every part of the bible has to be taken as literally as possible. This movement is relatively recent; in the Middle Ages, bible scholars identified 4 levels of interpretation of the bible, of which the literal interpretation was only one, and generally the least important. After the Reformation, everybody had to be able to read the bible (generally a good thing), but that also meant everybody got to interpret it, and some people got a bit carried away.')
