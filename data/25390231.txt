Once the dry brush is gone, it can&#x27;t burn a second time. Just like small pox wiped out all the vulnerable native americans, but then the offspring of the survivors were increasingly more resilient. Except in this case the fatality rate is 1% (or less) instead of 90%.<p>&gt; For one, we don&#x27;t even understand all the long term effects of having COVID as it is: there&#x27;s heart damage, lung damage, brain damage, extended fatigue, and that&#x27;s just what we&#x27;re seeing evidence of now.<p>This just seems like fear of the unknown. On the contrary, for the vast majority of healthy humans, it seems like the immune-system is well equipped to deal with the virus so there isn&#x27;t much reason to fear IMO (i.e. most people recover at home with no modern medicine needed). I have several family members that had it and recovered with seemingly no other long term effects, so there is no reason to believe they are going to be screwed later in life.<p>&gt; If another disease like COVID strikes in a couple years, it could still tear through the surviving population and cause similar long lasting effects.<p>More fear of the unknown. Novel viruses don&#x27;t come along very often. Getting sick is not a bad thing, natural selection is not a bad thing, it&#x27;s the very mechanism that has allowed humans to survive this long on planet earth.')
