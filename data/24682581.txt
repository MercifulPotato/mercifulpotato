Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[24683744], score=None, time=1601848680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682398, text='Imo, there&#x27;s a very big difference between the creation story found in the Pentateuch and Jesus&#x27; teachings in the New Testament. As a Christian I, of course, believe both, but I think that the details of the former are much fuzzier than the latter. So questions like &quot;did God <i>really</i> spend 6 days making the Universe?&quot; are theological red herrings. The point of the Bible is to be reconciled with God through accepting Christ as the one Son of God that died for our sins, was resurrected three days later, and ascended to Heaven. The details of Genesis are certainly interesting <i>theologically</i>, but vigorous debate on them (was God describing evolution? does one day represent a billion years?) isn&#x27;t particularly interesting <i>spiritually</i>, nor does it really help me reconcile my fallen and sinful nature.')
