Playing the &quot;dating&quot; game.  But as time passes, you just stop bothering and the &quot;dating game&quot; becomes just natural interactions.<p>Same with job-seeking, as time passes by I find myself more and more reluctant to &quot;play the game&quot;. To the point that I won&#x27;t proceed with a job process if it requires me to jump those stupid hoops (my 2 last jobs, 3 and 7 years ago I got without a real technical interview, and they were both highly technical). This means that right now jobs that I get will be &quot;limited&quot; to people I know and people who knows me.<p>As a head of engineering, right now I am trying to convince a good friend of mine (and amazing technologist) to join my team. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of putting him through the &quot;normal&quot; that other general candidates go through.')
