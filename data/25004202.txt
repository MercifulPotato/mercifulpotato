A variant would be a sub-launched equivalent of an ASROC: the rocket pops up above the surface, flies toward the target, then drops back in the water and the supercavitating torpedo takes over.  Possible advantage: ships can (perhaps!) shoot down incoming rockets or cruise missiles, but it&#x27;s harder to shoot an incoming torpedo; bullets don&#x27;t travel well underwater.')
