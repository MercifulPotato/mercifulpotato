But I am an advocate for any practices that are simple and resistant to Big Colorful Corporations and their like.<p>The problem that I see with society in general is that many of us have a strange attachment to these services (GMail, Facebook, Github, Youtube, Evernote, whatever) to the extent of outright dependency and diminished wherewithal to try something different, even if it may be to our advantage in the long run.<p>I sympathize with people, such as Mr. DeVault to an extent, who are determined to invite people to alternatives that are not entirely foreign.
