The geo&quot;hot&quot;s of the world, with big egos, who like the publicity, make a rap video and promote &quot;the cause&quot; aggressively. That won&#x27;t ever change but at least they are going into (and also bringing in) more mainstream media and folks. So there&#x27;s that.<p>Something along the line of &quot;there&#x27;s no bad publicity&quot;, because out of the millions of tv watchers and his yt rap video watchers, these brings in a lot of people (at least teens) interested in the scene with a higher percentage of those who remain and go deeper into the technical parts of hacks, then learning about fail0verflow &amp; co.<p>Many only then realized what the big picture actually is (<i>insert podium meme</i>)<p>So, for what it&#x27;s worth, never underestimate how many people REALLY know and appreciate a lot more fail0verflow&#x27;s work. Thanks again!<p>p.s. hopefully PS4 will catch up to the good old days of PS3. Pepperidge Farm remembers. Also that last year there was a pseudo-consensus that held-back PS4 hacks will be released only after the PS5 appears. (<i>help</i>)')
