Soft, they get scratched easily (most of them at least, I know a few types that are scratch-resistant), they show wear and tear in a much more unpleasant way than metal, glass or wood.<p>It&#x27;s a hugely important material but I can&#x27;t imagine ever perceiving plastics, even the higher grade and durable ones, to a premium feeling. I don&#x27;t associate that with brittleness but more with aesthetics and touch feel.')
