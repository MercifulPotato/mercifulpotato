One of the reasons it is sometimes put in quotes, I think, is to distinguish it from the meaning that you&#x27;ve linked.\nA rationalist in that sense is someone who holds the philosophical positions described in that article.\nA rationalist-in-this-other-sense is someone who, uh, generally has beliefs in some other collection of philosophical positions, and is involved in a certain community&#x2F;social-circle . \nIt is an unfortunate overloading of a term.<p>Some have given a definition of rationalist (or rationalist-adjacent) as : Eliezer Yudkowsky is a rationalist, and anyone who spends a lot of time arguing with rationalists is a rationalist.<p>This is quite a different thing that the sense of the word described in the Wikipedia article.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m rather fond of the group, but there are still cases where I find myself using quote marks when describing it.')
