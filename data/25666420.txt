The thing is that in languages like Python you just learn that it cannot be done, or that if you do you are inviting in chaos and the creeping sanity destroying little unreproducible bugs. As a result the development workflows simply avoid ever doing that and pretend like they don&#x27;t miss it. When you actually have the ability to do it, you do it all the time during development and on many other occasions. You don&#x27;t need fancy multiple failover distributed systems in order to keep everything working while you take a node down, you just switch out the class like it was nothing.')
