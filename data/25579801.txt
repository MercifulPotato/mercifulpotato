Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609317387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25571816, text='This whole subthread reminded me of a science fiction story I read several decades ago (late 80s or early 90s, I think) about an agent in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Chocolate.<p>The story centered on an undercover ATFC agent who grew up in Hershey, PA (which gave him some sort of underworld cred) and had infiltrated the Swiss Cartels. As I recall there were some flashbacks about a chocoholic family member or lover that had died which was what set him on a path of self-righteous vengeance, and a raid featuring a showdown with a literally sticky-fingered bad guy. There may have also been a Bond-style femmes-fatale who managed to escape that was a scion of some chocolatier family (Mars, perhaps?). It&#x27;s possible I&#x27;m confabulating some of these details.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to track down this story a few times without success, but it pops back into mind every time I see some mention of the idea of criminalizing sugar vs. decriminalizing other substances, so I thought I&#x27;d mention it on the off chance someone here recognizes it.')
