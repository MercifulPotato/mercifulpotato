Item(by='bhupy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602332662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735348, text='&gt; Yes, some sub indices have gone up, others have gone down. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that _overall_ the CPI has gone up over time. Wages have been having an inverse relationship with prices overall. This is not a case of &quot;prices are cheaper so the wages are less too&quot;.<p>First of all, wages have not universally been in an inverse relationship with price. For example, the <i>median</i> wage has gone up, in real terms, no matter which inflation index you use -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Noahpinion&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307793622369103872" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Noahpinion&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307793622369103872</a><p>Second of all, the minimum wage has absolutely increased in most of the US, via state and local minimum wage laws -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24733559" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24733559</a>. This is reflected in the urban price of food (CPI-U), which is comparatively more sensitive to labor prices, <i>as an input</i>. In other words the argument isn&#x27;t &quot;prices are cheaper so the wages are less too&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;wages are higher, so are the prices&quot;. While you may be correct that the minimum wage increases are not always sufficient to outpace <i>overall CPI</i>, they more than outpace CPI for food (less labor), which is why the CPI for food has moderately increased once you include labor.<p>The goods &amp; services for which CPI has dramatically increased have very little to do with low-wage labor (for now), and the root causes are more sector-specific (zoning, guaranteed loans, lack of price transparency, lack of supply etc)<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re putting in quotes something I didn&#x27;t say.<p>I apologize, I was paraphrasing. That said, that was essentially your assertion: that if markets do actually bring down prices, then the CPI should have fallen. But that presupposes that all goods &amp; services are delivered purely through unfettered markets, which is not the case.<p>&gt; No it&#x27;s true for all employers that would have had to pay a living wage and now don&#x27;t because the middle class will subsidize their labor costs.<p>No matter what, the employer never pays that living wage. It&#x27;s either passed on to the consumer in the form of price increases, or it&#x27;s paid for by society through subsidy.<p>I&#x27;ve found it helpful to visualize what this looks like with a concrete example:<p>Imagine a pizza maker&#x27;s market value is (say) $5&#x2F;hour. They are able to produce (for simplicity&#x27;s sake) 5 pizza&#x27;s per hour, or $1&#x2F;pizza. Including other operating costs + 3-5% profit margin (that&#x27;s the average for most restaurants), let&#x27;s say that the pizza sells for $5. Thus the pizza maker can expect to earn $40&#x2F;day, on the market. Suppose, due to rising rents and healthcare costs, the &quot;livable minimum wage&quot; should be $15&#x2F;hour, or $120&#x2F;day. There are 2 ways to guarantee this:<p>A) The government deposits an extra $80 to the worker, allowing them to make $120 that day. They can buy a pizza for $5, which is about 4% of their daily wage.<p>B) The government mandates a minimum wage of $15&#x2F;hour, which means that the labor portion of the pizza cost goes up from $1 to $3 per pizza (at the same rate of 5 pizzas per hour). The pizza now sells for $7 so that the shop doesn&#x27;t go out of business. The worker makes $120&#x2F;day, and can buy a pizza for $7, which is about 6% of their daily wage.<p>Notice that in (B), the worker is actually worse off, even though they have the same amount of money in their pocket. The worker has to pay a higher percentage of their pay to afford to eat, but this $2 extra means absolutely nothing to a millionaire, it&#x27;s pennies to a rich person. In scenario (A), the worker is better off, and the welfare system that sustains it can be funded through progressive taxes, which targets rich people.')
