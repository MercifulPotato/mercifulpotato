It&#x27;s supposed to be reciprocal but the ESTA is a Visa, it walks, talks and quacks like one. If it&#x27;s denied, there&#x27;s no real recourse and the process is completely opaque...<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s not in the interest of most countries to do that but it&#x27;s really infuriating how something like ESTA was created to abuse the spirit of the reciprocal visa free agreements while sticking to the letter of the agreements.')
