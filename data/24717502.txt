I am a long time linux user and recently brought a gaming laptop which comes pre-installed with Windows 10 Home. I made up my mind to use whatever software came with it rather than installing linux since I don&#x27;t want to mess up with my system too soon. I gave away all my pro-linux biases and gave Windows a honest try. I didn&#x27;t last two days with Windows, main reasons:\n1) Privacy Nightmare: I was not able to login without first creating and logging in to an outlook account. They&#x27;re pushing very aggressively than I&#x27;m comfortable with. And data stealing booby traps are everywhere. On the activities view, it always shows a &quot;Keep more recent activity&quot; button or something like that, which when clicked will send my browsing history to Microsoft servers to sync.\nI didn&#x27;t find any way to completely uninstall edge. It rings similar to Android, we get extremely less control on our own system.\nFor system updates, it will by default send update files to other users in the internet(like torrenting).\n2)Excess data usage: When I was on linux, the data usage is almost null when idle but windows seems to be always downloading something.\n3)Development: WSL2 definitely made Windows a bearable platform for development but I did encounter some problems. Installation was not straight forward, got some errors and fixed it by searching for an hour. There is no intuitive way to open bash in a terminal. Now, I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t search hard enough, but I was unable to setup a Ionic development environment on Windows and failed. That was when I realized windows wasn&#x27;t really for me and switched to PopOS the second day.\nEverything expect the nvidea card worked out of the box, and fixed it after reading a couple of threads on reddit. Battery life reduced by about 1 hour as compared with Windows but I can live with that.\nThe linux operating system and community is awesome, it is much frictionless to develop in linux than to use WSL2 in windows and you get a elegant operating system respecting our privacy than a bloated OS subsidized by data. And linux is free! I really wish linux will be around on desktops for a very long time and thanks to this recent experience, I will dread the day when Windows becomes the only available choice for personal computers.')
