I am an Engineer (the non software type). I work at an industrial plant. We use SAS pretty extensively for data analysis, time series analysis, multivariate regressions etc. As well as for BI type stuff (reports, graphing, adhoc queries).<p>For a while R was being pushed pretty heavily as a SAS alternative. My org paid R training courses etc. I found R and SAS pretty comparable at least the R packages we looked at (dpylr, ggplot2 etc).<p>I know about Python, the programming language I used PyGTK back in the day to build GUI apps. But it would not be my first thought for doing data analysis work. Does Python even offer something like R studio&#x2F; SAS Enterprise Guide and does it have a trending package?')
