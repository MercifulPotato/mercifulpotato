I&#x27;m sympathetic to whatever pain is underlying that, but that doesn&#x27;t make it ok to keep posting like this. Single-purpose accounts are not ok on HN, and such repetition is not in keeping with the site mandate.<p>Readers who encounter any single comment along these lines are naturally going to feel sympathetic, but that can&#x27;t continue past a certain threshold of repetition. In that sense these conversations are illusory. Bringing it up again and again is not helping you, and it&#x27;s damaging this site. Commenting so repetitively, even about a topic like personal pain which obviously matters, is functionally in the same category as spamming or trolling.<p>We banned your previous account that was doing this and asked you to stop. I&#x27;m going to ban this one as well and ask you to please not do this again.<p>I wish you well—I&#x27;m sure we all wish you well—in finding a way out of this into more satisfaction and self-kindness.')
