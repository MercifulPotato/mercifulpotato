I would still be a bit worried myself of a potential ban if I did try to perform such examples (in my parent comment), as the proprietary nature of the platform can make such actions necessary in order to have sufficient control of one&#x27;s data and environment. I do acknowledge how difficult dealing with abuse at-scale can be too, so sometimes unfortunate situations are partially-necessary as compromises here. I do appreciate reassurances that things aren&#x27;t as bad as some may claim though, since Discord is particularly worrying for me wrt the centralization and level of control they will have over the next years&#x2F;decades of the entire online social space.')
