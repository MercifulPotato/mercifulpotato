I&#x27;ve made a system with a similar design (RPI for display and UI, one STM32 for hardware control, another as watchdog) for an industrial marking system, and it&#x27;s run almost daily for 3 years without any issues.<p>The great thing about the Pi in this case is that it&#x27;s non-critical, and if it ever does die, you spend $35 and put in a new SD card.')
