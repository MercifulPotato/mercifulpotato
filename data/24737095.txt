The figure for comes from figure 14. The cost estimates are $3,000 with current technology. This works out to $500 per KWh 20 years system. To match the lifespan of a nuclear plant (typically 60 to 80 years), this works out to $1,500 to $2,000 per KWh when factoring the limited life span of the storage.<p>Regarding the reply with no response, timestamps get more coarse grained the further in the past you get. This reply could easily be weeks after my initial comment, and I would have explained how I arrived at these figures if I has read it.<p>Meanwhile, glaring inaccuracies like calming that existing natural gas infrastructure can be used to transport hydrogen go unmentioned. Or that &quot;hardly anyone is building nuclear&quot; when in fact most of the world by population is. And if we&#x27;re talking about cherry-picking pfdietz incessantly cherry picks the Vogtle and Flamanville plants as though they&#x27;re representative of historic nuclear costs. You arrive at the conclusion that I&#x27;m arguing in bad faith, while conveniently ignoring these issues with the claims I&#x27;m arguing against.<p>This exchange makes me sad, too. Solar and wind serve as useful temporary mitigation of carbon output, even though they don&#x27;t pave a way to full decarbonization. A hydrogen economy has a place to fulfill demand where energy density is necessary, like in transportation. But trying to advocate pipe-dream projects like storing tens of terawatt hours worth of energy in hydrogen really makes me wonder whether solar and wind advocates really have a grasp on the engineering challenges they&#x27;re facing. Especially when these plans rest on outright falsehoods, like the claim that we can using existing natural gas pipes for hydrogen.')
