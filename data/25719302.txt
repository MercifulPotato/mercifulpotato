Instead of fiddling with a bunch of random .service files, you can just do everything in a nix config and have them generated for you. Complex systems involving a bunch of units (services, timers, paths, whatever) can all be in one single place--alongside the service config. You can easily share defaults between units.<p>It&#x27;s so much nicer than doing it ad-hoc.')
