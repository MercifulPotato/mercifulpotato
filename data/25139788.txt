Less staff, less overhead, more customers, and she felt it was a better model for everyone involved.<p>Even before Covid, the sit down restaurant service with it&#x27;s hostess and waiters and 3 course menus seemed to be going the way of the movie theater.  Who has time, who has energy, and who wouldn&#x27;t be just as happy getting Doordash and eating in the comfort of their home and probably watching a movie at the same time? Fewer and fewer people it turns out.')
