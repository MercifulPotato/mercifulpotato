Kind of like its predecessor RIPv1. \nThe idea of publishing or implementing a new routing protocol that doesn&#x27;t have cryptographic verification designed into it as a feature seems like sabotage.<p>My day to day is dealing with the consequences of devops teams  launching low-security infrastructure and then clients wanting to migrate their high-sensitivity data to it, and this Babel spec is precisely the kind of thing that causes that conflict.<p>Sure, build something untrusted that forces people to implement their own security that is at a level sufficient for themselves. I understand that as a reasonable design principle, but perhaps I have been out of the game too long, as seeing how these things play out, it&#x27;s not clear how a routing protocol without at least signed updates is a good idea.')
