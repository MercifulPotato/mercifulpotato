Cameron - core to the show - got more distant, vague and poorly constructed with each season. The first season was gritty, tense, down to the metal. The rest of the seasons were good, not great, and weakened as each season went by. The last season was nearly mailed-in as far as story goes. It&#x27;s like the writers were zooming out season by season and by the last season everything was distant, like watching cardboard cutouts of the characters from a great distance.')
