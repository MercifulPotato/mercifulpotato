It&#x27;s all pretty basic still though...<p>I don&#x27;t want this thing cluttered up with a bunch of bullshit. This is why I really want access to make more modifications to it more easily. That said, I poked around the OS a bit and have access to root, so it stands to reason hacking on this thing isn&#x27;t insanely restrictive already.
