They acquired the StrongARM line from Digital Equipment and evolved it into the XScale line.  What Intel didn&#x27;t want was for something to eat into it&#x27;s x86 market, and Windows&#x2F;ARM didn&#x27;t exist.  So they evolved ARM in a different direction than Apple later did.  It was very successful in the high-performance embedded market.')
