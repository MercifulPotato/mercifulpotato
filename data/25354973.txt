There&#x27;s concurrent hashes and lists, and full threading support. But currently it&#x27;s on the programmer to not mess up the GC on shared data (eg ensure data graphs are isolated, but it&#x27;s not too tricky). I use the ESP32&#x27;s shared queue data structure in the esp-idf to move Nim&#x27;s native JSON types between FreeRTOS tasks. It&#x27;s non-copying and more efficient than normal message passing. I also use some shared globals. It all works pretty well.')
