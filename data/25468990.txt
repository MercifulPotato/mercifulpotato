I&#x27;ve worked in a mobile game shop before and seen how pushing ends up with devs getting burnt out.  They&#x27;ve been pushing now for years, probably since the very beginning.  That kind of thing will just grind everyone to a crawl and if it doesn&#x27;t ever let up then your team will just be crawling forever.  You have to let people get into the rhythm of development and the key is setting reasonable expectations of your team based on what you know that rhythm to be.  All the hype here, all the pressure to put out a great game, can be detrimental to development without proper leadership filtering&#x2F;framing it.')
