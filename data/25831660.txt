The same applies to every\nother single individual.<p>At the same time the internet obviously doesn&#x27;t only contain\n&quot;dopamine chasing snippets of BS&quot;. Online discussions and\narticles can improve critical thinking or make someone think\ndeeper about their views and motivation just like literature\ncan. Yet you deny that by bluntly saying all people reading no\nbooks are illiterate.<p>As a side note, before you start gatekeeping literacy you may\nwant to avoid grammar mistakes in your own writing. Though it will not\nmake your point come across less elitist, unfortunately.')
