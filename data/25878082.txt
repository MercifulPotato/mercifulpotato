If you don&#x27;t like that word, then how about I&#x27;ll rephase.  So how about this: &quot;You did not provide any examples of a major leftist government that did not go horrible wrong, and have lots of problems.&quot;<p>&gt; I&#x27;m making stuff up<p>By  &quot;making stuff up&quot;, I was saying that you were not referencing actual examples that I can look at, that exist in the real world, and are instead talking about hypotheticals that do not reflect how those hypotheticals exist in the real world.<p>&gt;  to this very moment: the UK, France, the Western world in general<p>And I am going to say that I would much rather live in any of these countries, than any real life examples of leftist governments.<p>Based on that, and based on comparing real world examples, I am going to say that I would deal with less problems by living in a western country.<p>&gt; My proto-ideal society  did exist, and fragments of it still remain. But then the British came.<p>Sounds like your ideal society didn&#x27;t work out so great then and has a lot of horrible problems.  If all the leftist governments implode because they can&#x27;t defend themselves, then it sounds like that is a pretty big problem, and I would never want to live in such a society.<p>&gt;  Much like right-wing economics was doomed<p>Well at least it is a lot better to live in than the alternative leftist governments! I would still much prefer living in the right wing economies than in any of the leftist ones.')
