Until you can prove that tunneling happens with chairs or find the interference pattern of bowling balls, the possibility that there is some other phenomenon that we currently don&#x27;t understand remains open.<p>You may prefer to believe that quantum rules apply to the macroscopic universe, and that is a valid possibility. Superdeterminism is another possibility that can&#x27;t be discounted. Perhaps wave function collapse is a physical phenomenon. There are other possibilities, and currently no way to choose between them, so just claiming that one of them is true doesn&#x27;t make it right.<p>Not to mention that QM and GR can&#x27;t both be true, so we know for sure that at least one of them has some flaw. Most believe that the flaw is with GR, but the possibility that QM is falwed remains there.')
