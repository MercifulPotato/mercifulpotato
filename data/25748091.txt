That&#x27;s where my ssh keys will reside. This will run qubes or maybe NixOS. Not sure yet.<p>The Mac will be left for casual daily use, development (but no production keys), graphics design, fun, general browsing, chat, and whatnot.<p>I&#x27;m still in the process of splitting all my tasks into what should be secure and what shouldn&#x27;t.<p>A nice side effect is that I won&#x27;t be just as afraid of running a random &quot;brew install&quot; or install an app to check it out, since the Mac is anyway going to be low-security.<p>Of course it&#x27;s annoying to carry around two laptops, but completely switching to Linux just means I won&#x27;t make it happen.
