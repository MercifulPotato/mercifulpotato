What I do is (in the case of 1-bit) just let the grey value (from 0.0=black to 1.0=white) determine the probability that the pixel is on or off, and render pseudorandom numbers according to those probabilities. In the case of 4-bit greyscale I do the same but within 16 bins.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to the methods in the article but maybe I can test this sometime.')
