Much of genetics isn’t amenable to this kind of ML, because it isn’t some kind of optimisation problem. And many other parts don’t require ML because they can be modelled very closely using exact methods. ML <i>does</i> get used here, and sometimes to great effect (e.g. DeepVariant, which often outperforms other methods, but not by much — not because DeepVariant isn’t good, but rather because we have very efficient approximations to the exact solution).')
