(Hint: you have to build the infrastructure first, and not all of these are even practical everywhere.) Hydrogen isn’t all that practical as a fuel, and biomass just puts CO2 back into the atmosphere.<p>Can you think of a renewable source of energy that’s both attractive to poor and developing countries, and also practical?<p>Oil is easy. You put it in a tank, then pump it through an atomizer, and set it on fire. You can transport it easily, it works anywhere, and you can run a car on it. I know, electric cars are a thing, but not in the places I’m talking about here.<p>Electrical transmission across long distances, and, especially between different countries with different power grids is a nightmare.<p>What am I missing here?')
