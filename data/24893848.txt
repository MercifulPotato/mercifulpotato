First sentence: A Monad is an endofunctor (a functor mapping a category to itself), together with two natural transformations required to fulfill certain coherence conditions. Easy.<p>Knowing a bit of programming, but not much Haskell, reading the entry for Monad (functional programming) or any blog post titled &quot;A Monad is like a ...&quot;, it almost seems as if the author is more confused about what a Monad is than me. The first sentences of the Wikipedia article for example are a word-salad. With dressing.<p>From an outsider&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s almost as if a monad in functional programming is not a 1:1 translation of the straightforward definition of category theory, leading to an overall sense of confusion.')
