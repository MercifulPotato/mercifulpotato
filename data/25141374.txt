I&#x27;d push back on the idea that prizes should be used for treatments like side-effect free drugs to reverse baldness, because the market for that is large enough that even in a regime without patents, R&amp;D costs can be recuperated. There&#x27;s just so much revenue to be had there.<p>The real value of medical patents (and this is something we&#x27;ve strayed far from) is in incentivizing expensive R&amp;D for ultra-rare diseases. There are diseases that afflict &lt; 1% of the population, there&#x27;s hardly any revenue to be made in serving that customer base, especially relative to the R&amp;D input necessary. It&#x27;s stuff like that which can really benefit from prizes. It also presupposes that the prize-awarding authority knows which types of R&amp;D fall under that bucket and which do not, and you get into a quasi-central-planning territory, but that holds true even in a world where pharma patents were only awarded to inventors of such rare-disease drugs.')
