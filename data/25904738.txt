Like using an EEG to measure brain signals and transform them into instructions, images, etc. Here&#x27;s some research where they use the EEG to train a model that reconstructs what people are seeing in their visual cortex [0]<p>All the reconstructions are super low resolution, but I wonder how much better they can get? I&#x27;d be much more open to brain-computer interfaces if it didn&#x27;t involve drilling through my skull.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scitechdaily.com&#x2F;image-reconstruction-from-human-brain-waves-in-real-time-video&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scitechdaily.com&#x2F;image-reconstruction-from-human-bra...</a>')
