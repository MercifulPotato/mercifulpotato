I&#x27;m not sure if this problem is physical, but as a formerly-obese person I can state with confidence that I still don&#x27;t quite know when I&#x27;ve eaten enough. There is no feeling of &quot;full&quot; for me; just pain vs. no pain.<p>&quot;Experience coupling&quot; examples…<p>* Feeling the need to eat popcorn while watching a movie<p>* Feeling the need to eat peanuts, hot dogs, and beer at a baseball game<p>* Feeling the need to meet with friends at restaurants, coffee shops, etc.<p>* Feeling the need to eat cereal by the fistful when trying to work through a tough algorithm (&lt;-- personal anecdote)<p>* Feeling the need to snack on road-trips')
