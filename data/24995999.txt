Item(by='rurban', descendants=None, kids=[24996818], score=None, time=1604556022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24987040, text='I stepped out of a formal architectural university degree, because I already worked as architect at the best architectural office in our country, and then founded a big architectural company, which did much more than just architecture. We did also civil engineering, software, visualization, vr, ai, modelling, surveying, city planning, and theatre stage design and movies. The university education  was really nothing compared to practical experience. At the end I tought at 3 universities for about 10 years, without any formal degree.\nNot dropout or autodidacts, just getting a better education in the industry. In our case we founded new fields.<p>Much more interesting was then when we founded an internet provider, became the largest independent provider in our country, then I switched to journalism and to automotive engineering (pretty successful), and then back to sole SW engineering, which is the most interesting in the end.<p>Several other architecture friends also had similar wild careers. One also did F1 engine design, and the provider startup consisted of 3 ex-architects. Architects are generalists, they can do everything. Literally.')
