Item(by='SahAssar', descendants=None, kids=[24817308], score=None, time=1603021758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24816376, text='Since it wraps existing browsers (chromium&#x2F;safari&#x2F;electron&#x2F;webkit) is it really fair to not say that in the readme? Sure it mentions that you should install them under &quot;quickstart&quot;, but all the other parts compare itself directly against other browsers when this really seems to fill more of a &quot;plugin-like&quot; role than a full browser.<p>Also, when doing readme&#x27;s for ambitious projects it&#x27;s probably best to mark what features are complete and which ones are just planned.<p>Right now it looks like the whole V-lang debacle IMO with lots of features promised and no way to know what is implemented and not, while wrapping other projects without acknowledging it.')
