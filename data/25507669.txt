Others will notice and change the way they interact with you accordingly.<p>For example, with a few exceptions, I don&#x27;t answer emails on weekends. It only takes one or two weekends for someone to realize this, and either stop emailing me on weekends or learn to not expect an answer until Monday.<p>As another example, if an important request, decision, or question is sent to me on Slack or text, I kindly ask them to send it to me by email. A few instances of this and people figure it out. This is, I think, a much more friendly way of changing people&#x27;s behavior than pointing them to a user guide.')
