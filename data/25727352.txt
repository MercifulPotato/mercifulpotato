I enjoyed pretty graphics and seeing buildings being slowly constructed.<p>Its interesting how games improved over time. I am not sure that even now I would fully learn how to play it without the manual. Some of the features are quite hidden and some are simply a pictogram that you need to know what it means to know what it means :)<p>But I am not really criticizing the UI after-all they did so much with so few pixels.')
