Some basic SaaS analytics&#x2F;metrics products don&#x27;t offer this functionality but it can be a hassle even with the ones that do. The accuracy will always depend on clean invoicing hygiene when the invoices are created.<p>e.g. if you create a subscription in Stripe and have modeled it properly using products, prices, etc... then the metadata for revenue recognition will be available but if you generate an invoice and write &quot;Annual subscription 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;21 - 12&#x2F;31&#x2F;21&quot; as the line item description then every tool will recognize that amount in full on the invoice date.<p>Revenue recognition might be a separate add-on for ChartMogul but I think they can do it. Chargebee and Recurly also do subscription management and maintain revenue recognition reports. Stripe semi-recently added revenue recognition to the billing dashboard. Some companies build a waterfall schedule in Excel then manually record revenue every month.')
