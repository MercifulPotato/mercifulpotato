Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605976947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169666, text='&gt; There&#x27;s a kind of arrogance that we fall into making decisions for others when we design APIs, library interfaces, etc where we know what we&#x27;re exposing and users don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for them. Maybe that&#x27;s right sometimes, i don&#x27;t know?<p>Usually it&#x27;s right, and at least you&#x27;re putting thought into it. API design is <i>not</i> easy, hence why it gets fucked up so often.<p>I just went through explaining to someone why they shouldn&#x27;t go pawing through &#x2F;proc to find details on a running process. How there were commands like &#x27;strace&#x27; and &#x27;lsof&#x27;, or even running a debugger that could better achieve their goals. Often people <i>just aren&#x27;t aware</i>.<p>The option to bypass layers of abstraction should be there, but the option should be off by default, and come with plenty of warnings akin to &quot;if you&#x27;re removing the cylinder head, we assume you know what you&#x27;re doing, and you assume all responsibility.&quot;<p>Other databases already bypass the kernel routinely; I&#x27;m reminded of Oracle which could use a partition or even whole disk directly. And yes, I know SQLite is not like other databases; that&#x27;s why it gets tricky.<p>Honestly, the stuff they lay out is the kind of customer requests I <i>dream</i> of getting. I would <i>gladly</i> implement these, where they don&#x27;t break backwards compatibility, and where they are off by default but can be turned on, in a fashion where it doesn&#x27;t upset&#x2F;surprise&#x2F;break currently majority usage.')
