User mode like WINE is the correct approach on Linux.<p>It&#x27;s pretty wild that Microsoft actually managed to reactivate the subsystem concept for (first generation) WSL after it had been dormant as an 1:1 boundary for so many iterations of Windows and even wilder how quickly (and elegantly) they switched to a completely different abstraction for WSL2. This switch was mostly motivated by cross-environment filesystem performance afaik, so it might be perfectly reasonable to take the other approach (an actual NT level subsystem) for the android use case: the guest apps won&#x27;t do much file I&#x2F;O outside of the subsystem&#x27;s dedicated playground because of how Android is discouraging free-form filesystem use.')
