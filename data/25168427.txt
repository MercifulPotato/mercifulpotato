One day we received PCs with Windows 1.3 (if I recall correctly). We were supposed to develop education software, but I was not too much impressed with Windows at that time. And we received no training at all on Windows programming. I looked at a famed book of the time on Windows (Petzold) and it it looked far more complicated to program on Windows than to program on DOS. And there was competition, for example GEM the Graphics Environment Manager looked much more polished than Windows.<p>And it seemed to my younger self that the perspective of writing software like a monk, on an subpar platform, was not very attractive.<p>If I look back, I am not sure it was a mistake, my colleagues were treated by managers as a cheap disposable resource. From their perspective it was logical, Windows was cheap so people were buying Windows would not invest much, the only business model was to use cheap labor and mass market.')
