I&#x27;ve consumed cannabis over the past decade varying degrees of regularly, typically in cycles of a few months of daily usage followed by a few months of very infrequent usage.<p>I&#x27;ve found when I am in a daily usage phase, I am overall more lethargic, less motivated at work, less motivated at fitness, and less motivated to go on dates. These problems don&#x27;t entirely clear up when I am outside of a daily usage phase, but progress made in those areas tends to erode. This doesn&#x27;t dramatically affect my life, I am certainly functional and overall productive at work and in my social life, but at the same time the findings make sense to me.')
