In my experience it&#x27;s takes an order of magnitude longer to change a representation than to change code. Once there are multiple services&#x2F;tools which works with a representation you typically have to support both the new and the old representation at the same time (since you can&#x27;t rollout everything simultaneously).<p>&gt; Compromising the consistency and maintainability of the current design to accommodate a hypothetical future requirement change is a bad trade-off IMHO<p>Designing a representation which can handle possible requirement changes does not necessarily mean &quot;compromising the consistency and maintainability&quot;. We have great tools for ensuring consistency (e.g. transactions and constraints in SQL databases), and I don&#x27;t exactly see how this new representation is more &quot;maintainable&quot; than the old one (although we don&#x27;t have all the information in this article).')
