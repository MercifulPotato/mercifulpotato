That&#x27;s probably what you want to use and the Windows apps I&#x27;ve made have been a pleasure to work with, especially due to their hot reloading and design tools.<p>For &quot;Store&quot; apps, you would be using UWP, which are the &quot;modern UI&quot; apps you see when you use Windows 10. These can run on any Windows 10 version and Xbox One+.\nYou can also make that style of app with WPF by theming it though.<p>Xamarin is now mostly used for mobile .NET development, but I really can&#x27;t recommend it nowadays as there&#x27;s a lot of cruft and documentation, in comparison to the stellar work MS has been doing, is quite lacking. If you <i>need</i> to reuse .NET code in your mobile apps, it&#x27;s there as a way for you to do that.')
