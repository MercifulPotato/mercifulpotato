We just happen to live in a relatively peaceful time. Not too long ago, constant war and fighting for territory was all there was, and there wasn&#x27;t a square mile on planet earth that blood hasn&#x27;t been spilt for.<p>Twitter is a monopoly and has an outsized influence on politics and news today, beyond any media force in history, perhaps. They&#x27;re protected by arbitrary legislation from the 90s that prevents them from being held accountable for false or defamatory statements from getting published and shared on their platform.<p>The whole impetus from that protection was to promote free speech. Instead, Twitter has chosen to arbitrarily and selectively mute, shadow ban, lock out, and silence those who they disagree with. I think if they are benefitting from 230 protection, they should not be allowed to engage in this kind of manipulation. Or they should be forced to federate their service with other platforms.<p>With Twitter, individual contributors can spend a decade building up a following of tens of thousands to millions of users, and then with a click, Twitter can take that away. I mean, I&#x27;m old enough to remember when we got the right to keep your phone number passed so that you can keep your number when you switch cell phone carriers. That sort of thing does not exist in social media. If I switch platforms, I lose my ability to communicate with my connections.  That&#x27;s a problem. That should be legislated away.')
