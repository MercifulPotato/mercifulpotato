He&#x27;s avoiding things like:<p>Is abortion a good thing or not?\nShould the government (and by extension people who don&#x27;t support it) be paying for it?\nShould the government treat it as neutral - there are a raft of instances where we let people make decisions but we absolutely let government push a desired outcome.  Don&#x27;t smoke.  Get exercise.  Have kids.  Get married.  Don&#x27;t be a bigot.  Be patriotic.<p>The annoying thing to me is that virtually everyone agrees that there&#x27;s a space short of government dictating that abortions don&#x27;t happen and not caring at all if they happen.
