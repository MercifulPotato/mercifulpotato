But you name the lambda, not the generic function. There is a huge value in using a standardized vocabulary. Even in English, we get value out of &quot;baby&quot; versus &quot;small human between the age of 0 and 2 years&quot;)<p>More generally, I&#x27;ve seen this kind of thinking before. A programmer discovers some &quot;universal truth&quot; which applied well in some context and they get so obsessed with it that they start applying it everywhere. Please, stop and think before you overcommit to such ideas. They are not nearly as universal as they seem - caveats apply. If you ignore those caveats, your fellow team mates will suffer - so check with them frequently too. At the end of the day it doesn&#x27;t matter what you think about your own code&#x27;s readability, but what others think.')
