If the co-founder is just doing this as a strategic move, expecting things are going to become quite valuable soon and considering the 10% cliff it may be that if their strategy does not work they will not have any problem continuing the partnership - although if that is the case I would (when things became profitable&#x2F; much improved) negotiate for some kind of exit because obviously the co-founder is not trustworthy.')
