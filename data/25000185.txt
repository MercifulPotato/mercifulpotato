That&#x27;s insufferable and why minorities, etc. are voting against them.<p>No one likes being told they&#x27;re irredeemable and need to repent.<p>And insofar as &quot;the liberals&quot; can&#x27;t introspect, they&#x27;re not considering that they&#x27;re deluding themselves into thinking they represent the working class when they largely represent the affluent, educated people who know the intricate socially profitable phrases to say among their conformist city friends.<p>So basically - are liberals so infallible that &quot;disagreeing with liberals&quot; means you&#x27;re socially conservative? Hogwash!')
