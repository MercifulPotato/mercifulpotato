This doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me in Chrome, but maybe it&#x27;s just me. Works in Firefox and Safari.<p>Edit: Nevermind, I tried again and it did begin to run before the tab closed abruptly. Tried again in an incognito window and it worked, and it also worked in a regular Chrome window with only one tab. Tried to run it in a second tab in that same window and the tab instantly closed again. Anyone know why this might be the case?<p>Second edit: While it doesn&#x27;t run in regular Chrome windows with multiple tabs, it does run in Incognito windows with multiple tabs. I don&#x27;t think I have the expertise to dig further though.')
