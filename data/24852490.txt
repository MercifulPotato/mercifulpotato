But by necessity the bitcoin vendors will have to deal with it as a prime scenario, which means they&#x27;ll either have to offer a meaningful user identification story (i.e. KYC or similar protocols) or offer a settlement period before the bitcoin is available -- credit the customer&#x27;s account, but don&#x27;t let them withdraw for 30 days &#x2F; 90 days &#x2F; whatever.<p>This requires that the vendor take on some risk (because if they make the trade and the price moves but the trade is cancelled due to chargeback the price may have moved) and they have to price this in to the deal; maybe charging a premium for using PayPal, etc. This is all fairly standard and Coinbase, for example, had to deal with a ton of this when they accepted credit card purchases.<p>But there&#x27;s no risk to PayPal.')
