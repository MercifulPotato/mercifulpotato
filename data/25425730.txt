I still play music today and my only regret is not spending more time on it earlier, whereas I regret spending so much time on video games. The collaboration and shareability of music is unparalleled; I can connect with people and actually create something that is an expression of myself and my collaborators, and even people who&#x27;ve never picked up an instrument can appreciate pleasant-sounding music. With video games, you really need to know the mechanics of a specific game to appreciate someone else&#x27;s performance, and very rarely do the results of a video game manifest itself in the real world apart from the consequential skills you may pick up.<p>The problem of quitting music once it&#x27;s no longer compulsory is endemic and I think more rooted with pedagogy than music itself as a medium. I staved it off because I was largely self-taught for theory and the instruments I currently play (piano, guitar), whereas people who were forced into lessons or only did it to fill an elective slot in school quit once they were able to. I&#x27;ve gone months-long stints without dedicated practice, but to me it&#x27;s closer to an unforgettable skill than riding a bike is (because I don&#x27;t know how to ride a bike).')
