California SUPPORTS AND BUILDS the nascent market space from subsidizing Solar, Energy Storage and yes Electric Vehicles.  I know it isn&#x27;t cool to defend the government they are the ultimate boogeyman but like FFS they provide so many critical parts of our economy and, in progressive states like CA, help nascent industries get a footing.  Without them, frankly, Tesla and SolarCity wouldn&#x27;t be where they are.  Prove me wrong with intelligible arguments.<p>&quot;&quot;It’s hard to find a total dollar amount of California’s subsidies for Tesla, but the subsidies have been thick and fast. Until this year, the state government covered $7,500 of every Tesla bought in the state. The Tesla factory applied for and qualified for plenty of tax breaks.<p>Early on, it got $612 million in tax breaks from California, according to Green Car Reports.<p>The federal government also subsidized the factory in question. Musk was a major donor to and fundraiser for Barack Obama. Obama’s administration issued a $465 million loan to help Musk’s company, Tesla, build the Fremont factory that would build components for all-electric cars. (Tesla has since repaid the loan, according to the Energy Department.)&quot;&quot;.')
