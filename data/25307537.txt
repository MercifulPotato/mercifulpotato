This fell along party lines, and it won&#x27;t come up in the Senate because it&#x27;s controlled by the party that opposes it.<p>That party has the overwhelming favor of its constituency. They lost the top spot, but largely held their own in legislative elections. They may have a large contingent of people who would be in favor of decriminalization, but they don&#x27;t seem to mind that their party obstructs it. Meantime, they have a constituency who is bitterly opposed to legalization, so they get to rule the day.<p>It&#x27;s a discussion that needs to be held within that party. They won&#x27;t listen to anybody from outside. They&#x27;ve made their bargain about a slate of issues they care about and issues they&#x27;re willing to sacrifice.')
