Most businesses that are large enough to have systemic problems have enormous resources to litigate against those claims.<p>In contrast, for employees to collect and use evidence, it is required that they:\n a) experience the abuse or discrimination, repeatedly\n b) collect evidence and documentation of that behaviour\n c) exfiltrate that evidence in contravention of legal contracts that can include NDAs, binding arbitration clauses, morality&#x2F;non desparagement clauses, etc\n d) be in a strong enough financial position to defend against litigation\n e) be confident enough in their own skills, reputation, and network to be able to give up future career prospects based on A-D.<p>And this is just from the 5 minutes it took me to compose this message.<p>I get that HN is a bastion of support for meritocracy, and that founder worship is a strong bias for many on this forum, but as a community, and as an industry we have got to stop undermining and destroying the folks trying to hold people and firms accountable for bad behavior.')
