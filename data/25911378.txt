Extremely heated subjects do not lead to positive results here or anywhere. The only way to win as a person is not to play the game despite the very strong temptation.<p>I agree, and the oblique War Games reference is appreciated.<p>&gt; Do you believe all opinions and expressions of those opinions are equally valuable and require equal advertisement?<p>(Who <i>would</i> believe such a thing? Well, I guess there was the FCC Fairness Doctrine, but fortunately that&#x27;s gone.)<p>Of course not all opinions are equally valuable, but an echo chamber of people parroting the party line also has no value. In fact, that has negative value to me; I&#x27;d prefer a cacophony of divergent opinions to a single narrative.<p>I&#x27;d just like to see the top 10 or 20 comments instead of the top single comment.')
