Like TOTP, it can be proxied through as there&#x27;s no challenge that includes signing the website name like FIDO. Also.. The Yubico OTP feature types using QWERTY with letters and no numbers. As I use dvorak, this resulted in considerable confusion as two yubikeys behaved the same.<p>Interestingly, copying the credentials between Yubikeys will not result in an accepted yubikey OTP. The serial seems to be used somewhere in the calculation.<p>A yubikey, using the CLI tool, can have TOTP credentials stored inside. This can be used in conjunction with grep and sed for any CLI scripts that may interactively request a TOTP.')
