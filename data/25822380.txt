Truly ejected me out of my worldview.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bullshit_Jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bullshit_Jobs</a><p>Previously, a HN commentator shared the distinction between &quot;doing&quot; and &quot;justifying&quot; work (IIRC). I <i>really</i> like this framing, dichotomy. And would like to synthesize with Graeber&#x27;s thesis.<p>Another interesting contemporary view is Scott Adams&#x27; &quot;confusopoly&quot;. I have a few other issues with Adams; I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get out of bed every day if I shared his bleak view of humanity. But I can&#x27;t deny that he does have some very penetrating insights<p>BS Jobs and confusopoly are complimentary. Young idealistic me always equated capitalism with producing stuff efficiently for profit, and the sharing of that surplus. The kids today use terms like &quot;late stage capitalism&quot;. Graeber examines financialization leading to managerialism, aka rent seeking. My rephrasing is the point is to maximize inefficiency to better transfer wealth to the management.<p>Apologies for this stream of conscious ideation. I&#x27;m still chewing on these concepts, insights.<p>Meanwhile, I sympathize with your situation and hope things improve, for everyone.')
