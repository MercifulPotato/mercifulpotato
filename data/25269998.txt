This is why they have a small battery life, as you mention, and didn&#x27;t even have an always on display until S5. Neither of these are technological constraints, since the Pebble had 7 day battery life with an always on display from the first version.<p>Now, the Apple Watch has sold well, so maybe it&#x27;s a fine tradeoff to make. But I think this &quot;high-end&quot; constraint has definitely shaped the product (and in a way I think is worse when viewed as a watch first).')
