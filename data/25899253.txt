The world is obviously not going to go from purely human driven to 100% autonomous overnight.  There will be an intermediate phase where initially some few cars will be autonomous and privately owned, and for those owners making use of the car&#x27;s full lifetime to serve as a taxi would be a no-brainer.  It could pay off your (very expensive) Tesla in the matter of a year or two.<p><i>After</i> the market for on-demand autonomous taxis is oversaturated, Tesla&#x27;s plan is actually to stop selling vehicles altogether, or reduce it drastically.  Musk has said that FSD vehicles will likely not be for sale after this point, so the &quot;consumer-operated robotaxi&quot; is inherently an intermediate solution.<p>Vehicle ownership will drastically change in nature after the advent of AVs.  Tesla isn&#x27;t going to be unique to having to adapt to this.')
