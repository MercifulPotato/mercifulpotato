What I&#x27;m surprised at is the 99.99% uptime - I thought given their foray into telecoms they&#x27;d be offering some very complex cluster-driven solution to go higher on uptime.<p>My guess is this is a way to commercialize their snap packages and auto updates (plus reboot-less kernel updates) in an market where the alternative would be to hire sysadmins, and therefore they benchmark their pricing on that basis.
