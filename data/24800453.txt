It&#x27;s like people complaining that the GPL is &quot;viral&quot;. That&#x27;s the whole point of it. Companies that don&#x27;t want to re-contribute their source changes are dissuaded from using it at all.<p>If you put an attribution clause in the license, the companies that don&#x27;t touch your code is the company you never wanted to use your code at all. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. You can&#x27;t say &quot;I need the exposure so I use a totally permissive license&quot; and then say &quot;Oh but I actually want attribution in a way that if people knew about this requirement, wouldn&#x27;t use it to begin with&quot;')
