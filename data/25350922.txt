This seller is almost certainly lying about who made it, and you can get them banned for this kind of activity.<p>My business is a dropshipper for artists that sell custom-print apparel on Etsy and Shopify. This sort of thing is allowed on Etsy, but we&#x27;re careful to create the listings in a way that Etsy approves. Etsy sells a lot of tshirts.')
