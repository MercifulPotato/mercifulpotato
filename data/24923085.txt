There is frequently only 1 gas station, 1 grocery store, etc that all sell things for reasonable prices.<p>For a completely different style, the major airport in Rome (da Vinci) is owned by a private company yet they don’t do any goofy shit to jack up landing fees.<p>There are many rural places in the US where there is only coverage from one cell phone provider and the rates remain the same.<p>&gt; The government does this with the addition of heavy regulation specifically to prevent abuse that comes from having monopolistic control of a market.<p>No, they have to add the regulation because of the abuse that comes from a <i>government granted</i> monopoly. Monopolies emerge all of the time in all kinds of markets and they are not indications of failures. They can indicate that consumers are happy enough or that the margin is thin enough that competitors aren’t needed.<p>A government guaranteeing that a competitor can’t exist is when monopolies become ripe for abuse. That’s why government granted monopolies need regulation.')
