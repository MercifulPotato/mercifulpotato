Item(by='vilhelm_s', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609273056, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570097, text='In an ideal frictionless gas (zero viscosity), the flow after the object has passed through will be identical to the flow before the object, so in that sense the air moves &quot;seamlessly&quot; around the object. But during this process, the pressure of the gas still changes. You can think of this as just newton&#x27;s second law: in order to change the velocity of an air packet, you must apply a force to it, and pressure is just force per area. So any time a gas flows in anything other than a straight line, you know that there was a pressure gradient involved and the pressure was not constant.<p>It&#x27;s a common example in fluid mechanics textbooks to derive the flow of a zero-viscosity gas around a cylinder, you can get an exact solution e.g. here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brennen.caltech.edu&#x2F;fluidbook&#x2F;basicfluiddynamics&#x2F;potentialflow&#x2F;singularities&#x2F;cylinder.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brennen.caltech.edu&#x2F;fluidbook&#x2F;basicfluiddynamics&#x2F;pote...</a> . Note that in this example there is no drag, but there are two zones of high pressure in front of and behind the cylinder. Those zones would have higher-than-ambient temperature.')
