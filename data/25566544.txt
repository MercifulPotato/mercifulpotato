Is there some fundamental reason why a resistor would be harder to cool appropriately (low thermal conductivity comes to mind, though I&#x27;m pretty sure there are high performance ceramics used for both brakes and resistors -- my heuristics aren&#x27;t really good enough to make a good guess for this one)?')
