The search engine maximizes expected utility when serving ads: argmax(predicted-click-through-rate * cost-per-click).  That&#x27;s the only rational thing to ask for from an advertising network, and it&#x27;s what the advertiser optimizes for as well by running the ad auction in the first place.  It doesn&#x27;t matter who computes the ad-quality score (the predictor of click-through rate); rational actors with sufficient information will agree on the value.<p>One could artificially prevent the search engine from e.g. sending keywords and viewer profiles to the ad network, but that is a completely separate regulatory approach from monopoly-busting.<p>While we&#x27;re stumbling around the regulatory possibility landscape why not just ban advertising altogether?  It&#x27;s a ~1% drain on the economy that people who know better go out of their way to block.')
