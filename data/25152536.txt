It turns out that I can have everything delivered, and my risk is essentially 0.  I&#x27;m going to wait it out until there&#x27;s a vaccine.  If the numbers dip very low in my area, I might try to squeeze in a doctor and dentist visit.  I&#x27;m not immunocompromised, but it&#x27;s not that hard to live as if I was.  I&#x27;m considering this whole thing a bit of an experiment to see how self-sufficient I can be.<p>Conversely, I have coworkers that are traveling all over the country (wearing masks), and staying at cheap airbnb&#x27;s.  Some are relocating because of the changing housing market.  If you don&#x27;t mind taking on a minimal amount of risk, you can get a lot of good deals on flights&#x2F;hotels&#x2F;airbnbs&#x2F;apartments&#x2F;etc right now.  Personally, even a little risk isn&#x27;t worth it when I know there&#x27;s 95% effective vaccine being manufactured.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s obvious that we&#x27;ll never get rid of COVID-19 entirely as a disease.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll become a disease only for the people that believe in &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;anti-vax&quot;.')
