There I see how a layer to manage several nodes starts making sense. But when you&#x27;re managing a single server, you already have a standardized API to deploy standardized packages (APT&#x2F;YUM + SystemD probably). It&#x27;s just a different one. Of course when you deviate from that it starts getting messy, but that happens with everything.')
