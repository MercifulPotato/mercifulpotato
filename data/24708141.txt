So there&#x27;s a factor of ~3 that you get back in that comparison. So the more comparable number is more like 3-4%. Still very low of course. The electric motors are also lighter than what creates equivalent power for gasoline so there&#x27;s another small amount you recover there. ~5% is probably reasonable.')
