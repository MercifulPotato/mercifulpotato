I don&#x27;t carry a gun because I fear others have guns at all.  You all seem to think that a gun is the only way that someone can hurt you. When I was a younger man I was the victim of an attempted car-jacking. Fortunately quick thinking got me out of that situation.  Regardless of whether this individual attempting to steal my car with me in it had a gun or not, he was physically larger than me and would have caused me harm (I did not grow up learning to fight.)<p>The idea of other people having guns is not the primary reason I carry. I&#x27;m happy for you that you never felt the need to carry a gun.  I&#x27;d rather have one and not need it than need it and not have one.  I respect your opinion, but the fact is we all have different, valid life experiences that affect our behavior and actions. I feel safe not carrying (I don&#x27;t live in a warzone,) but I feel much safer carrying when and where I can lawfully do so.')
