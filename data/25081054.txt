So essentially, the tunnel needs to behave like a switch would.<p>Edit: Obviously, it still reacts doubly as bad to the base connection dropping packets. I recall testing once how a TCP connection behaves when you subject it to a random % of packet loss (regardless of bandwidth it tries to use), and it resulted in completely stalled connections at a surprisingly low drop rates.<p>Edit2: In case anyone wants to try themselves, here&#x27;s how: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pico.net&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-can-i-simulate-delayed-and-dropped-packets-in-linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pico.net&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-can-i-simulate-delayed-and-dropp...</a>')
