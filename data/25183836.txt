Once you have disagreement, especially widespread disagreement, the political nature becomes clear.  For instance, take the idea of marriage only being between a man and a woman and go back 100 years.  Back then, it would have gone without saying, but now it&#x27;s &quot;political&quot; because many people have other ideas.  Nothing changed, except the level of consensus.')
