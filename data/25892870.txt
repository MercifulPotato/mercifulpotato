A lot of them would prefer an apartment or a condoâ€”smaller units....&quot;<p>This to me is at the core the problem. This statement is borderline revolting, with a holier-than-thou attitude. Why do we have an academic from an urban core opine on what everyone else wants ? Who said this person is an authority on how people that he does not know, want to live ?<p>The proof is in the details. People left cities to move to the suburbs because they hated what they had in cities. That was their solution. If people no longer want to live in the suburbs, they can do the reverse, or strive to change the suburb themselves.<p>Instead of advocating for &quot;solutions&quot; to impose on others, how about instead let people decide on their own ?  Simply put, for people that want to change their lifestyle, they should be able to do so on their own.<p>Yet I never hear 1 expert  - &quot;let&#x27;s open every metro city zone regulation to unlimited mixed use, and let&#x27;s see what gets built&quot;. \nThese experts are probably afraid they may be dead wrong about what people actually want.')
