The capabilities of a single thread of processing in a modern x86 CPU are underestimated by several orders of magnitude in most shops. The unfortunate part is that the more you chase the scalability with the cloud bullshit, the more elusive it becomes. If you want to push tens of millions of transactions per second, you need a fast core being fed data in the most optimal way possible. Going inwards and reducing your latency per transaction is the best option for complex, synchronous problem domains. Going outwards is only going to speed up if you can truly decouple everything in the time domain.')
