SQPOLL is still to be properly added and fixed and there are some security concerns (e.g. CAP_SYS_ADMIN being replaced by CAP_SYS_NICE to start a kernel submission queue polling thread).<p>io_uring has many tests in the companion user space library liburing, maintained by the same person that made the kernel patches (Jens Axboe). They test both the library as well as expected functionality in the kernel.<p>io_uring is not going to give you speed ups if you use it in the same way as you would epoll or kqueue. Thus, simply sticking it into e.g. libuv without changing how the applications are built probably won&#x27;t give you a lot of benefit (speculating).<p>It comes down to how you work with the ring buffers and how much you take advantage of the highly out-of-order, memory-barrier-based shared memory approach as opposed to more &quot;discrete&quot; (maybe not the right word) syscalls.<p>As of yet, I haven&#x27;t personally come across a <i>published</i> example of a production framework that utilizes these features adequately. We have some internal IP that does, but probably won&#x27;t be open sourced.')
