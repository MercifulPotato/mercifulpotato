I don’t have the luxury of ignoring performance, efficiency, and scalability. I don’t have any particular love for C++, there are many things wrong with it, but sadly there isn’t a practical alternative that doesn’t have worse trade offs. Ironically, I largely refused to use C++ until C++11. I delivered systems in a long list of other languages before that time; my usage of C++ is relatively recent. My choice is pragmatic and based on experience.<p>If you can’t think of reasons to use C++, that isn’t because reasons don’t exist.')
