Item(by='microtherion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608986810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541035, text='&gt; This attack screams anti-government militia with it&#x27;s technique<p>The target and the means (RV stuffed with explosives) would sort of fit the pattern. Broadcasting an advance warning would be rather atypical for US right wing (or islamic, for that matter) terrorists, though, and rigging up a speaker that actually works would stretch the technical abilities of a typical US militia group.<p>The groups who did operate that way (weather people, IRA, RAF, etc) are not presently active in the US (unless some snowbird weather people decided to come out of retirement).<p>If the rumors of this being a suicide bombing pan out, a single disgruntled person with some technical skill probably would have the financial and technical means to carry this out, and a company like AT&amp;T probably enrages thousands of technical people a year for various reasons â€” power laws would suggest that occasionally one of them might become enraged to the point of terrorism.<p>Or, for wilder speculation, maybe some foreign state level actor has an interest in causing extra chaos? With leadership of various security services in near constant turmoil, and new appointees being installed primarily with partisan domestic objectives, now is as good a time to carry out such an act as any.<p>It&#x27;s probably best not to jump to conclusions, and be wary of any authorities looking to take this incident as a pretext to expand any of their ample existing powers.')
