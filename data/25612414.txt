Item(by='gandalfian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609591095, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612128, text='USA relative posted us (UK) a vase he handmade, new hobby. Marked as gift but put $100 as insurance value. That&#x27;s more than £18 so customs charged us 20% vat plus £12 processing charge. So became rather an expensive gift. If he had not marked it as gift we would have also paid vat on the 50$ shipping!!! (Why is USA postage so much). So items from abroad can suddenly become very expensive. In the plus side books are tax free in the UK which is nice.')
