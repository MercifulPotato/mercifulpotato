These are real, material examples of the benefit brought by developers being on your side. Shun them as you have in recent years and you might find another OS starts to benefit from their weekend projects and innovative ideas.<p>I&#x27;ve recently come to a shift on mentality and believe that such sentiments are meaningless. It&#x27;s almost always the most parasitic and immoral of the players that succeed and continue to succeed. The worse they can treat the other parties, generally the better off they are. It&#x27;s like a deer telling a lion it should consider eating more grass.<p>Yeah it sucks cause we&#x27;re generally in the camp that is being taken advantage of. But due to the forces of capitalism and human nature, you can practically mathematically prove that your words will not be heeded, and to great great profit.')
