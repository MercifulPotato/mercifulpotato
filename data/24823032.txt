So the equivalence principle would fail- I can tell if I am accelerating due to gravity or if I am accelerating due to motion by measuring time dilation. Without doing the math you can know this is true by looking at the age of a person on the ground on earth and the age of a person in a spaceship accelerating at 1 G. The spaceman will experience greater time dilation (age slower) as his speed approaches that of light. In a spaceship people will age slower. But both people will only feel 1 G.')
