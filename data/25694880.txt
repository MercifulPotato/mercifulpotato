That&#x27;s not a great way to back up that &quot;divorced from reality&quot; assertion. And for the stuff that does appear to be at least somewhat relevant to the comment at issue, you haven&#x27;t clarified anything about what you believe to be divorced from reality, merely asserted that it is all &quot;nonsense&quot;.<p>The comment at issue did not use the phrase &quot;kids in cages&quot;. That&#x27;s you adding your personal color to a subject that you seem to object to being brought up in any manner at all. It looks like you&#x27;re trying to build a straw-man or three, rather than justify the accusation that the comment in question is &quot;entirely divorced from reality&quot;.')
