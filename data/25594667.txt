Item(by='stiray', descendants=None, kids=[25595743], score=None, time=1609435326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594072, text='&gt; is just how easy it is to create bureaucracy-intense workflows in JIRA and make management believe these are absolutely necessary<p>Omg, finally someone has said it, I thought I was weird. This is the imperative problem with JIRA, it is not made to help the developers but to satisfy management which is buying the software. +1 for this comment. I have seen its usage in 7 companies and in each and every case instead of simplifying developers workflow it was complicating it due to management wanting to have their data which, at the end, didnt bring anything for the product but were just enabler to make their cute graphs that enabled them to not be involved into development cycle (as they should be) but rather bring out statistics &quot;out of their shoe - JIRA&quot;.<p>And this is also my only (ok, except the slowness which should be understandable for any web browser js application) comment over the JIRA, I dont care what the tool is, how much time it takes (at the end, I am not paying for it), but how much it diverges from the tool that SHOULD help the development while in its essence it mostly helps the management to track their data.')
