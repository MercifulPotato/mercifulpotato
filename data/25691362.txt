Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610144913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25690104, text='&gt; Over 1000 sworn affidavits from witnesses.<p>The number of affidavits is a rather meaningless number. The quality of the affidavits is much more important, and those have been found <i>much</i> less impressive by courts.<p>&gt; What exactly is the point of voting in your state running legit by the book fraud proof elections, if another state isn&#x27;t going to verify signatures to make sure there are no fraudulent ballots?<p>If that other state&#x27;s laws don&#x27;t allow signature matching or make it optional, then that&#x27;s their prerogative; states choose how to run their elections, after all.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be happy with their choice, by any means, but it&#x27;s still their choice.<p>&gt; Even if your legitimate election state is won, the unsecure election state will nullify your state with their electoral count.<p>How do electoral votes from one state &quot;nullify&quot; electoral votes from another? One state&#x27;s electoral votes will get counted regardless of what other states do.<p>&gt; Because the Supreme Court said it doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The US Constitution says states get to choose how their elections are run. If one state doesn&#x27;t like how another state runs their election? Too bad.')
