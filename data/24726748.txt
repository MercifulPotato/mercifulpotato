We turned off the flags on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23677740" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23677740</a>, so that&#x27;s an example of a discussion <i>not</i> being suppressed. Your other links just point to meta threads.<p>These links seem to me to point to a system that is working reasonably well, the main problem with which is that people say a lot of untrue things about it. That&#x27;s inevitable—people say a lot of untrue things in general. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to do better than &#x27;reasonably well&#x27;, for many reasons, including: there&#x27;s too much randomness, we don&#x27;t see everything, and a lot of these situations are lose-lose.<p>If you&#x27;re suggesting that we should just have political free-for-alls on HN, that is quite impossible—HN would not survive it. If you&#x27;re not suggesting that, it&#x27;s unclear to me what your complaint is. Too much Assange? Everyone thinks that HN has too much of $something.<p>How we moderate politics on HN is well-established, and clearly explained at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;...</a>. If you or anyone have a better idea, I&#x27;d love to hear it, but please make sure that you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with past explanations first. If it&#x27;s something simple like &quot;just ban politics&quot; or &quot;just allow everything&quot;, I&#x27;ve already answered many times why it won&#x27;t work.')
