In my distant past I worked for a psychology firm handling, well, everything to do with computers.  That included some testing.<p>In the United States, there are two tests for ADHD I would vouch for: Conners&#x27; Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA).  Both are computerized.  Both rely solely on your reactions and your restraint, they are not questionnaires.  We had <i>plenty</i> of patients who had been diagnosed via questionnaire who did not show up at ADHD to a significant degree on those tests.  Rather, they had some other underlying disorder that can also mess with attention, such as, sadly, early onset schizophrenia.<p>The other benefit of these computerized tests is that you can use the to titrate your medication to an appropriate dose, as most stimulants have an inverted U-shaped response.  Too much and you get to feeling like a zombie.  Gain weight?  Retake the test.  Maybe you hit puberty.  Retake the test.  Maybe you have side effects and you need a different formulation or a different medication all together.  Retake the test.  By doing this, you can figure out what your optimal dose is, even figure out at what time you &quot;peak.&quot;<p>The other way to diagnose is through a PET scan but I don&#x27;t know anyone in their right minds who does that.<p>CPTs and TOVAs, I don&#x27;t know how much they cost today but I would say that they are worth it, both for peace of mind (I really have it, my parents didn&#x27;t just answer the questionnaire hoping to get certain results) and for the ability to tune your medicinal needs.')
