Not 1% or 7%  Zero. Those protests literally shut down critical stores for people in dire straits. For ex. The only pharmacy near low income seniors with limited motor ability, with the double whammy that public transport also shut down.<p>Cities on fire every week is not OK especially when the offenders are inmune from law enforcement.<p>To think that 7% is acceptable smacks of priviledge.  Someone is clearly not living in the inner city, and does not know what it means to not own a car when the public transport system is halted and the only supermarket near is razed.')
