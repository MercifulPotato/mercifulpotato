Typing would probably be a nightmare on the thing even with the (extra) hardware keyboard overlay.  I&#x27;ll bet getting Linux going on it would be basically impossible due to the bleeding edge, proprietary hardware.  Compared to my X1 it&#x27;s fairly low power.  Limited to 8GB of memory.  Only okay battery life.  Fairly sure it&#x27;s thicker than my X1.<p>And yet... for reasons I can&#x27;t explain... I kinda want one.')
