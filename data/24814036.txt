You&#x27;re a hack, and you know that every celebrity that can&#x27;t get a takedown for their PII on Youtube, Google, Facebook, and Twitter isn&#x27;t given the same privilege as Joe Biden and his son.<p>If Twitter really has this policy, let&#x27;s have no more tabloids on that medium.  Everybody who issues a takedown should get one.  And with celebrities it isn&#x27;t like Twitter doesn&#x27;t <i>know</i>.  Of course they know.  It&#x27;s selective enforcement of usage of their business.<p>Twitter--much like certain restaurants in Alabama--is saying they will serve certain people, but not others.')
