The core of their business on Amazon was to continuously hustle and identify new products that would fill that niche, as that made up for the biggest chunk of their profit.<p>So there are many 3rd party merchants at risk _now_ on Amazon.<p>Apart from that there are also numerous brands from Amazon themselves already. Most obviously &quot;Amazon Basics&quot; and &quot;Amazon Essentials&quot;, but also many with a non-obvious name[0].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17602470011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=17602470011</a>')
