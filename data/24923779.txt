Item(by='snvzz', descendants=None, kids=[24924242], score=None, time=1603917098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921442, text='&gt;Shadow Play, G-Sync, and RTX Voice are some nice features. Not to mention DLSS...<p>AIUI AMD has their own alternatives to all of these (minus RTX Voice, which I hadn&#x27;t even heard about until your mention). I do not know how good they are, but I expect there to not be much difference.<p>As DLSS 2.0, they&#x27;re supposedly releasing a competitor in next month&#x27;s drivers.')
