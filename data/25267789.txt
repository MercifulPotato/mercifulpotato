Item(by='d33lio', descendants=1, kids=[25269682], score=3, time=1606845664, title='Ask HN: Where to look for $180k+ engineering work', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been chugging along at a few small but exciting startups in NYC.  Fortunately, my current post has weathered most of the covid storm and is still picking up momentum.  I&#x27;ve been working hard, just now reaching around 4 years of experience.<p>I&#x27;m curious where I should be looking for higher compensation if I&#x27;m not quite ready to start my own startup.  Would it be better to look for opportunities at growth stage startups?  Transition into a sales role?  I&#x27;m not interested in FAANG as I worked at Amazon early in my career and found the culture &#x2F; work stress to be a poor fit.  That said, startup stress, working weekends etc does not bother me.<p>Mostly, I feel woefully clueless as to where I can look for higher paying jobs that I can actually acquire.  Eventually I&#x27;d like to run my own startup, but that will likely be in Austin or Boston where taxes are more reasonable.')
