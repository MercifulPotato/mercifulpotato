Until someone builds a Beowulf cluster of MacBooks they&#x27;re not just in a different league but playing an entirely different game.<p>1: Anandtech attempted to estimate the CPU power draw and got to around 10W at single-threaded load and a peak of 27W under compute-intensive load: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a> - that might mean you&#x27;d need &quot;only&quot; 10 M1s to reach the TDP of a current Threadripper')
