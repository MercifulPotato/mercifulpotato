Much too heavyweight and gave the users other things to worry about (disk space, updates, new types of package repositories). Something more fit for Linux culture would probably be closer to a set of best practices (this is what the executable is called, this is where libraries are put, there should be an icon here in this format), and let a thin wrapper handle it all.')
