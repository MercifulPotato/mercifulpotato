I&#x27;m just doing it my way now, with some new priorities, I suppose. The military is a complex subject for me and my friends. There are good things I can say and there are awful things I can say. Regardless, I will always be proud of what I did and accomplished in that time. It makes me proud you&#x27;ve made something of post-service life though, veterans will always hold a special place in my mind.')
