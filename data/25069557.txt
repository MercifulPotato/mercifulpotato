But how many of those hardware blocks exist for what you want to do? If you care about H265, great. Let&#x27;s say you get a dozen specific hardware accelerators, that&#x27;s still only 12 tasks. That might end up covering the vast majority of web browsing tasks (to pick one example), but particularly as an engineer there is always going to be something else. And not all intensive tasks are amenable to hardware acceleration, e.g. compilation. That&#x27;s why we care about general purpose CPU performance - at some point you always need it.<p>Incidentally, this is philosophically the idea behind processors with built in FPGA capability. The hardware acceleration would just be a binary blob that could be loaded in and used when necessary. It could be continually updated, and provided with whatever software needed it.')
