T<p>Well, I&#x27;m guessing that those posting on Parler that they were there to &quot;HANG ALL TRAITORS&quot; and such (there&#x27;s more and more of this coming out - I&#x27;d wait till the court cases present evidence before you claim such certainty no one was planning murder), coupled with the weapons they brought, and the fact that someone did indeed get murdered, will make it clear that some did go there intending to murder someone, despite your not being able to believe it.<p>If you and your group write some violent manifesto, then attack some place, and someone dies, even if it is not the person you wanted, you will be charged with murder.<p>Accidental deaths are charged with homicide. The current charges are murder, as in pre-planned killings.<p>No need to reply. I think our sides are clear enough.')
