Supressing information because its not convenient at the moment is the very definition of hack journalism. Something he wants no part of.<p>This is a pretty uncharitable read. The Intercept&#x27;s issue with Greenwald&#x27;s article is not that it is &quot;not convenient,&quot; but that Greenwald doesn&#x27;t adequately support his own conclusions on a story with tenuous evidence. That&#x27;s not hack journalism; that&#x27;s journalism. Journalists and editors are obligated to review stories and ask the question &quot;is what we are reporting true? is it relevant? is it timely?&quot; and if the answer to any of those is &quot;no&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re not sure,&quot; to hold off. THAT&#x27;S the standard that The Intercept is using, and that&#x27;s where Greenwald fell short. Anything less is the very definition of hack journalism.')
