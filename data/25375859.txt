Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607620495, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372464, text='First of all, I like it!<p>Some, hopefully constructive criticisms, mostly nitpicking&#x2F;paper cut bugs. My pedantism doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t like it ;)<p>- As somebody else mentioned, the email field on the signup page is a bit off-putting just to try it. Maybe add some text on why you need to know it (password reminders, whathaveyou). &quot;Display Name&quot; was already mentioned too for something that could be improved.<p>- I think it would be good to have a password confirmation box on signup. I have enough family that constantly mistypes their passwords to know that this is a thing :P<p>- When I created a box and was lead to the upload page (Step 2 of 4), I somehow assumed it would let me drag and drop straight to the page. Instead I had to click the button. Not a major thing but having a shortcut (like popping up that file picker once a dragover event happens) would be nice I think. Same for the Tracks page.<p>- After creating a box and uploading a track on the next page, it might be a good idea to pre-select that track ;) The list of selectable tracks is also a little too subtle. I had to think a few seconds what&#x27;s going on; ideally I&#x27;d have to think less about it.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t allow me to upload ogg or opus or straight wav. Again, no biggie, but the error text there could be more helpful. &quot;The accepted file types are audio&#x2F;mpeg,audio&#x2F;mp3&quot; is not so great. I later saw it says that &quot;starters&quot; are only allowed mp3 on the account page. Does this mean other formats are allowed when upgrading? I didn&#x27;t see any info about that.<p>- The text listing the benefits of the different tiers on &#x2F;upgrade is extremely thin and hard to read when viewed on a regular non-retina display on a Windows box. It also is different to the different tiers text straight on the homepage. And &#x2F;upgrade has no favicon (tries to get &#x2F;favicon.ico instead of &#x2F;favicon&#x2F;favicon-32x32.png that other pages use). It also shows me a $ price and an £ approximation. I&#x27;m on € and used to $, but seeing £ is mildly confusing. It also has a title of &quot;Become a member&quot;, but I am already a member :P<p>- It now tells me: &quot;You have exceeded the number of available SongBoxes on the Free tier. Consider upgrading.&quot; But the &quot;Your SongBoxes&quot; says &quot;My Private Songboxes (0 of 5 in use)&quot;. I did create a few boxes and subsequently deleted them. Now I got none and am not allowed ot make any more. Also, shouldn&#x27;t that be &quot;(0 of 1 in use)&quot; on starter? Bug?<p>- Speaking of which, you sometimes use &quot;SongBox(es)&quot; and sometimes &quot;Songbox(es)&quot;, come to think about it.<p>- I like your privacy policy, short and simple. But it doesn&#x27;t state if and for how long you will retain data after the user removes it. That would be a clarification worth making.<p>- Since you&#x27;re pretty much about privacy too according to your privacy policy, a way to delete the account would be nice.<p>Would I use it? Maybe, but I am not a &quot;pro&quot; and the pricing is too expensive for the me (I am a cheapskate) at 10 bucks&#x2F;month &#x2F; 100 bucks&#x2F;year for just 15 tracks. My price range for something like that, being &quot;Hobby&quot;, would be maybe around 20-25 bucks &#x2F; year for 50 tracks, but that&#x27;s just me.')
