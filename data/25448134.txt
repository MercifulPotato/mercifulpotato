I think it might be because I don’t want to be standing and moving around when playing a game and if you’re not doing that, the motion is kind of unpleasant.<p>I’m not sure this is something it can really overcome. I think an AR overlay of our actual world is more likely to be the next real platform (assuming the hardware is possible to pull off something like this).<p>Being in VR is just kind of an unpleasant&#x2F;isolating experience for me and I’m a pretty early adopter of most things.<p>In other people I’ve mostly seen a small number of games (mostly beat saber) keep people coming back, but I haven’t seen most people keep using it once the novelty wears off outside of that.<p>I think there are probably some narrow applications where it’s clearly better than not having it, but I’m skeptical of VR as a platform.<p>Maybe when the hardware is 10x better&#x2F;lighter it’ll be a difference experience? We are pretty early on in the medium, movies and tv were pretty bad for the first fifty years. It might just take a while for people to figure out how to use VR well.')
