I&#x27;ve tried replicating it, but seems to work ok. It should ask at the last screen during the onboarding.<p>Running Catalin 10.15.7 currently. Yes, the screen came but typically MacOS would send a popup notification where I can enable&#x2F;disable notifications for McPiper but that didn&#x27;t came<p>&gt; Yep, it&#x27;s on the radar, as this data isn&#x27;t available directly from the GraphQL pipeline object, it requires another REST request to GitLab<p>Would be a very useful feature as I have a few repositories\nthat I&#x27;m working on like once or twice a week but my colleagues are triggering pipelines on a daily basis<p>Also do you know why there is no &quot;app icon&quot; in my dock when I open the preferences window? If I hit CMD+Tab I also cannot jump to the window, but when I hit CRTL+UP and I see the window and can jump into it. Hope you get what I mean, quite new to MacOS :^)<p>Is it also possible to have a setting for the popup window width? Our repository names (including the organisation + groups) are quite long')
