The only thing that made them cool back them was they were different!   They were not x86, they had weird&#x2F;different CPUs and gcc -S provided a very different output.  They ran weird Unix OS such as IRIX, HPUX, AIX, BSD, SunOS &amp; Solaris which allowed one to see a different take on things.  sometimes they brought their own advantages, Solaris had really cool software, the only thing amazing about the SGI was the Monitor and the color, just beautiful.   These were fun to network, hookup and share with Unix fiends so we didn&#x27;t get into trouble using other folks computer.<p>Yet, I find that I&#x27;m still experiencing that same sort of fun, the raspberry pi, Arduino, GPUs, Xeon Psi, Google Coral, all sorts of cheap FPGA, if you want hardware, you got it!  Tons more are now available with documentation.   If you want software, you got it, Linux, BSDs, and you can still run NetBSD on your toaster.    If you want programming languages, there&#x27;s more available now than ever.   Even getting access to a solid Lisp or Prolog system back then was a pain, you can get access to many choices for free today.  Then you have latest and newest shiny things like Rust, Go, Javascript&#x2F;Typescript, Haskell, Ocaml, Idris, elm, dart, etc.<p>Computers have never been this freaking cool!   Craziest thing is that a $5 raspberry pi zero that fits between 2 fingers, could run circles around some of those cool computers of yesteryears.   The past was fun then, the future is much fun IMO.')
