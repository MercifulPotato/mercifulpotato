That said, I&#x27;d like to challenge some of my axioms and strengthen my own beliefs so raising one question I don&#x27;t have a good answer for.<p>If Robinhood is doing what they claim, ie: is having issues fulfilling orders and&#x2F;or is legitimately trying to protect retail investors by limiting purchases of a volatile asset, wouldn&#x27;t it be worse if they prevented people from selling as well as buying? Is there some detail I&#x27;m missing that makes only limiting buy orders &quot;blatant&quot; proof of market manipulation and not the best possible option they had if they were acting in good faith?<p>Note: even if my counter argument here is correct, I don&#x27;t think that necessarily means nothing fishy going on since there are a lot of other questionable factors at play and even if they were acting in good faith within the &quot;stock market game&quot; that doesn&#x27;t mean the game as a whole isn&#x27;t rigged.')
