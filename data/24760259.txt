How did that work?<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine how I&#x27;d even offer without making it awkward. I don&#x27;t think I could avoid making an already uncomfortable wealth disparity even more cringe-worthy.<p>I think if I had to go that route I would at least rent an entire house on an AirBnb so I could stay with my friends - that way they&#x27;re actually staying with me, rather than in a hotel in the same city.')
