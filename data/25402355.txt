Item(by='Sniffnoy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607811951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25378743, text='No, you shouldn&#x27;t end up with an infinite sum; if you only want to know the series finitely far out, you only need to know finitely many terms.<p>However, it seems the problem is hard for other reasons.  I had assumed, without checking, that they&#x27;d put the center of the circle at 3pi&#x2F;8 because it&#x27;s a pole.  Nope!  As best I can tell from some graphing tools, there is indeed precisely one pole in the circle, and it&#x27;s on the real line, but it&#x27;s close to the right endpoint; I don&#x27;t know that it has any nice form.  So I imagine that getting any sort of exact series expansion around there -- or even just getting exactly the first few terms, i.e. the first few derivatives there, which would be all you&#x27;d need -- would be difficult for that reason.<p>(Although, the higher the order of the zero, the more initial terms you&#x27;d need...)<p>Edit: Actually, I guess it looks like a zero of order 1?  Except that doesn&#x27;t make sense, because then the top contour integral would be zero...')
