Item(by='joshstrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610560317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25761074, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not sure general development will continue to be viable on the M1s.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to carry water for Apple here but what types of development are you talking about that won&#x27;t be able to continue on the M1? Sure a lot of stuff wasn&#x27;t there at launch but it looks like even docker (which was speculated to take a long time to get working) is getting close to a solution for arm and x86 containers to run on the M1. Brew is another one that wasn&#x27;t ready at launch but my guess is that within a year or so the M1 (or it&#x27;s successors) will be nearly identical to my current dev setup (which is one reason I&#x27;m waiting for the dust to settle).')
