Inflation is the main cause of the &quot;grow or die&quot; mentality and the many sustainability issues that come with it. You can not afford to have a steady business that isn&#x27;t growing, because inflation will slowly eat away your margins until you are operating at a loss. Especially since the reported inflation (under 5% in most developed countries) is far from the actual value seen by most businesses (between salary increases, rent increases, supply increases). It takes less than 15 years for a non growing healthy business to go bankrupt.<p>Inflation is also the main cause of quality decline seen in absolutely everything. When you can not raise prices as fast as your costs are increasing, the only viable option is to lower quality. This inevitably happens every where and is pretty much an accepted fact of life. It&#x27;s not that companies want to give you a crappier product or service, it&#x27;s that they have to.<p>I&#x27;m a huge skeptic of all crypto currencies in their current forms, but the deflationary part was one of the ideas that I really liked (not that any government would ever go for a deflationary policy)')
