It may also make sense to tax residential power to fund roads, since many electric car owners will primarily be charging at home.  Perhaps this electricity tax could be limited to people who are registered as owning electric cars.  That would follow the same principle of applying the tax where the fueling&#x2F;charging is performed.')
