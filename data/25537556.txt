Especially now. Work makes me use a Mac, and while the UI is nice, recent macOS is much more full of jank and bugs that ruin the experience.<p>I grew up on old-school 90s Linux, where part of the fun was deciding which program you wanted to compile from source to accomplish a given task. So I may be biased... but I gave my girlfriend, a long time Apple user, an old laptop off of which I&#x27;d scraped Windows and put kubuntu on instead. She loves it.<p>Oh, and as for build quality, ThinkPad &gt; Mac. Recent x86 Macs are glued-together pieces of shit that are optimized for being thin and light at the cost of <i>all</i> other concerns. They do not have adequate cooling, and when heat accumulates it has a tendency to break down the glue holding the system together.<p>I haven&#x27;t evaluated the X1 Carbon, but my T450s is still screwed together. It&#x27;s plenty thicc, but actually quite light in comparison to its size. It can also take a beating.')
