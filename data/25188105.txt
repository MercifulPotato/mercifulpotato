Item(by='adkadskhj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606147196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25186717, text='&gt; I also imagine that these kinds of discussions are infuriating to the people who were already remote pre-COVID and were working the hours they are supposed to. They had a great thing going on but if suddenly everyone else moves to remote and a bunch of people are slacking off, remote work suddenly look less viable from an employer&#x27;s point of view, not more.<p>It&#x27;s interesting, i&#x27;ve been WFH for ~8 years now under two companies. I&#x27;ve thought COVID would improve my job pool <i>(and also competition)</i>, but you raise an interesting point where it might solidify negative WFH views in a lot of cases.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, because if i could rely more on WFH i&#x27;d probably move further out. I like where i live (PNW) but it&#x27;s expensive. While WFH is not for everyone, i wish more people would give it a chance because of the <i>(potential)</i> huge cost benefits of being able to live where you want.')
