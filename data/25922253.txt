That might actually be preferred from a radiation point of view; I know Mars doesn&#x27;t have much protection from radiation, but I&#x27;m not sure how much comes directly from the sun versus random ambient radiation in space.<p>Another possible source of light pollution would be greenhouses with big windows that are lit with artificial light at night.')
