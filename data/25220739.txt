Failure to do so means that anyone able to create zones on these name servers can do so.<p>On Amazon you can request a delegation set, which means a combination of four name servers. Do that enough times and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll have all the possible variations that could exist. For every Amazon account you can request 100 delegation sets, but it&#x27;s easy to scale this out over multiple accounts. I&#x27;m also willing to bet you can easily get that limit raised to thousands of delegation sets by just telling support you&#x27;re going to use the account for hosting tons of zones. I don&#x27;t know the specifics of how CloudFlare does it, but I assume you&#x27;re more than welcome to do the same, programatically.<p>There&#x27;s no hill to die on. I don&#x27;t work for a provider, and how is that even relevant? Seems like a weird straw man argument or something.<p>The potential risks of this is blown way out of proportions. You&#x27;re still in control over the domain, just not the zone. Do stupid things, win stupid prices? In this case, letting someone else control your zone because you failed to understand how DNS works.')
