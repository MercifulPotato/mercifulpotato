But the kid and in particular your partner need your hands on deck, not on the workbench for days on, just to end up with an unfinished crib.\nAnd there are so many other, more important things to do that cannot be outsourced that easily.<p>And once the first kid is in the house, expect interruptions. Oh, kid has a &quot;mild reaction&quot; to a certain vaccination? Forget sleep, forget &quot;stuff that needs to be done&quot;, survive while keeping the basics in order.\nAnd with more than one kid expect to be on call for every minute you are home. Nothing can go by uninterrupted if you have small kid and a toddler and only four hands.<p>I envy everyone that has a different experience. Grandparents&#x2F;relatives help a lot. COVID-19 does not.<p>Projects suddenly need to be small or non-critical.')
