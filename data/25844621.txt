Item(by='TomSwirly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611137621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834097, text='&gt; the old values of honor are still valid.<p>Putting someone who is 60 year old in jail for 43 years for simply sharing a video is not &quot;honorable&quot; to the slightest degree.  In fact, this barbaric and cowardly action shows a complete lack of honor on the part of the royal family.  It shows weakness; it shows moral evil; it shows corruption.<p>I would add that the King fled Thailand because of COVID-19, and &quot;rules&quot; from Bavaria, so he&#x27;s also a coward who abandoned his country in their hour of need.<p>Generally, the term &quot;values&quot; usually means a justification for the purest and rankest evil, so I&#x27;m not surprised.')
