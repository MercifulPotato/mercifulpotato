Item(by='barrkel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607952062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412993, text='Organized crime can make money in other ways, but fundamentally it profits from regulatory and legal arbitrage: the difference between what is in demand and what is legal to supply. Decriminalization directly attacks the fundamentals of that arbitrage, whether it&#x27;s drugs or prostitution, or more prosaic like fuel taxes or tobacco duty (smuggling both has been a source of funding for IRA in Northern Ireland, historically).<p>Kidnapping is more of a capital arbitrage situation. I don&#x27;t think it scales like drugs. For it to be really worthwhile, it relies on people with a lot of capital coming into the area. If you scale up kidnapping, people simply don&#x27;t come, or invest a lot more in security.')
