It <i>will not</i> work, because inevitably they&#x27;ll miss something, and then people will assume that that missed thing is true.<p>The solution is NOT to do censorship based on truth.  The entire system needs to be unreliable, because it is unreliable.  People need to read things on twitter (and elsewhere on the internet) with skepticism, and they need to evaluate wether those things are true or false individually.')
