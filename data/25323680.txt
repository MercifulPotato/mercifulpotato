Now you might say that mostly caters to the rich world, and that&#x27;s true, but the people who can&#x27;t use TransferWise are probably not going to be able to use Libra&#x2F;Diem either for the same reasons they can&#x27;t use TransferWise: ID documents, KYC&#x2F;AML, plus capital controls and sanction regimes which aren&#x27;t magically going to disappear for this new currency.<p>It won&#x27;t provide one of the few benefits of Bitcoin etc either, namely the ability to make illegal transactions more easily.')
