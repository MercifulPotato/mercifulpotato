A lie of commission would be like Grubhub saying “All restaurants are our partners”.\nThe second case (which applies here) is a lie by omission. They are withholding very important information in an intentional way.<p>Since we’re on the topic of food: It’s like if someone asked, “Hey did you eat the whole pizza?” and you reply “I ate my three slices”. That’s true, except you also ate the other nine slices. Lie of omission.<p>It’s not bad logic.
