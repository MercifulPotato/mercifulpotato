What&#x27;s incorrect is when trying to explain the action through bernouilli it&#x27;s often asserted that the air above the wing must take the same time to transit the wing as the air on the bottom. Not only is this completely unjustified to assume when trying to solve the problem, it&#x27;s also false in practice: in general air above and below will not pass the wing in the same time, even though the air over the top is travelling faster.')
