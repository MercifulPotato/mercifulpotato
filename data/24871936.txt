I strongly believe it&#x27;s fictional. Most of the sources either don&#x27;t cite anything, or go back to Art and Fear, and the presentation there doesn&#x27;t say anything about where this happened.<p>Of course, the idea that you need practice to be good at things is obvious. But first, that&#x27;s not quite the claim in the anecdote, which is about being told to aim for high quality. In any case, the vivid anecdote would be better off if people were clear that it&#x27;s a hypothetical.')
