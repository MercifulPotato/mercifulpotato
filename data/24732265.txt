I know the official minimum for an I-485 pending application to be portable is 180 days, but I was wondering, if there is a way for people losing their jobs before the 180 days are up, to keep the application, employment authorization (EAD), and Advance Parole pending and and port over to the next employer past the 180 days (not all of them spent with the petitioning employer)?')
