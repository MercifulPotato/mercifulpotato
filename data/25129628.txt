This was frankly my reaction when I moved to the west coast. (Example from further north: it was hard to see glitzy retail in a place like Bellevue, WA and not think it is overly dependent on the rotting corpse of MSFT. Sorry for a blunt description.)<p>But in my understanding, though, I think San Francisco in particular has had the boom and bust cycles even before tech was most dominant and before a bunch of tech moved north from the valley.<p>It&#x27;s famously hard to predict things like this. I just have a hunch that some form of housing scarcity will return to SF.')
