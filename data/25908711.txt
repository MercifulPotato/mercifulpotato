Here is another crazy stalker trying to find their ex-partner.<p>No. Actually not the case.<p>I&#x27;m seeking legitimate advice or guidance and even assistance in locating a non-phone cellular device.<p>My vehicle was stolen recently and Lexus has told me that I can&#x27;t track the vehicle because I&#x27;m not enrolled in their special service. Bullshit!\nWell great. I have spent hours talking to them trying to find solutions. I have called dealerships. I have even reached out to some very backdoor knowledgeable people. All turn out to be a bust. But the best piece of information I was able to acquire is the MEID number for the cellular transceiver in the vehicle. The device is made by Denso, and is qualcomm 3G CDMA. I would assume that the device can be triangulated or at least to a general area.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to find a legitimate service for a legitimate reason. Most search results are flooded with the bullshit services claiming they can...im not a dumb dumb but don&#x27;t know where else to turn.<p>please no obvious possible solution replies like &quot;have you tried calling a dealership&quot; because yes I have thought of that and no they don&#x27;t do that. So please...no &quot;did you restart your modem&quot; answers.<p>much appreciated. any assistance that leads to the recovery of my vehicle successfully will be rewarded.')
