I have to be careful to say &quot;The world&#x27;s first <i>man-made</i> chain nuclear reaction was achieved in a squash court at the University of Chicago in 1942.&quot;<p>While Oklo georeactors are relatively well-known now, have you all heard of the crazier hypothesized georeactors? Like that the Moon may have formed in a nuclear excursion?

The current natural enrichment is 0.711%. 4 billion years ago it was 25%, well above levels necessary to make a chain reaction even in far less than ideal conditions.<p>Somewhat related, it also continues to blow my mind that about half of the internal heat budget of Earth comes from radioactive decay of primordial nuclides (while the other have is just what&#x27;s left over from residual cooling) [3]. So geothermal energy is really just a gigantic Radioisotope Thermal Generator.<p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#Radiogenic_heat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget...</a>')
