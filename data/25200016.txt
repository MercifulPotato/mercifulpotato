I took all that and lined it up with the flight time and flight path of the helicopter - earlier in the morning taking off from Monticello, UT and flying almost directly north before going off radar (usually indicating it dropped below radar scan altitude. From there, I know I am looking for a south&#x2F;east facing canyon with rounded red&#x2F;white rock, most likely close to the base of a larger cliff&#x2F;mesa, most likely closer to the top of a watershed, and with a suitable flat area for an AS350 helicopter to land. Took about 30 minutes of random checks around the Green River&#x2F;Colorado River junction before finding similar terrain. From there it took another 15 minutes to find the exact canyon. Yes...
