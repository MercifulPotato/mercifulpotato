Sometimes the error bounds are extremely large during a developing situation, and people should absolutely be aware of that. There&#x27;s a major discussion to be had about risk&#x2F;reward tradeoffs in the face of high uncertainty. (E.g., the relative cost of mandating face coverings is pretty low, even if the science is temporarily uncertain.)<p>However it becomes impossible to have such discussions when a large contingent of the population are ignoring all of the scientific data, and instead basing their opinions on motivated reasoning, faith, or political preferences.')
