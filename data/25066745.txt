Just because there were postings on election results doesn’t mean HN needs to be open to this sort of babble on a regular basis.<p>HN has been getting more postings on the political side of media, and that just lets in the shills, trolls, pundits, and the like.  A posting with a title like “the next fleet of Breitbarts” is only going to lead to comments that are a waste of good photons and too much work for moderators.<p>For their own sanity, the moderators need to triage more ruthlessly on political matters.')
