To where do you point as your evidence? I ask, mainly because the notion that &quot;libertarian&quot; policies (of both left and right varieties) have been tried in the modern era is a pretty big stretch, to me.<p>Not even the shallowest stuff people typically refer to, like marijuana decriminalization&#x2F;legalization laws, qualify as &quot;libertarian&quot; policies. All the states that have legal weed also tax &amp; regulate it heavily with specialized state controls, so we can&#x27;t call it &#x27;libertarian&#x27; in the least.<p>You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what libertarianism is - not to worry, though, because that&#x27;s pretty common and says nothing about you otherwise. Libertarianism is a radical political position to take; it does not fit neatly into today&#x27;s political infrastructure. By suggesting it fails to address X, Y, or Z, you are simply projecting your own values onto a system which does not share them with you.<p>&gt; They&#x27;ve failed to address the growing inability to normal people to have financial security<p>Libertarians have absolutely no interest in solving this problem. They are not trying to run peoples&#x27; lives, they are trying to relieve the people of the power that currently is wielded against them by the state and its cronies. The intent is to liberate people, so that they may be uninhibited in their pursuit of voluntary, peaceful interactions with others. What one chooses to do with this liberation is entirely up to them, and that&#x27;s what being human is all about.<p>You are of course free to disagree all you want with these perspectives, but attacking libertarianism in the way you do isn&#x27;t exactly fair.')
